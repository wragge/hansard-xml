<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Will the Government intervene and support the application by the Australian Manufacturers Council on behalf of SPC Ltd and its employees to obtain a variation of their award in order to give effect to the agreement entered into between SPC and its employees in order to preserve the jobs in the factory?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5731" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I congratulate SPC and the Victorian Trades Hall unions for at last meeting last week and talking about the terms of the agreement. I am disappointed that out of those talks no agreement emerged. I believe that the right course has now been taken in having the matter referred to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to determine what should occur. I indicate that I am thinking of making later this week a more general statement of what principle should apply in situations like this, but note for the interest of honourable senators that there appears in the Age and the Australian Financial Review today two analytical articles which cast interesting light on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand also that SPC will be in this building on Thursday and will talk with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, on matters of protection. The SPC has not sought a meeting with me on industrial relations issues, but I will seek a meeting with it because I think there are a number of matters about this issue that I would like to have clarified for myself.</PARA>
<PARA> At micro level this may well in microcosm represent what is in macrocosm a bit of a problem in the general economy. That is, in 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988 the economy was growing strongly; through the accord, wages were moderated with low wage outcomes and a distribution in factor shares away from wages to profits. Workers exercised commendable restraint, but the trouble was that those profits were used by speculators in unprecedented speculation activity and they lost the money. Workers are now being asked to find a way to generate more investment capital by further helping to restrain wages and distributing factor shares to profits. In microcosm that is what appears to be the case with this company. It appears to have made a number of bad investment decisions-it is now debt ridden; that is what the shareholders say-and consequently it needs to find a way around the problem.</PARA>
<PARA> The existing system is flexible enough to deal with matters of this sort. The company could seek a section 115 agreement direct with its work force, as a number of significant Australian companies have done. Without trying to play favourites, I give but one example where companies across the board have sought this flexibility provision. ICI Australia Ltd at Botany has reached a section 115 agreement with its work force because of the peculiar situation with which that company was faced and the competitive market in which it competed. It achieved significant flexibility in its own operation, major savings and in fact a more competitive output. That is one course.</PARA>
<PARA> Award modernisation and flexibility is another course that could have been taken. A capacity to pay argument could have been raised. I would like to know from SPC why it did not choose any of those courses or consult with its unions in the beginning. The terms of a number of other arrangements have not been communicated to the Government by the company-arrangements which are essential to the Government making a reasoned and proper decision in this case, as it will.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My Leader, Senator Button, interjects as to whether this has all come to hand in the time of Dr Hewson's stunt. Some of it was known before Dr Hewson decided to turn what is an industrial relations and economic issue into a political cavalcade and comedy. My advice to Dr Hewson is to butt out and leave the parties to industrial relations and the umpire to determine this matter. This is not a matter for political circuses; this is a matter for sober decision making. The system is flexible enough, and the flexibility of the system should be allowed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. We have had a lot of words from Senator Cook. I would like to point out that there was no stunt on the part of Dr Hewson. He is simply giving effect to what has been Opposition policy now for over four years. I ask the Minister: seeing that this is an important matter, why is the Government not intervening now, as the case is in the Industrial Relations Commission and could be heard quite quickly?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5731" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my answer I made clear at least this point: the Government has received no approach from the company about this matter at all. So we have had no request to us from the company to intervene. From the union side, we have had no request to intervene, either. In terms of my independent advice, there are a number of issues and questions, some of which I have referred to in my answer, to which I would like to know the answer before the Government could form an attitude. Let me say that the system is flexible for companies which wish, in straitened economic times, to make particular deals with their work force to do so, but within the system so that the umpire can say that those deals are fair. That is the proper course for companies to take.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this case, the company did not take that approach initially and there are a number of elements, which I referred to, that are still not clear. For example, the company has said that it will introduce a profit sharing scheme should it return to economic viability in the future, although it has not said what the profit sharing scheme will be. There is another question about the role of part time workers in this decision made by the work force of the company. There have been allegations that the permanent work force made a decision on behalf of the part time work force. I do not judge those allegations, but they are matters upon which the Government needs advice before it can make a decision on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is another matter. The company has retained International Public Relations Pty Ltd (IPR), a major public relations company in Australia, at considerable cost. I am not sure whether the workers, when they voted in their ballot, knew that there would be a retainer for a company such as this at considerable cost. One asks why a company like IPR, with New Right associations, should be engaged in an industrial matter like this when the course of going to the Commission was always open to the company.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to inform the Senate that our ships were well received when they made their first Australian landfall at the Port of Darwin last Friday where they were welcomed by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Bilney, on behalf of the Government. This Friday is particularly significant as it will see the return of the ships to their home port of Sydney. The two ships will be met outside Sydney Heads by the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke; the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson; myself; the shadow Minister for defence, Senator Durack; the Chief of the Defence Force; the Chief of the Naval Staff; and a representative of the New South Wales Government. Upon their entrance to the harbour at 9.30, the two ships will be joined in procession by the naval vessels, Otway, Ovens, Fremantle and Jervis Bay and by naval helicopters in a fly past carrying the Australian flag and the Navy ensign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While it is not possible to open the fleet base to the Sydney public, I invite any members of the public who are interested to assemble at suitable vantage points around the harbour to view the procession and give our ships a rousing welcome. We would particularly welcome those owners of recreational craft joining in that spectacular Sydney tradition of a flotilla to accompany the ships as they make their way up the harbour. I am sure all honourable senators will join me in expressing the hope that our sailors get the warm and friendly reception that they have earned when they return to Sydney this Friday.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. When the Government was engineering the recession, did it take into account today's tax deadline in assessing the economic stress to business? Has the Government assessed the number of business bankruptcies likely to result from today's tax requirements?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5733" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of suppositions behind Senator Walters's question which I do not want to deal with. But let me try and get a few facts straight on the record in relation to this matter, because the facts have not been there in some of the public comment on this issue. As I said in the Senate last week, the Government's decision in the 1989-90 Budget to alter the timing of company tax payments was made against the background that the majority of businesses are not conducted as companies. For example, only some 25 per cent of small businesses are incorporated, and in the papers comment has been largely about small businesses. The majority of those businesses-75 per cent of small businesses, for example-are subject to provisional tax arrangements. The former company tax collection arrangement offered those businesses operating as companies a substantial advantage in terms of the timing of tax payments over those which were paying provisional tax. That was an inequity in the system which the Government sought to deal with at the time the legislation was introduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The new measures seek to reduce but do not remove the deferral benefit associated with the previous quarterly system; that is, there is still an advantage to those incorporated companies over those companies that are not incorporated and which are paying provisional tax. The 1989-90 Budget measure, as announced, would have required all June balancing companies with notional tax liabilities in excess of $1,000 to have paid 85 per cent of notional or estimated tax in July this year, with the final payment by March next year. However, to ease the impact of the transition to the new measures, the Government decided to allow companies with notional or estimated tax liabilities under $400,000-that is, the smaller business end of the spectrum-in this current financial year the option of paying their total liability in December.</PARA>
<PARA> This arrangement still, of course, results in an element of bring forward in the timing of payments vis-a-vis the former quarterly payment system, but not to the extent of the original announcement. Any deferral in the timing of payments until February or March could result in a tax deferral gain to taxpayers beyond that of the former quarterly system. It should be borne in mind that the tax payments due today are in respect of profits earned in the year ended 30 June 1990-that is six months ago.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne is always quick with the gun but I do not think he shot anything with that one. Perhaps he is anticipating next year's company profits. Furthermore, those companies which operate on a substituted accounting basis and closed their books between December 1989 and May 1990 in lieu of June 1990 would already have met their tax obligations for the 1989-90 income year and the deferral for June-balancing companies would discriminate against many companies which have already paid their obligation in respect of this tax period.</PARA></TALK.START>

To that extent, for the first time in my life I am grateful to the honourable senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In summary, the Government will not be granting a further general extension of the arrangements. However, where companies are facing genuine financial hardship as a result of the need to meet the current payment, they should contact their local taxation office regarding their particular circumstance with a view to discussing a mutually agreeable time frame for payment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question. Is the Minister saying that because only 25 per cent of small businesses would be affected by today's tax deadline, it does not matter how many bankruptcies there will be?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Has the Minister seen press reports this morning that the Hun Sen Government in Cambodia and Vietnam have criticised the United Nations (UN) peace plan for Cambodia? What is the Government's assessment of this development and the current prospects for achieving a comprehensive peace settlement?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5734" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of press reports, including in today's Age, that Hun Sen's State of Cambodia (SOC) regime in Phnom Penh and Vietnam have hardened their position towards the comprehensive settlement plan initiated by Australia and subsequently, of course, adopted by the United Nations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The SOC's sensitivities-that is to say, the Phnom Penh Government's sensitivities-about the proposed United Nations administrative and military role in the transitional period have been known for some time and do not necessarily of themselves denote any kind of hardening of the SOC position. It has been reported that at a press conference for foreign correspondents in Phnom Penh as recently as a couple of weeks ago, on 29 November, Hun Sen in fact reiterated the SOC's acceptance of the Permanent Five (P5) framework document.</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important to note, as we watch the ebb and flow of rhetoric in the last stages, hopefully, of the settlement process, that the P5 framework, accepted in its entirety by all Cambodian parties as the basis for settling the Cambodian conflict, does not envisage the dismantling of the SOC regime. Rather, it provides for the exercise of such control by the United Nations transitional authority in Cambodia as is necessary to ensure the strict neutrality of administrative agencies, bodies and officers which could directly influence the outcome of the elections.</PARA>
<PARA> Quite a lot of the reporting that one sees is addressed to the bogy of dismantling the Phnom Penh Government. I make the point again for the record that the full dismantling of that Government is not what is in any way proposed by the UN peace plan. So far as Vietnam is concerned, its concerns are also not new and their reiteration does not of itself signify any hardening of its position.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, a most welcome development in the settlement process has been the decision announced just in the last couple of days of the co-Chairmen of the Paris Conference, Indonesia and France, to meet members of the Supreme National Council (SNC) in Paris later this week. Hun Sen has already indicated publicly that he will attend that meeting; the other factions had indicated some time earlier.</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the meeting is to brief the SNC members on the draft settlement text and to discuss with them the functioning of the SNC. We do all hope that, arising from that, some major progress will be made, in particular so as to enable reconvening of the coordination committee of the Paris conference in January next year. Australia is maintaining very close contact with key players in the negotiating process. We expect to play an active role in that Paris conference context when the committee and the conference itself are reconvened.</PARA>

Has the Minister noted that the Victorian Government has recently enacted an Industrial Waste Management Policy (Waste Minimisation) Act? In relation to waste of energy, is it a fact that Australia is the only Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country that has not set national standards for energy efficiency in buildings? When will this Government introduce legislation setting national standards for energy efficiency in buildings?

Yes, the Minister is aware of the recent Victorian legislation and will be examining it closely during the preparation of the national waste minimisation recycling strategy. Yes, the Federal Government is concerned that it is possible to construct buildings in Australia without due regard to energy efficiency, perhaps because of our mild climate relative to that of other OECD countries. Australia has not yet implemented many of the potential energy saving improvements which many other OECD countries have. Happily, this means that there is a great potential to do so. As a result--</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Tate interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I thought that was cute, too. As a result of the Government's decision to have a planning target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Government endorsed an energy management program initiative package to be implemented by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. As part of that package, in February next year every household in Australia will be provided with an information kit on ways to cut down our domestic energy consumption. Access to information is the first important step in implementing the wide community commitment to reducing our contribution to the greenhouse effect. As the responsibility for energy and building standards falls within the portfolios of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, and ultimately the States and Territories, the Minister will seek the advice of her colleagues Senator Button and Mr Kerin and get back to Senator Coulter as soon as possible with an answer on the Government's intention in relation to national standards in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of legislation designed to minimise the production of industrial waste, as I said, the Government is developing a national waste minimisation and recycling strategy in consultation with State governments. This will address the options for government action, including the option of legislation for the minimisation and control of both industrial and domestic waste. The draft strategy will be available early next year for public comment. The Government remains committed to introducing legislation to phase out the production of intractable waste by 1 January 1996. The Minister is not aware of the precise timing for the introduction of that legislation to Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen reports of the Morgan gallup poll but I have not seen the poll. I note the response to it which is, as the question implies, overwhelming, but I do not know what the question was and how the questions were framed, so I make no judgment about the veracity of the poll. When I obtain a copy of it and see the results, I will make a judgment about it. However, I must say that I am not surprised at the level of support, given the publicity that has attended this type of deal in Shepparton.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Will we amend the Act? I have made it clear that the Act provides for great flexibility for particular working arrangements. The first and most obvious example in this case is section 115 of the Act, which enables companies and employees to work out arrangements for wages and working conditions different from mainstream awards but suitable to the particular needs of a company and the trading environment that it operates in. A good example of that is the ICI Botany agreement in which sick leave has been given over in favour of an honour system and a number of other changes have been made which have put that company on a competitive footing. I point out that this has been done consensually: it has been done by agreement between the unions, the workers and the company concerned, and registered in the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> I secondly point out that under the award modification provisions provided for in the last national wage case decision there is provision, in the case of particular awards-and this award as regards food preservers has this flexibility provision-for award flexibility to take advantage of particular circumstances with a particular respondent, as this case would be.</PARA>
<PARA> I thirdly point out that there is a provision under the Act to mount a capacity to pay argument. There are principles laid down on how that should be conducted and that is there nonetheless where incapacity to pay besets a particular employer. All of these things are provisions within the Act or within benchmark decisions like national wage case decisions governing wage fixation.</PARA>
<PARA> I fourthly point out that under the award restructuring provisions the emphasis is now on workplace change, with a workplace change being designed to generate greater productivity or profitability in the workplace. But the significant thing about all of these provisions is that they should be taken to the Industrial Relations Commission. Why should they be taken to the Industrial Relations Commission? Clearly, the umpire needs to see that each of these deals is fair and that we do not find a situation in which, with a higher level of unemployment than this Government likes to see and with the bargaining share switching from workers to companies, people are particularly taken advantage of or victimised in any particular circumstance. That is why the umpire should scrutinise each of these arrangements. Given the flexibility I have referred to, there is no reason to amend the Act.</PARA>

<PARA> The issue of SPC started off outside; it is now coming back inside. As I have said, that is a welcome change. Senator Alston throws up as an example one set of circumstances that may obtain. I will throw up another example in reply, if he will just give me a chance to do so. In a time of high unemployment it is not unknown in industry for some employers to say to workers, `You will accept these reduced provisions or you will be sacked'. In that situation there is no fairness and no bargaining opportunity. The reason why an umpire needs to be in place to scrutinise those types of deals is to see that there is fairness.</PARA>
<PARA> Another observation I make about the proposition which Senator Alston has put is that it assumes fundamentally that unions covering workers in this country are not concerned about unemployment. I have had speeches delivered to me by leaders of particular unions and officers of the Australian Council of Trade Unions about unemployment. They are concerned about unemployment and about being flexible having regard to the circumstances of particular companies to make the relevant arrangements. One does not obtain cooperation by ignoring and going around them when they are part of the industrial relations institutions in this country. The proper arrangements are made by working with and through them so that better arrangements are made.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that this country has come a long way since the days when the Liberal Party was in government. We have come a huge distance- a million miles-in industrial relations from the type of New Right philosophies the Opposition has expounded. We have come through a period of massive award restructuring which has underpinned industrial efficiencies in this country which otherwise would not have been able to be achieved; we have come through a period of high economic growth when the bargaining shares were reviewed--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important question. Some European companies estimate that something like one-third of their business in the 1990s will be devoted to environmental engineering and waste management problems. There are significant national and international opportunities for Australian companies working in these fields. The environment management industry, as it is called, covers a range of technologies, products and systems which are designed to assist in the preservation or restoration of the environment. Australia has some particular strengths in liquid waste treatment, membrane technology, bioremediation and sensing equipment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The broad range of technologies has of course, not unusually in Australia, in the past led to a fragmented industry. My Department has been encouraging the development of a common purpose within the industry through support for the establishment of an environmental management industry association. The companies involved are also forming an export group, with the assistance of Austrade. The Government is also assisting information flows within the industry, and a recent publication on waste management technologies and so on has been well received in the industry. In recognition of the growth potential for industries of this kind, a system was established within the generic grants scheme to make particular research and development grants to projects relating to the industry. Environmental management and technologies is also one of the priority fields being considered in the multifunction polis feasibility study.</PARA>
<PARA> The area of environmental management is in some ways a relatively high technology industry now, as distinct from the past. There are some very interesting Australian companies, such as Memtec Ltd, the Sydney company which specialises in membrane filtration, and a company in Brisbane called Neutralysis, which is a small company at this stage but which has some undoubted interest being shown in its processes in the United States and elsewhere. There are other companies of that kind which I think are well positioned to grow with the importance of the waste management industry in the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is too early to make any assumption that the prospect of high level talks between the United States and Iraq has now evaporated. Although the visits of Iraqi Foreign Minister Tareq Aziz to Washington and United States Secretary of State James Baker to Iraq are both on hold as a result of the failure to agree on dates and following an obvious stalling exercise from the Iraqi side, I think it is reasonable to hope that some new dates will emerge over the next few days. Since there can be no doubt at all about the determination of the coalition to bring matters to a head forcefully if United Nations (UN) objectives cannot be achieved in any other way, the objective fact of the matter is that there is much more for Saddam Hussein to lose than to gain if the talks fall through completely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic objective of the proposed discussions, as Secretary Baker has made very clear, is to make absolutely clear to Iraq the nature of the forces arrayed against it and the absolute necessity of its complying with UN resolutions. Consistent with that, there is no reason in Australia's view why some other matters could not usefully and constructively be discussed-in particular, the future shape of security arrangements in the Gulf region and perhaps also the means of resolving some of the matters originally in bilateral dispute between Iraq and Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA> What cannot and will not be linked to discussions about the Gulf conflict is the question of the resolution of the Palestinian and other outstanding Middle Eastern issues. While, as President Bush and Secretary Baker have said, the resolution of the Gulf crisis may well constitute an `opportunity' or a `springboard' to address these issues, they are separate and distinct and must remain so. It is, accordingly, simply chasing a will-o'-the-wisp for Iraq to insist that the Palestinian and other Middle East issues must be on the agenda of the talks. It is simply part of Iraq's continuing attempt to divert attention from and confuse the issue of its aggression against Kuwait and, as such, must be dismissed out of hand.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have taken a very strong stand that, by unleashing consumer power in the marketplace, there is no doubt that Australians can help those of their fellow Australians in the farming industry, in orchards and in the fishing industry by ensuring that, when they have presented to them a variety of foodstuffs, they can make a choice which favours the Australian produce. I believe that they can be aided in that particular task by clear labelling of the country of origin of imported foodstuffs. I am aware of the recommendation of the Australian Food Standards Committee made in Perth a couple of weeks ago and I believe that it is imperative that the country of origin be shown, because I believe that that is an important indication to consumers of the country of origin and, therefore, of the choice that they are confronting. One hopes that they will then favour the Australian produce.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the exact wording on the label, that is a matter which comes before the various health Ministers of Australia. In view of the unfortunate fragmentation of responsibility in our Federation and between different portfolios, that should be the case. I have written to the various health Ministers in all the jurisdictions of Australia encouraging them to move very quickly on the recommendations. I will certainly take up Senator Bjelke-Petersen's admonition that one needs to have a clearer statement of the country of origin rather than simply a statement that imported ingredients are used in the preparation and sale of certain fruit juices.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if Australian consumers were confronted with the information that a particular fruit juice did contain imported ingredients, knowing as we do that in some instances fruit juice concentrate is merely diluted with Australian water before it is peddled on the Australian market as produce of Australia, that would be sufficient to give pause and enable them to make a choice in favour of the Australian product.</PARA>
<PARA> I have no knowledge of a proposal that floral arrangements be labelled in any particular way. I will take that matter up. However, I do not believe that it is a matter of such concern as, for example, the one that led me a week or so ago to speak about the labelling of unpackaged vegetables, fruit, fish and nut products because in those areas there is obviously an imperative need and that will be met.</PARA>

The video explains how award restructuring operates and the advantages both to workers and employers in a workplace of engaging in restructuring the productive output of that workplace. The Government has paid $30,000 towards the production of that video. The total cost has been made up by services provided by management and workers at Nissan Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the big advantages of the accord is that it has introduced a major change in terms of award restructuring; quite astonishing change has occurred. It is now supported by all the parties. The Confederation of Australian Industry strongly argued for it in national wage case proceedings and it made that point again this year.</PARA>
<PARA> Award restructuring means that we break down the old craft and trade classifications and have multiskilled trade persons. We make the work force more flexible so that it is better able to adapt to and deal with new technology. It introduces career paths into awards so that workers do not remain locked forever in the job classification that they start out in and it provides advancement by training and qualifications. The wages system is used as an incentive in this. It provides a setting to agree on how to remove inefficiencies and generate greater productivity and profitability and how that productivity and profitability should best be shared. Those are the advantages of award restructuring.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems in the manufacturing industry in proceeding with it is that we have uncovered a lack of numeracy and literacy skills in the ordinary industrial work force. It is estimated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions that poor English fluency in the workplace costs $6.5 billion a year in terms of lost productivity and between $10m and $13m in terms of workers compensation. It is estimated that Australia has one million workers in need of training in this area. So the Commonwealth Government, in supporting the actions being taken by employers, workers and unions, has proceeded to present this video.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ivan Deveson of Nissan Australia is reported as having said:</PARA>
<PARA> Award restructuring paid higher dividends to companies that implemented it properly, but language was a hurdle that had to be cleared first. . . But one of the largest problems confronting award restructuring was that of illiteracy . . . The problem of communicating, because of the weaknesses in our English language, are horrendous . . . We underestimated that. The literacy and numeracy problems of our country, which may or may not be typified by the Nissan workforce, are horrendous. In Nissan's body shop, employees came from 77 ethnic groups and spoke 27 different languages. Although the language of the company is English, we have to handle that challenge.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to demonstrate how his company has benefited massively from award restructuring and how that enables weaknesses in achieving a more flexible work force to be identified. This is one that has been, and the Federal Government is pleased to join with Nissan in trying to address that problem on its behalf and in its workplace as well as on behalf of other major manufacturing enterprises in this country.</PARA>

The point that I have consistently made is that there is a system of dealing with this and it is best to allow the system to work. For politicians to interfere constantly with the workings of the system does not help in any way. Dr Hewson should butt out of the SPC dispute and enable the umpire to make a proper decision in the circumstances. I congratulated the parties for talking; that was the company and the Victorian Trades Hall Council. That is a proper thing for them to do. I of course acknowledge that the workers, and many of them -the reports I have seen suggest the vast majority of them-are union members, are concerned about their interests. My point is that their interests are best protected from rapacious employers as well as-if the Opposition wishes to make the implication-rapacious unions--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a supplementary answer to a question asked of me on 12 December by Senator McMullan about human rights in Vietnam and about the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do and the Most Venerable Thich Nhuen Quang. In my response I said that the most recent report from the Australian Embassy in Hanoi dated July 1989 advised that both had been released and were now freely practising their religion in the Nghia Binh and Thai Binh provinces respectively. It has been brought to my attention that since the release of this report from the Australian Embassy in Hanoi, the Amnesty International report entitled Vietnam, Renovation (Doi Moi) the Law and Human Rights in the 1980s, published in February 1990, claims that the two monks are still under house arrest in their native villages. I have therefore instructed Australian Embassy staff in Hanoi to visit the two provinces in the course of their provincial travels to verify whether the two were indeed released as we were formally advised last year by the Vietnamese authorities. On a positive note, I can advise that on 10 December the Australian Embassy in Hanoi raised 11 other human rights cases with the Vietnamese foreign ministry and was advised that two of the 11 had already been released from detention.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week Senator Teague asked me a question about Cambodia and Mr Costello's conversations in Beijing. I would like to make a supplementary answer to that in the light of Senator Teague's response to my invitation later that day to put down a document in the Senate bearing upon his question. I would like first to explain that since launching our initiative in November last year to revive the Cambodian peace process Australia has had a large number of private discussions with the various Cambodian parties and other relevant governments at both ministerial and senior official level. The value of our contribution to the peace process has depended crucially on our respecting the confidentiality of those discussions. Accordingly, I do not intend to undermine our credentials to play a continuing facilitating role in the peace process by divulging all the details of our various conversations with Prince Sihanouk and his son Prince Ranariddh, who is the executive leader of the Cambodian party FUNCINPEC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, because Senator Teague has chosen to ask specific questions about Mr Costello's meeting with Prince Sihanouk in Pyongyang on 2 November, let me simply say that I have now had a opportunity to check personally the relevant records and I can confirm the accuracy of the response I gave to Senator Teague's question without notice last week. Mr Costello has told me that when he met with Prince Sihanouk in Pyongyang he did not say anything to suggest that Australia was on the point of recognising the Hun Sen regime nor did he say anything to suggest that we believed a second Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia was likely. There is nothing in the detailed record of conversation prepared at the time to suggest otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA> On 13 December Senator Teague tabled a copy of the document which purports to be the translation of a message of 4 November from Prince Sihanouk to Prince Ranariddh, who was then in Bangkok, which makes reference to Mr Costello's conversation with Prince Sihanouk in Pyongyang on 2 November. I am able to say that Mr Costello met Prince Ranariddh in Bangkok on 6 November and found him to have received a version of a message containing some misunderstandings of Mr Costello's conversation four days earlier with Prince Sihanouk. Those misunderstandings related to issues similar to those raised last week by Senator Teague and were carefully corrected at the time by Mr Costello.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to confirm for the record that Australia's relations with Prince Sihanouk are most cordial and constructive. We recognise the unique place he occupies in the affairs of his country. He has given firm support and encouragement to Australia's efforts to assist the international negotiating process aimed at a comprehensive settlement of the tragic Cambodian conflict. We, for one, have no doubt at all that he will continue to play a central, important and perhaps decisive role in the affairs of his country.</PARA>

<PARA>The Senate</PARA>

<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Teague</PARA>
<PARA>In my response to your Question without Notice concerning Cambodia on 4 December I said that the issues you raised would be addressed in my Ministerial Statement of 6 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>There was one query concerning the responsibility of Son Sen for human rights violations that was not covered specifically in the Statement-although the relevant considerations were addressed in general terms on p.17 of the document as circulated-and I would like to respond further to that. </PARA>
<PARA>Son Sen is a senior Khmer Rouge leader and is currently the commander of the Khmer Rouge military forces (called the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea-NADK). Prior to the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge regime in December 1978 January 1979, Son Sen was Deputy Prime Minister in charge of defence. Together with Khieu Samphan, who is the nominal leader of the Khmer Rouge (President of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea), Son Sen was nominated by the Khmer Rouge to be a member of the Supreme National Council established by the Cambodian parties at their meeting in Jakarta on 9-10 September 1990. As confirmed in the joint statement issued at the conclusion of that meeting, Khieu Samphan's and Son Sen's membership of the SNC was in fact accepted by the SOC and the two other Cambodian parties. (There are ten other members of the SNC-six nominated by the SOC, two by FUNCINPEC (Prince Sihanouk's faction) and two by the KPNLF (Son Sann's faction)). </PARA>
<PARA>As a senior figure of the Khmer Rouge regime, Son Sen must bear some of the responsibility for the horrendous record of that regime. Whether or not he should be held personally to account for the gross human rights violations of the Khmer Rouge period is basically up to the Cambodian people to decide. To date anyway, it does not appear that the Cambodian people, at least as represented by the non-Khmer Rouge parties, are inclined to so regard Son Sen.</PARA>
<PARA>Successive Australian Governments have condemned the atrocities committed by the Pol Pot regime. The presence of two Khmer Rouge nominees on the Supreme National Council does not signify any change whatsoever to that Australian position, nor does it signify any Judgment about their personal culpability or otherwise for Khmer Rouge atrocities. </PARA>
<PARA>As to the question of whether Pol Pot or his most notorious associates should be allowed to stand in the election conducted under UN auspices, the Australian Government's position is that this is an issue which will have to be addressed in the peace settlement process-perhaps by way of agreement between the parties if not by some more formal disqualification provision. It is our present understanding, as I indicated in the Parliamentary Statement, that those whose past notoriety is greatest do not in fact intend to be candidates: certainly it can be assumed that if Pol Pot or any of his most notorious associates were to stand the International reaction, including from Australia, would be very severe. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This being the first item, under our Standing Orders-I only had the annual report of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade placed in my hands literally the second that I stood up-I will not be able to speak at any length in the few minutes available to me. I do not wish to use this opportunity to berate the Government for its failures in the field of Australia-India relations, its slowness to take initiatives with regard to China, its failure in New Guinea and the Pacific generally or the difficulties it is facing due to a too singular, too unique approach in putting forward only one option with regard to Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk just briefly about some questions that remain in my mind about the Department and the way this Government is administering the Department. I refer to questions that I have asked during Question Time in the Senate and through colleagues in the Estimates committee hearings concerning the distribution of staff, in particular political staff, in our embassies overseas and the network of Foreign Affairs officers in the Department, both in Canberra and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> I am one senator who has long held the view that we do not apply sufficient resources to this Department. I continue to urge that additional resources are given to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade so that there are the personnel in Canberra and especially overseas to carry out the programs and to forward the proposals that are in Australia's best interests. I do not wish to criticise particular officers; I wish to give support to any proposal or Cabinet submission that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) may have made in the past or may be in a position to make in the future so that there is an increase in the resources available to his Department to ensure that our proposals are best achieved in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the developments in Europe, eastern Europe in particular, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, just to take one region of the world, there is a need for us to have a properly functioning embassy in Czechoslovakia and to make sure that we have a distribution of diplomatic posts, which will ensure that we have eyes and ears in these rapidly changing parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need to reconsider the number of our staff deployed in South America. The achievement of even one or two additional posts will help to make sure that, especially with regard to trade and economic relations, we are able to take up opportunities in Australia's national interest. That can be done partly by way of joint ventures in economic matters with those countries, to ensure that the trade outcome is directed to the Asia-Pacific region as much as to Europe and North America. We should also see what advantages there are for Australia within South America, having regard particularly to our advanced technology, our research and our high levels of development of processes which may well be applied in that region, given the stage which countries such as Mexico, Colombia and Chile, to name just three, have reached. </PARA>
<PARA> I will continue to watch both the annual reports and the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to ensure that we have adequate resources to achieve our national interest. Often, one well-informed officer can further Government policies-policies worked out in dialogue in this Parliament, in some ways-to enormous material gain to this country. It is timely to remind the Government that any requests that are well argued by the Minister in Cabinet ought to be properly supported so that we have Australia's national interest--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since I am fortuitously in the chamber, let me respond by saying that I am glad for once to have Senator Teague making a contribution to the foreign affairs debate with which I have no difficulty agreeing. The job performed by Australian officials overseas in our missions is a first-class one. They provide a highly professional service and deserve more recognition than they sometimes get. The role of the diplomat overseas is now often thought rather less necessary than before due to the advent of the jet aircraft and the fax machine, as well as other electronic communications. But, against that background, the point is often overlooked that the complexity of international affairs is increasing almost exponentially; not only in bilateral relations, with a much wider agenda these days, but also in matters of multilateral diplomacy. I, for one, need no persuasion that we need not to be further reducing our representation overseas but, if humanly possible, increasing it. I do not want to trespass on the short time available to other honourable senators, except to say that I will be working very hard to ensure that no unnecessary reductions occur and that, if possible, we do get some increases in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>In the six or seven minutes that I have had the annual report of the Australian War Memorial in my hand, I have not been able to establish whether or not it lays before the Senate the decision of the Australian War Memorial Council to introduce a charge for admission to the Australian War Memorial. Honourable senators will be aware of the fact that this announcement was made approximately two or three weeks ago by the Chairman of the Council. It was greeted with dismay, shock and horror by the veterans' community of Australia, who see the imposition of an admission fee, even to the exhibit areas of the Memorial, as being grossly inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time that the announcement was made I said, on behalf of the Australian Democrats and, I believe, the majority of veterans in this country, that the introduction of such an admission fee was little short of crass commercialism of the worst kind. Since the announcement was made, the reaction of the veterans' community has built considerably around that resentment. Last week this was reinforced dramatically with the announcement that Mrs Moore, a volunteer of 15 years standing at the Memorial, had her services terminated, allegedly because she had spoken out against the introduction of the admission fee. She had pleaded with the Council to cancel some of the expensive social activities associated with the Memorial in an attempt to save money. In fact, she simply stated a position of dissent. She exercised her free right of expression, the consequence of which was that her services were removed after 15 years of voluntary service to the Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a sad irony that those who are commemorated in that War Memorial died in defence of that fundamental right of freedom of speech. It is not as though Mrs Moore's dissent had been expressed in an assertive or even in a public way prior to her dismissal. She made a very low key statement of her opinion about the decision of the Council, only to find herself dismissed after 15 years of voluntary service to the Memorial. Ironically, she was dismissed in the same week in which the Memorial advertised for volunteers. The Australian Democrats share with the community at large, but especially with the veterans' community, absolute disdain at the introduction of an admission fee, even to the exhibits associated with the Memorial. Further, we express our absolute dismay with the fact that somebody who has voluntarily served for 15 years was dismissed because she exercised her right of free speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak on the annual report of the Australian War Memorial. I regret that it was not available prior to tabling, and therefore it is very difficult to comment in any depth about it. Nevertheless, as Senator McLean said, there is a major issue facing the Australian War Memorial at the moment. I will spend the five minutes available to me in discussing that issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, I acknowledge that two Council members have died. One was Mr Reg Saunders MBE, who was the first Aboriginal Australian to be a commissioned officer in the Australian Army. He had served on the Council from July 1985, and I know that he will be missed. In addition, after the report went to the printers, we learnt of the death of the artist, Mr Clifton Pugh. He had also made a major contribution to the Memorial during his time on the Council and I express my regret at his passing. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the issue I wish to speak about is the decision taken by the War Memorial Council to charge for admission to the Memorial. In the last few days I have been concerned about the increasing tendency for the Memorial to be referred to as a museum. It is not a museum; it is a memorial. It would be sad if the Memorial Council started to think in this way and, indeed, it would be a very black day if the Council responsible for the Memorial were to use that language, as is happening around the country now. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition recognises the major efforts that the Council has made over the last few years to upgrade the Memorial. There have been enormous improvements. The Memorial is an important place of pilgrimage for all Australians. It is where one learns about the importance of peace because one sees the horrors of war. I recognise that there is a big demand for funds by the Memorial. It does need a lot of money, but it also gets a lot of donations and that should not be forgotten in this current debate. It is extremely important that the Memorial has access to funds for research, for assistance to the public, and for the education of the next generation of Australians. I recognise that there are lots of pressures on the Memorial Council to find the necessary funding to do all the jobs that it is faced with, and that is a dilemma for the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision that was announced last month to charge for admission gives the Opposition some major concerns. We accept generally the principle of user pays. But in this case there are very real concerns that we are turning something which is a memorial to our dead into just another museum. This is even though the Memorial has chosen to distinguish between the galleries and the more sacred parts of the building. </PARA>
<PARA> I wrote to Dame Beryl Beaurepaire setting out the concerns and asking her some questions. I have now received a response which I do not find satisfactory in any shape or form. Dame Beryl has failed to come to grips with the access and equity issue. The Government has just released a report by the Office of Multicultural Affairs which goes into great detail about the ability of ethnic Australians to have access to the War Memorial. It looks as though the access and equity principles which may be extended to the ethnic members of this country are more important than for those who have actually fought for their country. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor would it appear that the access and equity questions are important when it comes to those who have donated items to the Memorial. Men and women who have lost mates or spouses, who have given their personal effects to the Memorial-those of us who have given letters or tapes to illustrate the social history of the wars through which we have lived-have been forgotten in the arrangements that have been made. Dame Beryl and her Australian War Memorial Council have failed to find a way to give access and equity to these people. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Council has failed to get any sort of a guarantee from the Government that the funding will continue at the present levels and will be indexed accordingly following the introduction of the admission charges. It is clear that the War Memorial will end up being squeezed like a lemon. I urge the Memorial Council to think again. It has no guarantee of funding. It is not giving proper access to the men and women who have fought for this country or the people who have given to the Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned about what has happened to Mrs Moore, the voluntary guide who has lost her position after many years of devoted service. This is not the way for the War Memorial Council and its committees to behave. I urge them most sincerely to give this whole matter fresh consideration. We in the Opposition are not satisfied with the answers that have been given by the Council. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The family allowance supplement (FAS) has made a significant difference to the living standards of a very large number of Australian families on low incomes for whom this program was designed. This evaluation report seeks to give an outline of the nature of the families which have either taken up or not taken up this payment. It provides an extremely valuable snapshot of the approach and response to this payment by families on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The family allowance supplement was a crucial element in the Cass survey on social security. At that time a benchmark was established for the payment of FAS. The payments, expressed as a percentage of the married pension rate, were 15 per cent for children to the age of 12 and 20 per cent for those aged 13 to 15 years inclusive. This target was reached in 1989 after a December 1987 commencement date. </PARA>
<PARA> The characteristics of families for whom FAS has made such a lot of difference are summarised in the report that we are now considering. The report shows that FAS payments are being spent primarily on children; families have a high work force attachment and prefer to stay employed; the payment plays a vital role in helping families make ends meet, which is exactly what we had intended; it is used to pay for children's basic necessities such as clothing, food and school expenses; the majority of parents who were receiving FAS thought that their children were as well off as most children in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> The departmental records at the end of 1989 show that 61 per cent of FAS families received income of between $200 and $400 a week. It must have been at about that time that the means test was relaxed a little. FAS has had a significant effect on the level of net family income. Most families in this cohort rely on one income plus the FAS payment and there is a clear preference for the existing fortnightly cash payment. The payment is not influenced by perceptions of stigma. The high rate of take up probably reflects the FAS publicity campaigns, including regional office outreach programs and correspondence from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), rather than any structural change. It is thought that these campaigns contributed quite substantially to the increase in take up between its inception in 1987 and June 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> At June 1990-and these are the most recent figures given to us by this report-about 180,000 families were receiving FAS. The children of those families would probably number close to half a million. The main source of information about FAS comes, despite all of the efforts that we have made in terms of publicity, from friends and relatives, followed by the Department of Social Security and the media. The majority of people found information about FAS easy to get and reported no difficulties in applying for it. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, FAS has made an enormous difference to the well-being of very many Australian families. I think the Budget outlay in 1989-90 was in the vicinity of $514m, a very worthwhile expenditure. A comparison of eligible and noneligible families showed that, on the whole, the non-eligible groups were more likely to be in de facto relationships with fewer children and lower educational levels. However, almost all families receiving the payment have children of a very young age. The Government appreciated that the low, single income characteristic of families with young children made this extra payment absolutely essential for their well-being. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to make a couple of points about the Barley Research Council annual report. I was a member of a recent trade mission to China that was made by six Liberal Party members and senators. The question of barley arose when we visited the Guangzhou malting company in the Guangzhou economic zone. During the visit we heard glowing reports of the barley supplied to that malting plant from New South Wales. This plant is now the largest malting plant in all of Asia. Indeed, it supplies some 14 Chinese brewers with their malt as well as the renowned Danish brewer, Carlsberg. The export of barley to China has risen quite substantially in the last 12 months. A successful contact for the supply of 100,000 tonnes of barley, which is valued at more than $20m, has been successfully negotiated. </PARA>
<PARA> This report is concerned with the amount of research that goes into the production of barley in Australia. The Barley Research Council states on page 4 of its report that its objectives are as follows: firstly, to increase productivity in the production of barley, secondly, to protect the industry's productive base; and, thirdly, to increase market demand. </PARA>
<PARA> In watching the various stages of the malting process and hearing very glowing reports about the quality of the barley that is being supplied, one can commend the Research Council for the work that it is doing, if indeed the work it is doing is contributing to the increase in market demand for barley from Australia. At a time when there is little good news about the export of Australian products, be they commodity products or manufactured goods, it is indeed pleasing to see that there was a touch of brightness for barley from Australia in our trade with China. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to comment on the rural adjustment scheme, particularly as it relates to Western Australia. In commenting on this report, I emphasise that the rural adjustment scheme has been operating in its current form fundamentally since 1971-72. I wish to emphasise that many of the problems occurring in rural Australia, and rural Western Australia in particular, have been brought about, firstly, by the problems Australia has had internationally in the marketplace and, secondly, the economic policies adopted by the current Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The high interest rate regime, the lack of effort in reforming our transport industries, the waterfront and our general cost structures have been absolutely disastrous to the rural sector and to rural businesses. Since the Hawke Government has been in power, farm enterprises in Western Australia have dropped from 17,000 to 13,000 in what have been considered relatively good times. This drop has been a direct result of the lack of reform in the pipeline industries because rural production, as an export industry, depends very much on exporting from Australia at a competitive price. With the high interest rate regime that we have had, farmers and the rural businesses in the towns that support them have not had the opportunity to put any `fat' away so that they can ride through the present downturn or engineered recession. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned greatly that, according to the report in the press last week, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has placed emphasis on providing funds to take more people out of the industry. On the estimates which have been put forward in Western Australia by the Rural Adjustment and Finance Corporation of Western Australia, if the current situation continues, then another 3,000 to 4,000 farm enterprises or farming families will be leaving the industry in the next seven or eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> The time has come for the Government, through its economic policy, to address the problem. The rural adjustment scheme should be a facilitator primarily to assist people and businesses in rural industries to get over the rough spots so that they can continue. The tragedy is that we are now seeing people who are good operators and have an enormous knowledge and understanding of the industry being caught in this economic malaise which is forcing them out of existence. The flow-on impact in the rural towns, on the employees who work in agricultural industries-shearers and rouseabouts-and on people involved in the support industries, such as machinery dealers, will be quite disastrous. They are the people who are now moving out and joining the dole queues. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of this report, it is time that the whole emphasis of rural adjustment was reconsidered. The real culprit for the problems being faced at present, including the necessity to pour in the dollar amounts talked about, is not the people working in the rural or support industries, whether they are efficient or not, but successive years of totally inappropriate economic policy which has pulled down people to their knees. That economic policy has been totally inappropriate to the requirements of those in the community who produce the real wealth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a matter to which I will be giving a great deal of attention as soon as possible. However, I draw attention to some of the recommendations relating to fraud control. I am alarmed to think that the Auditor-General is having to make recommendations to the Department of Veterans' Affairs on preparing detailed operating procedures for dealing with fraud and other irregularities and that they have not defined such terms as serious fraud, minor fraud or technical and administrative irregularities in the treatment services control guidelines. There is a recommendation to refer these guidelines and operating procedures relating to fraud and other irregularities to the relevant authorities, such as the Australian Federal Police and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, for comment and to submit them to the Repatriation Commission for formal approval. What has been happening? In 1987 we had the report that required all government departments to put into place the proper fraud control plans. We now find at the end of 1990 the Auditor-General telling us that these things are not in place and recommending that they be put in place straightaway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The departmental response to the recommendation I have just referred to, which is recommendation No. 8, is that the Department will review the need for more detailed guidance of treatment services control actions relating to fraud; that guidelines relating to fraud and certain other irregularities will be referred to the Australian Federal Police and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for comment; and that the guidelines in future will be referred to the Secretary to the Department for approval. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are all things which should have been done long ago. We are talking here about the treatment of veterans. There is a great opportunity for overservicing and fraud in the provision of these services. We are talking particularly here not about the involvement of veterans so much as about the involvement of people who deal with veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not had an opportunity to read the report yet, but if there is one thing I know for absolute certain it is that there should not be one penny misspent in the Department of Veterans' Affairs because any penny misspent on fraud or overservicing-call it what you like-is a penny that is not available to look after the veterans who fought for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the veterans are being pinched for their pennies when the Australian War Memorial Council has to put a charge on going to the Australian War Memorial. If there is any money that could possibly be better used in the Veterans' Affairs portfolio, the Department and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) should be ashamed of themselves to think they had not taken that action long ago. Every other department has been putting plans in place. What in Heaven's name has happened to the Department of Veterans' Affairs?</PARA>
<PARA> I will be keenly concerned to see the material on the irregularities that we can only look at now in flicking through the report. Clearly, the Auditor-General does not believe that serious fraud is a major concern, but the Auditor says that unacceptable servicing, which is shown in a pie chart on page 30 of the report, is 45 per cent and irregularities cover 54 per cent. Serious fraud, thank God, is one per cent. That is the achievement of priority in examining unacceptable servicing. I am appalled to think that the Department has been dragging its feet so much, as I am sure all senators are, because it means that money is coming out of the welfare of and care for our veterans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering three separate pieces of legislation before the Senate today. The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill is a collection of corrections of sloppy drafting by the Government with regard to nine separate pieces of legislation. It includes amendments to two wheat industry Bills which the coalition in the other House tried to move during the passage of the original legislation. The Government has finally accepted the commonsense of these proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other Bills which are being considered today are the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill and the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Bill. Both of these Bills are significant and important for the terms of trade between Australia and import countries and the meat and livestock industries. The purpose of these Bills is to give the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation power to implement and administer schemes to control the level of exports of Australian meat and livestock to particular markets where the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation board considers such arrangements would be in the industry's best interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corporation already has the power to restrict the quantity of meat and livestock exported from Australia; to prohibit the export of meat and livestock to particular countries; and to administer meat quotas to a particular country where restrictions are, or in the opinion of the Corporation will be, imposed by either that country or Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The experience with the live sheep trade to the Middle East, in which the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation experienced a deficiency, is the ability to impose controlling levels of exports. We have a situation in which the live sheep trade has been built up to approximately seven million sheep, half of which were going to Saudi Arabia. Trade had to be suspended when shipments of sheep to the Middle East were being rejected; the traders had been shipping older sheep and there was very little that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation could do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Middle East nations, in particular Saudi Arabia, have specified quite clearly the age requirement of sheep. Since the suspension of live sheep exports to the region, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation has been rebuilding its trade. It has imposed two limitations on live sheep exports: first, limiting the shipment to one shipload a month; and, secondly, a far tighter specification with regard to the age of the sheep. It appears that the industry needs to rebuild the numbers on a more controlled basis and ensure that those live sheep meet the requirements of the marketplace. It is important that this industry is protected during the reconstruction of the trade. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the legislation under consideration, the coalition Liberal and National parties believe that what the Government is proposing goes too far. It gives the extension of a general export power, which is really only going to be utilised for one form of export-live sheep. In the past the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation has had those particular extensions as required and has managed them well. The coalition fails to recognise why the situation should need a different requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the intention of the coalition to move during the committee stage amendments which we believe meet the requirements of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation and the live sheep export industry. They will bring some control to the market by restricting the power of the Corporation to live sheep only and restricting the ability to sell quotas to the live sheep industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no point in saying that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation does not have certain powers to control the trade. There are, of course, better ways in which to control the trade. It is wrong to say that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation does not have any powers. On the contrary, its powers include: cancellation of export licences; prohibiting the export of meat and livestock to certain countries; and bringing about more orderly trading. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust that the Government will accept the coalition's amendments. They will meet the current needs and avoid the potential trade and quota problems. If the amendments are not successful, the coalition will vote against the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst many aspects of the series of Bills before the Senate can be supported and in some cases are a relief to see, we should be very careful not to take for granted some of the information included in the second reading speeches incorporated by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn first to a matter which will become apparent under the Australian Meat and Livestock (Quotas) Bill 1990. The justification for introducing this Bill was given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in his second reading speech in the House of House of Representatives, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Because quota arrangements can, at times, result in windfall profits to exporters-</PARA>
<PARA>and there is no doubt that that is the case-</PARA>
<PARA>granted quota access, it has been decided to empower the AMLC to sell quota entitlement by auction . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I question that statement. That is true as it stands but, conversely, an existing exporter who fails to gain a quota at such an auction also has the potential to suffer a windfall loss. The loss would result from the existing provision of infrastructure and support systems which have been made at the exporter's expense. With such a statement in the Minister's speech, it is immediately apparent that there has not been sufficient consultation with the industry regarding these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> During the period in which this Bill has been proposed, we have received several items of correspondence which make suggestions such as that the quota Bill receives intense opposition from exporters and traders, it creates a disincentive to trading meat and livestock from Australia, and the charging of quotas will result in lower producer returns. These sorts of reservations have been offered to us by people involved in the industry. We therefore intend to support the Opposition's amendments in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats' amendment, which is to be offered in the committee stage as well, is directly connected with the export of live sheep. Our opposition to this practice is well known and documented. We will take every opportunity to highlight the lack of concern for animal welfare which participation in this trade illustrates. We are yet to be convinced that such trade is even to Australia's economic advantage. For example, considerable expenses are involved in moving live animals overseas and maintaining them in a saleable condition for several weeks at sea. I fail to see why exports of live sheep should be permitted at all when obviously the completion of the enterprises is so often subjected to international diplomatic manoeuvring, as we have seen recently. In such circumstances, our economic advantage would surely be best served by processing the sheep in Australia and not subjecting the sheep to the suffering that is guaranteed by the vagaries of international politics. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. We applaud and agree with many aspects of this Bill, which facilitates arrangements for the collection of levies from the pig and laying chicken industries for payment to the exotic animal diseases preparedness trust account. That is good and something which should be recognised as such. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also pleased to support the amendments to the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1983 which enables the Murray-Darling Ministerial Council to make decisions out of session. This council is charged with the direction and coordination of the Murray-Darling Basin initiative to combat land and water degradation and to develop sustainable resource use in the basin. We support the amendments, which should make the operation of this council more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> In a similar vein concerning part 4 of this Bill, we shall be moving an amendment to clause 14 of the amendments to the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 so that the word `sustainable' is added to the clause and it will then read:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . conservation and sustainable resource management . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The committee that is being considered in this legislation is an independent selection committee. Its purpose is to nominate persons to the Minister for appointment to the Horticultural Research and Development Council. One would think that, in keeping with this Government's stated attitudes towards sustainable development, it is entirely appropriate that appointments to this corporation should be guided by expertise in sustainable resource use, a phrase which we were so pleased to see in the Murray-Darling Basin Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments which we will be moving to this Bill include alterations to the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. This Act is a constant source of irritation and annoyance to people who believe that plant variety rights is a vehicle which will enable the manipulation of plant breeding and horticultural research by multinational companies. Those companies do not have the best interests of Australian agriculture at heart. In fact, we can see immediately that the development of hybrid plant types is dependent upon particular fertilisers, agricultural practices and pesticide usage. These plant types are often sold by the same companies which own plant variety rights. They lock primary producers into agricultural practices and expenses which would not necessarily occur if we were freer to pursue alternative agricultural methods. So we will be moving some amendments which are associated with the Plant Variety Rights Act. </PARA>
<PARA> By moving such amendments, we will attempt to ensure that, if the Plant Variety Rights Act is to operate, then at least it will operate with some degree of recognition of the traditional agricultural practices which have been able to bring Australian agriculture and its development of varieties to question other international practices and so often lead the world in what has developed in Australia. On some occasions in this legislation we are able to see room for congratulating the Government, on other occasions we will be supporting amendments moved by the Opposition, and on other occasions we see a very great need to move our own amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Bill 1990. In the short time allotted to me, I will briefly run over the reasons why there is even an attempt to have quotas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As you probably know, Madam Acting Deputy President, the live sheep issue has provided lively debate for the last 18 months or so, particularly in the area of trade with the Middle East. In fact, it has been a lively debate for other reasons and Senator Bell slightly touched on some of those in his delivery, including whether live sheep should be transported at all. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988-89 at least 7.1 million sheep were exported to the Middle East, though by the end of the 1989-90 financial year that figure had dropped to 4.4 million. That was due to the disruption in the Saudi Arabian trade as against the trade in the balance of the Middle East. Saudi Arabia imported around 1.25 million sheep in 1989-90, which was a drop of 60 per cent on the 3.1 million imported in the previous year. When Saudi Arabia dropped out Kuwait became the biggest trader, importing 1.37 million sheep. Of course, we have since lost Kuwait due to the Gulf crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Since July of 1989 we have still had problems of rejection because of alleged diseases. The Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (AMLC) then halted shipments altogether. But that was a great mistake on the part of the Corporation. Instead of talking it through and trying to convince a high ranking Australian official, such as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) or the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), to become involved, it simply decided to cut out exports and starve the Middle East of live sheep. That short-sighted method certainly did not help by the time it came around to getting exports going again. So the AMLC does have a lot to answer for in this case. On 22 August 1989 the AMLC announced the resumption of trade for sheep up to three years of age, commonly known amongst the trade as the yellow taggers. In March of 1990, there was a further destruction of the trade because of disease. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that we should inoculate sheep against scabby mouth, which is the disease presenting the greatest problems. This disease, of course is, a passing phase, but I believe inoculation would work. I would not advocate having inoculation on the farms, because it is a live virus. But, with a 42-day retention period the sheep could spend 14 days on the feedlot, 14 days or thereabouts on the ship and then 14 days in quarantine when they get to Saudi or wherever they are going. Quarantining really has to be looked at, because the Saudis seem very hard to please. I believe that our sheep have always been presented pretty well and pretty clean, but the Saudis do not seem to understand this. </PARA>
<PARA> On 28 November it was reported that the Sheepmeat Council of Australia had accepted the amendments in this Bill, but the Council criticised the AMLC for not advising it of the proposed legislation. The Corporation went ahead with the Government and came up with this proposed legislation, but forgot to tell anyone else about it. Of course it recommended that quotas apply. In this case, the Saudis wanted only about 800,000 sheep a year, which is roughly 12 shipments of about 80,000 sheep. </PARA>
<PARA> We should now look at the provisions of these quota measures. Clause 6 provides that where a limit on exports has been or is to be imposed, the AMLC may grant a single quota allowing the export licence holder to make all exports, or two or more quotas allowing each export licence holder to make a specified amount of exports. The AMLC may grant a quota by auction, tender, private sale or allocation free of charge. A quota will have effect for a period, not exceeding two years, specified in the quota document. A quota will be subject to any conditions specified in the quota document. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that quotas will interfere with a lot of current negotiations with the Middle East countries involved in the live sheep trade. The biggest problem I have in accepting quotas is that they could finish up in the hands of one exporter. Even if, say, three quotas are auctioned or placed by tender or private sale, under the Bill they are negotiable and could be bought by one exporter. If they finish up in the hands of one exporter, that exporter will dictate what he will pay to the farmer. Do not let anyone tell me any different. He will strike the price. There will be no intermediary to say whether or not it is a fair price. What is more, when quotas are sold, whatever price an exporter pays for a quota will be deducted from the amount paid to the farmer. Let no one tell me that is not correct, either. In every case where there is an intermediate stage in delivering agricultural goods overseas-this probably applies to other industries as well-the producer of those goods or livestock pays the price. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure will also penalise the operator whose infrastructure is already set up, who has already done the research. It will penalise those who have already carried out negotiations with the Middle East. A new quota holder can come along and make use of all that infrastructure, research and negotiations; he can simply pick it up and not bear any of the cost. In fact, that new quota holder might not even be welcomed in the Middle East. I understand that not all carriers and exporters of live sheep are welcomed over there. </PARA>
<PARA> The AMLC claims that it will be returning to the industry what payments it receives from the quota sales. The only thing it has forgotten to tell us is how it will be returned to the industry. How will it be done? Will it be on a per contract basis? If one farmer sells X number of live sheep to the exporter, will the Corporation reimburse that farmer? Remember that I have already told the Senate that the farmers will be paying a price in the lesser amount they will be getting for their stock to pay for the quota. Will that money be returned to them? No one has told us that. Will money be returned to the industry on a general basis; in other words, will funds be recycled like they are in the wheat industry, as I believe will occur with the wool industry levy? We do not know what will happen. Will it be wasted in general administration, in a way that we see again and again it is wasted in statutory bodies? My fears are that that is exactly what will happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Why does this Bill have to include meat? If live sheep exports are the problem, and we need to get quotas for that, why have in the Bill meat already slaughtered in Australia? I cannot see the reason. With the overproduction of sheep at present, the idea is to find more and more markets for our stock, either as live shipments or as meat. So why have a quota on meat as well? It is ridiculous. The Bill also designates the class of meat, the type of meat or whatever. I believe it is a scattergun approach to overcome one problem. It is putting in regulations that may or may not be needed in future, and I know that they are not needed at the moment. Why put them in if they might be needed only in years to come? I believe that the AMLC and its views on this should come back to the Parliament for scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendments have been spelled out by Senator Tambling, and I believe we should restrict the Bill to quotas on live sheep-if we have to have quotas at all. There should also be a sunset clause under which all these provisions will be brought back to the drawing board in three years time. This solution is a short-sighted way of going about the problem in the Middle East. It should have been sorted out in other ways before today, for the reasons I have already stated, and having a three-year sunset clause will provide a longer term approach. In three years time we can debate the matter again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In dealing with the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill 1990 and the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Bill 1990, I will not go over the same ground as Senator Tambling and explain our position and the reasons for our amendments, but I would like to make some comments on the Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will begin by outlining how important the live sheep trade has been to Australia in recent years. It has already been mentioned that up to seven million sheep have been exported in recent years. I emphasise that up to five million sheep have come from Western Australia, which has been a very important part of the live sheep industry. </PARA>
<PARA> A point that I would like to pick up here-this point was mentioned by Senator Bell when he questioned having a live sheep export industry at all-is that to destroy the live sheep export industry would be economic and trade suicide. It is not in the best interests of our processing industry and our live sheep industry to talk about phasing some of it out. If we took that action, we would be opening up the live sheep trade to the dumping of subsidised European products, particularly beef, into those markets. We need to recognise that this trade is one of customer preference and has been for generations. When the hurdles in front of us now are overcome, I believe that will continue. In my view it is quite ludicrous for Australians to suggest that we should phase out this aspect of our industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that has been so important about the live sheep trade is that it has been the base on which the whole price structure of the sheep flock has been determined for many years. As such, when we have a thriving live sheep trade, we find that this flows through; mutton prices are significantly better and there is a very notable increase in the returns to the producer on the commercial sale of wool producing sheep, including our fat lamb industry. As we all know, at the end of the day the producer has to make a profit, otherwise he goes out of business. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Australian marketing authorities, and the present Government in particular, have a real attitudinal problem with quotas. We are not putting enough emphasis on getting out and selling our product, marketing and sorting out the problems that we have. To highlight this situation, I cite as an example the very beneficial impact on the wool industry since the trip made by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), which related mainly to the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has had the opportunity for a number of years to play a much more positive role with the problems in the Middle East-not just in Saudi Arabia-with countries such as Libya, Iran, Egypt and others. Whether we like it or not, those countries deal not only on a government to government basis, but they also deal at the top of the hierarchy of their governments. They think it is an insult when we send over trade delegations or people who are not at the top echelon of our government at the time. While we will be moving amendments in the Committee state of the debate, I have great reservations about the attitudinal problems in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area in which we have been negligent in the live sheep industry is setting up trading arrangements with these countries for our various products. We should take imports from those countries to offset that trade. A classic example of this was the problem we had in the very early days when our sheep were rejected. I hope that those on the other side of the chamber are listening carefully to what I have to say. At that time, dumping action was taken against clinker being imported into this country. It had been purchased from the Saudi Arabian operation, which was owned by the royal family. They took that as a real insult. Of course, the dumping action was not sustained but it took some nine months to sort it out. In the meantime ships were tied off the Australian coast. If we are going to deal with these countries, we have to get our act sorted out as well as requesting them to get their act sorted out. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole issue of how we handle quotas also creates an enormous number of other problems. Senator Panizza has briefly touched on the issue of equity, in terms of how one gets the price back to the producer and the impact that will have. Unfortunately today we do not have sufficient time to go into all the aspects. Once one starts introducing restrictions or regulations and interfering with the ability of the market to operate, it creates situations which discriminate against some producers, some exporters, and favour others. </PARA>
<PARA> I spoke earlier about the problem we have with quotas in the wool industry and how to get equity between States in terms of their production and sales over the years and the restrictions that are now being put in place. As a Western Australian senator, I believe it will be very difficult for Western Australian producers to get equity for the contribution they have made to the industry over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> What will the criteria be for the selection of various exporters on this whole issue? Will the emphasis be put on whether or not they will be returning the best return to the producers? Will the emphasis be put on whether or not they have a particular type of ship in which the sheep will be freighted? What will the general arrangements be for the live sheep trade?</PARA>
<PARA> Another question on the quota arrangement is: will it favour some of the exporters or the shippers who operate out of the major ports-for example, Fremantle-and give them an advantage over those who have operated out of some of the coastal ports around the country?</PARA>
<PARA> When we start talking about quotas and we get involved in this type of restrictive activity-and I understand the problems that we have with that-it creates all sorts of distribution problems in terms of the practical application. From what I have seen and read on this matter, I do not believe that these problems have really been addressed. We can look at an idea on a piece of paper, write it down and decide that it is a good idea to have quotas, but it goes a lot further and deeper than that. </PARA>
<PARA> In my remaining minute, I will summarise what I said at the start. In my view, phasing out the live sheep trade can only be described as stupidity. It would be handing what have been traditional Australian markets to the subsidised products from the European Community. It would not benefit Australia, the producers or the exporters involved in the pipeline. </PARA>
<PARA> I re-emphasise the attitudinal problem we have in terms of marketing. One can look at a broad range of industries. It is very important that we become a lot more dynamic in our attitude to marketing, apply a little lateral thinking, and go to the highest level of government to sort out our problems. I think that the Libyan market could be sorted out without much difficulty. The rationale behind that does not make sense to me. I will reserve my comments on plant variety rights to the committee stage of the Bills when the amendments are moved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak to this legislation, I note several things about it. Firstly, the legislation is specifically directed at the live sheep trade and not at any other aspect. Secondly, the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) is not involved in any other aspect of international trade and it already has powers through its licensing authority to regulate exports of live sheep, yet it is being given additional powers. Past rejections by Saudi Arabia of Australian live sheep, dating from July 1989, seem to form the basis of concern. Since then, there has been a lot of careful negotiation by Australian exporters to re-establish the trade. Frankly, this is now threatened by the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government did not consult with peak bodies involved in the trade, such as the Australian Livestock Exporters Association, about the legislation. The legislation gives an extension of general export power to the AMLC when it really only intends to use it in relation to sheep and is specifically, as I said, directed at trade with Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is not proposing to introduce import quotas. It is interesting that there has been no meeting with the responsible Saudi Arabian Minister. The Government seems to have failed over a continuing period of time, that is, during the seven years it has been in power, to keep up the excellent relationship that was established with Saudi Arabia during the last coalition Government, particularly when Mr Anthony was the responsible Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is contrary to the spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. We have seen the Government preside over a decline in the share of export of sheep and sheep meat, largely to the benefit of New Zealand. It is important to note that this is another example of the poor relationship that now exists between this Government and Saudi Arabia which has resulted in a decline in our sheep trade. </PARA>
<PARA> I have recently been provided with a copy of correspondence between the Australian Livestock Exporters Association (ALEA), the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). Due to the guillotine being in place and the short time frame imposed upon this debate, I will refrain from reading the letters in full. I seek leave to table the letters. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The quotes that I propose to read from those letters show how poorly this legislation has been considered and it shows that most thinking and sensible people simply do not want it. The Director of the Australian Livestock Exporters Association, Mr R.G. Levy, wrote to the Chairman of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, Mr Austen, on 16 November 1990, and stated as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>ALEA totally reject the need for quota selling/tendering of allocation-</PARA>
<PARA>in the live sheep export trade with Saudi Arabia-</PARA>
<PARA>and seek an assurance from AMLC to take immediate steps to have this part of the legislation withdrawn. ALEA find the proposed legislation quite unnecessary, a perceived insult to our Saudi trading partners and an unacceptable intrusion into the commercial arena. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . will cause an even greater disruption to the trade that is occurring now. </PARA>
<PARA>In a letter dated 16 November 1990 to Mr Austen of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, Mr Trivett, the Chairman of the ALEA, writes, he says, `with a sense of urgency'-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> Regardless of what any of us in Australia may think about the necessity of such legislation, the facts are that the Saudis see all the paperwork as evidence of a scheme aimed at forcing their market to pay $100 million p.a. extra for livesheep. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Trivett urged Mr Austen-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in the strongest possible terms, to amend that request to exclude quota entitlement selling powers. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Trivett wrote to Minister Kerin on 16 November 1990 and said that he was writing about the appalling breakdown in communications. He said-and again I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>We say appalling, because there is no other description appropriate, given the situation that we now all are confronted with. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The action taken to place this amending legislation before the Parliament was first signalled to this Association late on Monday 12th November and then by a party who was concerned to learn our views and position. It would seem that neither the Government nor the AMLC were concerned as we have no advice of the content of the impending legislation. Despite there being a mechanism for consultation that permits ALEA access to AMLC for such matters no such opportunity was provided to ALEA. </PARA>
<PARA>Very simply, the evidence is that there has been no adequate consultation on this legislation. People in the industry are concerned that the action of the Government is simply going to make their situation worse. Again, I quote from Mr Trivett's letter to Mr Kerin of 16 November:</PARA>
<PARA>We can only see the legislation as presented as naive, unnecessary and likely to be offensive to all countries purchasing meat and livestock from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely this is the action of a government which is tired, a government which is simply no longer in command, a government which is not able to make the correct decisions for the benefit of this nation. We have been told that we are in a recession which this Government has engineered and induced. By the introduction of this legislation, we now seem to be attacking trade. In the words of the people who are on the commercial side of the operation, it is legislation which is designed to torpedo all their own efforts. Mr Trivett goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We must ask why and for what benefit did the collective wisdom of our Government decide to take such action so covertly and so hastily?</PARA>
<PARA>Surely, that is an indictment of this Government. Does this really sound like a government that knows what it is doing?  In a note of sadness, in the final part of his long letter to the Minister, Mr Trivett says:</PARA>
<PARA> Given the extreme difficulties endured by us all during the past 16 months it would be reasonable to assume any action as significant as these changes would demand the fullest discussion in an official forum. There was no such opportunity provided by AMLC/DPIE or yourself which is surprising as you are renowned for your concern to ensure that access and discussion opportunities are provided to involved parties. </PARA>
<PARA>Even a Minister who has enjoyed some regard for his ability is now seen to be letting the country down. We now have a situation where the Government, instead of helping Australian exporters develop their markets, is intent on sabotaging those markets. This Government admits that it engineered this recession, the one that we had to have, and is forcing people out of jobs; they cannot even negotiate with their own employers to be allowed to stay on because of union power. Is this the same Government that now wishes to torpedo this aspect of our international trade? If the Australian exporters do not want this legislation and the importing nations do not want it, who on earth does want it? No doubt next year we will be back here debating more amendments to rectify the damage that this legislation will do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating cognately three Bills: the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Bill, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill and the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill. Senator Tambling, supported by Senators Bishop, Panizza and Crane, has put the position for the Opposition. I talk on these Bills as they affect statutory marketing authorities. All of these Bills cover statutory marketing authorities which have come under a fairly severe attack during the last week-and I believe that they do need some defence in this Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the Industry Commission (IC) report, which came out last Friday, treated statutory marketing authorities less than fairly. The report said that statutory marketing authorities were responsible for a transfer of 0.03 per cent to consumers from farmers. Those who compiled the report believe that that cost which will be added to the cost to the consumers will be around $550m. As we face tremendous problems in the horticultural industry, I believe that we need to address what that $550m represents. The authors of the report have arrived at this figure of $550m, or 0.03 per cent, by taking world parity pricing and then working out the difference between that and the cost of products in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, I do not have to tell you of the hardships being experienced by people who produce horticultural products in rural Australia. As a resident of Kingaroy, you will be aware of the hardships being experienced by producers of horticultural produce in rural Australia and the agony that peanut producers and navy bean producers are experiencing, just to name a few. We are facing in this country a flood of imported products coming in under subsidies which are, to a large degree, although not all the time, being dumped or countervailed. Unless farmers have some defence against these products flooding into this country, then the figure of $2.134 billion will increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The IC, as it is now called, is taking no notice of that problem facing all Australians. That is why I say to Senator Cook that we are finding SPC Ltd in diabolical trouble. One of the reasons it is in trouble is that it is facing subsidised and dumped imported products coming into this nation. That is why some action has to be taken. The statutory marketing authorities are a defence against that dumping, but the IC has never recognised that. The IC is saying that it is costing Australia $550m to have statutory marketing authorities marketing and selling Australian products for the farmer. </PARA>
<PARA> I include in my contribution some figures that I received from the Department of the Parliamentary Library today. Between 1960 and 1990, the consumer price index (CPI) increased 637.6 per cent and total products, excluding agriculture, increased 755.1 per cent. The prices received at the farm gate only increased by 348.1 per cent. So, in real terms, the farmers are receiving half of what the normal wage earner has received in the last 30 years. The normal wage earner's wages and standard of living have increased by 637 per cent while the farmer has found that prices have only gone up by an amount that equals about half of that. That is why we cannot consider this issue just in automatic terms, as the Industry Commission has done. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Commission is suggesting that, if we just work on a completely flat playing field and import all our horticultural and rural products, we will save Australia $550m. That is very small thinking, and is not correct thinking, because it does not take into consideration the amount of imports that are flooding into this country. It does not take into consideration the increase of 348.1 per cent as against the 637 per cent CPI increase. So I say to the commissioners in the Industry Commission that they are not being realistic when they put reports out like this. I suggest to them that they go and walk around the marketplace and have a look at the imported products that are on the shelves of the supermarkets. To some extent, the report denigrates statutory marketing authorities, but certainly does not offer any other alternative. I do not see it of any use for a report to come out and say that statutory marketing authorities increase the cost of products. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also makes the point that farmers are forced into statutory marketing authorities by coercion-and that is not true. By a referendum at any time, by a majority decision, statutory marketing authorities can be abolished by the people they represent. Only two years ago in Queensland, the cotton farmers decided that a free market suited their needs best and they closed down the statutory marketing authority, and everything has gone very well for them. In fact, they are probably one of only a few of the primary industry groups that are showing increases at the moment. Of course, free markets are great on the way up. But on the way down sometimes one does need some assistance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an inane comment from Senator Cook. Those sort of flippant remarks do not get him anywhere, particularly when he is now faced with 300 unionists looking down the barrel at losing their jobs. I would have thought that Senator Cook would have been able to come up with a better argument than that type of flippant remark. It is a throw-away line in the Australian Labor Party. It certainly does not get the rural producers and primary industry anywhere; and it certainly does not retain the jobs of the people working in the processing factories whom Senator Cook represents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point that I believe the IC report was derelict in not bringing up is that, at present, three grocery chains control 70 per cent of the domestic grocery market in Australia. Those chains have tremendous market domination that can be used to suppress prices and increase costs to producers. Again, statutory marketing authorities are the only defence that rural and primary industry people do have against such market dominated forces. I agreed today to limit my contribution to 10 minutes. That time is now up and I thank Senator Tambling for allowing me the 10 minutes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, without disrupting the debate, I seek to address the Senate for about two minutes. According to the shadow Minister, we are a minute or two ahead of schedule. I wish to touch briefly on the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Bill 1990 and say that I find it absolutely without any merit at all. I can see absolutely no justification for it. The Bill is put to us because, as a result of difficulties in the Middle East, although there are present residual powers available to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, it now requires particular and definitive powers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason for this is not completely clear to me. However, if it is suggested in some quaint, cute way that this will improve prices, it will be the first time that introducing discretionary quotas has improved the prices received by Australian growers for any product. One can provide figures subjectively on the basis of prices where quotas have been used, but fundamentally there is no economic or logical reason for arguing that because an authority is given a power to allocate quotas it will enhance one's prospects in a market or improve one's prices. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it being put to me that the power is required because there have been some-and I do not deny it-irresponsible shippers or growers who have done a disservice to themselves and the industry generally? If it is being put to me that quotas are required to control health considerations, let us understand that. However, quotas are not required to guarantee that. I have read but superficially the debate that has taken place in the media with a past Prime Minister of this great nation of ours who said that we could immunise against scabby mouth. It has been argued to the contrary, and I do not have sufficient knowledge to know which view is correct. I would have thought that it would be a monumental task. We all recognise that scabby mouth is particularly contagious. If it not detected beforehand, once a ship is at sea there is no prospect, in such a confined environment, of quarantining any section of the ship. That is why a great deal of care and concern ought to be taken from the outset. </PARA>
<PARA> Scabby mouth does not affect the flavour of the meat, but it does influence the aesthetic virtue of the stock. If I were buying a shipper to kill and put in the fridge and it was covered in scabby mouth, given my sensitivity in these things, I might be offended. However, this legislation will not change that. We can deal with the health problems by more diligence and vigilance by the appropriate authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also fair-and I hope not unkind-to say that some shippers and growers have exported sheep which have been past the age limit set down by the Saudis. I do not know whether they thought they were all too clever and could slide a few in and the Saudis would not be bright enough to know the difference or whether they thought that not too much notice would be taken when the sheep reached their destination and it was just a nominal figure or gesture. Whatever the reason, they made a grave mistake. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not insensitive to say in this place that there are some politics going on in the Saudi royal family which have caused some problems with our shipments. But that is only part of it. One plunges oneself into the darkness of ignorance if one assumes that that is our only problem with our exports to the Middle East. This occurs at a crucial time because the market into Kuwait and other parts of the Middle East is closing down. I do not have the figures with me, but I believe the number has gone down from about seven million to two million: there has been a dramatic reduction. It is terribly important that our exports are accepted once they reach their destination. In many respects that will occur if there is proper diligence and supervision of the exporters and, in my view, this will not be enhanced by the prospect of quotas. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to prices. It is argued in Australia from time to time that when we compete with the rest of the world in a free trade situation we will somehow enhance our market if we have one muscle man competing with overseas buyers. I find it passing strange that that proposition is not put even by this Government in respect of iron ore, uranium, bauxite, coal, woodchips or natural gas. </PARA>

Nobody with any substantial respect argues that the iron ore companies have to come together collectively and do a deal with the Japanese to get a fair break. Nobody argues that the coal companies have to go together, holding hands, hoping desperately that they will not become unclasped in their negotiations with the Japanese. We do not require quotas for that; and nor do we need a statutory authority telling us who will sell what to whom and for how much. But, suddenly, when we deal with agriculture, things have to be different: irrespective of whether it is wool, wheat or sheep-whatever the cereal crop is-we suddenly need statutory authorities, arbitrary parliamentary control, quotas, restrictions, supervision: all those things that shackle the virility of the free market process and the free market system. Basically and philosophically, nobody outside the rural sector would argue with that. I do not know whether it is because of the insecurity that comes with this country's youth or some other inferiority complex that comes from spending too much time close to the land.</PARA></TALK.START>

I would not want to draw any comparisons, but let us look at what has happened to the Australian Wool Corporation recently. The price of wool was up at 870c and the world was barking. The growers were over the moon. If we think the Corporation is a genius and that is the way we should go-that is the sort of structure we need-we have not learnt much in the last 12 months. I hope that we will allow free trade within the normal sensible parameters, taking health matters into consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Senator Bell from the Australian Democrats indicated that he will move an amendment, which the Government will not accept because it would have the effect of closing off some options in this trade. The Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation has set rigorous conditions for livestock exports. Unfortunately, many Middle Eastern markets prefer live sheep to mutton and any move to limit live sheep exports would not help in the current circumstances. The Government will not accept that amendment. Senator Tambling from the coalition will move in the committee stage some other amendments which the Government will accept. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to reply to much in the debate, except to say that when I came into the chamber Senator Bishop was making some uncomplimentary remarks about the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. That body is appointed on the recommendation of its peer group; it is not appointed by political patronage. I should indicate for the record that Senator Boswell, the Leader of the National Party of Australia in this chamber, nodded his head in the affirmative when I made my first observation on peer group approval for the appointment of this body. The Australia Meat and Live-stock Corporation represents producers and exporters of livestock and meat. It also comprises people with industrial relations, promotional and finance capability, and it is a body which is respected in the wider sweep of the rural community. Against those credentials, criticisms have been put by meat traders, such as Mr Trippett, who represent the middleman, that is, not the producers but the agents who sell the livestock. I think this is a classic case of a vested interest speaking for itself against a group composed of the wider community representing the public interest. In those circumstances, I do not think the record should go unanswered on the basis of this chamber now rejecting the criticisms made by Senator Bishop. </PARA>
<PARA> My final comment is about a remark made by Senator Boswell. Of course, the Industry Commission (IC) makes reports and does so fearlessly according to its lights and to the need to examine rationally within an economic framework what is to be done. Those reports advise the Government and are not binding upon it. They provide an opportunity to promote informed and intelligent debate on those issues. That is not to say that the Government accepts them or every element of them; nonetheless, it is a contribution to the debate process. Any implication that the Government would necessarily pick up all the recommendations of an IC report should be seen in that light. I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate. Although in opposition to the Government, most of the remarks have been helpful. I commend the Bills to the chamber. </PARA>

For the sake of consistency I think the Government would be well advised to accept this amendment. This clause of the Bill talks about the characteristics of a person who will be required to sit on a committee to advise on nominations. It is a couple of steps removed from the formulation of Government policy.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am replying to the debate thus far and indicating why the Government accepts the amendments. The original request for this legislation came from the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (AMLC) which believed that these powers were necessary to aid it in its mission to promote, control, protect and further the interests of the industry in relation to the export of meat and livestock. As a result of pressure from industry, the AMLC has backed away from its original position of wanting the power to set and sell quotas for all products covered by it. It has now accepted that these powers should be extended to live sheep only.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Corporation believes that to proceed with the Bills in their present form without these amendments being put through may have an impact on the chances of putting any controls in place for livestock exports to Saudi Arabia, which is the immediate priority. The amendments that the Government is accepting here this afternoon-that is, all of the amendments that the Government is accepting-should restrict the ability of the AMLC to establish quota systems. Clause 4 (b) states:</PARA>
<PARA>where, in relation to live sheep and lambs, the Corporation otherwise considers it in the best interests of the industry to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 6 (2) restricts the ability of the AMLC to allocate quota by auction, sale by tender or private sale of live sheep. Under clause 7 the Corporation is not obliged to grant quotas to live sheep. I am not sure whether that explanation answers Senator Panizza's specific question. If it does not, then perhaps he can reframe his question and I will make an effort to answer it for him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not fully briefed on the point of the question raised by Senator Panizza. However, the officers of the Department present confirm that there had been consultations about this amendment. With regard to Senator Panizza's question of interpretation, I have a note in front of me which may answer his question. Firstly, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (AMLC) will only set quotas where market conditions require it to do so. Secondly, genetic material is not intended to be restricted by the AMLC. As I understood it, Senator Panizza asked what sorts of lambs can be exported under this legislation. I need some guidance, but I will answer the question as I see it. The matter is defined in the broader sense of the meaning of the word `lambs'. Any subdefinition is not necessary; it is all-embracing. I have just received a nod from my advisers, so I must have explained it correctly.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> ``(1a) The corporation may, by notice in writing given to licensees, prohibit the export of live animals.''. </PARA>
<PARA>As the legislation has already reached the stage where it refers only to live sheep, this would obviously give the Corporation the capacity to prohibit the export of live sheep. However, Senator Crane made the strange observation that if live sheep were not exported and the trade was not able to be continued, then the sheep would be substituted for processed beef from Europe. If that is the case, we would welcome such a situation as it would enable Australia to join in the export market of processed meat. This contradicts the assertions made by other speakers that in fact it was a matter of consumer choice in the Arabian countries to which our live sheep exports had been targeted and supports the contention that the Australian Democrats have had for some time that it is nothing to do with consumer taste, but more to do with manipulation of the market. The jobs which could be generated in Australia through the packaging of meat processed in our factories would be greatly to Australia's advantage. The contradictions that have been made in the argument so far support the Australian Democrats' amendment. </PARA>

I did not go into a lot of detail because our debating time was cut short. I would like to make a couple of points about the export of live sheep. Firstly, if exports were restricted, customers would go elsewhere to other countries. Secondly, if live sheep could not be supplied, those customers would seek another product. We would not be able to compete with such subsidised products. In this context, I use the European Community as an example, although it does not apply just to that body.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>In light of the story on the front page of this morning's Sydney Morning Herald it seemed important to the Committee to bring the tabling of this report ahead by a day. We felt that there was a need to get an accurate report into the Senate, where it properly belongs and to where it should first come. Discussion on this report should be based on fact. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a few brief comments. First, I acknowledge that this report is unanimous. I thank my colleagues for their consideration of the content of what I think is a very significant report on health. The membership of the Committee changed due to a change in the membership of this place on 30 June. Curiously, on both committees we had the assistance of four doctors. During the second half of the inquiry we had the assistance of one triple-certificated sister and one mere mortal-one ordinary human-to keep us honest. I think in some ways the Committee has been assisted by the knowledge and background of its members. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee in its unanimous report appreciated that the issues for discussion and debate are very significant, particularly at this time of debate in the community about health and the costs of health. We have, we hope, set an agenda for debate about health which we trust will involve the community very extensively. In days of rising health costs and restrictions on the amount of money that governments wish to spend on health, there is no doubt that a very significant community debate has to take place about the allocation of resources and the setting of priorities in respect of those resources. There also needs to be debate about what the community is prepared to pay for in the health arena. The Committee, in its report, has raised that as a very important issue. It has chosen to refer to these matters in the opening chapter of its report before deliberating specifically on its terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that the national health strategy inquiry currently under way, known colloquially as the Macklin inquiry, will take up the issues raised in this report. Indeed, the report recommends that it does in respect of some specific items. I have no doubt that Senator Peter Baume, in his future endeavours, will also want to address these matters. The Committee was asked to look at Medicare, the costs of hospitals, both private and public, and health insurance. The principal recommendations go to the area of health insurance.

<PARA> After clause 10, page 5, insert the following Part:</PARA>
<PARA> ``Part 2a-AMENDMENT OF THE DISABILITY SERVICES ACT 1986</PARA>
<PARA>Principal Act</PARA>
<PARA> ``10a. In this Part, `Principal Act' means the Disability Services Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>Interpretation</PARA>
<PARA> ``10b. Section 7 of the principal Act is amended in the definition of `accommodation support services' by adding at the end `and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes attendant care services, namely, services to persons with disabilities to assist them with personal administration, transport, mobility, transfers, personal hygiene, bathing, grooming, dressing, eating and drinking, and similar personal activities'.''. </PARA>
<PARA> After Note 1 at the end of the Bill insert the following Note:</PARA>
<PARA> ``1a. No. 129, 1986, as amended. For previous amendments, see Nos. 80 and 99, 1988.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Disability Services Act 1986 contains within part 2, section 9 (2) the kinds of services that may be funded under that Act. Nine service types are currently included in definitions of those service types. They are included in section 7 of that part of the Act. The service type `accommodation support services' is defined there as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Services to assist persons with disabilities to develop or maintain suitable residential arrangements in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst this definition encompasses everything that we would currently support in that area, the definition of `residential arrangements' has been at times misunderstood. The amendment proposed today will assist in clarifying the intentions of that service type. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986, the nursing homes and hostels review heard from many people with physical disabilities who were permanent residents of nursing homes and who expressed a clear preference to live back in the community. The only barrier to this appeared to be the absence of community based care or modified accommodation. The Government responded by establishing the national attendant care scheme in the 1986-87 Budget. Eligible applicants for the national attendant care scheme are aged between 16 and 64 years, are permanent residents of a nursing home or have used respite care in a nursing home for more than 130 days in the past year, or occupy a nursing home classified bed in a public hospital with little chance of returning home without support. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme fosters maximum self-direction via the consumer who selects the service agency that will employ his or her personal care attendants and directs those attendants on a day to day basis. I do not know that any of this is relevant, but I conclude by saying that attendant care provides services that assist persons with a disability with their personal administration, transport, mobility, with their personal hygiene, dressing, eating, drinking, and with every aspect of their lives. This is no more or less than that which was envisaged in the definition within the Act for `accommodation support services'. This similarity was obviously realised by the review working party. However, it is now clear that some groups still mistakenly believe that the attendant care model of services is not possible under the Act and have narrowly interpreted accommodation support as congregate care grouped homes. While this is patently incorrect, this Government does not wish possible confusion to discourage people with disabilities from being supported to live in the community, in the setting they choose, and in the way that they choose.</PARA>
<PARA> The amendment moved here today will make it clear to all concerned that the Government is genuinely interested in individuals and in individual solutions to their difficulties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have a series of amendments which we will be moving later on. One of those amendments covers a particular area of the amendment that Senator Tate has moved. I want to express my concern that Mr Braithwaite, in his private member's Bill, signalled the need for this amendment. People who are involved with people with disabilities, and people with disabilities themselves, have been asking for this issue to be addressed. It seems regrettable to me that the Government would bring into the chamber, at this late stage, an amendment which I have not had time to discuss with Mr Braithwaite. The Australian Democrats and I were discussing the amendment that they were going to circulate and the amendment that I have circulated. Now we have an amendment brought in at the eleventh hour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is typical of this Government, of the way it deals with legislation and with us, that we have this amendment before us which I think I received this morning, when the matter has been on the agenda for at least a year. Mr Braithwaite addressed this issue a year ago in a draft Bill that he put down for discussion. The Opposition has its own amendment and it will be putting that forward. It is up to the Democrats which one they will support, but I guess they will support the Government, despite the conversations we have had over a long period of time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to go back about two weeks to our initial discussions on this matter, with the Liberal Party of Australia and also with the Government. The reason we asked that this whole issue be discussed now was in response to the review of the national attendant care scheme which has been in the possession of all honourable senators for quite some time. We were very pleased to note that the Liberals' concern matched ours, and we therefore proceeded to draw up an amendment, one that the Liberals took on board and included in a package. I acknowledge the input from Mr Braithwaite who also has been concerned about this issue for some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, further and very late discussions with the Government-I apologise to Senator Patterson; I attempted to get in touch with her office; I understand that the message, as we made this decision about half an hour ago, has only just got through-showed its continuing concern that our amendment, and the amendments that the Liberal Party has taken on, do leave a very important gap, that is, the provision of services by people with disabilities themselves for people with disabilities. Therefore, we have taken on board the concerns of the Department, in particular. We will be supporting this amendment as the Government amendment and our amendment are the same. </PARA>
<PARA> It brings attendant care services within the Disability Services Act 1986. We note that the Government has been promising for quite some time to do that. We have been contacted today by quite a number of disability services groups in support of what is now occurring. All of them expressed their concerns that additional recommendations included in this review will now be taken on board with the same initiatives that are now being taken with this particular amendment. I believe it sets out very clearly that such services are part of the scope of the Act and are to be considered as eligible well beyond the time of this Government-indeed, into future governments. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not take up the Committee's time for a long discussion now of the merits of attendant care. I simply quote from recommendation No. 3 of the relevant report, which states that an attendant care scheme be established as an accommodation support service under the Disability Services Act 1986. So it will continue to receive a separate funding allocation. The Democrats set out to do that some weeks ago when we took it on board to move an amendment to the Bill that is now before us. </PARA>

<PARA>The amendments to the Disability Services Act (DSA) which I have circulated were contained in a private member's Bill presented to the House of Representatives in November by the shadow Minister for community services and aged care, Mr Ray Braithwaite. A year before that, in November 1989, Mr Braithwaite laid before the Parliament a draft Bill suggesting amendments to the Disability Services Act 1986. In his introductory speech, he said that that draft Bill was essentially a discussion paper and that he hoped it would provoke comments, suggestions and discussions from people with disability, their parents, relatives, carers, governments- in fact all those concerned with, and for, people with disability. The response to this initiative was gratifying. Mr Braithwaite received over 400 telephone calls and submissions, and he addressed interest groups in all the mainland States. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Disability Services Act, which I have circulated, were contained in a private member's Bill presented to the House of Representatives in November. Following that presentation and those consultations, Mr Braithwaite presented further papers and further discussion ensued. We worked together on developing these amendments so that they would be in line with and address some of the concerns that have been expressed around the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The tabling in Parliament of principles, objectives and guidelines, which is one of the issues addressed in Mr Braithwaite's amendments and in the amendments I am circulating here, should be subjected to and available for amendment, if necessary, and approval. In the second reading speech of Senator Grimes, the then Minister for Community Services, during the debate on the Disability Services Act in 1986, he said that these principles, objectives and guidelines would be tabled. Four years later, not one of them has been laid before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Bringing these principles, objectives and guidelines before the Parliament will provide greater assurance of adequate opportunity for proper debate on such vital matters which could alter the thrust of the Act or its implementation. Using the affirmative resolution mechanism of requiring Parliament to approve rather than disallow, as is the case with most regulations tabled, provides an opportunity for proper consultation, public participation, input, criticism and awareness; and then debate, amendment if necessary, and final approval by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats supported this mechanism in connection with the charter and agreement on residents' rights and responsibilities in nursing homes and hostels. I had hoped that we would have their support on this amendment, but it seems from my discussions with them that that will not be the case. We have seen, as I am sure the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, will acknowledge, cooperation between all parties on those residents' rights and agreements. I believe we could have seen similar cooperation if we had been able to bring those principles, objectives and guidelines under the Disability Services Act into this Parliament for discussion and debate. Had that been done, we believe that this would have had the effect of curtailing any proliferation by the Department of Community Services and Health of supposed guidelines which have now created uncertainty, rigidity and confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments provide for three new service types to be provided under section 9 of the Act: firstly, attendant care services, signalled by Mr Braithwaite for some considerable time-and we have now got the Government responding to one of its Budget initiatives at this very late hour. The other two are staff training services and vocational training services. The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) said that attendant care services will be brought under the legislative coverage of the DSA. Although we have been waiting for this service type, the Minister did not act until we pushed him with these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition is committed to the improvement of the quality of life for all Australians who have a disability, and we believe that, wherever possible, this should be achieved by providing services which are within the mainstream of the community. However, we are opposed to ideology overtaking commonsense, and hence we support the provision of specialist services where such services are obviously appropriate to the needs and free choice of the client group and valued both by that client group and the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA> We make no apology for the fact that we support the continuation of the best of existing nursing homes and hostels, sheltered workshops and activity therapy centres, where such services provide the best practicable lifestyle for particular clients. We all know that a number of services were in need of changing, and the sector itself has admitted that. But, as I said, we still support the view that there is a purpose and a place for choice, flexibility and diversity. We believe that there should be a happy coexistence of the old and new services beyond 1992, but we acknowledge that, as more and more new services are established and more and more younger clients with different educational experiences, backgrounds, aspirations and expectations seek services, the old services will naturally contract. </PARA>
<PARA> Extension of the transition date of 1992 has become necessary, especially as the Department appears to be admitting that the deadline of 1992 cannot be met. Even the reviews of services cannot be completed by then. The Minister admitted last month that the number of people with a disability employed in the Public Service had decreased. This was an issue I addressed in the Estimates committee, based not on a huge amount of research but on moving around the community, going to sheltered workshops and talking to the service providers about the problems they were facing in getting their clients into open employment. The constant comment that came to me in those consultations was that the service providers were having great difficulty in placing people with disabilities in the Government sector. That came to me over and over again. That view was vindicated when the Minister said that the Public Service was not in fact holding up its end. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government cannot employ people with disabilities and set the example-and we have had an answer today to one of our questions on the Estimates which shows just how many departments are not meeting that requirement, and it is an exorbitant number; over 70 per cent of departments have not increased the number of people with disabilities in their employ-then those people with disabilities will be left in a vacuum, forced there by the haste with which this legislation is being implemented and trapped because the government sector and perhaps private enterprise are not able to meet the demands of that program. </PARA>
<PARA> We propose to extend the deadline to 1995, with the intention that we would still keep pressure on those service providers who can change their services to enable people with a disability to achieve their total fulfilment under the Act. Should the Minister insist that transition must be complete by 1992, then he will be closing, not opening, the door of opportunity offered under the Act to many people with disabilities. Extending the transition date will give some security to parents of children attending sheltered workshops and to those whose children are at special schools. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments provide some degree of predictability in financial assistance and some degree of restriction as to terms and conditions which may be imposed by the Minister in approving the making of a grant of financial assistance. If these amendments are carried, it will no longer be possible for the Department-with or without the sanction of the Minister-to press upon recipients of grants unilateral, harsh or unwarranted terms and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we have proposed an amendment providing for an appeals procedure in order that the decisions of the Minister and his Department may be reviewed. Such a mechanism is included in most other legislation of a similar nature, and we believe that its non-inclusion in the Disability Services Act was an oversight on the part of the then Minister. These amendments are concerned with accountability-part of what the Democrats call `keeping the bastards honest'-and we believe that the adjustments proposed are the amendments that were evidently in the mind of the then Minister, Senator Grimes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a sad reflection on the Government that, despite its knowledge of our intentions for some 12 months, it has not moved to consult with service providers or consumer groups or to amend the Act to provide both departmental and Ministerial accountability. Nor has it addressed the question of whether sufficient funding is available to keep pace with the demand for services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to go through a couple of general points as to why the Australian Democrats at this point in time are not able to support these amendments. Firstly, several of the amendments are covered by an area currently being looked into by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs-that is, the employment of people with disabilities. We believe that to move now on a number of these initiatives is to pre-empt that report. We would like to see that report brought down; it is not too far away now. As a member of that Committee, I can assure honourable senators that we have finished hearing the evidence. There were well over 220 different submissions.

If we need to, we can no doubt come back to these issues next year, when I understand that a number of them will be before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to my third general point: they really are issues that deserve full debate, deliberation and discussion. Unfortunately, as we all know, we have not very much time tonight to do that. Therefore, at this point in time the Democrats will not be supporting the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are a number of concerns. In particular, I will start with the extension of the date. It does seem that the Government will not be able to meet the initial deadline. There seem to be some delays with the review process-that is, with the assessment procedures for the various services. We feel that it is a little early to look at changing this date. As Senator Patterson noted, there are services that need to be changed and need encouragement to change. We believe that to extend the date at this point in time will take the pressure off the very services that we should be keeping the pressure on. </PARA>
<PARA> The new services is one issue that we would specifically like to leave until after the Senate Standing Committee has reported. We understand that the guidelines are already disallowable instruments under the Disability Services Act 1986. We do share concerns that as yet we have not seen any final guidelines and we believe that this is a matter that again should not be dealt with immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the review of decisions is an area that we think needs exploring further. However, this provision, which is virtually a blanket provision, could indeed open up more problems than we are trying to solve. Therefore, at this point in time, this could really open up an avalanche of appeals against decisions not to fund that may not have been fully understood at the time these amendments were put together. While we agree with the Opposition that certainly more needs to be done in this area, we feel at this point in time that we should not support the amendments. We look forward to further discussions at some point down the track. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the Australian Democrats. I congratulate Mr Braithwaite and Senator Patterson for the job that they have done in bringing this matter before the Parliament and seeking to have these amendments adopted by this chamber. As Senator Patterson said, the fact is that the principles which were promised to be formulated and to be incorporated in the legislation by this Government have not materialised. What the Opposition has done is to put the focus on the need for that to be done and indeed to have the Parliament fully involved in that process. I agree entirely with the proposition that is contained in the amendments, particularly amendment 5(4), which indicates:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The principles, objectives or guidelines contained in an instrument under subsection (1) have no force or effect unless and until each House of Parliament has agreed to a motion of which due notice has been given approving those principles . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That will enable us to amend, if required, the principles when they come before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has given another focus to the importance of this society having full regard for those people with disabilities. The test of the civilised nature of any society is how it treats those who have the least and smallest voice in our community. In many cases, those with disabilities and the people who are caring for them are doing their utmost to live with a degree of dignity and security. That takes an enormous effort. Those people make an enormous contribution both to themselves and to society as a whole. It is very important that these sorts of amendments have been put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree that attendant care services and vocational training services should come within the purview of this legislation specifically for the persons for whom they are designed. Whilst I agree with what Senator Lees has said, it is unfortunate that time is not available to debate them in full. I am prepared to give them support at this stage and hope that the Government will do that also. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am dreadfully sorry to disappoint Senator Harradine, but the Government cannot give support to the amendments moved by Senator Patterson on behalf of the Opposition. She ranged over several matters. I will briefly respond to two or three of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, as to the principles, objectives and guidelines formulated by the Minister under the Disability Services Act 1986, it may be that listeners would get the impression that all that happens at the moment is that these principles, guidelines and objectives are simply tabled for the information of senators. Of course it goes much further than that; they are in fact disallowable instruments. There is full opportunity for the Senate, through its various committees, such as the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, to put a particular disallowable instrument under scrutiny in accordance with its criteria. Then as far as this chamber or the House of Representatives is concerned, they are disallowable within 15 sitting days of the tabling of the particular objectives, guidelines or principles. That needs to be emphasised just in case people thought that somehow parliamentary scrutiny was not being undertaken in relation to these most important principles, objectives and guidelines. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Harradine" NAMEID="6H4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator Harradine</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They cannot be amended, though.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a tendency in this chamber over the last couple of years to start bringing regulations which are normally disallowable into the chamber and requiring an affirmative vote of both chambers. This blurring of the distinction between delegated legislation and substantive amendments to the Act is a difficult one which this chamber will have to grapple with. We have little enough time as it is to deal with substantive legislation. To start dealing with regulations as if they were substantial legislation and to require regulations to be voted on affirmatively by both chambers will take more time than certainly we seem to have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walters" NAMEID="UJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator Walters</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is why it should be clarified now.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is clear. I have given a clear statement as to what the position is. It is delegated legislation subject to disallowance. There was also a suggestion that perhaps the transition period end point should be extended from 1992 to 1995. I think what Senator Lees had to say was pertinent, and that is that we should keep it in mind that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) has made his intention clear that where there is a demonstrated willingness to continue to move towards achieving better results, then the particular organisation is in no jeopardy. It can be assured of its ongoing funding support. But if a particular organisation stands still and does not make the sort of adjustments that it is being encouraged to make, quite clearly its funding will be reviewed very carefully in 1992. By that time, some five years will have elapsed and that should be enough time for an organisation, its board of management and so on, to make a firm commitment as required by the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am quite confident that moving the end point of the transition period to 1995 would relieve some of that very necessary pressure for the more recalcitrant agencies, but I would imagine that they are only a minority and that most of these organisations will be able to demonstrate quite readily by the end point of 1992 that they are, as I say, achieving the objectives set out in the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point raised was the idea that decisions to grant financial assistance should be subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) and the administrative decisions judicial review (ADJR) process. Of course they are already subject to review by the ADJR process, so that is already taken care of and there is no need for that part of the amendment. As to review by the AAT, I think in the Scrutiny of Bills Committee or in other committees we have constantly adverted to the point that the Administrative Review Council has made-that where we have a finite pool of funds to be distributed to various persons or agencies or entities and there is an allocation to some rather than others an appeal process to the AAT by a disappointed party is not something which the AAT is really geared to review. The AAT deals normally with discretions exercised by Ministers and so on; it does not deal with the simple allocation between parties who are competing for a finite pool of funds meaning that some are therefore left disappointed. If an appropriation of funds is made by this Parliament and those who are disappointed contest the allocation, those who already have the funds may start expending them in good faith, and how can the AAT then remedy the situation? It is a very difficult situation and not one that really lends itself to the AAT-type review process. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not quite sure whether the indication by Senator Lees of why the Australian Democrats preferred the Government amendment moved and passed by this chamber a moment ago also deals with anything which Senator Patterson has brought forward in the amendments she has before the Committee. If it does, I adopt Senator Lees's reason for rejecting the attendant care amendment put forward by the Opposition in that it was limited to the provision of care by an able-bodied person. The Government amendment in that respect proved to be superior and more attractive to the Democrats and of course to us, and therefore to the Committee. </PARA>

I think that the community of people with disabilities deserves better than that, and I hope that the current Minister redresses that situation as soon as possible. I guess I am not going to be able to convince the Australian Democrats now, but hopefully later on when we move amendments again to this legislation I can convince them, that the subordinate legislation should be able to be amended. I think that there is a case for some legislation to be amended, as we have seen with the agreement on residents rights. That legislation, which was sloppy and appalling, is now in some sort of form that might be acceptable. I hope that the Government and the Democrats will reconsider this, and I hope that we will see the guidelines in due course and will not have to wait another five years for them.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government recognises, as evidenced by its own amendments of some several pages, that the charter is extremely sloppy. Would the Minister consider showing the regulations to the Opposition and the Australian Democrats prior to tabling them and get our okay, so we can tidy them up before they are actually tabled and we do not have to disallow them?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not intend to proceed with this particular amendment. It might be worth while in the couple of minutes before the dinner break explaining why we are not proceeding with it. The situation arose with respect to a particular medical practice which was employing a radiographer. That radiographer was having X-rays interpreted by a radiologist and being paid by the radiologist away from the practice. There was concern expressed by this practice as to whether it would be caught by this clause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that in the Committee Senator Lees requested a paper to be prepared as to whether that medical practice would be caught by this clause. I will read the letter from David Pedler, Acting Assistant General Manager of the Health Benefits Division in this regard. He draws attention to the following words in the clause:</PARA>
<PARA>In applying the legislation to a practical situation the key words within sub-section (c) of section 23dzg are ``without reasonable excuse''. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>It is difficult to provide precise information covering every eventuality . . . as a general statement, however, provided that a medical practice can clearly demonstrate that the requesting of diagnostic imaging services is not tied to a financial reward or benefit for the requester of the service or to the owners/operators of the medical practice then there should be no cause for concern on their part. </PARA>
<PARA>Consequently, it seems that the concerns which were being expressed with respect to that practice are not justified and the practices themselves are not in jeopardy. Therefore, there is no need to proceed with my amendment. </PARA>

<PARA>I will not be moving amendment No. (1), which would have read:</PARA>
<PARA> Heading, at the end add ``IN APPROVED HOSTELS''. </PARA>
<PARA>I will also not be moving amendment No. (18) to clause 72, which would have read:</PARA>
<PARA> Heading, at the end add ``IN APPROVED NURSING HOMES''. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not be moving these amendments because the Government has amended the original charter and has taken those two amendments into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I begin this debate by saying that the Liberal and National parties have always supported the concept of residents rights. But we have a number of concerns about the form of agreement and the charter as they were tabled on 18 September. As I have indicated, this charter differs little from that which was tabled on that day except for the minor amendments that I was going to move but which the Government has now included in the current charter. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot let the opportunity pass without expressing my dismay at the appalling standard of this legislation. The original documents were riddled with inadequacies and grammatical errors. The Government has beaten its chest about the extent of its consultation on the development of the agreement of the charter. I know of the efforts made by the aged care sector because I was present at one of those consultations. Despite the fact that I had some concerns about the way those consultations were carried on, I know that the aged care sector and all the people within that sector-residents, their relatives, providers, staff and others concerned-made a concerted effort to make input across the time that these agreements have been discussed. For them to see the state of this legislation when it came in must have been a real smack in the face. The care that went into their consideration of the legislation was not reflected in the way this legislation appeared in this House. </PARA>
<PARA> That consultative process should have produced first-class legislation to pay respect to the efforts made by the residents and the aged care sector. That was not the case. What we got was sloppy and inadequate. Such were our concerns-we were also concerned that older people in our community should not be victims of sloppy legislation-that Mr Braithwaite wrote to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) expressing concern about the technical drafting of the documents and the substance of the documents. He suggested that it would be in the interests of the Government, the Opposition and the Parliament to discuss the many amendments we believed to be necessary. He stated in his letter:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is our obligation as an Opposition to ensure that legislation is of an acceptable standard, and we believe that to enshrine in legislation the Charter and Agreement in their present form would be of no credit to you, as Minister, or the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the letter addressed to Minister Staples. Mr Braithwaite suggested that representatives in the Minister's office and the Opposition work together with the Attorney-General's office to redraft the charter and the agreement. This offer was rejected by the Minister. Accordingly, the Opposition tabled 76 amendments to the charter and agreement. After much negotiation some of the Opposition's amendments to the agreement have been accepted by the Government and the Australian Democrats but none of our proposed amendments to the charter have found acceptance, except that minor amendment we have seen and spoken about already. </PARA>
<PARA> I must give credit where credit is due. I expressed my concern to Senator Tate and suggested that we might try to get together with the Democrats to discuss these amendments and how we might deal with them. I was of the opinion that we might have an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission revisited event-sitting in this chamber for four days while we patched up the Government's legislation. This plea, unlike Mr Braithwaite's to Mr Staples, did not fall on deaf ears. I would like to put on the public record my appreciation to Senator Tate for making himself available for discussions, the result of which will facilitate the way the amendments will be dealt with today, though not necessarily to our satisfaction because we would have liked a lot more of the amendments agreed to. It shows that when there is goodwill and cooperation the people who benefit are the citizens of Australia who end up with this legislation, which is much less likely to be subjected to unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> I must also express my appreciation to our respective staffs. With Senator Tate's cooperation, Minister Staples's staff have spent hours with our staff and the Democrats' staff. I know I will not be speaking out of order when, on behalf of myself and Mr Braithwaite, I express my gratitude to Mrs Carol Lamb for the part she has played in those negotiations. I know that there will be similar feelings on the part of the Government and the Democrats with regard to the role that their staff have played. This has involved hours and hours of work. To suggest that 200 to 300 hours has been spent on this legislation by the staff, singly not jointly, would not be an exaggeration. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the charter has now been enshrined in the current Bill and we are dealing with the charter at this point, I have some comments to make about the charter in particular. As I said, the charter was tabled on 18 September under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954. It was not even properly entitled; it could have applied to residents of approved nursing homes and of Commonwealth or youth hostels, or tenants generally. Our amendment recognised this deficiency and added to the title `in approved hostels'. When we get to the amendment on nursing homes, the same will apply. </PARA>
<PARA> The drafting of the charter is extraordinarily poor. Our amendments are mainly to correct grammatical errors, to clarify the intentions of the documents and to remove unnecessary duplication. We believe that the charter should be subject to some general limitations and we have added that statement. I find it very difficult to understand why, even if the Democrats could not agree to that amendment, they could not address themselves to the amendments dealing with grammatical errors and other minor matters that need correction. I rest my case there. I ask for the Democrats' support but I doubt whether we will have it. </PARA>

<PARA>These are amendments to clause 9-that is, to the charter. As Senator Patterson thanked her staff a moment ago, I take this opportunity to thank my staff, Jacqui Flitcroft, who has worked tirelessly on this now for months. Without the cooperation of all staff of the Minister, and of the Liberals as well, we would not have got the high quality document we will end up with eventually after proceedings tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government cannot accept further amendments, as are proposed by Senator Patterson, to the charter of residents' rights and responsibilities in approved nursing homes. We believe that, with some minor amendments which will be moved by the Australian Democrats in order to improve the style of the particular charter, it does embody the aspirations which we think are important in regard to the rights and responsibilities of residents in approved nursing homes. For that reason, we maintain that the Committee ought to accept the charter in its present form.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(8.29)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendments moved by Senator Patterson. The reality is that what the Government is proposing will not be effective. Any strategy that treats doctors as the residual pawns in a bureaucratic game will perhaps not provoke the wrath of the doctors but will be ignored by them-which is even worse from the Government's point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is needed is a charter that is acceptable both to the people who run the nursing homes and to the residents, and these amendments do that. Bureaucrats and politicians have no concept of what occurs around the death bed. There is no place at the death bed for politicians, bureaucrats and lawyers; it is for the families and their medical attendants. We need within this Bill something that allows for that charter. </PARA>
<PARA> As an example of that, I am reminded of something that occurred in my clinical experience. A friend of mine was asked to give a patient who was in extremis an intravenous injection. The bureaucratic requirement was that the doctor, not a nurse, had to give the injection. The patient was gasping his last and the doctor gave the injection. As he did so, the patient expired. The doctor was horrified at what had occurred and, as he started to leave, the relatives asked to see him. All sorts of thoughts crossed his mind. Was he covered by medical defence? How was he going to explain it? The senior relative came forward and said, `Doctor, that took a lot of courage'. The point I am making is that what occurs in real life needs to be accommodated, not something that shall be dictated by the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> A private hospital in Queensland once determined that it would decide which person gave anaesthesia in the hospital, much along the lines that the Government is now trying to make a determination in relation to nursing homes. The hospital set a standard which was opposed by the Australian Medical Association. So there was a confrontation between the hospital and the Medical Association. The head of the hospital said, `If you wish, we will convert the hospital into a motel because we are the ones that decide the standards that will be proposed'. It is the same situation here. It does not matter. We cannot control what type of standard will be determined and the amendment proposed by Senator Patterson will give credence to that. I support that amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Dr Herron has made a very interesting contribution but I am not sure that it is in relation to the charter. When one reads the charter in relation to either the hostel or the nursing home, one sees that there is no reference to politicians and only one reference to doctors, where it says that a resident has a responsibility, as far as he or she is able, to inform his or her medical practitioner of the state of his or her health. There is no attempt in the charter to deal with the way in which a doctor might offer a particular treatment or a medical service of any type to a resident. I believe it is very important that that should be the case. Indeed, it forms the basis of much of the argument which we will come to later in relation to the agreement on the claims made by some that a resident's right to a medical practitioner should be curtailed in some way. I would have thought that Senator Herron would be concerned about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that both charters are dealing with the rights and responsibilities of residents and those who provide the nursing home environment for mainly our frail elderly in their declining years. To that extent, we have before us just and humane documents, both of which are important. People in their frail, elderly years ought to have their rights recognised in a nursing home or hostel, as much as in the homes from which they come. </PARA>

<PARA> (30) SIGNING PROVISIONS, omit ``SEALED AND DELIVERED'' where they appear. </PARA>
<PARA>These particular amendments have been the subject of extensive consultation-I understand not with Senator Harradine or the other Independents-but certainly between the Australian Democrats, the Opposition and the Government. On the whole they are to do with tidying up the agreement and serve to clarify the intention of the agreement. I will just enumerate some of those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the agreement sets out the services to be provided by the proprietor to the resident. These services include care and accommodation. It is proposed that subclause 4.1 be amended to further define `care' as `nursing home care'. Clause 4 also makes provision for a schedule which sets out any services, facilities and goods that the proprietor and resident agree shall be provided which are in addition to those the proprietor is required to provide. It is proposed that clause 4.2 be amended to delete reference to a schedule and instead state that a document shall be attached to the agreement which lists the services, facilities and goods ordered by the resident. It is also proposed that subclause 17 (a) (iii) be amended in line with and as a consequence of this amendment to clause 4.2. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5, for example, sets out the conditions under which the proprietor can levy extra charges. It is proposed that a new subclause 5.4 be included which states that any extra services, facilities and goods must be freely requested by the resident without any undue influence from the proprietor. Such extra services might include daily newspapers or hairdressing. Subclause 12.5 sets out the right of the resident to obtain any legal, financial or administrative advice and support that he or she requires. It is proposed that this subclause be amended to add that this advice and support is to be at the resident's own cost. This reflects the existing situation and clarifies that the proprietor does not have to bear this cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 13 sets out the obligations of the resident, including an obligation to respect the rights of a proprietor, staff and other residents within the nursing home. It is proposed that this clause be amended to provide that a resident fulfil these obligations as far as they are capable to ensure that those residents who may be confused or not responsible for their actions are not in breach of the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 21.3 sets out the grounds on which a proprietor may end the agreement, including where the nursing home is no longer able to provide suitable accommodation and care for the resident because of the resident's assessed long term needs. It is proposed that the time in which the resident is to supply the assessment report of her or his practitioner be extended from five to seven days. Subclause 21.3 (g) sets out the circumstances under which the agreement may be ended where a resident has been absent from the nursing home for seven days. It is proposed that this subclause be amended so that the agreement cannot be ended where the resident and proprietor have agreed upon a fee to maintain the resident's place in the nursing home during her or his absence. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other minor drafting changes made to the agreement which tighten up the wording of provisions, but I believe they will not result in any change to the meaning or effect of the provisions; hence, in this bundle of provisions, I believe there is good ground for the agreement that has been reached in consultation prior to the presentation to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have moved a large number of amendments. I will not refer to many of them because the Government has taken them into consideration in its amendments. A number of amendments were submitted by the Opposition and the Democrats and I am pleased to see that the Government has addressed many of them. I think this is an indication of the state the legislation was in when it first came into this place. For instance, in the interpretation the definitions were not in alphabetical order. There were some problems, and Senator Tate has referred to them, with a schedule which, in fact, was a blank sheet of paper on which were to be written the things the resident was asking for-be it the New York Times or some other subscription to a magazine. It was not a schedule but a document to be attached to the agreement. There was no basis for it to be amended from time to time-for example, if a person suddenly was not able to see and did not want to get the New York Times, or thought it was biased in its editorial, or whatever. The way the amendments were thrown together in the end, after all the consultation that had taken place, showed a lack of forethought in planning. We will be supporting the Government's amendments mainly because many of them are ones we suggested.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also support this batch of amendments moved by the Government. The amendments come to us after extensive consultation and discussion. It is probably a first that such a large batch of amendments has been agreed to by all three parties. Again, I pay tribute to the staff who have worked so hard on this. I emphasise the very strong support of the Democrats for the charter and the agreement. It is very unfortunate but true that there is a need for it. I refer to a recent report entitled No Innocent Bystanders: a study of abuse of older people in our community, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Care of older people is generally regarded as being at the bottom of the list by many people and the industry has had difficulty in establishing a well-trained workforce with a lower turnover level. The need to address this and other structural issues affecting carers is fundamental to increasing the quality of care and reducing the vulnerability of residents to abuse. </PARA>

In my tiredness, and due to the fact that we are dealing with a quite complex Bill, I said that the amendments were thrown together. I did not mean to say that the amendments were thrown together. I meant to say that the documents were thrown together. The amendments in no way were thrown together. Rather than trying to change Hansard, which would not be what I would want to do, I want to correct the record now by saying that I meant to say `the documents'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although I was not involved in the direct discussions, as Senator Tate mentioned, I can assure him, as he probably knows, that I have had my ear to the ground on this matter and have watched proceedings with a great deal of interest. In so far as these Government amendments improve the agreement, that is a matter to be applauded. As has been mentioned by Senator Patterson and Senator Lees, this has been the result of a considerable amount of effort by the individuals concerned-the shadow Minister in the other place, Mr Braithwaite, Senator Patterson, and the staff. I will be supporting the amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By far and away the most substantive amendments moved thus far were moved by Senator Patterson, and I supported them. The amendments moved by Senator Lees tidy up the wording. For example, `indebted' was substituted by `obliged to feel grateful'. While not wishing to canvass those issues again, it should be noted that all of these things are important to ensure a better form of agreement, and that is one reason I support these amendments. However, this is more or less shadow-boxing at present because the Committee is due to debate some of the more major issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) That, in accordance with subsection 40abb (5) of the National Health Act 1953, the Senate amends the form of agreement between residents and proprietors of approved nursing homes formulated under section 40abb of the Act, dated 14 September 1990, and laid before the Senate on 18 September 1990, in accordance with the following schedule of amendments:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Clause 3, page 2, proposed paragraph 3.1(b), omit ``and'' (last occurring) and proposed paragraph 3.1 (c), omit ``.'', substitute ``; and''. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Clause 3, page 2, after proposed paragraph 3.1 (c), add the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> (d) where there is a residents' committee that wishes to be involved in the preparation or amendment of the rules then the proprietor shall develop or amend the rules to reach agreement with the committee. Failing agreement the resident or the proprietor may take the matter to the internal disputes committee under Clause 23.''. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) Clause 15, page 7, proposed subclause 15.3, omit everything after `proprietor' (third occurring), substitute ''. In the event of no mutual agreement between the proprietor and the resident about the proposed move, the proprietor may still move the resident, provided there is a bona fide medical or other care need for the move as assessed and certified by a medical practitioner independent of the nursing home or a health professional from a geriatric assessment team agreed to by the resident. If the resident fails or is unable to agree to the appointment of such practitioner or health professional within seven (7) days of the proprietor proposing the move of bed location to the resident, the proprietor may arrange for the assessment in the absence of the resident's agreement, provided such assessment is carried out by a medical practitioner independent of the nursing home or a health professional from a geriatric assessment team.''. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) Clause 20, page 9, omit the clause, substitute ``The resident has the right at all times to use an advocate or representative, including in all of the resident's dealings with the proprietor. The use of the advocate or representative shall be at the discretion of the resident.''. </PARA>
<PARA> (6) Clause 21, page 10, proposed paragraph 21.4(c), omit ``or'' and proposed paragraph 21.4 (d), omit ''.'', substitute ``or''. </PARA>
<PARA> (7) Clause 21, page 10, after proposed paragraph 21.4 (d), add the following paragraph: ``(e) in no less than fourteen (14) days in respect of 21.3 (g). The proprietor agrees to take all reasonable steps to contact the resident.''.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Clause 21, page 11, proposed subclause 21.7, omit ``21.3 (g)'', substitute ``where the proprietor fails to contact the resident under 21.4 (e),''. </PARA>
<PARA>I will deal with these amendments in three groups. Initially, I wish to speak to amendments Nos 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. As Senator Harradine was not able to be a party to the discussions and negotiations that have taken place, I will briefly dwell on a couple of the important amendments that I have moved. A few of the other amendments are simply rewordings, but we are trying to cover a couple of substantial issues. The second amendment to clause 3, page 2, proposed paragraph 3.1 (c) and (d) deals with resident committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe it is extremely important that wherever residents so wish, the residents' committee should be involved in the preparation or amendment of the rules-after all, it will have to abide by them-and that the proprietor discuss those rules with the residents' committee. However, we have allowed some room and, failing agreement, the resident or proprietor may take the matter to a disputes committee so that the nursing home can come to some agreement and consensus. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw the attention of the Committee to our amendment No. 4 to clause 15, page 7. This amendment deals with some concerns expressed by the operators of nursing homes on the ability or otherwise of a proprietor to move patients. The original agreement limited that to a certain extent. We are aiming to ensure full consultation with the resident concerned. After all that, if there is still no agreement, then either the medical practitioner of the nursing home or a health professional from a geriatric assessment team will be required to provide assessment and support. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 5 relates to the use of an advocate. We did not want to run the risk anywhere in the agreement of limiting the resident's access to an advocate if he or she needed to speak to somebody. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 7 relates to the absence of a resident. The proprietor must take all reasonable steps to contact that resident. </PARA>

<PARA>(54) Clause 23, subclause 23.3, omit ``recommendation'', substitute ``finding, which shall be binding upon the parties to the dispute''. </PARA>
<PARA>Eleven of the amendments that we have moved have been agreed to by the Australian Democrats in the hours of discussions we have had outside the chamber. Some of these amendments are minor and reflect drafting corrections, but a few deserve explanation. Nowhere in the document was there any mention of the requirement for residents to be informed of the rules of the nursing home prior to signing the agreement. It seemed to us absolutely necessary for residents to be informed of the rules of the nursing home before entering into agreement. We have amended the agreement accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of the amendments modify the agreement so that impossible demands are not placed upon the proprietor. For example, clause 6, as it is tabled, is almost incomprehensible because of drafting and grammatical errors. The proposed amendment clearly imposes fair and reasonable obligations. As the clause now stands the proprietor is expected to guarantee that a resident will not be assaulted by a fellow resident or by a visitor. In all practicality, when running a nursing home one cannot monitor every moment of the day who will be in the nursing home. Even though all precautions might be taken, a resident may be subjected to some sort of assault, whether it be verbal or physical, without the proprietor being able to have any sort of protection for that individual resident, even though he or she might do all within his or her power to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The absolute guarantee of privacy in clause 7 is unreasonable. Our amendment incorporates the concept of privacy as it is expressed in the international covenant on civil and personal rights. The amendment seeks to clarify where rights and obligations lie and to remedy drafting defects in the clause as tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment to clause 11 makes it more reasonable. It is unrealistic to require the proprietor to provide secure storage for valuable possessions of a resident without any indemnity from the resident. The draftsman probably had in mind small personal items. But personal effects do not refer just to jewellery and small things such as television sets; they include all chattels. Some constraint needs to built in to ensure that the personal effects of residents are stored subject, as we have amended in the clause, to the space constraints of the nursing home. It is entirely impractical for a resident to expect that his or her personal effects will be stored in the nursing home, if the nursing home does not have the facility to do so. Our amendment brings that into a more realistic form. </PARA>
<PARA> We are aware that residents come to regard their rooms and their beds as their personal space and territory and that they should not be moved at the whim of a proprietor. But we also recognise the practicalities of running a nursing home and are of the opinion that it may be necessary to move a resident to allow for minor or major building or repair activities in the home. Hence our amendment to clause 15. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments attempt to clarify the intentions of the agreement. I will not take up the time of the Committee by going any further into our reasoning behind these as we have discussed them ad nauseam in the meetings outside. Had the business of the Government been better organised, we would not be debating this very important legislation under the guillotine and I would have been able to explain the amendments fully. Given that we are operating under a time constraint, I ask honourable senators to support the amendments that I have moved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite the fact that the 30-odd amendments which I have moved will be opposed by the Australian Democrats and the Government, it is important that our concerns and our preferred wording of the legislation are on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In particular, I wish to refer to four amendments which relate to clauses 3, 8 and 9. I believe that we will be dealing with the amendment to clause 10 separately. In clause 3 we are substituting a subclause requiring that the proprietor and the resident agree to abide by the rules of a nursing home except in so far as the rules are inconsistent with this agreement or the charter or the standards of nursing home care published from time to time by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> In this debate we have a most delicate situation: balancing the rights of residents already in a nursing home, those who have worked to provide the facility and those who are actually working in the facility against the rights of those who may want to enter a nursing home but who cannot conform with the rules of that home. All of us who have debated this issue have put a lot of effort and, in some ways, a lot of heartache into thinking this through. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the arguments behind the Opposition moving this amendment is the belief that people in a nursing home-in many cases, they have chosen to go to that nursing home because it is run by a church or a group to which they belong that expresses their values, their morals and their beliefs-should be able to spend the rest of their days sharing their time with people who hold the same values. </PARA>
<PARA> Over 35 years ago Baptist women-I say this for the benefit of women in the chamber-had the foresight to demand that their church buy land so that a nursing home could be established at North Balwyn. That was in the days when aged care was not on the agenda. Those women had planned ahead. They put enormous efforts into raising money for that property. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that not only has there been government support for the capital development of nursing homes but also there has been an enormous effort by volunteers in all of those organisations to establish aged care places of a high standard which would hold their own anywhere in the world. I can say that with some authority, having visited aged care centres in many countries. Many people in some of those fine institutions have dedicated their lives to raising money. Many people who have voluntarily given their time to the residents hope to move into nursing homes themselves. Because of government subsidies, somehow there is to be intervention by the Government in terms of the rules that will be applied. </PARA>
<PARA> Some time ago-I think it was 1985 or 1986-I was quite horrified to read a news report of a nursing home, either in the southern part of New South Wales or the northern part of Victoria, in which an elderly couple who wanted to be in a room on their own to talk were in breach of the rules of that nursing home. At the time I expressed my concern. The rules of a nursing home might be ridiculous, but it is worse when the rules of a nursing home are not known before the people go into it. I was surprised that the Government did not have an amendment, which we now have, which indicated that people should know the rules of a nursing home before they sign an agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess the only concern I would have is the situation where somebody may be required to go into a nursing home, or where the choice is limited in a regional area, but I think that that, if it occurs at all, would be very rare. It would be a greater infringement of rights if people had to live with others who did not share their philosophical or ethical values. As I said before, it is a very delicate balance of rights. Many of us have thought long and hard about this and anguished over it, and after all that we have come up with this particular amendment which I support and which the coalition supports. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other things our amendment does is extend the limited religious exemption provided for in the Government's amendment. Our amendment includes charitable or similar voluntary nursing homes, because there are some nursing homes which are not necessarily religious in that sense but which in fact have expressed moral values because of the charters of their organisations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not accept the amendment concerning clause 3, rules of the nursing home, because it believes that the sorts of sentiments which have been expressed by Senator Patterson are to be found within the clause as it is presently drafted, particularly in 3 (1) (b). Senator Patterson's amendment would read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The proprietor and the resident agree to abide by the rules of the nursing home except insofar as the rules are inconsistent with this Agreement or the Charter set out in Schedule 1 or the standards for nursing home care published from time to time by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, I cannot see a lot of difference between that and the present agreement, which in 3.1 (b) reads:</PARA>
<PARA>to the extent that the rules of the nursing home are consistent with this Agreement and with the Charter set out in Schedule 1 and with the standards for nursing home care published from time to time by the Minister, the proprietor and the resident will abide by them;</PARA>
<PARA>It is precisely the same, with just a slight reversal in the sequence of the phrases and clauses in the sentence. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we are on common ground in trying to acknowledge a situation where the proprietor and the resident agree to abide by those rules which are consistent with this particular scheme but which of course can elaborate on or go beyond-but not in an inconsistent way-the provision of the charter and the agreement as we have discussed them in committee this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is important that that supplementary character of the nursing home rules be acknowledged. I think Senator Patterson is correct to say that there are many instances where people will find the bare bones of the agreement do not really, despite their great merit, make entry into a particular nursing home the attractive proposition which it should be for them, embraced within a philosophy of care which accords with a belief and the values which they almost certainly would have held for decades as they reach the frailer aged years of their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is a place, certainly, for nursing home rules. I believe that the agreement as drafted makes exactly the same provision as Senator Patterson seeks to achieve, though perhaps in a more legalistic way and not quite as positively as her amendment, but I do not believe there is any reason to depart from the language that has been adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> Question put:</PARA>
<PARA> That the amendment (Senator Patterson's) be agreed to. </PARA>

<PARA> (19) Clause 10, omit subclause 10.2, substitute the following subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``10.2 have access to medical, health and social services of her/his choice, but a medical practitioner shall not have the right to treat the resident in the nursing home if the medical practitioner will not agree to observe the ethical principles of the proprietor in the exercise of the practitioner's profession within the nursing home;''. </PARA>
<PARA> As we have seen from the various newspaper reports, in the last two weeks there has been a great deal of debate and discussion on subclause 10.2. The newspaper reports have constantly referred to the fact that residents should have the right to the doctor of their choice. Our amendment does not deny a resident the right to the doctor of his or her choice. However, it does specify that that doctor must observe the ethical principles of a proprietor when practising in a nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of my colleagues wish to address this matter, so for the sake of not delaying the Committee any longer I will leave it up to them to go into more detail about the reasons for our moving this amendment. As I said before, we asked the Democrats to consider our amendments and I regret that they will not be able to support this amendment either. I call on my colleagues to put the case. This is one of the most complicated matters that have gone through the chamber for a long while. Senator Herron, who is a new senator, made some comments on the charter. I am sure he will add to them when he speaks to this amendment and will support me in moving it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier tonight I made a speech which, in my inexperience, I thought at the time was supportive of the amendments that Senator Patterson was moving. I wish to add a few comments to those which were out of place at that time. The point I was making was that it does not matter which law we pass or what the bureaucracy determines; if a patient does not wish to accede to the requirements of a nursing home that patient will need to find somewhere else to go. Alternatively, if a patient insists on a particular doctor and that doctor does not conform to the requirements of the nursing home, what will happen in the real world is this: when a doctor who is known not to conform to the nursing home's requirements rings up to get a bed for the admission of the patient, the doctor will find that there are no beds available. It is as simple as that. That is what occurs in the real world. So no matter what the bureaucrats and the politicians think, in reality, the nursing home will determine the requirements of the patient to accede to the morality of the nursing home or hospital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I referred earlier to an incident that occurred years ago when a hospital decided that the doctors would need to conform to its requirements in relation to anaesthesia. It decided that doctors would not be admitted unless they had specialist qualifications in that regard. The Australian Medical Association opposed the decision of the hospital. The Mother Superior of the hospital confronted the Australian Medical Association and said, `If you wish, we will turn it into a motel'. Honourable senators can appreciate what happened-the doctors backed down, they accepted the requirements of that hospital for a high standard of anaesthesia. It is one of the leading private hospitals in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Patterson's amendment will achieve what occurs in real life. It does not matter what the strict requirements are in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill, in the sense that the amendments are being moved by the Government. As I mentioned earlier, any strategy that uses clinicians as the end point in a bureaucratic game will be ignored by the clinicians because in the real world the doctors treating the patients in the nursing home, in consultation with those patients and their families, will determine the management. </PARA>
<PARA> We think it is only logical that the amendment proposed by Senator Patterson, which recognises the real world, should be adopted by the Government. I support that amendment because it satisfies the requirements of the church nursing homes. In reality, they are the ones providing the service; they are the ones that have asked for this requirement. For the life of me, I do not understand why the Government does not agree to that requirement. After all, the Bill imposes a restriction on church nursing homes, which they will not follow in any case, because it is contrary to their principles. The Opposition amendment satisfies those requirements and it would be satisfactory to the churches which control the nursing homes. I support the amendment as proposed by Senator Patterson. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. I, too, wish to support my colleagues on the amendment to subclause 10.2 of clause 10. As Senator Herron put very well, this issue is a matter of commonsense. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Government has not accepted the advice of the Australian Catholic bishops who have very strongly opposed the draconian attempts by the Government to override the rights of nursing home proprietors who have firm religious beliefs and also high principles in their philosophies of care. These philosophies must not be compromised. Practices of over-sedation, euthanasia, treatment of a patient against his or her wish and breaches of a patient's rights must be opposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) has told representatives from the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference that the amendments they seek would negate residents' rights to a doctor of their choice. On the other hand, a doctor who ignores the moral principles and religious conscience of a particular nursing home against the operator's wishes would create a larger problem than the one the Minister is concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA> I note in the Minister's reply to the Catholic bishops that he promised that an independent committee, which would include church representatives, may be set up to review the operation of the agreement and charter at a later time. I must say that that is not acceptable. Earlier today we heard from the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), who is at the table, that the regulations that were put down in, I think, 1986-Senator Patterson was making inquiries about this-still have not been enforced. If that is an indication of how things move in that particular ministry, a committee which has been promised by Mr Staples, I am sure, would take some time to review the matter. In any event, I do not believe that the people involved should have to wait in the faint hope that a committee may come up-I repeat, may come up-with an acceptable argument at a later date. It is not good enough. If we are going to enact legislation, we should do it properly. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Senator Patterson and her advisers should be congratulated for the amount of work they have put into looking at this very complex piece of legislation and amendments, and congratulations should go also to the Australian Democrats and the Government for the work that has been done. I am pleased to see that a compromise has been reached in a number of areas. As I said earlier-and as Senator Herron has said-I cannot understand why the Government will not accept this amendment that we are putting with the full support of not only the Catholic bishops and the religious organisations but also other religiously run institutions. It is the only argument the Government has, at the moment anyway, with all the agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> There has never been any question about the tremendously high standard of care that has been afforded by Catholic nursing homes and, in fact, other religious nursing homes. I think it is very important that we do not jeopardise that care, and anything that will jeopardise that care must be vigorously opposed. I have certainly received a lot of representations, as I guess other senators have, from concerned Catholic bishops-and I think they are genuine concerns. Any agreement that allows a doctor to act in a way that is contrary to the basic moral and Christian principles of Catholic religious orders or any other religious order that operates nursing homes must be opposed. The fact that the President of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, Archbishop Clancy, took the trouble to contact the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and had conversations with him in itself shows just how strongly they feel about the matter. </PARA>

I ask the Democrats to think again about this particular matter. It has been dealt with separately. It is a matter that is causing a lot of concern to the majority of religiously run institutions in Australia and-as I said earlier, as Senator Herron has said and as Senator Patterson has alluded to-I cannot understand for the life of me why the Government will not accept this minor amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to state very briefly the Australian Democrats' concerns on this issue. What we believe has been happening for the last three years is, in effect, the original wording as the Government proposed it, and there does not seem to have been the outcry from the community that is now being suggested that there will be if the legislation passes in its present form. The Democrats wish strongly to support the rights of nursing home residents. These, I must stress, are not additional rights; these are the same rights that anyone in the community would enjoy-the right for them to choose their own doctor. This doctor may be a general practitioner who has treated their family for 10, 20, or 30 years, and now, because they move into a particular nursing home, they are going to be asked to reassess their trust and their faith in this particular person and perhaps to change to somebody else who they may not know and, at that particular time in life, they may be very reluctant to trust that person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I can dwell on a couple of points raised by Senator Calvert, I feel very strongly that these amendments are draconian attempts to limit and restrict the rights of the residents. After all, the documents we are dealing with tonight-the charter, the agreement-are aimed at protecting the rights of people in nursing homes and hostels in their latter years of life as they would enjoy those rights in the community. The Australian Democrats believe it is an affront to the nursing homes themselves to suggest that somehow all these incredible things will happen if they let these doctors in. It is an affront to the doctors themselves to suggest that there are doctors in the community who are not ethical, who are somehow not practising legitimately in some way and who will-Senator Patterson alluded to a number of media reports-do all sorts of unethical things if they are allowed to continue to treat people they may have been treating for many years. While we dwell on the number of people who have contacted us on this issue, we have also had representation from the bishops-a group which I must stress was not involved in the original negotiations because it does not run nursing homes. We have not heard from those who do; that is, the various orders of Catholic sisters who run Catholic nursing homes. I have not heard from individual Catholics who are concerned about these measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, the question should not be why some proprietors should seek to remove those doctors but why these rights should not apply to residents of nursing homes. I want to stress at this point that Catholic nursing homes are held in extremely high regard in the community. Indeed, they are held in such high regard that many people seeking to be residents of them are not Catholic. I believe all those individuals should have the right to choose their own doctor; therefore the Australian Democrats will not support this amendment. </PARA>

I am pleased to hear that the Minister is interested in my views and I will be interested to see whether he agrees that in this area Mr Staples has created unnecessary conflict. I say that quite deliberately. Senator Lees said she had not heard from the nursing orders. The first I heard about this issue was the publicity in the Australian when that great nursing home order, the Little Sisters of the Poor, commented about the proposed nursing home agreement. Frankly, that was the first time I have heard the Little Sisters of the Poor come out publicly on anything. It is a dedicated order which has been in existence for decades, serving the aged people of Australia and elsewhere. The response of Mr Staples was to attempt to belittle the Little Sisters of the Poor. I heard Mr Staples say, `Well, we hope to get some charity into this debate.' Who is he to suggest that the Little Sisters of the Poor, the sisters of charity, do not have charity? The order worked on the smell of an oily rag years before any money was made available from government sources for the support of aged people in the homes run by the order.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Zakharov says that she does not consider that these dedicated orders of women have had at heart the conscientious interests of the people that they have served for years and years. I do not know where we are going if she does not believe that, because I believe that everybody else around this chamber would say that they have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say that not only have they had the rights of residents in nursing homes foremost in their minds, but they have also established a very high standard of care in accordance with the philosophies of care which are well recognised. It is that philosophy of care which they see should not be compromised. In this area, it could be compromised unless this amendment by the Opposition, or something similar, is adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lees suggested that the amendment is an affront to the medical profession, to the doctors themselves. I refer Senator Lees to the Medical Journal of Australia of 20 June 1988, volume 148, in which there is an article by Helga Kuhse and Peter Singer, notorious from the Centre for Human Bioethics, Monash University. They reported on a questionnaire which was sent to 2,000 Victorian doctors selected at random. It was a survey of attitudes and practices of doctors in Victoria with respect to requests for active help in dying from patients who are suffering from a terminal or incurable disease. Here we are talking about the rights of nursing home proprietors, including of orders of nuns, to protect the aged within their care. Of those doctors, 896 returned completed questionnaires. I quote from the article:</PARA>
<PARA>The survey indicates that a clear majority of those who responded to the questionnaire support active voluntary euthanasia and that many doctors have provided active help in dying. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it not appropriate that the philosophy of those involved in health care who preserve the rights of the aged in the nursing homes they run should not be compromised? Should they not have the right to prevent a doctor who has an attitude of supporting euthanasia from attending to persons in homes for the aged-nursing homes? I would have thought they should; that is facing facts. It is an interesting thing. It may be said, `There are laws which would protect people', but there are not laws that will give people full protection from the onslaught of euthanasia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Zakharov says, `What if it is their wish?' We could go into that, but the guillotine is going to chop our heads right off in a minute. The life of this debate is going to cease very shortly, but I would like to go into that matter. It seems to me, since Senator Zakharov has asked that question, that with the Government's amendment which says that the proprietor, with the consent of the resident, may require any medical practitioner chosen by the resident to agree to respect, et cetera, we get to a situation where many of these people in nursing homes need the protection of those who run the homes-protection from a medical practitioner who may have an attitude such as was described in the Medical Journal of Australia article. It is very interesting to see that this article was written by Helga Kuhse and Peter Singer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said before, although there are certain laws-and we will no doubt go into those later-the fact is that there is not any protection for an aged person in a nursing home against a doctor who has that sort of attitude. The only protection, of course, is that of the people who care for the aged people in those nursing homes. We have Senator Tate's own Government paying $450,000 of taxpayers' money to the Centre for Human Bioethics. But these medical research funds were used not for the purpose of undertaking medical research but for the purpose of developing a philosophy for destructive experiments on human embryos. At the other end of life we had the Government's own money going to Helga Kuhse to assist in developing the occasional paper for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have some people in the health bureaucracy who would not mind euthanasia-it would get rid of a lot of monetary problems. That is why this amendment is important--</PARA>

Although I have not spoken to them individually, I have a letter from the Catholic bishops. There is no doubt that they see this as very, very serious indeed. I received a letter from them today-presumably everybody else has received it-dated 17 December 1990. The final part of the letter from the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Catholic Bishops have already decided to advise Catholic nursing homes in their dioceses and religious institutes conducting nursing homes not to sign the Agreement if clause 10.2 of the Agreement is not amended to enable Catholic religious bodies to sign the Agreement in good conscience. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very serious statement. I would be interested to know what the response of the Government is on that. It does not apply only to Catholic organisations; it applies to a whole number of organisations. I have letters-which, no doubt, other senators have-on this matter.

So I am happy to go ahead tomorrow and announce that the Government has changed its mind in relation to Medicare, that henceforth, under Medicare, patients will have the right to a doctor of choice. That is the logical conclusion because the Government will not accept the Opposition's amendment. If the Government opposes our amendment, it is insisting that patients shall have the doctor of choice in nursing homes and therefore, as a corollary, in public hospitals.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Residents-call them what you will. They are people, Senator Tate. They are human beings, like the Minister and I. They are ill. As Senator Harradine said, they need loving care. But I assure the Minister that they will not get it from government. They will get it from the people who provide the care in the nursing homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Long before government came in, nursing homes were traditionally run by religious orders and religious bodies. What is happening now? Government is saying, `No, you don't know enough about it. We are going to determine how you shall look after those people. We are going to determine who will look after you. We are going to determine how that care will be given and if you do not do what we say, we will cut the funds off'. The Government is saying, `If you don't follow our dictates, we will cut the funds off'. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the answer, Senator Tate? Residents though they might be, the Government is insisting that they have the doctor of choice. What about residents in the hospices? What about the residents in places like Mount Olivet? They do not have the doctor of their choice. They have a nursing home attached. </PARA>
<PARA> It is frequently said that the number of patients admitted to hospitals in Australia is proportionally far greater than in any other country. The reason is that, because of our decentralisation, many patients who should be in nursing homes are actually in hospitals, particularly country hospitals. The people who come from Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales would not be aware, as they never travel around the backblocks of Queensland or Western Australia, that many of those hospitals cater for nursing home-type residents. One may call them residents, patients or whatever one will, but they are people; they are citizens of this country and they demand and expect not only a high standard of physical care but an extra dimension which is given by the churches and the religious orders. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Government should not think for one moment that those nursing homes do not have the rights and responsibilities of the individual at the forefront of their objectives; of course they do. It is a responsibility of government to provide for those people and it is the very people who are in need of that care who demand even more compassion from government than those who can afford to go to nursing homes of their own choice. So there is a responsibility which cannot be abrogated, and it is a responsibility that we all have. Senator Tate can play with the semantics of whether they are residents or patients or whatever, but they are people-human beings in nursing homes-and the people who provide that service have a right to determine the quality of care and the philosophy behind it. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I return to Senator Calvert's query, `Why does the Government not agree to the amendment? It solves the problem'. If the Government did, it would not have this battle on its hands. The passage of this Bill is not going to stop that battle; I can assure the Government of that. The bishops are not going to go away and I can tell Senator Tate that when we are well and truly under the ground, the churches and the nursing homes will continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has never been my contention-I am sure it is not that of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples)-that governments have a monopoly on the provision of tender loving care for those frail aged who find themselves spending their last days in the nursing homes of this country. It is also important to say that that tender loving care is not a monopoly of the church either. There have been great religious orders founded by extraordinary women-one thinks of the Blue Sisters and so on. Florence Nightingale was regarded as a heretic, an atheist, and a loose woman because she dared to bathe men. The nursing tradition in Australia has as much, if not more, for which to pay tribute to Florence Nightingale as to any of the great teaching orders, but I would not want to say one is better than the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that there are many-both those of a secular frame of mind and those motivated by religious ideals-who devote themselves to the care of the aged in our nursing homes in Australia. I believe that they all deserve our commendation and praise because they undertake one of those civilising influences in our society which are so important. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine said that in many ways this debate is unnecessary. I agree with him: in many ways it is. I have in my hand Gazetted Standards for Nursing Home Care, gazetted on 10 November, 1987, by Neal Blewett, Minister of State for Community Services and Health. This document, which has regulated the provision of nursing home care in Australia for the last three or so years, contains the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Standards to be observed in the provision of nursing home care in approved nursing homes:</PARA>
<PARA>1. The nursing home will ensure that each resident receives appropriate medical care by a medical practitioner of his/her choice when needed. </PARA>
<PARA>That particular standard of nursing care, gazetted three years ago in November 1987, has governed the operation of nursing homes in Australia, and as I understand it nursing homes run by the Catholic Church have acquitted themselves well in respect of that particular provision. In other words, there has been 100 per cent compliance. </PARA>
<PARA> I imagine, though I have not had access to the materials but I am assured by officers, that the Little Sisters of the Poor have had no difficulty in the last three years in complying with that provision. I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA>The nursing home will ensure that each resident receives appropriate medical care by a medical practitioner of his/her choice when needed. </PARA>
<PARA>The phraseology has not proved a barrier to the provision, within the Catholic nursing home system, all other nursing home systems or individual nursing homes not part of a system, of a range of medical care which is permitted within the nursing home in a way which obviously has caused no great difficulty. The bishops have decided to make this an issue in relation to euthanasia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us remember the debate. The question of sexual activity in nursing homes was first raised. It was in relation to comments by the Sister Superior of the Little Sisters of the Poor in that regard that probably caught Senator Harradine's attention. A delegation led by Bishop Kelly came to my office twice. The next time the members of the delegation came to see me-about 10 days later-they moved off the sexual agenda entirely and exclusively and added euthanasia. It is in relation to euthanasia that they have decided to take their stand at this time, as Senator Calvert so perceptively said. No doubt it will change next week. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make it absolutely clear that the Government is utterly opposed to the practice of euthanasia, forbidden as it is by all jurisdictions throughout Australia. I am referring to passive and active euthanasia, whether it is not putting the respirator on when it is required or putting the needle in too early. Senator Herron would know that, whilst euthanasia is something to be abhorred as a criminal activity, nevertheless there will be occasions when a compassionate Catholic doctor, in conjunction with the nurse or the sister in charge of the little room where the elderly person is painfully eking out the last hours of life, will hasten that person's death in a gentle and compassionate way. Senator Herron will know that that is a fact. Surely when we are talking about how things actually happen in our society, no-one would say that that does not happen in the best of nursing homes. Thank God that some of the sisters running the Catholic nursing homes are more compassionate than the bishops in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to refute some of the matters that Senator Harradine raised. He said that the health bureaucracy would have an interest in this and that it would help them to get rid of a lot of a problems, particularly of a monetary kind. I regard, as an absolutely despicable assertion about those who are concerned with the various bureaucracies of health care throughout Australia, this suggestion of a motive for their bringing forward this clause in this amendment. The health bureaucrats of this country have not determined on a course of getting rid of elderly patients in nursing homes in order to secure some sort of monetary benefit. I find that an extraordinary type of assertion.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine also said, `Well, if this goes through, there will be no protection for those who might be at the mercy of some doctor who wants to practise euthanasia in the nursing home'. I am sure that Senator Herron could once again confirm the fact that, when a doctor does his rounds, particularly in that situation where there might be a temptation to give a little more of an injection than is normal, he would be doing it in conjunction with and under the supervision of an ever vigilant sister on the ward. There is no way in which the doctor just goes in and performs that sort of activity solo. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the question of whose rights are at stake because, in the provision as it would be amended if the Government's amendment is carried later this evening, we do not have an authoritarian or totalitarian approach by the Government. But we are not going to stand by and allow an authoritarian or totalitarian approach by a proprietor either. I commend Mr Staples for moving to this position. The first draft of the agreement reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The resident has the right and shall . . . have access to medical, health and social services of his/her choice. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Staples, having listened to the argument and having tried to understand and be sympathetic to the concerns of the nursing homes, as expressed on their behalf by the Catholic bishops, as it is said, offered this amendment:</PARA>
<PARA>The resident has the right and shall . . . </PARA>
<PARA> have access to medical, health and social services of his/her choice. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . Where the proprietor of a nursing home is a religious body the proprietor may-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . bring to the attention of a resident and of any medical practitioner seeking to practice in the nursing home the doctrines, tenets, beliefs and teachings of the religious body; and</PARA>
<PARA> . . . with the consent of the resident, require any medical practitioner chosen by the resident to agree to respect and observe the philosophy of the religious body when practising his/her profession within the nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA>In many ways that is somewhat redundant because, if we were talking about euthanasia, clearly the philosophy of the religious body would be entirely in harmony with criminal law anyway. Quite explicitly, Mr Staples has said and recognised that there is a balance which perhaps was not given enough weight initially. In our multicultural, pluralist society where an organisation-in this case a religious body-runs a nursing home, some weight has to be given to the factor of a particular ethos, a particular set of values animating the dedication of that group to the running of a nursing home. There is a recognition of that distinctive ethos of the particular nursing home, but it cannot completely submerge, swamp, overwhelm and suffocate-perhaps I should not use that term in this context-the interests of the resident. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Staples has said that where there is a meeting of minds, as surely there will be, between the resident and the proprietor of the nursing home, the particular nursing home can direct the medical practitioner not to practise medicine within the nursing home unless he agrees to respect and observe the philosophy of the religious body concerned. There is a difficult task there but it is an attempt to recognise that we live in a multicultural, pluralist society and that some nursing homes will have their own religious ethos. But that has to be combined with, in a cooperative and collaborative way, the rights of the resident. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Staples has hit a good balance in the clause that he has offered. He has gone further than that. He said that if in any jurisdiction in Australia there was a move by any parliament which was successful in trying to modify the criminal law and provide for euthanasia, he would have written a provision into the agreement to make sure that that was taken account of. I believe that this was put up to the bishops a week or so ago, but they said that that was not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Staples has gone further again and said that, given the three years experience that we have had of the successful operation of the outcome standards for Australian nursing homes, which include the provisions in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, which I have mentioned, perhaps we should see how this agreement works and, if there are any problems, a joint committee with church representation would be able to review the operation of the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> We should pay some deference to Senator Herron, who has had more experience I guess than anybody else in this chamber in dealing with the elderly and with those in nursing homes and so on. The way that these things work on the ground will be somewhat different from what we might think they are in the abstract or based on the written terms of this agreement, however fairly devised they may be. I think they will also function differently from what the bishops might think is the ultimate standard of attainment of a particular moral principle. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that within the nursing homes-Catholic and otherwise-there will be an ability to work within the particular clause that Mr Staples has now offered as a very reasonable approach to trying to balance--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What an extraordinary statement by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate). He spent an extraordinary quarter of an hour regaling the Senate. I will take his comments point by point. The first point is that he made a statement that tender loving care is not the sole prerogative of nursing sisters-Little Company of Mary, the Little Sisters of the Poor, the Nazareth House Sisters, the Sisters of Charity and so forth. I could go on. Who said it was their sole prerogative? Nobody said it was. Did anybody here say that? Why did Senator Tate say it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; There was no implication at all. I was responding to what Mr Staples said. He said that these people ought to have a bit of charity. I am entitled to respond to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My second point is that Senator Tate waves the document, which he said was gazetted in 1987 I think, entitled `Standards Monitoring Guidelines for Quality of Life and Care Outcome Standards'. But he selectively quoted from that document. Standard 1.1 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The nursing home will ensure that each resident receives appropriate medical care by a medical practitioner of his/her choice when needed. </PARA>
<PARA>Having quoted that, he said that the nursing homes run by the nuns have managed to stay within that in the last three years so why can't they do it now? That is what he said. He did not quote what he should have quoted. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The guidelines provide a summary of key issues, followed by a more detailed description of information to look for with respect to each standard. </PARA>
<PARA>This appears in the introduction. It then says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is stressed that this document provides guidelines, not hard and fast rules, and as such standards monitoring staff are expected to use their judgment in the application of the guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a difference-and the Minister knows it-between those loose guidelines, which are not hard and fast rules, and this measure. Not only is it a hard and fast rule, but unless the nursing homes sign the agreement, they are not entitled to receive Commonwealth money. There is a vast difference between that matter and this one. Why try to pull the wool over the eyes of the chamber? Why did the Minister not quote from this document? Guidelines are entirely different from a measure which is now included in a piece of Commonwealth legislation, particularly where the latter carries with it a denial of community funds if the agreement is not signed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister then suggested that I have accused all bureaucrats of urging euthanasia to get rid of fiscal problems. I certainly did not accuse all bureaucrats of that. I said `some bureaucrats'. I repeat: why was all that money allocated to Peter Singer; why was all that money allocated to Helga Kuhse to develop an anti-life philosophy which is utilitarian at its base, with an implied assertion that there is life unworthy of life?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister talked about what doctors might or might not do in a Catholic hospital. The Minister rather confused the charitable refusal of medical practitioners to engage in burdensome treatment, where the outcome is not proportionate to the burden that is being imposed on the resident or the patient. We could have a discussion on that but we do not have time to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate finally ended by saying that when his mother and father go into Mary's Grange no doubt they will use their same doctor. I have received correspondence from Mary's Grange and it does not want this provision in the agreement. That is the fact of the situation. Of course, Mary's Grange, since it has been mentioned, will want to see that its residents have the doctor of their choice. But I am sure Mary's Grange wants to have a situation where it can exclude such practices as over-sedation, euthanasia, treatment against patients' wishes, and other breaches of patients rights which are morally unacceptable and against the background of their philosophy of care. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not say any more because time has almost expired. But it is important to get a few things on the record. Senator Tate seems to infer that this issue started on the aspect of sexual matters. I have the documents which came from the Australian Catholic bishops in September. Those documents go over a wide range of issues. They date back to September. It is unfair for Senator Tate to suggest that the Australian Catholic bishops are changing their ground. I hope that he will withdraw that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to continue a deteriorating personal exchange with Senator Harradine. What I said about the Catholic bishops was in the context of their visits to me. Bishop Kelly lead the delegation that came to see me. On the first occasion before they saw Mr Staples-in fact, I arranged the first meeting they were able to have with him, due to his other commitments-their total and utter concern, with no other matter raised, was in relation to sexual practices that might be indulged in by the fragile and aged in nursing homes. Only at their second meeting with me, about a week or 10 days later, did they raise the new issue of euthanasia, saying that it was as a result of their further reflection and advice received in this matter. I was only reporting the sequence of events as it was presented to me by their official spokespeople.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth of Australia Gazette from which I quoted, as opposed to the information booklet `Living in a Nursing Home', and which sets down the principles-including `The nursing home will ensure that each resident receives appropriate medical care by a medical practitioner of his/her choice when needed'-is headed by the words:</PARA>
<PARA>The following standards are to be observed in the provision of nursing home care in approved nursing homes and non-compliance with these standards by the proprietor of an approved nursing home may attract the consequences outlined in section 45E of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, withdrawal of approval for new residents or withdrawal of approval altogether; revocation of approval. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not saying that at all. I am answering Senator Harradine's point that we are talking about two qualitatively different things because they had different consequences. I am pointing out that the consequences for failure to keep to the standards which have been observed would involve those sanctions outlined in section 45 of the Act, if they were thought to be appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To answer Senator Calvert's point, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, Mr Staples, has said in my presence in conversation with the Catholic delegation that revocation of funding-which is what Senator Calvert is talking about-is a matter of absolute last resort which should only be invoked where there is such a deterioration in the provision of care that the residents in the particular home are in real jeopardy and at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why that particular sanction is held, not in relation to the matters which we are discussing. That is an absolute last gasp effort to try to persuade a nursing home that, unless it looks after its people in a civilised way, its funds will be withdrawn. As I say, that is for those terrible situations of absolutely indifferent, almost callous treatment which, as we know, occur occasionally even now, but certainly never in the homes which Senator Calvert or I would visit in the course of our journeys around Tasmania or even on the mainland, in so far as the mainland can attain Tasmanian aspirations and standards. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that I have said as much as I can in defence of the offer which has been made by the Government. In fact, in a sense I have anticipated the amendment I wish to move. It tries to strike a balance between recognising in our multicultural society that certain nursing homes will have an ethos, a guiding philosophy or a religious ideal which ought to be recognised, but not in a way which completely swamps the residents within them. Where there is that coincidence of minds-which will invariably be the case-between the residents of a nursing home and the ethos of the home they have chosen to enter because its prevailing spirit accords with what has guided them in the decades of their long lives to that point, I believe that a particular doctor should not be permitted to offer services within that nursing home. I think that is respectful of both the resident and, in this case, the religious order which is running the nursing home. I believe that Mr Staples has made a fair offer in this regard. I believe that the amendment put forward by the Opposition ought to be rejected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I have said is that the clear case for the operation of the discretion by the Minister, which he emphasised, was in those cases where the care being offered to the residents so far falls short that they are in a situation of terrible distress. I do not know what the exact result would be if the Catholic bishops ordered various homes not to sign this agreement because, obviously, it is more than not attaining a particular standard within an agreement. I believe that the various nursing homes have their own boards of management and their own religious orders' autonomy in relation to the governance of those particular nursing homes. I believe each of them will be able to make their own assessment, based not on rumour or early drafts. What I would make a plea for them to do is to have a look at the document as it emerges from this Committee and is adopted by the Senate. It is a better document than perhaps has been in circulation up to now. I believe that, once they look at that particular document as it emerges from this debate, they will be able to make a fair assessment of its requirements. I would imagine that many of them would find that they can work within the scope of the agreement as it will be amended during the course of this Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I said in answer to Senator Calvert's question is what I believe-namely, that in the instance he has put forward we are not talking simply of failure to attain a particular standard-and that is what I was directing my mind to earlier when Senator Herron did not deal with clause 10.2, clause 9.3 or some combination of particular standards of care. He is talking about a failure to observe the whole purport of what will then be an agreement sanctioned by this Parliament and therefore part of the law of Australia. I think that is a much different situation from one where we simply look at particular clauses or particular effects of failure to measure up in a particular instance. In that situation I believe that there would need to be a lot of discussion in order to try to clarify the matter, but I cannot prejudge the decision that might be made by the Minister in any particular instance. As I say, it would be my expectation that, when boards of management and the religious orders themselves look at the agreement as it emerges from this committee stage, many of them will find that it is an agreement which can commend itself to them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question I have relates to the two previous questions. I still do not think we have an answer to it. The question was quite clear and the documentation that I have received, as others have, from the bishops is quite explicit. They have said that they will not agree with the Government's decision. I do not think Senator Tate can pick them off the way he did with the pharmacists or the way he regularly does with the doctors. He will not split them up into little bits; he is dealing with an explicit decision of the bishops conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The bishops have said quite categorically-and the archbishops in each different State have written to senators giving their imprimatur to the decision-that they will not comply with the decision of the Government. Senator Harradine and Senator Calvert earlier asked for Senator Tate's response. They asked whether the Government would cut the churches' funds off if they did not comply. There is no indecision on their part and there should not be any indecision on Senator Tate's part. I think he should give a clear answer to that by saying, `Yes, we will cut their funds off if they do not comply with the decision' or, `We will not'. Senator Tate cannot sit on the fence and say, `Some of them might, some of them will not, some of them will and perhaps we will give some money to some of the others and then we will split them all up into little divisions'. The bishops have made it quite clear that that will not occur. That is the question that has been asked by my honourable colleagues: if the bishops do not sign the agreement, will they get their money cut off? Is the answer yes or no?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry I cannot help Senator Herron, but I am not in the magistrates court in Brisbane. I am not going to answer yes or no. The fact is that what I have indicated is a process of consultation and deliberation which has been undertaken between representatives of the episcopal conference of the Catholic Church and the Minister. Various statements have been made by all sides and all parties. The Little Sisters of the Poor said that they may be forced to withdraw entirely from the provision of this particular care and leave their residents or paying guests to whoever might establish an alternative home for them. Extreme statements have been made. I am saying that, as the deliberations have progressed, the particular proposal put forward by the Minister, which is embodied in the amendments I put to honourable senators was not, I believe, before the bishops conference when it met a couple of weekends ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I say, there have been discussions right up to this very moment, so I do not believe we are in a position to give absolute answers. I hope that, having reached this point and with the Parliament having expressed its view, there will be an opportunity for the parties involved to have a look at the agreement as it emerges and make their own decisions. But I believe that there will be no extreme or intemperate statements because in the end, one would hope, whether it is the Government or bishops, it is the care of the aged and the frail which is of paramount concern. One would not want a situation where that group of aged Australians was put in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> But we live in a multicultural and pluralist society. The Government cannot force people to sign agreements or enable agreements to be signed between residents and proprietors. I suppose we will have to see how the exercise of free will and responsibility by the episcopal conference and the homes concerned can now be brought to terms with the expressed will of the Parliament if, in fact, it passes the amendments which the Government will put forward in the next five or six minutes. </PARA>

<PARA>In respect of amendment No. 6, we have already had a very full debate on the matters of concern which led to that particular amendment being drafted. Given the fact that we have only four minutes left on this debate, I believe I need not rehearse those arguments. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 cover those clauses which were designed to deal with the claims made by the Catholic bishops that nursing homes may have forced upon them the free choice of their residents to indulge in certain forms of sexual behaviour which are incompatible with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of the religious body which ran the particular institution. </PARA>
<PARA> That particular matter has been dealt with, I understand, to the satisfaction of the Catholic bishops in that a political precedent was drawn upon, which is found in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act of 1986 where senators will recall that, in relation to discrimination, the notion of `discrimination' was defined in a way which excluded:</PARA>
<PARA>any distinction, exclusion or preference . . . in connection with employment as a member of the staff of an institution that is conducted in accordance with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of a particular religion or creed, being a distinction, exclusion or preference made in good faith in order to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or that creed. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that particular recognition by the Parliament-and I believe it was probably inserted actually in debate in this particular chamber-indicates the proper political grounding for the amendment which is offered in clauses 4 and 5 before the Committee at the moment. So that, where the nursing home has a rule which excludes certain forms of sexual behaviour, that particular rule will operate in so far as, as I say, it is undertaken and promulgated by the religious order to ensure that activity in the sexual area accords with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teaching of that religious body which runs the home. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matters really are, I think, fairly straightforward and, indeed, consequential. This makes it clear that what one is talking about is the resident's right to make choices, and it does not itself imply or impute to a proprietor any particular condoning of a choice of the resident in so far as the resident makes, of his or her own free will, a particular choice. I commend those particular amendments to the Committee. </PARA>

However, we do acknowledge the considerable input that the Catholic bishops have had, and we believe that now a balance has indeed been struck between their concerns and the concerns of those who have been involved with the drawing up of these documents, and that is the concerns of those who wish to protect the rights of the residents.

When the Opposition was debating all these issues with the Australian Democrats and the Government, we had anticipated that the Government would move all of its amendments before we moved ours.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Available Departmental records indicate that three contracts have been awarded to the Roy Morgan Research Centre since 1975. These were a two-part evaluation of the Family Allowance Supplement (FAS) survey in June and October/November 1989; an assessment of Family Allowance advertising in September 1989; and a contract for the conduct of surveys and analysis to determine the social impact of the Child Support Scheme in November 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>Evaluation of FAS Survey</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Yes. The contract was the standard form contract for consultancy services. It conformed to the Department of Administrative Services guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA> There were no alterations to the specifications after the contract was entered into.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) $181,500</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Yes. Roy Morgan Research Centre was selected for this contract on the usual basis of competitive submissions from a short list of consultants whose specialised expertise and suitability for the assignment are known to my department or the Office of Government Information and Advertising.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Yes. Questionnaires will be made available to the honourable senator after the report has been tabled in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Full questionnaires were provided.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (h) The contract to the Roy Morgan Research Centre was only one of several major tasks undertaken as part of the Family Allowance Supplement (FAS) evaluation. The final report for that evaluation is to be tabled in Parliament in the near future. A copy of the report will be sent to the honourable senator after it has been tabled.</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (j) A complete set of computer printouts is not held by the Department. However, specific tabulations are held.</PARA>
<PARA> Yes, the Roy Morgan Research Centre provided an interpretation of the data. It also provided a report on each of the stages of the FAS survey.</PARA>
<PARA> (k) The survey results have been used extensively in the final report of the evaluation of the FAS program. They have also been used for administrative and policy purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> (l) The proposal to commission the survey emanated from my Department.</PARA>
<PARA>Assessment of Family Allowance Advertising</PARA>
<PARA> (a) No. There was no contract as the assignment was small and the research company was appointed by OGIA on behalf of my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) $13 550</PARA>
<PARA> (c) No. The assignment was put out to selective proposals from two consultants because it was a small but urgent one.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Yes. The questionnaire is included in the report.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) No. We were not provided with the full questionnaire because my Department's questions were included in a ``shared cost'' omnibus survey in which a number of clients combined questions for one interview. Each client's questions are confidential to that client and we would not expect to be informed of them.</PARA>
<PARA> We rely on the integrity of the consultant and their membership of the European Society for Opinion and Market Research which binds them to a code of professional behaviour ensuring such conflicts do not arise.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) Yes. See previous response. My department was not aware of all questions or provided with a response.</PARA>
<PARA> (h) A copy of the report will be forwarded to the honourable senator.</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (j) No. The Department received computer tabulations for all surveys as specified in Clause 4 of the standard contract. The Roy Morgan Research Centre provided an interpretation of the data.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Australian Government is aware of allegations of public executions of homosexual men and women in Iran. Under the religious laws of Iran, homosexuality is classified as a crime. Cases that come to the knowledge of the Iranian authorities, even of consenting adults, have been met in some instances with severe punishment.</PARA>
<PARA> During a crack-down on prostitution in Tehran in 1989, several people described as prostitutes were executed; some of these people may have been homosexuals. According to the Australian Embassy in Tehran, those executed may also have been implicated in illicit drug dealing. Executions of homosexuals for attacks on minors are reported periodically. There does not appear, however, to be evidence that the Iranian authorities are going out of their way to hunt out homosexuals, nor evidence that there is a concerted anti-homosexual campaign.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's High Commission in London has been informed that the British Embassy in Tehran (which was not open in March 1990), has not prepared a report on the execution of homosexuals in Iran. There have been a number of reports on the human rights situation in Iran which deal inter alia with the question of executions, including reports by the UN Commission on Human Rights' Special Representative on Iran: the first of these reports was released in March 1990, and the most recent report was released on 6 November 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Australian Government is firmly opposed to capital punishment in all circumstances. The Government's concern over the excessive use of the death penalty in Iran has been firmly and frequently conveyed to the Iranian authorities, both in the multilateral and bilateral context. The Government will continue to press the Government of Iran to adhere to international human rights standards, and to cease this cruel and inhumane form of punishment.</PARA>
