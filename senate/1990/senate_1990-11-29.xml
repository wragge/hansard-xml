<TITLE>Austudy: Family Allowance</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Senators in Parliament. The Petition of the undersigned shows:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government is planning to introduce an assets test on Family Allowance at a level of $500,000. It will maintain the current assets tests on Family Allowance Supplement (FAS), Austudy and Isolated Children's Allowance which are discriminating against farming families particularly during the present rural crisis.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners ask that the Senate in Parliament assembled should request the Australian Government to exempt the family farm of registered primary producers who are living and working on their own farm from inclusion in the assets tests for Austudy, Family Allowance and Family Allowance Supplement.</PARA>

<TITLE>Austudy: Family Allowance</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain electors of Queensland points out to the Senate that the 1990/91 Federal Budget stipulates that from January next year Family Allowance payments will be subject to an assets test. Family Allowance will be withdrawn if net assets excluding the family home and debt exceed $300,000. Furthermore the parental assets test threshold for Family Allowance Supplement, Austudy and Assistance for Isolated Children has been severely slashed in the 1990/91 Federal Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> Considering the economic crisis facing rural communities in Australia, assets tests of such a nature are not viable because the assets are incapable of generating enough income to sustain families and send children away for schooling.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore ask the Senate to exempt the family farm from the assets test for Austudy, Family Allowance and Family Allowance Supplement.</PARA>

<TITLE>Air Landing Fee: New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA> That the report be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the eighth report of the Committee concerning a matter raised by a person under Privilege Resolution 5 of 25 February 1988. On 26 November 1990, the President, Senator the Hon. Kerry Sibraa, referred a letter from Sir William Keys relating to remarks made by Senator Newman and Senator Herron during discussion on a matter of public importance on 15 November 1990 to the Committee of Privileges as a submission under Privilege Resolution 5. The Committee has considered the submission and recommends that a response agreed to by Sir William and the Committee be incorporated in Hansard and I seek leave so to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The response read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>RESPONSE BY SIR WILLIAM KEYS, A.C., O.B.E., M.C. AGREED TO BY SIR WILLIAM KEYS AND THE COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 5(7) (b) OF THE SENATE OF 25 FEBRUARY 1988</PARA>
<PARA>In the Senate on Thursday, 15 November, I was the target of most insulting remarks from Senators Newman and Herron. I write to ask that my response to these attacks and to the issues from which they arose might be presented to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman referred to me as a Government ``stooge'' because of my support for hospital integration. Let me begin by saying that for 27 years, 17 as National Secretary and 10 as National President of the RSL, I was the principal negotiator for the war veterans and dependants of Australia. In this role I developed sound working relations with Prime Ministers from Robert Menzies to Robert Hawke. I believe I also had the respect and confidence of my own constituency and the Ministers and Governments of the day, regardless of their political persuasion. </PARA>
<PARA>The results achieved for veterans and dependants over that period are a matter of record and speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>I briefly retrace this history of my efforts for veterans and dependants to make the point that Senator Newman's interjection was not only deeply offensive, it was untrue. I am nobody's ``stooge'' and never have been. The views I express are at all times my own. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not the personal attack on me which concerns me: rather, it is the attack on the concept of integration. As National President of the RSL I negotiated the integration arrangements with Prime Minister Hawke and Veterans' Affairs Minister Humphreys. The views expressed in my letter, quoted by Senator Tate, represented views adopted by organisations such as the Korea and South East Asia Forces Association and the TPI Association. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently, in supporting Senator Newman's attack, Senator Herron was incorrect in his statement to the Senate in relation to a National Conference of the AMA on 26 May at which I spoke. </PARA>
<PARA>He said I had returned from overseas that morning. In fact, I had returned 5 days before. </PARA>
<PARA>He said I had delivered a speech that I had not actually read. In fact, the speech I read was the third draft of an address on which I had worked with the National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition (NOOSR) in which I provided the general thrust and the professional people provided the supporting data-a fairly normal procedure for such a speech. </PARA>
<PARA>He is correct in saying that I did anger my audience. I told them if they did not adopt a more flexible attitude to the assessment of the professional skills of overseas-trained doctors, they were in danger of becoming irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA>The merits of the points I made were subsequently endorsed by the Australian Medical Council which, as a result of its own review, greatly changed its assessment procedure to make it a far more practical process and thus give overseas-trained doctors a far greater prospect of obtaining recognition and registration. </PARA>
<PARA>I make this submission in an endeavour to clear my name and reputation. I trust that appropriate action can be taken. </PARA>
<PARA>SIR WILLIAM KEYS</PARA>
<PARA>I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) will remember that on 12 November I asked him a question relating to his comment that he would possibly refer executive salaries to the Prices Surveillance Authority. I pointed out that he had mentioned that the level of executive salary increases was in the range of 16.5 per cent. I then asked him whether such an inquiry would include in its terms of reference those senior staff in his and other ministerial offices who have received salary increases of up to 35 per cent, plus additional fringe benefits. The Minister said a lot of things in reply, but the gist of it was that he would not be including those extremely large increases for his own and other ministerial staff, as well as staff of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), in that Prices Surveillance Authority inquiry. I then asked the Minister this supplementary question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Who makes the assessment, or is this just a case of the spoils of office that the Minister has referred to on so many occasions in this place?</PARA>
<PARA>After making a couple of odd comments, the Minister assured me:</PARA>
<PARA>The assessment is made by the appropriate officers of the Department of Industrial Relations-</PARA>
<PARA>I stress these are the Minister's words-</PARA>
<PARA>with no reference to any Minister whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of Question Time on 12 November the Minister came back and said that he would like to supplement his answer. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I said in my answer that Senator Bolkus was the responsible Minister and then I said, `as I understand it'-</PARA>
<PARA>which is not true; if people look at Hansard they will see he did not say that-</PARA>
<PARA>and I went on to complete the answer. Senator Bolkus has now advised me that the assessment of ministerial salaries is made, of course, as I said in my answer, by the Department of Industrial Relations-in fact, it is made by the Secretary of that Department who then advises Senator Bolkus as to the outcome. Senator Bolkus has the power to accept, reject or amend it. </PARA>
<PARA>He was restating part of his answer and correcting that part where he said `with no reference to any Minister whatsoever'. He was making that correction. However, yesterday, when I asked Senator Bolkus whether the individual Ministers had the opportunity of making assessments of their own staff, Senator Bolkus said that they do. That is completely contrary to the answer I received from Senator Cook. When I asked Senator Bolkus why the Minister had answered me in the fashion he had-incorrectly saying the individual Ministers had no input at all-he said he could not answer for Senator Cook; obviously Senator Cook did not have the information. I ask the Minister, because he is the Minister for Industrial Relations, whether he would now like to correct his answer to me, because it was obviously wrong, and why he did not have the correct information of his own Department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will concede that Senator Walters quoted some of the relevant parts, but not all of them. The key part of my answer that Senator Walters is holding up to me now is that when the question was first put to me I said that I was not the appropriate Minister to answer it but that since the question was directed to me I would do the best I could to provide the Senate with the relevant information. With that caveat, I think it is reasonable for me to be able to say that, though not talking on my portfolio, I would nonetheless endeavour to provide the best information I was apprised of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The terms of the Prices Surveillance Authority's charter do not require it to be a vehicle in which salaries of ministerial staff and Opposition staff can be determined or scrutinised. There is not in the ministerial staff issue any price element that would be something that the Surveillance Authority would look at. The relevant authority for setting up the framework for the levels of ministerial staff and Opposition staff is the Remuneration Tribunal. The Remuneration Tribunal has done that by setting ranges. </PARA>
<PARA> The placement of particular staff within those ranges is the next exercise. That is done by the Secretary of my Department, uninformed, unencumbered and unenlightened by me-that is to say, independent of government. He makes an assessment as a person within the government structure who is knowledgeable about industrial relations and about appropriate relativities and weightings of relativities for people of this type. That recommendation goes to Senator Bolkus, who has the ministerial responsibility for adopting, rejecting or amending it. He exercises that responsibility as the case may be, according to his own determination. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters has come back to an answer that she tells me Senator Bolkus gave to a question yesterday. I have no knowledge of that interchange so I take her word that she has relayed the terms of that interchange accurately. On that assumption, I will answer what she has put. To the best of my knowledge, the only time I was aware of what levels were to be bid for by my staff was when they indicated to me where they were applying to be placed in the range.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is this obsession by the Opposition, when I raise the question of excessive remuneration for executives in Australia, not to join the Government in its clarion call for restraint by executives and for executives to show the same restraint that their employees have shown in wage fixation over the last years. I would have thought that the provable fact of a huge executive rip-off stood out so startlingly that the Opposition could find it within its soul, somehow or other, to support the Government's call for restraint.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Instead of a call for restraint we now have this exercise of morbid curiosity about what has happened in the determination of salaries for ministerial staff. I should say on that subject-that is, ministerial and Opposition staff-that unlike the executives, of whom I was complaining, their salaries have been through a proper process of determination. That determination is by, in the first instance, the Remuneration Tribunal headed by Judge Mahoney, a Supreme Court judge of the New South Wales jurisdiction. He has made a determination as to salary ranges for different classes of position. Within those classes of position, according to the experience, ability and competence of the individuals concerned and their performance, an assessment is made and they are placed within a broad range. </PARA>
<PARA> The process that we are talking about is where within that broad range they are placed. They are placed in a way in which there is an incentive to encourage them to better performance. That is a process of assessment and determination in each of their cases, unlike the example I was making about senior executive salaries in which there is self-assessment and self-determination without any independent objectivity being brought into the argument. </PARA>
<PARA> Having made that position quite clear and identifying the still dogged refusal of the Opposition to call upon senior executives in this country to restrain their remuneration packages, I do not think that there is any need to select out individuals who, by their performance, have been independently assessed as requiring an upgrading in their salary. I just think it would be a more sensible process; I might say that I am not going to lend myself to that either. All the information about what rates these people get is on the record and Senator Kemp can have access to it; I do not need to do his research for him. I would hope, since Senator Kemp is rising to the call, that when he does speak he would preface all his remarks by saying that he does join the Government in calling upon senior executives in this country, who have had massive salary increases, to do as their employees do and exercise restraint. That would mean at last some bipartisanship on a fairly obvious point of inequity. </PARA>

<PARA> The issue is-just so the Minister can get it clear in his mind-that he, by his own behaviour, has provoked this issue. The Minister has gone around trumpeting the accord. He has gone around telling people in this community-the workers-that they have had to have cuts in living standards. He has moved vigorously against those who have broken outside those guidelines-the latest effort, we will recall, was by members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The issue that we want is to see whether the Minister lives by the same rules that he wants others to live by. That is the particular issue and that is why he has brought this matter on. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned that the Government is calling for restraint, and we do not argue about that issue. The country is in a deep crisis-and probably the figures today will show this-which I suggest the Minister's policies have brought on. What we are interested in is this: the Minister has gone around trumpeting restraint and telling workers that they have to restrain their behaviour, and Bill Kelty has joined him in that. Now we find from yesterday that with the figures Senator Bolkus gave this chamber, and which have not been denied, there is a considerable doubt that the rules that the Minister and his colleagues have applied to others have in fact applied to their own senior managers. That is the reason for what he calls obsessive interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the Australian Democrats-of all the parties represented in this Parliament-in exercising the moral imperative of restraint. That is a significant step forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come to the second point. The distinction I made before is that executives undergo self-assessment and appoint their own salaries. The people who Senator Kemp is talking about went through a period of independent assessment by competent authorities to examine what work they did, what ability they brought to the job, what experience they had and with what competence and performance they pursued it. On assessing each of those people individually, independent of themselves, the authorities placed them in a scale, moreover, that is based on the Public Service scale. That is, a work value assessment was carried out on each individual. There is a world of difference between self-assessment and self-appointed salaries, independent assessment and an objective, competent independent authority fixing a rate. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the honourable senator has then moved to blur that distinction and has gone on to talk about the level of increase. The level of increase related to a general wage movement for these officers is the same level of increase that everyone else has enjoyed. But the assessment of their work value which has not taken place--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Kemp" NAMEID="WW4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Kemp is going to talk on wages policy, it is very important that he understand what the constituent parts of that policy are and how, when greater expertise and competence are called for and more demands are made on people, they are entitled to get higher pay because of that extra responsibility and demand. As long as that is assessed by an independent competent authority, there is nothing wrong with that. In fact, that is quite right, fair and just.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One cannot therefore say that because the type of work these people do has changed significantly over time and because the value of the work that they produce for the government or their employer has increased immeasurably, they are not entitled to receive an assessment and a regrading. One cannot say that-and that is what has happened in this case. So before anyone makes the point that we are not applying the same principles to ourselves that we ask others to apply, the answer is this: certainly we are. If we were not, we would be worthy of condemnation. But we are, and we are according to our own likes; we are according to the likes of the Remuneration Tribunal; and we are as well according to the likes of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we were setting new precedents here on which other wage and salaries earners could build, there would be a wages break-out. They would be citing the precedents that we had established to justify wage claims in the broader community. So we were careful to ensure that the principles we were applying in this particular case were in fact looked at by the ACTU and, indeed, the Confederation of Australian Industry (CAI) as I recall. So the two major players that appear before national wage case benches and appear in the endless tug-of-war over what the right level of salaries or wages might be before arbitration commissions could pass their Geiger counter over the principles we were applying and get the test reading back to find that it was neutral. But in fact the principles we are applying to ourselves are the principles that are universally the principles of wage fixation for the general community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator may still wish now to proceed down this course because he is offended by quantum, by the amount, but before he does, I warn him it is a treacherous course for him to proceed down because he has obviously proceeded down it to the extent that he has without a knowledge of wage fixing principles, and he will come to grief if he does not comprehend those principles in the examination of this subject. </PARA>

It may be dealt with in the Minister's own Department on some occasions, I might add, but certainly a department that the Government runs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has told us that the executive increases of 16.5 per cent, using his own figures, and the extraordinarily large figures of up to 35 per cent for ministerial staff are totally different because one is an independent assessment. He told us just a little while ago that some of the staff suggested their salaries and, if he signed them, he sent them down to the Industrial Relations Department-and that is fair enough. But I would say the difference is, as the Minister has told us, that the Australian Council of Trade Unions has sanctioned one lot so the Government has said, `Fine, so long as our bosses tell us it's all right, we'll do that,' and the ACTU did not sanction the other lot. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the basic difference between the two. A very old union trick-and the Minister would be very well aware of it-is that if you cannot go for a total increase and stay in the area where you are, you upgrade your area. Yesterday we were asking Senator Bolkus to give us a description of the difference between the job done by the staff previously and the job they are doing presently. He said that he had never claimed there was any difference. Of course the Minister now says there is greater demand on them, there is greater this and greater that-but Senator Bolkus said yesterday that he had not claimed there had been any change in the demands of the jobs that those staff members were doing. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, the Minister is well aware of all these facts and all we are saying is: be consistent; say to the community out there, `We've got to pull our belts in'; have a look at the figures that will come out today, and acknowledge that we have to do it with our own staff. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no open cheque book-type of situation here. This is a situation of strict scrutiny and control and proper guardianship of public moneys. The purpose of the scheme of course is to encourage the amalgamation of unions along industry lines and to achieve, therefore, one union per industry, if possible-certainly at least one bargaining unit per industry and/or enterprise where possible-so that the demarcations that occur with the inherent craft union structure we have in this country can be removed and workers can be skilled across a range of skills without there being that craft focus of the past. The work force can therefore become more flexible, more productive, and that will benefit the wider economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, part of our micro-economic reform program is to encourage this amalgamation to break down the old craft unionism of this country and achieve a major industry focus for our union organisation. The cost of doing this is quite large. For example, two quite small unions wishing to amalgamate immediately face a legal bill of about $50,000 in order simply to draw up the scheme of amalgamation and have it approved. They face other legal costs for the purposes of getting the matter dealt with. These are costs in addition to the normal running and administration costs of a union. Since we are encouraging unions to achieve amalgamation, we see that a reasonable thing for us to do is to meet some-and I underline that word-of those costs; not all of them, because they are special costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The second element of this scheme is that there is often a high cost at the point of explaining to members who have perhaps been encoded into a craft view of things of the need for amalgamation so that they can make intelligent choices when they come to vote about amalgamation. The members can have better explained to them the wider opportunities of what that portends for them in their futures, careers and earning power. So that is another area into which some of these funds go. </PARA>
<PARA> The process of obtaining these funds is for the unions to make a submission setting out what they propose-there are strict guidelines involving accounting and control measures laid down by the Department and each of the submissions is judged against those guidelines-and if a union's submission meets those guidelines it is then a candidate for approval. The approvals are recommended to me, and I make a decision based on the recommendations of my Department. I believe at each stage of this process there is sufficient control to be certain that these funds are spent in the manner and for the purposes for which they are allocated, and there are review mechanisms to ensure that. </PARA>

<PARA> The purposes of those courses is to encourage people to learn English in the workplace and/or to become competent in English. Our worry is that non-English speakers, or people with poor competency in English, in a mechanised workplace may not understand always what the safety signs are, what the hazard signs mean, and what the operation signs mean for properly conducting and operating plant and equipment. Therefore they can be a danger to both themselves and to their workmates. These workers may be able to pass the screening of personnel officers and get into the workplace, but there is a real need to lift that understanding, as there is a wider social need to encourage more literacy in English by all residents of this country so that they can be aware of their rights, which are more often set out in English than any other language. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out that on page F21 of Estimates Committee F Hansard of 13 September 1990, Senator Foreman asked this question:</PARA>
<PARA>What about seminars? Do you conduct them in any language other than English?</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Pratt, the Director of the Affirmative Action Agency, answered:</PARA>
<PARA>No, we do not, unfortunately. We do have quite a lot of discussions with employers, where there is a multicultural work force, about the strategies that may be developed. One of the main areas of concerns is things like induction programs which, unfortunately, many employers still maintain in English. We make certain recommendations but, unfortunately, we do not have the resources to present our material in any other language. </PARA>

There is a need to broaden that understanding, and obviously teaching English is part of it. I have a number of additional questions which I suspect may not be able to answered now. Maybe if I just read them out we can get the answers later. If the Minister wants to answer now, that is fine. When was the first non-English speaking program conducted?

I was interested in the debate that took place when this matter was first raised, but the debate really relates to the pay structures and methods of deciding the payments of chief executive officers. As I understand it, the method of assessing those salaries was taken out of the Remuneration Tribunal's hands last year and in fact has now been put within the control of the board of the statutory authority, or whatever it might be. I want to find out what the movement was, one year after the decision was made, in the salaries of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia; the Managing Director of Telecom Australia; the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank Group; the Managing Director of Australia Post; the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Industry Development Corporation; and the Managing Director of OTC Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is the proper place to find that information.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a matter which would be disclosed in the Reserve Bank of Australia report. I am not in a position to confirm or deny that, as I have no formal advice from my Department or from any other authority which I am responsible for. I can simply say that the place to find that information is in the annual report of the Reserve Bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apropos the discussion we had earlier, the Government insisted that statutory authorities such as the Reserve Bank, the Commonwealth Bank, in particular, Telecom and Australian Airlines take on a more commercial hue and compete free of the restraint that would normally be applied to government business enterprises. We insisted that they orientate their operations to a more commercial dimension. One element of that decision was to enable those authorities to compete for executives within the general executive market in Australia. As soon as we do that, we run straight into the prevailing excessive level of executive remuneration. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is a shared view of the major parties in this place that it is a good thing to put those authorities on a more commercial footing. I think that is a common view in this chamber. As soon as one wants to attract the best executives, one has to compete for those talents within the senior executive market. If that market had exercised more restraint, the rates payable in statutory authorities that are on a more commercial footing would be less. The central task is still to obtain restraint of those large executive remuneration packages that we are objecting to and, I see today, bipartisanly objecting to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to direct the Minister's attention to the discussion held in the Estimates Committee on Canadian pig meat. I note from the report of Estimates Committee F that officers of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE) were unable to provide the Committee with definitive information on the nature and magnitude of subsidies made by Canadian authorities in support of this industry. The Committee noted what we already know-that Canadian pig meat was heavily subsidised. Of course, the great concern was and still is-let alone the competition it gives Australian producers because of the meat being heavily subsidised from Canada-the health side of things. I know that the DPIE has a strict inspection of meat that comes into Australia but, if disease in cooked meat floats past, we have a problem on our hands. I would like the Minister to comment on what the Department could not tell us about the nature and magnitude of subsidies, and also on the issues relating to health.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -This is a well-trodden track. We have had this discussion many times; it appears we are going to have it again. So be it. Perhaps I should start by saying that the Australian Government does not use quarantine as a non-tariff barrier to trade. The purpose of quarantine is to make sure that no diseases get into Australia. It is not the purpose of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to artificially use its powers to prevent trade. It is its responsibility to ensure that traded goods are non-disease carrying. When the Canadians want to sell uncooked pig meat to the Australians, we have to be satisfied that it will not transmit any disease. That process has been under scrutiny and the process is complete.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next question, therefore, is: is the trade fair? Is there a level playing field here or not? Do the Canadians subsidise their pig production, whereas in Australia it is largely unsubsidised? Do the Canadians thus have a competitive advantage? The referee in those types of arguments is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). My understanding is that there is some form of government assistance to Canadian pig producers. The image I have of what Senator Panizza said is that he thinks there is a huge subsidy. That is wrong, although I always concede that `huge' is like `beauty': it is in the eye of the beholder. </PARA>
<PARA> By reference to a general level of subsidy, one would not say that the Canadians were engaging in huge subsidies. The test is: is it something that GATT would allow or is it something that GATT would not allow? As I am advised-I am sure that I can give the precise details when I consult my adviser in a moment-what the Canadians do is benign in GATT terms. If we were to take reprisal action against them, which would be non-benign GATT reprisal action, we would be the offenders and not they. However, as to whether there is anything I need to say to supplement my answer, I will just quickly check. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply add that the assistance given in Canada is provided at both Federal and provincial level, but is not given for the purposes of export or of enhancing a product's penetration of foreign markets. It is assistance given for other reasons within the constitutional provisions of Canada. </PARA>

<PARA> Moving away from Canadian pig meat, while we are on the question of subsidies, and I would like an answer later in respect of the health side of things, I briefly mention the other imports, such as bananas, orange juice and that sort of thing, dumped, for the sake of a better word, in Australia from the Latin American states What is the Minister's Department doing about that at the moment?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A believed case of dumping is not a responsibility of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy; it is a Customs matter. The normal procedure is for the offended party, or the party that believes there is a case of dumping, to take some action with Customs in order to establish that. There are then mechanisms to lift the level of tariff or other protection to ensure that the dumping is neutralised and that the competition is therefore fair. However, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy-Mr Kerin's Department, the Department for which I am answering now-does not itself have that primary responsibility. As I said, that responsibility resides within the portfolio governed by Senator Button, but the primary initiating responsibility lies with whoever believes that this event has taken place to take action to protect his interests.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no doubt that there are many offended people, but these things are a bit like legal proceedings. Many people make complaints, but the real test of sincerity behind a complaint is to take action and have the matter determined in one's favour to see whether what one has complained about is a matter of substance or not. While I have no doubt that there is a chorus of complaint, I am not aware at this point of particular actions being initiated. One must measure the sincerity of a complaint against the lack of action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the honourable senator asked about the importation of fresh banana fruit from South America. In fact the bananas come from Ecuador. I am aware that the Australian banana industry has approached the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) expressing concern at the likely disease risks if Ecuadorean bananas were permitted to come into Australia. Late in 1989 AQIS received a proposal from Fruit Distributors Ltd of Wellington, New Zealand, to permit the importation of fresh banana fruit from Ecuador. That company has been importing Ecuadorean bananas into New Zealand for a number of years. AQIS has distributed a preliminary risk assessment and discussion paper in its regulatory bulletin of October 1990. That review is still preliminary, but industry will be kept fully informed of developments in this proposal and given the opportunity to contribute to the technical assessment. It will be several months before AQIS is in a position to determine whether a detailed bio-economic study will be required, and a final decision is not expected until some time in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA> Industry has responded to the AQIS discussion paper by convening meetings in New South Wales and Queensland with participants from grower, transport, packaging, marketing and horticultural industries. A fighting fund has been established for a program which includes a visit to Ecuador by a number of industry representatives to assess the field situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, the processes of health assessment of the likely disease risk caused by bringing these bananas into this country are being undertaken by AQIS in a proper way. It is unlikely that there will be a final decision on that issue until 1992-93, and the grower organisations whose interests are affected by this matter are involved in the process. </PARA>

<PARA> The health side of the pig meat issue was exhaustively examined over a seven-year period. When the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) earlier this year agreed to the importation of Canadian pig meat, it was completely satisfied about the safety of importation. It has conducted that inquiry on medical grounds only, and it has come to the conclusion that it is safe. The risk assessment has been made and the bottom line is that transmissible gastroenteritis, which is the disease that people were mainly concerned about, is recognised internationally as not being transmitted in fresh meat. At one time I was literate in how all these diseases operate, but I have not read a brief on this for over a year. However, the advice of the proper scientific authority is that the risk assessment is favourable to importation. Any other questions about competition are outside the competence of AQIS. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I now move to live sheep exports. During the Estimates Committee hearings this matter was discussed at some length and questions were asked about the rejection of live sheep exports to Saudi Arabia and other Arabian ports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee heard evidence that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE) had put in place customer-specific criteria for satisfying quarantine rules in each buyer nation, and that strict quality controls over age and disease had been implemented. It was reported either yesterday or the day before that a shipment of another 80,000 sheep was rejected by Saudi Arabia because of scabby mouth. I note that in today's Australian Financial Review there is a letter from a Malcolm Fraser of Melbourne-I presume that is the former Prime Minister because sometimes he uses that address and sometimes he uses the Hamilton address-pointing out that scabby mouth, the disease for which the sheep were rejected, is a passing disease. It is a terrible disease to look at because one can see it. If symptoms of disease are internal, they are not so obvious and it is not so bad. However, scabby mouth looks terrible and Australian butchers would not buy the meat of sheep infected by it. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) and the DPIE have the power to place a condition on export that the sheep have to be inoculated against the disease. I understand that this is a simple procedure. Since scabby mouth disease has caused the rejected shipment, as it did various shipments last year, why does the Department not insist that sheep for export be inoculated?</PARA>

<PARA> I now turn to scabby mouth, the name of which is about as pleasing as the sight of it, I understand. The allegation the Saudi Arabian authorities have made is that a shipment of sheep-I think they were on the vessel Al Gasseem-contained some sheep with scabby mouth. I have no independent corroboration from Australian authorities as to whether or not that is an agreed diagnosis. At this stage, all I have is an allegation being made by Saudi Arabian authorities without independent corroboration as to whether we agree. </PARA>
<PARA> However, Senator Panizza asked whether we have investigated the use of a vaccine that can terminate the disease if there is an outbreak of it on the voyage. I am not sure about that. Although I am advised that vaccination has been discussed by the industry, at this stage there is no guarantee that a vaccine will resolve the issue. The other element is that the vaccine is a live virus. I understand that some Western Australian farmers have indicated that they would not want such a vaccine on their property. This raises the question of whether we should be very cautious about introducing it onto a confined ship taking a long voyage from Australia to the Persian Gulf. That is a matter for some assessment. At this stage the best we can say is that this matter is under consideration. Whether we should go the extra step and do it is a matter for determination. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Panizza has suggested vaccinating the sheep at the port before their departure. That is a matter worthy of consideration, but there are qualifications: I am advised that the vaccine can break down; there is a 42-day period to wait in dealing with the vaccine; and there are some extra costs associated with it. So those are matters to keep in one's mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I would make a general comment on the live sheep trade to the Middle East. Frankly, Australian producers have nothing at all to apologise for. By and large, the live sheep that come out of Australia are healthy, are not carrying a disease and are of good quality. There is a need to continue the persistent efforts that the Minister, John Kerin, has made in opening up that market, because some people have posed the open question that maybe this is a market in which some non tariff barriers are being used to limit the penetration of Australian sheep. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to subprogram 1.1-livestock and pastoral. I would like to pick up at the point where the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and Senator Panizza left off-and this is more in the form of a statement than a question. It applies not only to the live sheep trade but also to the wool industry and a number of other export industries in this arena. I think it is about time we applied some lateral outward thinking and a little less inward thinking. I have to say with a certain amount of joy that a press release yesterday described a wool sale as the best that has been held this season-it was in Launceston, Tasmania-where the Australian Wool Corporation bought only 26 per cent of the wool. That was good news.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But when we look at the wool industry we find that the answer to our problem lies in higher taxes and quotas. When we look at the live sheep trade we find that the answer is to put quotas in place and restrict the movement of sheep from this country. I agree with the Minister that we have nothing to apologise for. I believe that part of the response to the current wool situation comes from Mr Kerin's overseas trip. If I have a criticism of the Minister it is that neither he nor the Government has been proactive enough in the part they can play. I cannot confine my comments to the Government because I do not believe the industry has been proactive enough or has had the ability to apply a little lateral thinking to get constructive answers to overcome some of the problems we have experienced in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to emphasise the importance of the live sheep trade. We have to recognise that, whether we like it or not, countries such as Saudi Arabia, Libya and Iran-where there has been some activity lately-deal on a government to government basis and it is very important that the Ministers responsible take a proactive role. It is my belief-obviously I do not have the time to make a long speech on this-that a little diplomatic wisdom by some Ministers could well overcome the problems we have with Libya, for example, and reopen our live sheep trade there. It has the potential to take some one million sheep per annum. We can go through the various countries one at a time. </PARA>
<PARA> I am certain that there are actions that can be taken in terms of the Saudi Arabia situation. Once again, they have to be taken by the top level of government. It is a fact of life that those countries do not deal with lower levels. One thing that certainly damaged our relationship with Saudi Arabia had nothing to do with disease; it was a dumping action brought by the Australian cement company over the importation of clinker into Australia. The action was dismissed some nine months later but, nonetheless, the clinker from the royal family's operation in Saudi Arabia was tied up for nine months. These are some of the things that need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the wool industry, I think it is very important that the necessity for some lateral thinking and for pressure to be put in this area be recognised. Once again I emphasise, as I did recently in this chamber, that on 24 August I wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and made a suggestion to him in good faith that we put in place a commercial task force of successful businessmen and get them to go around the world to look for niche markets. Once again I emphasise the importance of doing these types of things so that we can compete with New Zealand and other countries in a constructive way. </PARA>
<PARA> Tied up with that, it is very important that we have a strategy as to where and how we can assist in credit sales: what opportunities there are for barter; the role of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation in covering some credit sales; and what part investment from the industry itself can play in assisting sales. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems absolutely crazy to me that currently in the wool industry, for every bale that goes into the stockpile there is a cost of $850. Within two years, $300 of that $850 will have disappeared because of interest and storage costs. It seems to me that it would be a far more constructive and better investment to put that $300 into the pipeline rather than having it paid to banks and warehouses. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make some comments on the meat industry situation, about which I have asked a number of questions in recent times in the Senate. The current situation that is developing in our meat industry is of major concern to me. It could well be said that I should have made these comments when we were considering the Industrial Relations portfolio, but I thought it was better to mention them during consideration of the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio because the impact at the producer level of this type of disputation is often forgotten. The bottom line is that, at the end of the day, the producers are the ones who suffer, miss out on export sales and have their program disrupted in terms of turn-off. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to emphasise-this may not always be well understood by a lot of people-that there is only one oppor- tunity when livestock can be turned off for slaughter, and that is when the animal is ready. It cannot be done two or three weeks down the track because of delays due to industrial disruption or some other reason. There is only one opportunity. Delays have a very disruptive and costly impact on the individual producer. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note the drop in exports out of Victoria that has occurred in the last 18 months. Of course, that has a flow-on effect through all of the other States in terms of setting the market price achieved at the saleyards and elsewhere. I am bitterly disappointed by the situation at the moment. In Victoria two days ago Premier Kirner said that this was a Federal problem. In this chamber, the Minister said that the Government was not prepared to intervene and that the resolution of the problem should be left to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Yesterday, Deputy President Riordan adjourned the case because the relevant officers of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU) were overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we have a tripartite buck-passing exercise going on while the meat industry in this country is being very seriously and consistently undermined. In my view, there has been a total abuse of the directions given by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I find that very disturbing and I believe that the Government needs to play a much more positive role in resolving this matter and getting the meatworks operating again. </PARA>
<PARA> I can supply information-it is well documented-which shows that the various systems that operate elsewhere produce killing rates per animal in the order of 50 per cent of the cost in Australia. We do not need any further trips overseas, junkets or whatever one wants to call them, to get that information. We know what the situation is, and I am quite certain that officers of the Minister's Department, the AMIEU and the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia are well aware of the situation overseas. The problem could be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> What saddens me so much about the meat industry is that it needs to be recognised that it is one of our most important industries. One has only to look at the contribution made by the producers, the employment opportunities offered and its importance in terms of exports. I refer particularly to the Asian market. It is worth noting that every 18 months economic growth in Asia is equal in size to the economy of Japan. We need to position ourselves so that we can take advantage of developments there. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very important that we apply lateral thinking to overcome some of the problems in the live sheep trade and the wool industry. I do not believe that they are insurmountable, but I certainly believe that they have not been addressed thoroughly or effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the meat industry, if we have an industrial relations system-and I do not necessarily agree with all aspects of it-which is administered by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, it is important that the people involved respect the decisions of the Commission. If they do not respect the system, it is important that the Government take an active role in doing whatever it can to bring that issue to a head and make sure that those people who are irresponsible are brought to account. </PARA>
<PARA> The unfortunate thing about this is that in a very short time the matter will be referred to our civil courts and elsewhere. That will lead to long, drawn-out damages claims. While part of the problem will be solved in the longer term, it will cause additional disruption, which is about the last thing we want at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crane did not really ask a question. I should acknowledge that Senator Crane made what I thought was a considered and balanced contribution to the debate about how we should promote Australia overseas and how we should try to obtain greater niche marketing of Australian products, particularly of live sheep to the Persian Gulf, wool and other matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since he spoke not as a politician trying to score cheap points in a political argument but rather as a representative of rural Australia, bringing some criticisms certainly of the Government but as well of rural and farmer-based organisations for their lack of activity, I was going to pay him the compliment of saying that I would pass on his remarks to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and see that he was made aware of the views that Senator Crane has about that, because this Government does stand ready to explore whatever avenue there might be in order to promote agricultural trade abroad. Any contribution to that debate is a worthwhile one. I think Senator Crane has made a worthwhile contribution to it today. </PARA>
<PARA> The meat industry dispute is a matter that he and I have jousted about in Question Time. The Question Time format, whereby a strictly formed question has to be asked and answered within the limitations of the question asked, is not necessarily a format which enables discussion of the point. Senator Crane has entered into a discussion of his concerns for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA> If I can identify those concerns, they are that, taking a producer's view, he is frustrated by the level of industrial disputation which lowers the value of the carcass to the producer because of the delay between the turning off of that sheep or cow to the time that it is slaughtered, dressed and ready for market. I can understand that. The Government for its part has a similar view. We, too, are frustrated by the level of industrial disputation. We do not like to see our trade account damaged in any way. Our political life to some extent depends on the trade account not being damaged, so we have real self-interest as well as genuine concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The difference between us, if I can put it to Senator Crane in the open way in which he has ventilated his views, is not of concern. That is not the difference. The difference between us is how these matters are best resolved. One view is that they are resolved by inflicting penalties: bringing the full force of civil law to bear and to fine massively or gaol people. The other course is to let the arbitration system work properly, because I think and fear that the first course is often a course that starts from the presumption that one side is always right. </PARA>
<PARA> Where an industry has a high level of industrial conflict, like the meat industry unfortunately has, I find in my experience that both sides are a mirror image of one another. That is not to say anything about the grower, but at the level of the abattoir, the abattoir management and the meatworkers tend to reflect the worst traits of each other. There is no perfect, snow white purity on one side and complete blame on the other; both are equally guilty of mismanaging the industrial relations in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, to bring the full force of pains and penalties on one side is in itself inequitable. The difference between us is in how we manage industrial relations to achieve a better outcome. Since Deputy President Riordan has obtained an undertaking that there will be no disputation, since he has set a daily review of what is in fact going on, and since he has set a date for hearing and determination of the claim, I think it is fair to say that the arbitration system is working. We should give it room to work properly. We can sit in the grandstand and look at the field of play and criticise the umpire, but he is right there where the play is and in the best position to make a decision, and we should give him room to do so in this industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I have to say to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) in this respect is, `Come off it'. Deputy President Riordan gave a direction just over two weeks ago that there was to be no strike action. The Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU) with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) entered into an agreement when the meat inquiry was put in place. The Minister was right yesterday when he said that there was an agreement then and there will be a daily review. All of these things have passed before us and there has been total abuse of the Industrial Relations Commission in this respect. I believe that when the AMIEU did not honour its commitment in terms of what it said to Justice Maddern, it was fair and reasonable that the junket, as I call it, overseas should have been cancelled immediately because that is being paid for by taxpayers. I cannot accept that particular argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister knows as well as I do who plays the game in terms of the union movement and who plays the game in terms of the employer organisations. I have to say to the Minister that, quite frankly, Wally Curran and his boys are one group who can be described as nothing but industrial bandits when it comes to this situation. They have a long track record of abuse. The Minister has been involved in it and I have been involved in it. One cannot describe them as anything else but industrial bandits. We must come to grips with this issue. As I said, Deputy President Riordan got this commitment yesterday, but what happened to the direction a fortnight ago? What happened to the agreement that was reached when the meat inquiry was put in place? They are not worth the paper they are written on. I do not want to say any more about it now, but the attitude that is being adopted here disappoints me greatly. I believe in fair play and honesty; neither of those exist in this particular case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to support my colleague Senator Winston Crane on the matter of the meat industry. We can sit here all day and debate the situation of industrial relations concerning the rural industry. We know we can harvest a wheat crop and store it while waiting for an industrial relations problem to pass. We can shear wool off sheep and store it and do the same. We can even do it in the dairy industry. We can milk and put the milk into the freezers, or the chillers in this case, and we can wait and hopefully the industrial disputation eventually will be resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But when it comes to meat, as Senator Crane points out, it is vastly different. When a beast gets to a certain situation it has to be killed. Otherwise, as pointed out, it loses value; it gets too old to make that particular grade; or other stock on the farm are coming on and have to be put into different paddocks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister must remember that at present in the rural industry the beef trade is the high point. It has to be protected to a certain degree. The Minister can probably remember the 1971-I think it was-famous Midland abattoir strike. He would have been around the industrial relations sector at the time. The Midland abattoir was shut down for eight or nine months and farmers have certainly never forgotten that. I can remember that a lot of good beef cattle had to be put in the backblocks and was virtually useless the year after; not only had it become too old to make the grade but the price had dropped right back. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the meat trade, or the killing of meat, almost gets into the essential services situation; the whole industrial system in the meatworks and the abattoirs has to be looked at to sort out the problems. These problems in abattoirs have been going on as long as I have been around, so there must be something radically wrong. There have been numerous inquiries. The Government obviously knows that a problem exists; it has to be sorted out. There used to be longstanding arguments in other places-in the shearing industry and on the waterfront, to a certain extent, although the waterfront has a long way to go. I believe the meat industry has been let go long enough. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation we can all remember at Mudginberri-and Senator Crane and Ian McLachlan were involved-where after a long stand-off a good system was arrived at. I believe it is time that the Minister and the Government looked at the rural industry on that basis for the good of not only the meat trade but also those who actually work in the abattoirs. They will finish up just like at Mudginberri: better off than they were before. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know, I just wanted to establish that fact. Senator Crane's question, as I comprehend it, is what benefit is there to the wider community because of these grants; is there a research component, et cetera. The Australian Government makes some money available under the national afforestation program for broad acre plantations of Australian hardwoods to be cropped because of the conflict endemic in the community between the values of industry on one side, based on forest products, and conservation and the environment on the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our Government is committed to the best conservation outcomes that can be achieved consistent with maintaining a balance with the best industry outcomes. In the forestry industry, that means stimulating plantation forestry so that native forests are not relied on wholly and solely as the timber resource for industry. In order to encourage plantation forestry, we make some funds available, upon application, for reputable companies to engage in plantation forestry. It is my understanding that those funds are meant to be catalytic; that is to say, to stimulate investment in broad acre forestry and not to pay for the whole bill of goods but to encourage private investment to go down that route and to provide some initial impetus for that. </PARA>
<PARA> We see it as part of the broader objective of providing a secure resource base for industry, taking pressure off native forests, resolving the debate between industry and the environment, and helping achieve a better outcome for workers in the industry as well as for our export related component of that industry. There is no specific research requirement on people who receive these grants, but the wider issues are quite important. </PARA>

I was told that a report was to be submitted to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in November.

But the matter is itself under report and there will be a report in due course. </PARA>

I was emphasising the importance of having industry representation in the scrutiny, management and placement of that process.

However, I do look forward to the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I move now to subprogram 2.1, farm plans. While I have no intention of speaking to it today-I will do so at the appropriate time-I want to take the opportunity in committee to say how pleased I was with the annual report of the Soil Conservation Advisory Committee, and to congratulate the people who put together that report. It is a very good and precise report that outlines very clearly the situation facing that Committee at this particular time. As we all know, it has a very important function to carry out. </PARA>

That was subject to an approved farm plan. At that time I noted that there was no effective mechanism for getting approved farm plans in place. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia, approval is given under the auspices of the Commissioner of Soil Conservation but because of resourcing problems, it could take two, three, four or five years on his projections. I understand the situation is similar in other States but I am not totally familiar with their situation. The Minister indicated that he was looking at the matter and that he had some thoughts and ideas on it. I ask the Minister to indicate whether any progression has been made at this stage because if none has been made then the provision made in the Budget subjecting land-holders to that whole farm plan provision does not mean a thing. </PARA>

If that particular requirement stays in place, I think there should be some method of exemption of that requirement for land-holders, whether they be farmers or pastoralists, who have carried out conservation works, who have made application to have a whole farm plan approved and because of lack of resources have not been able to be put it in place.</PARA></TALK.START>

Bearing in mind that the Minister now knows a great deal more about the rural crisis than he could have known when the Budget was struck back in the winter recess, does he think that that Budget item will suffice, given the increases contained in the Budget are for rural adjustment and services and not only for rural producers?</PARA></TALK.START>

It relates to the questions and discussion that we had in Estimates Committee A over the Midford case and the Australian Customs Service. I do not wish to reiterate all the discussions that took place in Estimates Committee A, but there is one matter in particular that I want to get a little more clarification on. That relates to the amount of compensation that has been paid to Midford Paramount Pty Ltd. At page 644 of the Estimates Committee A Hansard it is recorded that one of the departmental officers, Mr Strang, told the Committee that the figure was roughly $800,000.

The Minister will recall that during the Estimates hearings the key departmental officer concerned with the case-or one of the key officers-a Mr Bissaker, was not present. I think he had gone overseas on the day of the Estimates hearing. His replacement for the purpose of the Estimates Committee hearing, Mr Strang, had not been briefed by Mr Bissaker on the issues likely to be raised before Mr Bissaker went overseas. I think that is a matter of concern. We discussed it in the hearings. It was obvious that this case would be raised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without being political about it, it raises a very important point in relation to the conduct of the Estimates committees and the value that we and, through us, the community rightly expect to get out of those hearings. If people come along who have not been adequately briefed, for whatever reason, then it obviously detracts a great deal from the value that the Parliament and therefore the community get from the conduct of the Estimates committee hearings and the conduct of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Chairman, I believe that this is a matter of serious concern. It happens on not infrequent occasions. Fortunately it is not the norm-it is the exception rather than the rule-but it certainly does happen from time to time. This was a very notable example of a breakdown somewhere along the line. I hope that the Government and the Minister will be able to set the Committee's mind at rest as to why that happened and that we will be able to get an assurance from the Government that similar occurrences will not happen in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I want briefly to raise again the question of consultants used by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce (DITAC), which was referred to in the Committee's report. It is important that the chamber be aware that DITAC spent no less than $8.14m on external consultancies last year. That included a figure of about $1.2m on the multifunction polis, half a million dollars or so on the Australian Manufacturing Council and half a million dollars or thereabouts on the new enterprise incentive scheme, and there were many others as well. </PARA>
<PARA> When we discussed this in Estimates, the Minister said that he thought the total amount had been increased by the rather special one-off consultancies to which I had referred during the questions, and obviously that is the case. What did not come out of the Estimates hearings is the Government's policy in relation to the use of consultants: whether any restraints are imposed on expenditure on external consultancies; how that is monitored; and whether the expenditure on external consultancies is looked at in any way in relation to the resources available within the Department, and I presume it is. If so, I would be very interested to know how the two relate because, as I say, $8.14m in anybody's language would be seen to be a large amount to spend on external consultancies, given the resources not only within the Department proper but also within its very important outriders and the other outriders of government. I would welcome some elaboration on that. </PARA>

<PARA>No. Each committee has a budget and it determines how it will use it. </PARA>

<PARA>And they can decide how they use it.

That matter was raised in the hearings on 18 September, as recorded at pages 136 and 137. It relates to the $38,635 paid by DITAC to Messrs Ernst and Whinney to prepare a fraud control plan for the Department. I was very pleased to hear from the Minister and the departmental officers at the time that there had been no fraud perpetrated on DITAC to their knowledge and that they were doing this to prevent fraud occurring. What I was not so pleased about was the response I received to some of the questions I put a little later as we examined that matter. I asked Mr Palfreyman:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>What specific procedural changes will result from the recommendations of the consultants?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was classic Yes, Minister. Mr Palfreyman replied:</PARA>
<PARA>I think it will raise the question of fraud and fraud awareness within the Department. We now have a regular mechanism, if you like, to talk about fraud and fraud control measures. That is something which is quite different from the situation that existed 18 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA>Great! The Department is now going to talk about fraud control measures. But that is not really satisfactory; that is not why we pay $38,000 to consultants to prepare a fraud control program. I asked Mr Palfreyman again:</PARA>
<PARA>I want to know what specific procedural mechanisms had been put in place as a result of the consultants' recommendations. I am not interested in awareness campaigns. I am interested in how you have changed your operational procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Palfreyman replied:</PARA>
<PARA>We do not actually have any changed procedures yet in place. </PARA>

<PARA>Are you going to change any procedures as a result of this?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report dealt with our discussions in the Estimates Committee concerning Treasury economic forecasts. The Minister may recall that we had a very interesting discussion in terms of the impact on the Budget forecasts and Budget figures of the oil price increase-which of course had not occurred at the time the Budget was framed. The Budget was framed on the basis of a $US23 forecast for oil per barrel. We discussed that at some length and, in the end, the Deputy Secretary, Mr John Fraser, pointed out that one gets an impact on both the revenue and the expenditure side and that at that stage he was unable to give a sensible answer on the extent to which the impact on the expenditure side was offset over time by the impact on the revenue side because it was a highly complex calculation. I would certainly agree with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noted, therefore, with interest the statement subsequently-two or three weeks later-by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) when he said at a press conference on 20 November 1990 that the cost to the revenue of the tax cuts that were to be made from 1 January would `roughly cancel out' the boost to the Budget from higher oil revenues. Obviously, there must have been some additional work done or information available to the Treasury between the time of the Estimates hearing and two or three weeks later when the Treasurer made that statement to enable him to say that, given that the Treasury was unable to give such an answer at the time of the hearings. I wonder whether the Minister wishes to comment on that. </PARA>

Of course, the whole purpose of putting questions on notice beforehand is to give officers an opportunity to provide more details on areas to which they feel unable to reply without further information or details at the hearing. But I would have to say that the lack of response by the Treasury officers in this instance-the honourable senator might recall that it concerned the general question of prudential arrangements and supervisory arrangements-related also to some important issues that have been very much in the public domain in recent times. The whole question of the Commonwealth Bank's purchase of the State Bank of Victoria and the Commonwealth's involvement or otherwise with the events surrounding the Pyramid Building Society collapse were the two main ones, but there were some other specific cases as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that Treasury's failure to provide meaningful answers, not only in response to questions that were put on notice but also in response to the questions that were raised in the Committee-although it might have been a wonderful job of obfuscation and Treasury bureaucratic stonewalling-very seriously obstructed the important democratic process of parliamentary scrutiny. The answers I received were gratuitous, they failed to produce any real information, and they were totally unhelpful. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that on future occasions those who sit at the table as Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries guiding the questions in Estimates committees will look at this matter. If they do not, we will be spending a lot of time in committees which are supposed to be ascertaining material of interest and importance to the Parliament and not doing so. I hope that we do not see a repeat in future of what happened at least in that part of the hearings. I say that, in the overall context of what were very good examinations of the departments of Finance and Treasury, there were some black spots-particularly the one I have referred to. I hope that I will not have to make a similar criticism in the future. </PARA>

I am advised that it was made clear at the time-on 28 August the Treasurer (Mr Keating) spoke of this-that where State privatisations take place the framework that has been applied to the State Bank of Victoria situation is a framework of general application, and that information has been made available to at least Premier Greiner and perhaps to others who applied. Without being able to talk about the detail, the framework, the general approach, will be considered to be one of general application in the case of State privatisations, but I do not think it is so directly relevant to our own asset sales.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a different subject, I asked in the Estimates Committee hearing on 3 October whether the Treasury had received any representations seeking exemption from the resource rent tax for petroleum feed stocks. The answer at that time was that the Treasury had received a copy of one representation to the Minister for Resources requesting an exemption for gas and ethane. I then mentioned to the Estimates Committee that the resource rent tax proposal would have some important implications for user industries, particularly industries using Bass Strait gas. It will have the effect of a significant increase in the price of gas in Victoria because gas, in effect, has not been subject to tax. Bass Strait gas had not been subject to it because the royalty arrangements applied only to Bass Strait oil. Gas users in Victoria will be hit by the resource rent tax decision to apply to Bass Strait. Hit even more will be those industries which use Bass Strait gas as a feed stock.</PARA></TALK.START>

Since 3 October when this matter was raised in the Estimates Committee has the Treasury received any further representations and has the matter been looked at in any detail as a result of my questions or any other representations coming its way?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the privileges that we as parliamentarians have is that we have an opportunity to become familiar with some of Australia's greatest treasures. In the last week, in the company of the Hon. Fred Chaney, the shadow Minister for the environment, I had the privilege of inspecting some of the rainforests and other natural wonders of far north Queensland. One of the things that became abundantly clear to me was that, whilst many of our rainforests and other natural treasures must be preserved, they must never be preserved in such a way as to lock them away from the ordinary Australian family. At times during the last week I was disturbed by some of the more radical proposals for preservation of our rainforests and our other geographical heritages, in that they might be locked away from the ordinary Australian and become accessible only to those who fortuitously do not have to work for a living and who can take the many weeks off that are necessary to trudge through the beautiful nature spots that are our rainforests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the four days I spent with Fred Chaney touring north Queensland we had the opportunity of having discussions with many Australians from many very differing outlooks and backgrounds. The divergence of views about what should be done in the future was quite remarkable-and I might say a little perplexing for a politician; but all with whom we spoke had the interests of Australia at heart. But each person came from a position which he or she perceived to be in Australia's best interest. </PARA>
<PARA> We were privileged to have had discussions with councillors of the Douglas Shire Council, who kindly provided transport for us along the road from Mossman and the Daintree area through to Cape Tribulation and on to the Bloomfield River. We traversed the track that excited so much media attention in the past. However, a sensible debate has now developed between the many parties, all attempting to find out just what is the best way to handle the situation of that road from Cape Tribulation to the Bloomfield River that was the subject of so much media attention some years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We were able to talk to groups of environmentalists, who had very definite and reasoned views on why the road should be closed, and also with other people who live in the area and care about the environment and who consider that the road is there and that what should be done is to make sure that it is used and maintained. If the road were maintained there would be less run-off and fewer side effects that may damage the fragile environment in the area. We spoke with many businessmen who considered that the road should be shut-and many ordinary Australians who considered that it should be open. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Chaney, our shadow environment spokesman, will formulate a position for consideration by the coalition at a later time. But my impression-and I say this not wanting to reopen any of the wounds which may have been cut at the time the road was first opened-is that, as it would seem that the road is in place, what we have to do is make sure that it is maintained in such a way as not to cause any damage to the environment but so that it will provide a ready access to our rainforest treasures for ordinary Australians who want to travel up to those more spectacular parts of far north Queensland. I am conscious that the road does give the opportunity to ordinary Australians to visit these areas-an opportunity which would be denied if the road were not there. </PARA>
<PARA> During our visit north of Cairns, I was also pleased to find that, against the gloom and doom that besets other parts of Australia, the Sheraton Mirage Resort at Port Douglas was exhibiting an 80 per cent occupancy in November-a truly remarkable feat and one that has obviously been achieved by some very intense and skilful marketing overseas by that organisation. So it does show that, when times are tough, if the tough get going they can succeed. I can only congratulate the management of that resort for getting out and getting their customers in. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an enormous diversity of tourist destinations in far north Queensland, and I should mention one in particular that gave me a great deal of pleasure. It was a man-made rainforest habitat operated by some very enterprising people in the Port Douglas area. They have built acres of shade cloth under which they have planted and grown a real-life rainforest complete with running water. They have within this enclosure a myriad of different species of butterflies and bird life. But I might add that none of those have been captured wild; they all are home bred. It gives tourists a first-hand experience of just some of the many hundreds of brilliant and interesting creatures, birds and butterflies that our nation can be so proud of and is so lucky to have. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take a couple of minutes of the Senate's time to tell of a very moving experience that I had in this rainforest habitat-an experience that will be one of the most memorable in my life. We were followed within this rainforest enclosure by a little flying bat, who loved people and almost-I stress almost-made a nuisance of himself by wanting to be with the action and to follow people around as they walked through this area. The bat was so friendly and made a point of landing on visitors and showing his affection when he was pampered in the right way. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I have lived in north Queensland all my life and been very familiar with the bats flying out of mango trees as a flitting shape across the darkened sky, I had never had the opportunity of getting close to them. I was quite surprised to find that they are really very friendly and intelligent little creatures with quite a remarkable make-up, a remarkable build. Really, if one were inclined that way-I suggest that many would not be, and I also suggest that it would be improper-they would make great companions for mankind. </PARA>
<PARA> While we were in the Cairns area with Mr Chaney, we took the opportunity of discussing environmental matters with the Cairns Environment Centre officials and the rainforest management unit which is being funded by the Commonwealth Government to the extent of about $10m in this year's Budget. This unit is in a transition stage, in the course of being handed over to the Wet Tropics Management Authority-also a government authority being set up jointly by the Queensland Government and the Federal Government. The officials working in the rainforest management unit are very dedicated to their task. They are very knowledgeable, but they have some problems in that they are lacking in any direction from above and there is an uncertainty hanging over the future of those people. I do think that the Wet Tropics Management Authority, the Commonwealth and State governments should bring some finality to that, should appoint a director to the Wet Tropics Management Authority and coordinate those groups as quickly as possible. As things are running now, there is a problem with the direction of that organisation and it should be solved at an early date by the governments involved. </PARA>
<PARA> During my time in the Senate, I have taken a particular interest in the north Queensland space base. It was interesting for me, with Mr Chaney, to extend this knowledge by meeting with the Cairns based Cape York space base working party which is an offshoot group of the Cairns Chamber of Commerce. The establishment of the space base would propel Australia into the forefront of science and technology into the next century and would also create much needed jobs and impetus to development in far north Queensland. There are many people working hard on expanding their knowledge and awareness of the space base and also considering environmental matters and questions of traditional land ownership. I can only urge the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland State Government to set more realistic timetables as time is running out for the space base project to become a reality. Unless the current Cape York land use survey is quickly finished, and the environmental impact studies hurried up and finished at an early time, it would seem that Australia may miss out on this project-one which could be of worldwide significance. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the greatest problems facing those trying to grasp the issues of the space base is to determine the question of traditional land ownership. This, of course, needs some investigation, some clarification and some ground rules to be set with the groups with which the proponents of the space base are to deal. I understand that that is one of the problems at present; that the people wanting to proceed further, wanting to do environmental studies, wanting to talk with the traditional land owners, cannot find a traditional land owner with whom they can speak. There are some groups that have been approached that have refused to talk, to discuss it. Even if someone could be found to discuss it with the proponents of the space base, there is no certainty that one would be talking with the right person. I think it is very important for the Queensland Government and the Commonwealth Government, if it has some input into it, to set the guidelines more clearly so that those wishing to establish the space base will know with whom they can speak and that, when they have made agreements with those parties, those agreements will be binding. </PARA>
<PARA> I finally mention in relation to the space base that I saw in press reports in yesterday's and today's papers that, following the withdrawal of the Essington Corporation from the project, many new different groups are interested in tendering for the Cape York space base project. I also note with some interest that one of the tenderers, a group in which the former Queensland Premier, Mr Ahern, is involved, has indicated a great interest in it. But he has also said that the base may not necessarily proceed at the Temple Bay site, which had been identified by the Cape York Space Agency Pty Ltd, which has been doing the work so far and which was a creation of Essington. So, although a lot of work has been done on the Temple Bay site, it is clear from the press reports and from what Mr Ahern is reported as saying that the Temple Bay site may not necessarily be the site. </PARA>
<PARA> There were a certain number of reasons why that site was chosen. One of them was so that the rockets would go off over the sea rather than over land and so that no-one would be inconvenienced. The Temple Bay site has sea access that would be suitable and also comprises land which is of fairly poor quality. It is not a rainforest, as many people might think it is because it is up in Cape York. It is not as was portrayed on a disgraceful 60 Minutes program on that particular matter, with lots of natural wonderments and heritages there. It is really very low saltbush, scrubby sort of country which barely carries one beast to 20 hectares. It is very poor country indeed. That was one of the reasons why the Cape York Space Agency Pty Ltd originally chose that site. But it is interesting to see that other sites may well be looked at now, and there may not be as many problems with the traditional land owners in other sites being looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are some of the things that were of interest in an environmental way and a development way in far north Queensland that I was pleased to show to Mr Fred Chaney. There were a number of other things that we looked at while there, one particularly dealing with the Tully Falls-Millstream Falls hydro-electric project, and I will be saying something about that a later stage. I thought, as a matter of public interest, that those things-the natural treasures, the great wonderment of the rainforests and other tourist destinations in far north Queensland, and the work that is being done on the space base in that part of the world-would also be of interest to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, in my contribution this afternoon I intend to outline the danger that new electoral boundaries in Queensland, the State I represent, will not shed the cloak of malapportionment that has for so long blighted Queensland's electoral system. If this possibility is not thwarted it will be a massive disappointment for those who have fought hard and long, sometimes against almost insurmountable odds, to rid Queensland of a rotten electoral system, a system which was deliberately designed to boost the opportunity for a particular party to remain in power. That party, of course, was the now discredited National Party in Queensland, and the electoral system was commonly referred to as a gerrymander. Even though that term is not strictly technically correct in the context of Queensland's electoral boundaries, its use was a clear indication of the deep lack of confidence Queensland residents had in their system of electing parliamentary representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the time of Queensland's 1989 election there was a groundswell of opinion for the introduction of an electoral system based on the principle of one vote one value. It is generally accepted that in a system of single member constituencies for enrolments in individual electorates, a tolerance of plus or minus 10 per cent may be regarded as a one vote one value electoral system. This is a fairly liberal tolerance and some observers believe that a 5 per cent tolerance may be more appropriate. After all, with a 10 per cent tolerance either way-that is, from 90 per cent to 110 per cent-it is possible for one electorate to have an enrolment 22 per cent higher than another. It is now history that in the 1989 State election Labor secured 50.3 per cent of the primary vote and about 54.3 per cent of the two-party preferred vote and, in doing so, overcame the State's malapportioned electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA> On assuming government, Labor, under the leadership of Premier Wayne Goss, established the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission, usually referred to as the EARC. The EARC's duties included a review of the State's malapportioned electoral system. Before discussing the EARC's findings, I shall outline Labor's policy in regard to electoral justice in Queensland. The policy is quite specific. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Labor believes that the essence of representative democracy is an electoral system based on the principle of one vote one value. To this end Labor will institute an independent electoral commission which will establish fair electoral boundaries based on geographical community and population factors, with an optional preferential system of voting with a 10 per cent tolerance. There will be no electoral zones. </PARA>
<PARA>Like all the major parties, Labor made a submission to the Commission. The EARC, however, was not obliged to bring down a report based on Labor policy, even though Labor is in government in Queensland. Nevertheless, although some parts of Labor's submission were not accepted by the Commission, Labor Party members in Queensland are able to accept comfortably almost all of the key points of the EARC's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The key recommendations are continuation of single member electorates; compulsory enrolment and compulsory voting; optional preferential voting; an average of about 20,000 voters per electorate with a 10 per cent tolerance amongst electorates; an electoral weighting for electorates more than 100,000 square kilometres in area; the number of members of State Parliament to remain at the current level of 89; an independent redistribution commission to determine electoral boundaries; the early appointment of a Queensland electoral commissioner who will be the chief executive of a Queensland electoral commission; and the State Education Department to give priority to electoral and citizenship education for primary and secondary schools. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of these recommendations go a long way towards meeting the urgent public demand for a fair electoral system in Queensland, one based on the principle of one vote one value. But the Commission's recommendation to weight electorates more than 100,000 square kilometres in area is a serious flaw. What the EARC's proposal would do, if adopted, would be to create a two-zone electoral system. It is simply not possible to have a one vote one value electoral system with two zones having different quotas in the different zones. It would not be correct for the Queensland Parliament to accept this part of the Commission's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The EARC's basic proposal in relation to weighting is to add what have been termed phantom voters to the enrolment in electorates with an area of 100,000 square kilometres or more. The number of phantom voters may be up to 2 per cent of the electorate's area. Thus, for example, an electorate of 150,000 square kilometres may have 3,000 phantom voters added to its enrolment. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it incredible that this idea had its genesis in a proposal made by a well-known member of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland, Councillor Noel Robertson. According to the EARC's report, Councillor Robertson proposed his own hybrid suggestion to the EARC. His method absolves certain electorates from adhering to an electoral system based on the principle of one vote one value. </PARA>
<PARA> I have always enjoyed good relations with Councillor Robertson, who is Chairman of the Cloncurry Shire Council, but on this occasion I must totally disagree with him. I cannot accept that he was unaware of Labor policy. He was Labor's candidate for the seat of Flinders at the 1989 election, so he should have had more than a passing knowledge of Labor policy. When I have the opportunity, I shall determine whether he sought permission from his own Party to propose his harebrained scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I also find it incredible that the distinguished commissioners of the EARC would consider this proposal worthy of comment, let alone suggest that their two-zone recommendation should be passed into law. Surely they knew the strength of feeling against zonal systems in Queensland, with the votes of some citizens being of greater value than others simply because of their geographical location. The EARC protests that it has not recommended a two-zonal system, but it has. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth while looking at what the EARC's proposal would mean in concrete terms. The figures I am about to outline are based on data and analyses of those data provided to me by the statistics group of the Parliamentary Library. I am indebted to that group for its assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the existing boundaries, four Queensland State electorates are over 100,000 square kilometres in area. These are Flinders, 199,000 square kilometres; Warrego, 225,500 square kilometres; Cook, 350,750 square kilometres; and Gregory, 443,250 square kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA> The EARC's proposals would result in a quota per electorate of about 20,000 voters. Assuming this figure of 20,000 with a 10 per cent variation, enrolments could vary from 18,000 to 22,000 voters. I seek leave, Madam Acting Deputy President, to incorporate in Hansard a table which illustrates how the proposals would affect these four electorates. I have in fact cleared this table with the Whips from both sides of the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. This table reveals that the number of phantom voters in those four electorates are 3,950 for Flinders; 4,450 for Warrego; 7,015 for Cook; and 8,865 for Gregory. If these phantom voters are deducted from 18,000, the lowest allowable enrolment for electorates, it may be seen that the number of real voters required for each electorate is 14,020 for Flinders; 13,550 for Warrego; 10,985 for Cook and 9,135 for Gregory. Taking into account these electorates' existing enrolments, Flinders and Warrego would need additional real voters to make up the least possible quota of 18,000 voters. Cook would be able to shed over 2,000 of its existing enrolment and Gregory would give about 1,000 of its real voters to another electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With other electorates, the possible enrolment may vary from 18,000 to 22,000. The ratio of the lowest to the highest possible enrolment is 1 : 1.22. Put another way, a vote in the electorate with the lower enrolment is worth 1.22 times the worth of a vote in the electorate with the higher enrolment. As I mentioned earlier, this type of variation in a one vote one value system of electorates is usually regarded as acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> The ratios of real voters in the four electorates being discussed to the highest possible number of electors in other State electorates are not acceptable. They are 1.57 for Flinders, 1.62 for Warrego, 2.00 for Cook and 2.41 for Gregory. Should the EARC's suggestion for remote areas be given any credence when it allows for possibilities of votes in one area being worth two and more times the value of votes in other areas? My response is that it should not. This is the very defect in the current zonal system that Queensland electors want to see removed. I have discussed the probable consequences of the EARC's proposals on those four State electorates, which currently have an area of 100,000 square kilometres or more. Nevertheless, under the proposals more than four electorates could be over 100,000 square kilometres in area. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also worth noting that three Federal electorates in Queensland exceed 100,000 square kilometres in area: Leichhardt, 141,300 square kilometres; Maranoa, 625,200 square kilometres; and Kennedy, 772,000 square kilometres. None is weighted with phantom voters and there is rarely, if ever, any clamour that the Federal representatives in those electorates have areas too large to cover adequately. To suggest, as the EARC does, that these representatives have 12 senators to assist them is also totally misleading. If the EARC believes that this is so, it does not understand the reality of Federal politics. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my understanding that the EARC report is to be examined by the Parliamentary Electoral and Administrative Review Committee. It will then be considered by the Government. I would urge the parliamentary committee to consider the adverse consequences of the weighting proposal. Just because the EARC has made a recommendation to have two classes of electorates does not mean that the idea is sound. My assessment is that the weighting proposal should be rejected and the State Government should take this opportunity to reject this aspect of the EARC's advice. If it does not, an unacceptable zonal component will remain an unpalatable feature of the Queensland electoral system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Before commenting on the two subjects I wish to raise in this discussion of matters of public interest, could I just say that the hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party knows no bounds when it comes to electoral boundaries and redistribution. Members of the Labor Party claim to be whiter than white but they ignore reality. The reality in South Australia is that although at the last State election the Liberal Party obtained 52.5 per cent of the vote and the Labor Party 47.5 per cent, unfortunately the Liberal Party was unable to form government. So Labor members cannot stand up in this House or any other House in Australia and claim to be the advocates of one vote one value and fair electoral systems. The fact is that they do not practise what they preach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to refer to two important issues related to, firstly, the Australian economy and, secondly, a business in South Australia. On many occasions during the past few months we have asked the Government to release a report entitled the Sheridan report. It is now well past the stage where the non-appearance of that report can be treated as being above suspicion. It is a matter of great public interest that a report commissioned by the Government which then tells the Government facts it does not want to hear can be hidden, as this one has been. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sheridan report is an independent review of the Australian Audit Office. The Government is deliberately keeping this report under wraps. It was delivered to the Government by the due date- 31 March 1990. We have now been waiting eight months for its release. Media speculation about the report grows daily. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had the ridiculous situation of having two government reports released recently which actually comment on the findings of the Sheridan report. The annual report of the Australian National Audit Office makes mention of the Sheridan report. The report of the independent auditor, Mr Michael Sharpe, also makes mention of the Sheridan report. I am delighted that this means that at least someone has seen the report. But the fact is that those who should see the report have not. This Parliament and the public have not seen it. That is what counts. That is what is called accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> So what is in the report that is so difficult for the Government to accept? What is in this report that needs to be hidden? The history of the man who prepared the report, and the reasons he was commissioned to produce it, give us some of the clues to that. Tom Sheridan is the retired Auditor-General of my home State, South Australia, and a man respected by all sides of the Parliament. He is a man who knew how to achieve results in South Australia and who, when Auditor-General, managed to increase efficiency auditing of government agencies and bodies while the staff numbers within his department actually decreased. So there we have it-a man who knows and understands the word `productivity' and how to achieve it. </PARA>
<PARA> Is productivity and what it means what this Government is hiding from? I am told that the Sheridan report contradicts a Commonwealth Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommendation for additional funding of $15.7m for the Audit Office. This funding was recommended by the Public Accounts Committee to enable the Audit Office to conduct efficiency audits of government bodies and agencies. However, the Sheridan report not only says that the Audit Office does not need the money to carry out that additional work; it actually states that about 60 full time staff-the equivalent of about $3m a year-from within existing resources of the Audit Office could successfully be redirected to efficiency audits. In other words, not only does the Audit Office not need more money to carry out efficiency auditing; the Sheridan report findings are that, if the Audit Office did not need to take on the extra workload of efficiency audits, it could save $3m and 60 staff. That is the meaning of increased productivity methods. That is the meaning of increased management and control of resources, of better planning of audits. I am also informed that the Sheridan report recommends allowing the Audit Office to charge all government bodies for audits. </PARA>
<PARA> The underhanded treatment of the Sheridan report by the Government suggests that, despite wasting many trees extolling to the nation the values of increased productivity, the Government runs scared as soon as it is confronted with the hard facts of productivity within the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at it this way: the Australian National Audit Office is a relatively small and a supposedly efficient office. Yet, as soon as a man who understands how to achieve productivity gains access to the running of that office, he identifies quite enormous savings to be made. What gains could be achieved from similar reviews of major government agencies such as the departments of Defence, Social Security, Finance and so on? As far as the Government is concerned, it does not bear thinking about; that is why the Sheridan report has not been tabled and presented to this Parliament. It has been kept under wraps, not so much for what it says about the Audit Office but for what it indicates about the Public Service generally. Clearly, vast savings could be made if similar reviews of other government bodies and agencies were carried out to indicate productivity gains. But as far as the Government is concerned, its productivity message to the private sector is, `Do as I say; don't do as I do'. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth Auditor-General, John Taylor, has been reported as follows in the Business Review Weekly:</PARA>
<PARA>``The Sheridan report is positive as far as we're concerned,'' he says. ``It is a good report and it is fair. It has put the acid on us in non-audit areas, where it is harder to get further productivity gains.''</PARA>
<PARA>So we have John Taylor praising the report. No doubt he, too, would be pleased to see a report of which he approves made public. </PARA>
<PARA> How much longer will the Government hide the report from us? Not once in the eight months since the Sheridan report was delivered has a reason been put forward for the delay in its release. It has gone far beyond bearing a report which shows changes that need to be made, need to implemented and need to be put in place. It is at the stage where Parliament is being treated with contempt. It is a matter of public interest that ought to be resolved immediately. Governments are accountable for the spending of taxpayers' money. The Sheridan report has identified where some of that money can be saved; this Parliament has a right to know. That the Sheridan report has identified the tip of the iceberg is all the more the reason for its release-and its release urgently. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another matter of concern to me as it relates to a business operation in South Australia, a private company, free enterprise company, that has launched into the tourism market to service the Kangaroo Island tourism industry in the State of South Australia. Having got the business up and running, very successfully, very professionally and very efficiently, its operators have now run into a brick wall through administrative blunder. The position is that they used to operate ferries known as the Philanderer Ferries. The new name is Kangaroo Island Searoad. They operate two 40-metre ferries with 16 crew between Kangaroo Island and the mainland, and it is a vital link between the mainland and Kangaroo Island-an island that has enormous tourism potential for South Australia and is exceptionally important to our State's tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> In April this year they were granted by the South Australian Corporate Affairs Commission registration of the business name Kangaroo Island Searoad. They went ahead and put in place this particular enterprise, this facility. They undertook an extensive launch of Kangaroo Island Searoad, put in place its vessels, equipped its crew with uniforms, printed brochures and undertook advertising of its service in the tourism sector. Then, after being in operation for several months, they received correspondence from the Australian Government Solicitor threatening to sue the company for using the name `Searoad', saying that by a 1956 Act the Australian National Line (ANL) has exclusive right to that name. When the 1956 Act was converted in 1988 for public company status of this government quango, that was maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have a situation that a business, in good faith, applied for and obtained registration of a business and trading name, operated for several months and incurred costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars in marketing potential. Two months later, the operators were told that within days they had to take the name off the side of the ferries, to burn all their tickets, all their literature, all their publications, all their brochures and to take the uniforms off the crews servicing the two ships because they have the name `Searoad'. </PARA>
<PARA> But the story gets even more curious. There are other companies trading in Australia already who are using that name. One of them is Searoad Props Pty Ltd. Why has the Australian Government Solicitor written to this one company in South Australia when there are other companies in Australia that have the word `Searoad' in their business name or their trading name? Why has this one company been singled out?</PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian Corporate Affairs Commission had no knowledge that that name was protected. I understand, and the South Australian Attorney-General has indicated in that Parliament, that it is the norm that, where there is a name protected by Act-as is the case with `Searoad' with ANL-that formal advice is given through ministerial council meetings to the relative State authorities so that they are aware of that set of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> In this instance, there was no notification from the Federal authorities to the State authorities that the word `Searoad' was in fact a generic word protected under the Act. Therefore, the Corporate Affairs Commission within South Australia acted in good faith in registering the name-giving the green light for this company to go ahead. Talk about the classic Yes, Minister syndrome: it seems to me to be well and truly to the fore in this circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins, the Minister responsible in the area, has become extremely difficult to contact in the last few weeks to try to clarify this matter for this company. I understand that the matter is currently before the Federal Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). But it happens to fall within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins. I ask the Minister, as a matter of urgency, to give consideration to the plight of this South Australian company. </PARA>
<PARA> If it were not for the ANL Act, the company would be quite entitled to proceed with the name `Kangaroo Island Searoad'. It would be able to continue to provide the service which it put in place in good faith with the support of government instrumentalities. The fact that it now cannot proceed, that there is a stumbling block and that it is being singled out from other Australian companies that use the word `Searoad', is something that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency-particularly when ANL does not use that generic word in any of its advertising or marketing in South Australia. It is not even in the phone book in South Australia. Yet, ANL is objecting to this word being used by a company that operates a short transport link between the mainland and Kangaroo Island in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened raises this question: with the privatisation of Australian Airlines Ltd in due course, will the generic word `airline' be used in legislation and, if it is, what problems will flow from that? So the problem that has been highlighted indicates an area that needs to be addressed quite seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, this company has acted in good faith. It deserves more than the scant regard it is getting at the moment from the Federal ministry. It has a problem on its plate not of its own doing. I think it behoves the Minister, Senator Collins, to address the matter and give a clear indication of what action the Government intends to take either to uphold the Act, amend the Act, or ask ANL to show some commonsense. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.28)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly about the matter that Senator Olsen has raised. It is something that has come to my attention in the last couple of days. We believe that the new Australian Securities Commission legislation will come into effect on 1 January. This whole matter of business names and the particular case of the `Searoad' name in South Australia illustrates one of the major problems that the business community in Australia could suffer from under the new national scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As most honourable senators would know, currently business names are registered in each of the States and Territories under business registration regulations. I would presume that they would probably differ from State to State. I know that in Western Australia the test that the Corporate Affairs Commission would apply to one wanting to register a name is whether or not that name is likely to cause confusion with some other name. Because under the new national scheme we are going to register all business names and company names, particularly company names, in the one data base in Morwell in Victoria, we will have a situation where there will be 800,000 names. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has come to the conclusion, and quite properly, I guess, that we cannot apply a test such as the one I have described-that is, the test of whether a name is likely to cause confusion-with 800,000 companies because it would just be a bureaucratic nightmare to have to review all of these cases. </PARA>
<PARA> So what is likely to happen after 1 January is that across Australia there will be a number of companies-for example, Smith Corporation, Smith Company or Joe's Delicatessen-with similar names registered. This has caused the need to have what we now know as the Australian companies number-that is, a nine-digit number which all companies around Australia are required to have printed on all of their public documents, cheques, letterheads, envelopes, seals and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA> This will potentially cause the sorts of problems for business around Australia that my colleague Senator Olsen has mentioned today. The test that will apply from 1 January is that the Australian Securities Commission will not register a name only if that name is identical to an existing name. So if one were, for example, to have the name `Joe's Cake Shop Pty Ltd' no-one else could go along and register the same name. But if there were a successful cake shop operating somewhere in Australia and someone like Coles or Woolworths, or some other large transnational company, wanted to use, I guess, the goodwill associated with that name, all they would need to do is register a company with some small alteration to the name. They may decide to register `Joe's Cakes Shop' instead of `Joe's Cake Shop'. If they did, they would meet the test which will be applied by the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Another good example is a successful small business or partnership that has a business name registered. Take, for instance, Burley, a very famous manufacturer of footballs from Western Australia, which I understand is just a small family company. If some national, or even international, company wanted to come along and use the goodwill associated with that name, all it would have to do is register a name similar, but not identical, to Burley. This could be done with impunity in relation to the Australian Securities Commission test which is that one cannot register an identical name. One can, however, register a name which is likely to cause confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> Someone like Burley could then enter into a passing-off action and I guess try to sue the international or national company that was trying to use a similar name and steal the goodwill of that company name. However, some small businesses-one-man and two-man trading names, for example-might just not have the resources of the big national and international companies to fight a court battle to protect their goodwill and name. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that is important to make here-and Senator Olsen has made it already-is that under the new Australian Securities Commission regime, which will apply after 1 January, there seems to be one rule for the private sector and one rule for the public sector. The name `Searoad' is being protected by the Government. It is stopping, at great expense, this company in Adelaide from using the name. However, this could not be done in the private sector. I think that is wrong; it is a double standard. It is an area where I believe there will be great confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be great cost to business across this nation when this new scheme comes in and 800,000 companies are all registered on the one register. It will be very expensive. There will be a lot more litigation in relation to passing-off actions. It is hard to estimate what the impact of this one aspect of the Australian Securities Commission legislation will be. But, on all estimations, it will add an enormous amount of bureaucracy. There will be an enormous amount of litigation in relation to company goodwill. The centralising of State corporations regulations is likely to considerably enhance the problems that small business will confront. </PARA>
<PARA> So all I do today is to draw this to the attention of the Senate. It is an issue that will raise its head during the first 12 months of the implementation of the Australian Securities Commission legislation. The Senate and the Australian Parliament and all of us who represent our various constituents need to be aware of it because it involves a sort of bureaucracy which is going to cause a lot more trouble. The problem that Senator Olsen has raised here today is but a small tip on the top of a very big iceberg. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Beahan has suggested that I am a bigger target. The reason had nothing to do with my security, incidentally. At the time this trip was planned five or six weeks ago, a visit by anyone to our ships put that person in a particular geographical region-that is, within a helicopter flight of the host country that is dealing with our logistical support. For that reason, and that reason alone, I did not want to pre-announce the visit when the decision to go was made five or six weeks ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have conceded here, given the way that international events were going at that particular time, by the time I went that reason was virtually inoperative. However, we saw no particular reason to announce the visit. There are one or two other sensitive matters concerning publicity in that region and I am happy to go into them. Our logistics base there has worked very effectively, but one of the conditions of its use is that there be no publicity. That was also in my mind in regard to this particular trip.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Has the Government been monitoring the human rights position in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and, if so, has there been an improvement in the situation recently? Has the Minister seen the October Australian newsletter from Amnesty International suggesting that prisoners of conscience in the Soviet Union are still being punished repeatedly? What is the Government's response to that report, if it has seen it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government has been closely monitoring the human rights situation in the USSR on an ongoing basis. We recognise and very much welcome the significant progress that has been made there in recent years. The Soviet Union today is obviously a vastly different society from what it was only five years ago or, indeed, more recently. New laws in areas such as freedom of conscience and the media have been passed by the Supreme Soviet. Draft laws on immigration, citizenship and freedom of association are under consideration by the Supreme Soviet. Revision of the penal code has reduced the possibility of conviction for political offences and the system of psychiatric treatment is undergoing significant reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Notwithstanding these welcome improvements in the human rights situation in the Soviet Union, there remain areas where further progress needs to be made. Although the number of political prisoners recognised by Amnesty as `prisoners of conscience' was reduced from 600 in 1986 to just 90 in late 1989, there are currently concerns about 50 or so suspected political prisoners in the USSR, several of whom are believed still to be in psychiatric hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of Amnesty International's concerns over prisoners of conscience in the Soviet Union. The October 1990 Amnesty International newsletter referred to by Senator Maguire mentions the cases of Bohdan Klymchak and Aleksandr Goldovich. The Australian Embassy in Moscow has been monitoring the case of Bohdan Klymchak for some time. We have received information that he was released from prison in mid-November, and I have asked the Embassy to verify the allegations made by Amnesty about the other man, Aleksandr Goldovich.</PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union signed a human contacts agreement with Australia last February which commits both governments to facilitating a broad range of people-to-people contacts in a number of areas. Also, next January the Australian Government will for the first time engage in bilateral discussions with the Soviet Union on issues concerning human rights of interest to both countries. This is another encouraging and, I believe the Senate will acknowledge, very welcome development.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to the Minister representing the Treasurer relates to the fact that today's national accounts figures confirm that Australia is in a recession and that we have not experienced the soft landing that the Government has been promising us for the last 18 months. Given that imports rose during the September quarter by 8.4 per cent, does the Minister agree that, even though the economy has been deliberately shut down, the strategy of containing the foreign debt growth by high interest rates has not been successful? Will the Minister comment on the Australian Democrats' view that a more appropriate strategy would have involved more emphasis on strategic trade policies to attack Australia's current account problems without increasing unemployment? Given that recessions impact most heavily on low income earners and tend to increase poverty, what measures does the Government intend to take to lessen the burden on disadvantaged groups-especially the 2.6 million Australians who are already living in absolute poverty?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not prepared to accept several of the assumptions in Senator Powell's question. Having said that, I will answer as best I can. It is true that imports were strong in the September quarter. It is important to note that there were a number of important factors in that. Five per cent of the 8.4 per cent increase was due to transport equipment, which included aircraft and things of that kind. There was another large contributor from service transactions related to the acquisition by the Australian Government of the new chancellery building in Tokyo. There were some one-off things peculiar to the September quarter. But I do not regard that as an explanation. During the history of the Australian economy there have always been surges of imports of transport equipment and things of that kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, we are dealing with one quarter's figures. The figures for the previous quarter show that imports were dramatically down. If one averages the imports over the six-month period, one sees that there is not such a spectacular result as has appeared in the September quarter import figures.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell asked whether the Government, in responding to the current account figures, would adopt some policies enunciated by the Australian Democrats. As a general proposition, my answer to that question is no. As a general political, economic and social proposition, adopting policies which have been advanced by the Democrats is not a good way to go.</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of definitions of strategic trade policy. My understanding of strategic trade policy may be something quite different from Senator Powell's understanding as expressed in her question. I am not prepared to answer that question at Question Time in the absence of some specifics of what it means. I think they are the main points in Senator Powell's question. If I have not covered anything, she will no doubt let me know.</PARA>

I am referring not to our appearance, but to the two Peter Sellers characters who argue from different premises, like Edinburgh housewives, as somebody once said. The point is that my understanding of strategic trade policy would not include the question of accelerated depreciation. It seems to me to have nothing to do with strategic trade policy as it is enunciated by the journals and the experts around the place. Perhaps that is a Democrats' view of strategic trade policy. I will have a look at the second part of Senator Powell's question, which related to rural imports, not as a matter of policy but to see whether it is a matter of fact and, if so, why.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I can confirm that. The concerns have been raised in two consecutive programs now on A Current Affair, both of which I saw, and which were riddled with inaccurate statements presented as fact. A number of things have to be made clear about what is a major proposal to reorganise Australia's airspace management. The first point is that decisions have not been taken by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to implement any of the proposals and will not be taken for some time. Extensive consultations are currently under way with the industry. The only timetable that has been set, February next year, is merely a target to establish at that time an implementation timetable for the proposals that go ahead. In fact, I expect that the full implementation of the proposals that come out at the end of this process will take years, not months, to establish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is absolutely untrue, as suggested by the program, that air traffic control will be removed from 80 per cent of Australian airspace. That is absolute nonsense. Currently, the air traffic control provided in Australia consists of a service adjacent to busy airports and positive separation provided at high altitude, which is where most of our major jet services operate. The fundamental basis of the proposal that is being put forward is to lower by some 4,000 feet the altitude of the air traffic control currently provided, which will significantly increase the number of aircraft that get positive separation services provided by air traffic control.</PARA>
<PARA> On that program the assertion was made that special events, such as the races at Birdsville, which were specifically cited, and Bathurst, where a very large number of aircraft come into an airstrip that would normally not do so, will also be greatly affected. I saw the interview where a fellow said that aircraft would collide in the air and so on. That assertion is absolute nonsense. The Civil Aviation Authority has always provided the service of a mobile control tower at any of these special events, such as Birdsville and Bathurst, where large numbers of aircraft converge on an airstrip that normally do not do so. That service has always been provided, and will continue to be provided, by the CAA, and in fact is completely untouched by any of the proposals that are being put forward at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the basis on which all this is being done has as its primary consideration the question of safety. The consultation process has a very long way to go and significant changes will no doubt be made to the proposals that are currently being put forward. But that is all they are-proposals.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it will not, because this Government is more successful in handling industrial relations than the Opposition was. The record of this Government is that industrial disputes in this country have run at 62 per cent below the level they did for the comparative period of the Fraser Government. Indeed, the greatest fall in industrial disputation in Australia, if one compares the Fraser-Hawke periods, was in Victoria where there has been a 76 per cent reduction in the level of industrial disputes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, Senator Cooney has asked me about comparisons with the Victorian governments. The Cain Labor Government came into power in Victoria on 3 April 1982. In the previous 10 years, from 1972 to 1981, under the Liberals, the average annual rate of industrial disputation in Victoria was 832 working days per 1,000 employees. This was the worst record of any State in Australia during that period. The average annual rate of industrial disputation in Australia over the same period was 675 working days per 1,000 employees. Therefore, under the Liberals, the rate of industrial disputation in Victoria was 23.3 per cent higher than the Australian average. From 1982 to July 1990, under the Cain and Kirner Labor governments, the average annual rate of industrial disputation in Victoria dropped by 76 per cent to 200 days lost per 1,000 employees. This figure is 16 per cent below the Australian average in the same period.</PARA>

Having regard to the figures, that is clearly not true. For example, if Alan Brown, the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria, who is trotting out the old remedies, were to succeed in being in a position to implement his policies, Victoria would impose on itself a significant handicap by again embracing a very high level of industrial disputation. I think the figures show that when one has an accord, as we do, that works so successfully, one can lower the level of industrial disputation and remove that drain on productivity simply because, from an industrial relations point of view, Labor governments do it better.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First off, there have been a number of complaints, as Senator Burns would be aware, about the behaviour of mobile review teams. It has to be understood that around the country there are now 60 of those teams in operation. When we have 60 teams going around, it will always be possible that one or two individuals might exceed their authority and be overzealous in the application of their duties. Clearly, this has occurred in only a couple of cases. The Department has taken all possible responsible action to make sure that those officers have been reminded of their responsibilities and do not exceed them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the case that when a mobile review team approaches the door of any Australian home it is supposed to inform the householder that the interview does not have to take place at that particular moment; it can be held later on at a DSS office. Of course, the householder has the right to refuse entry. There have been complaints that an explanation of those and other rights has not been given, so I have undertaken to have a set of guidelines produced and made publicly available for mobile review teams. The guidelines will include the requirement for personnel to identify themselves to the householder and make sure that a sheet of paper is handed over which does outline all the rights of the householder. That will not completely eliminate the problem, but I hope it goes some way towards doing so.</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of concentration on the most disadvantaged group, I think that while some publicity may have attached to mobile review teams looking at sole parents, they are hardly the only ones being looked at. At the moment, of those 60 teams to which I referred, 20 are looking at unemployment benefits, 10 at long term unemployment benefits, eight at sole parent benefits, nine at public information, five at sickness benefits, five smaller teams are reviewing payments of all types, and three are follow-up teams. In fact, only a very small number of the teams are looking at sole parents, so it should not be suggested that the most disadvantaged group is in some way being singled out or picked on; rather, it is being reviewed in just the same way as we are reviewing all of our other kinds of benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the percentage of cases being reviewed continues. These reviews have shown we can actually make very considerable savings. In 1989-90 nearly two million reviews were carried out, not just by mobile review teams but by other officers as well. In the course of those, there was a cancellation rate of 6.2 per cent-122,000 benefits were cancelled-and over 7 per cent were varied downwards. This continued targeting and making sure that in so far as possible fraud is minimised means that many millions of dollars are being recouped from those who are not entitled to it.</PARA>

I remind him of the Prime Minister's refusal to release to the Australian Capital Territory Government funds held in trust by the Federal Government for the ACT Government to assist in restructuring the hospital system. I also remind the Minister that the restructuring of the hospital system arose from a report of Dr Brendan Kearney. The report was written for the Federal Government and accepted by it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Reid was kind enough to give me notice of this question and I sought information on that basis. I am advised that this question misses the point because release of funds from the trust account is not only on the basis of whether the project will produce long term savings. Mr Kaine's request was rejected because it failed two criteria: firstly, the projects concerned were not of exceptional quality; and, secondly, alternative funding is available. The present Grants Commission inquiry into ACT finances is likely to confirm that the ACT is substantially overfunded relative to the other States. It is, therefore, vital that the funds in the trust account be available to assist in what is likely to be a difficult transition to State-like funding over the next two years. The trust fund should not be used for projects that are unlikely to assist significantly in that transition. In this crucial aspect, the projects nominated by Mr Kaine are not exceptional.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another consideration in the decision was that it is clear from the 1990-91 ACT Budget Papers that alternative funding in the form of loan raising is available. The net borrowing estimates made allowance for the need to finance these projects within the ACT global borrowing limit, which makes a mockery of Mr Kaine's claim that he will need to raise taxes and charges as a result of the Government's decision.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly had a phone conversation with Mr Ahern, but I would like to make it clear that he phoned me; I did not phone him. This is clearly one of these `Dear John' telephone conversations. I have no doubt that I said something like that. Mr Ahern, probably two months ago, approached me on the basis that he had been approached to chair a company, put together a consortium or something of that kind, to look at the spaceport proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was asked by him, in either the terms that Senator Kernot quotes or in other terms, whether I thought the spaceport was a viable possibility. My answer to that question, to Mr Ahern and publicly, was yes, subject-as I have said on a number of occasions-to an appropriate environmental impact statement and to addressing some concerns of Aboriginal communities over the nominated site.</PARA>
<PARA> During the course of the development of the spaceport concept there were a number of hurdles which had to be overcome. There was an economic hurdle about the potential viability of the spaceport, which I believe to have been overcome by agreement to use Soviet rockets. When it was agreed that Soviet rockets could be used, it then became a question with the Americans whether they would be happy with that course and for United Technologies, an American company, to participate in the management of the spaceport. That hurdle was overcome by discussions conducted by Senator Gareth Evans and others with the Americans.</PARA>
<PARA> Only two weeks ago people from United Technologies were here. They must be regarded as significant experts in world terms about these matters. They are enthusiastic about the spaceport proposal and regard it as a commercial oppor- tunity. Of course, there are numerous advantages associated with the Queensland site, particularly its closeness to the equator.</PARA>
<PARA> The deficiency at the moment in having a commercial spaceport proposal proceed in Queensland is the availability of reliable commercial consortia who might proceed with the spaceport proposal. I do not know whether Mr Ahern's consortium is in that position; certainly he sought reassurance from me in that phone conversation on the issues which the honourable senator referred to. It remains to be seen whether his consortium will find my advice palatable in terms of commercial realities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 August 1990 Senator Watson asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question relating to alleged anomalies in the Australian Taxation Office. The answer to that question is very long. I table the answer and seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The matter to which the honourable senator refers relates to the treatment of bad debts under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the income tax law bad debts may be claimed as deductions under either of two provisions of the Act. One is a specific provision dealing with bad debts, section 63, and the other is the general deductions provision, section 51.</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the specific provision itself sets out two bases for deducting bad debts. Pursuant to paragraph 63 (1) (a) a debt which has, during the income year, been written off as a bad debt, will be allowable as a deduction if it has already been brought to account as assessable income in any year. Pursuant to paragraph 63 (1) (b), a bad debt will also be deductible if it is incurred in respect of money lent in the ordinary course of a money lending business.</PARA>
<PARA> Alternatively, a deduction may be allowed under the general deductions provision, subsection 51 (1), where the bad debt is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income to the extent that it is not a capital loss or of a capital, domestic or private nature.</PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances outlined by the Honourable Senator, two distinct debts may arise as bad debts. The first is the non-receipt of interest which may have accrued on a fixed interest security, and the second is the inability to recover the full amount invested in the security. To illustrate the operation of the provisions to the nonreceipt of both interest and the underlying investment, I will refer to three different categories of taxpayers-individuals, organisations carrying on the business of money lending, and other businesses bringing income to account under the accruals method of tax accounting.</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, an individual who deposits funds in a fixed interest security clearly makes a capital investment. In general, unless the accruals method applies under division 16E of the Act, it is only when interest is actually paid or credited on the security that it will form part of the assessable income of that person. Accordingly, where a debtor institution is unable to meet its liability to pay interest on the security no amount will generally have been assessed to the individual investor. Consequently, there is neither an amount which has been brought to account as assessable income by the individual taxpayer in terms of paragraph 63 (1) (a) nor a loss or outgoing incurred in gaining assessable income in terms of subsection 51 (1). Therefore, no deduction is allowable in respect of the nonreceipt of interest income.</PARA>
<PARA> The return of an individual's capital outlay for an investment can never be assessed as income. As no amount will be brought to account as income the operation of paragraph 63 (1) (a) is quite irrelevant. As to subsection 51 (1), failure by the debtor institution to ultimately repay an individual's capital investment would amount to a loss but such a loss is one of capital and not deductible. However, that loss will be one which may be offset against any capital gains derived by the taxpayer in terms of the capital gains and losses provisions of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, where an organisation carrying on a business of money lending invests in a fixed interest security in the ordinary course of its business, the failure of the debtor institution to repay both the amount invested and the interest on the security will give rise to both amounts being deductible under paragraph 63 (1) (b). That is how the full Federal Court determined the provision applied in F.C. of T. v. National Commercial Banking Corporation of Australia Ltd in 1983. The same amounts are also likely to be deductible under subsection 51 (1).</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, any investment by an accruals taxpayer (other than a money lender) in a fixed interest security will usually be on capital account. Any failure by the debtor institution to pay interest on the security will be deductible under paragraph 63 (1) (a) where the taxpayer has already brought that amount to account. So far as the failure to repay the amount invested is concerned, that amount will be treated in the same way as for individuals and be regarded as a capital loss which may be used to offset capital gains for the purposes of the capital gains and losses provisions of the Act.</PARA>

Comcar drivers have been offered the standard APS redundancy payment of two weeks severance pay for every year of service to a maximum of 48 weeks pay, plus 3 1/2 times their superannuation contribution. In addition, drivers over the age of 45 years with more than 10 years service were offered, in the calculation of their severance pay, their average overtime for the past two years, provided that the overtime average was more than 40 per cent of their base wages in each of those two years. These arrangements were negotiated under of the Public Service Act and can be found in determination 71 of 1990 issued by the Department of Industrial Relations on 29 June last. This determination, I am advised, was tabled in this House on 21 August last.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second question was whether the retirement offer must be made to all Comcar drivers. The retirement offer was made to all drivers in conformity with the policy of the Department of Administrative Services in relation to redundancies deriving from downsizing. It must be recognised that the retirement offers are part of the restructuring process for Comcar, which is designed to enable those staff who are--</PARA>

Such an approach is not uncommon in modern private and public organisations. I was asked whether there is a minimum retirement payment irrespective of service and, if so, what the retirement figure is. The APS redundancy award provides for a minimum of four weeks severance pay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last question was why redundancy packages are being offered in areas where there is clearly no redundancy requirement. The restructuring process, of which the retirement offers are one part, is required for the total Comcar organisation in all areas of Australia. While staff numbers in certain States need to be maintained, certain individuals do not perceive themselves as fitting into the new organisation's style of operation. These individuals have been allowed to retire and are being progressively replaced.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I need to clarify an answer which I gave yesterday to Senator Boswell concerning the move by Ministers throughout Australia to require that, in relation to orange juice, orange juice products and other orange products, in those cases where ingredients are imported, that fact be noted on the label. Indeed, that principle will apply not only to orange juice products but to other fruit juice products so that, for example, apple growers in Tasmania will be pleased to know that in relation to apple juice concentrate the same labelling requirement will be mandatory; that is, that the label bear a notation that, in fact, whilst made up in Australia, imported ingredients are used in the product. The same, of course, will be of interest to Senator Boswell and to those in Queensland and northern New South Wales and will apply in relation, for example, to pineapple juice concentrate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Question Time today in response to Senator Hill's question, `Is Australia in a recession?', the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, gave the first honest and clear answer from the Government on the economy in a long time-but only because he had no alternative. His answer was yes. What staggers me is that, on a day when the most serious economic statistics to greet this nation for many, many years are released, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the third most senior Minister in the Government, has refused to participate in this debate. Indeed, the debate is being carried on the Government's side not by a Minister, not by a spokesman of the Executive Government, but by Senator Walsh.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walsh was an eminent member of the Hawke Government last time around, but Senator Walsh chose for reasons very understandable to resign. Those reasons were essentially because he violently disagreed with the Government's economic policies and he could not get his way in Cabinet to exercise responsible economic policies. That is the person today-he is no spokesman for the Government-who is carrying the candle for the Government in this debate. I find that incredible. I really cannot believe it, other than to say it is yet another example of the continuing and increasing arrogance of this Government towards the Parliament of Australia and, therefore, towards every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the reason why the Government has lied to the Australian people for months and months over the state of the economy. This economy is in recession. Statistical evidence and anecdotal evidence-every sort of evidence which has been coming to the Government and to the Australian people for months-has made it patently obvious that the economy is in recession. Indeed, today's national accounts figures, showing a fall in gross domestic product in this nation of 1.6 per cent for the September quarter, confirm what everyone except the Government seemingly already knew; that is, that we have been in recession for a year. The first paragraph of the official publication today says, in the explanation:</PARA>
<PARA>Gross domestic product (GDP) declined in September quarter 1990 by 1.6 per cent in constant price seasonally adjusted terms, to be 0.7 per cent lower than in September quarter 1989. This is the first occasion since June quarter 1983 that seasonally adjusted constant price GDP has been lower than in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA>So if ever confirmation were needed that this economy has been in recession for a year, there it is from the Government's official statistical spokesman, the Australian Statistician. Indeed, the national accounts figures show that for three of the last four quarters there has been negative growth in the economy. It was only in the March quarter that we got some positive growth. The decline in gross domestic product (GDP) in the statistics today would have been even worse-and it is bad enough as it is-if the Government had not been out there pump-priming the economy in various old-fashioned, past generation, Keynesian ways. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the statistics, the impact on the private sector of the Government's policies is staggering. Private consumption expenditure rose in the last two quarters by only one-half of one per cent. In the September quarter alone, government consumption spending increased by no less than 3.2 per cent in real terms. Look at capital expenditure. Total private capital expenditure was flat in the September quarter after falls of 5 per cent, 2 per cent and 5 per cent again in the three preceding quarters. Indeed, private capital expenditure in the September quarter was down 10.9 per cent on the September quarter of a year earlier. What has happened to public expenditure? Public expenditure by government is up by a massive 10.8 per cent. Total public expenditure was up in the September quarter by 5 1/2 per cent, and over the year to the September quarter of last year it rose even more, by 5.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been happening in this recessed economy is that the Government has been taking action which has made the private sector even more recessed, and it has disguised the true magnitude of the recession that is in the private sector. We talk about a technical recession today. A technical recession is said to be a recession where there have been two consecutive quarter falls in GDP. That is just a technical definition. We all know that the recession has been with us for a long time. We did not need to look at technical statistics.</PARA>
<PARA> One has to ask the question whether recession is the right word, given the state of the economy and looking at the statistics over the last 12 months. We are getting to the stage where the more appropriate word is probably depression, and the statistics we have seen confirm that. Why did the Government not know we were in recession? Of course it knew. It has known it for months and months, and for purely political purposes it has consistently refused to acknowledge it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and other Government Ministers have said repeatedly that we are not in a recession. On 22 March 1990 in Adelaide, during the recent election, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>We won't let there be a recession. </PARA>
<PARA>On the same day in Brisbane the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no need to fear a recession in any sense. </PARA>
<PARA>What is significant about 22 March 1990? It was the Thursday before the general election of 24 March. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer made those statements on that day, in the face of mounting concern from the electorate, for one reason only: to mislead and deliberately lie to the Australian public in advance of the election that was to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> Businesses have closed, tens of thousands of people have gone bankrupt-16,000 bankruptcies in the last 12 months-and hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs because the Government has refused to change its policy direction, has refused to acknowledge the facts, has not been able to see for itself what the real world is like and has not been out there to see what the real world is like. The cost of this arrogant, blinkered approach has been tragic in economic terms but even more tragic in human terms. The human cost of this engineered recession-engineered because the Government has been playing politics with this economy for at least the last three years-is immense. I believe that the Australian voting public will never forget and forgive what has been done to them during that period. </PARA>
<PARA> It could all have been averted if the Government had acted sooner. The situation in Australia is made even more tragic by the fact that we have been in a recession over the last 12 months-it was building before that-at a time when world economic trade has been experiencing the longest ever growth period in history. The difficulties we face are compounded by our recession coming at a time when growth has been on the up in the world economy, although we are now seeing a world economy which is starting to slow down very dramatically. That has extremely grave implications for our external trading position and our economic situation generally. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Crichton- Browne said, commodity prices are under great pressure. The present position with our balance of payments is such that, even were there to be a dramatic improvement in our trading position, as a result of the policies of this Government we have built up a foreign debt of $154 billion, on which the interest payments are between $18 billion and $20 billion a year. So we have an enormous in-built problem-the greatest problem we have ever had on our external accounts-which is virtually intractable. If we do not make a start on correcting that today, that debt situation shows every prospect of causing a fall in our living standards, the like of which we have never seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While all that is going on, the Treasurer is running around painting the economic statistics of recent months as a beautiful set of figures. I will bet that he did not go running out to where my office is located at Brunswick in Melbourne, or even to his own office-if he knows where it is-in the western suburbs of Sydney saying that he had a beautiful set of figures, because the people being thrown out of work hour by hour as a result of the Treasurer's policies, the people closing their businesses day by day as a result of his policies and the youth forced on to the streets as a result of his policies would have lynched him; and so they should have. As late as last month, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>The economy is slowing but not precipitously. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer's scorched earth policy had arrived long before that. It was the policy of a Treasurer who had been unable to see that quite clearly, even on his own definition of a recession, we were in a recession. In May of this year, at a press conference on the March quarterly consumer price index figures, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>Rapidly mounting unemployment, business failures and people trying to sell assets when they can't. This sort of thing. All the classic conditions of recession which we've not seen yet, not seen now. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know where the Treasurer was looking. Over the last 12 months we have seen an increase of 160,000 in the number of people thrown out of work through the policies of this Government. At the end of October 1990, 650,000 were unemployed in this country. At the end of October 1989, 490,000 people were unemployed. That is an increase of 160,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA> Employment has been falling and bankruptcies have been rising. Senator Richardson admitted today in the Senate that employment will get a lot worse. We do not need Senator Richardson to tell us that. We just have to talk to anyone in the private sector. If we talk to the car manufacturers, if we could get through the acres and acres of cars in their yards that they cannot sell, the metal manufacturers, the retailers or anyone who is engaged in productive employment and productive retailing-anything to do with the work side of industry-they will tell us that this country will go down a lot more before it starts to go up. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Government cannot tell us what is around the corner, the Prime Minister has tried to tell us in the last few days that the indications are that production and employment will certainly rise in 1991. Who on earth will believe this Prime Minister and his Treasurer, who have got it absolutely wrong every year for the last eight years in calling the economic shots as to what would happen in the future?</PARA>
<PARA> At least in this chamber Senator Button has had a little more honesty than have the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. He said some time ago that the high interest rate policy of this Government-and it is a high interest rate policy because of the inability of the Government to adopt a mixture of policies that are appropriate to the needs of our economy-was forcing `a reduction in manufacturing capacity in Australia'. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>I hope profoundly that we are hanging on to the best but there will be some good ones which disappear. There is no doubt about that and that concerns me. </PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday, Senator Button admitted that the Government had made things difficult for business as a `result of earlier policy decisions'. Senator Button either lacked the courage to come in here to debate this issue or, I rather suspect, knew that the recession was coming, has given up on his Prime Minister and his Treasurer, and has taken the decision not to come and defend these figures-because they are indefensible. That is why today the Leader of the Government in the Senate is not in this chamber, although in Canberra, for this very important debate. </PARA>
<PARA> We did not need today's national accounts figures, dramatic though they are, to tell us that we are in recession. A whole host of other statistical indicators over recent months have shown this. Bankruptcies are up 32 per cent over the past year; unemployment has been rising for a year to a figure now of 650,000 people. As Senator Michael Baume pointed out in Question Time today, as he has been doing so diligently for months, the situation in youth unemployment is even worse. </PARA>
<PARA> The ANZ job vacancies have fallen dramatically over the course of this financial year. The Australian Bureau of Statistics job vacancies fell last year by 15 per cent. In August of this year-the latest available figure-the number of vacancies was 25 per cent less than a year earlier. We have seen, with the balance of payments figures yesterday, no improvement of any consequence at all. Indeed, if one looks at the underlying figures in the balance of payments, one sees that things have got worse: absolutely flat exports; imports-at a time when the Treasurer's restrictive engineered recession effects should be slowing imports-up by 8 per cent; and in the September quarter a negative turnaround in our trade position of $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The debt figure has continued to escalate. The debt figures for the end of September released yesterday were $156.3 billion gross, $124.5 billion net. They are the second highest figures ever recorded. They would have been $1 billion higher, except for the favourable exchange rate effects on the way in which the figures are calculated. </PARA>
<PARA> Building approvals have been falling dramatically. Manufacturing production and investment are down. Dwelling commencements are down. Revenues from the prescribed payments system, as we saw in recent days, are down dramatically because of a decline in the construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA> One would have known all these things simply by looking at the national press. I do not normally quote the national press in support of argumentation, but for the last six months it has been telling us what has been happening to the economy. On 20 June 1990, in the Age: `Consumer confidence falls to new low'; 1 October: `Commercial, industrial property at 35-year low'; and 2 October: `No doubts about rural recession'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should have listened to the person who should be the next leader of the Australian Labor Party in this country, that is, John Kerin, because on 8 October this was reported: `Worse than '82: Kerin's grim news'. On 10 October leading businessman Arvi Parbo was reported as saying, `Pick-up in economy not likely'. Only yesterday the Chairman of the ANZ bank and one of the leading businessmen in Australia, Milton Bridgland, said that this last year was probably the harshest economic environment for medium and small businesses in Australia since World War II. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation facing Australia today is one of deep recession. The great tragedy is that the Government has consistently refused to acknowledge that. It has, therefore, delayed taking the policy measures that are required to even start getting this country on the right track again. I urge the Government-and perhaps today's dramatic figures will force the Government-to adopt the mini-Budget that it should have adopted months ago. </PARA>

There will be a list of expenditure cuts presented to the Senate within the next week or two. One of those expenditure cuts-or savings, as the Department of Finance normally calls them-is to apply a very generous asset test to education and some social security allowances. What is Senator Short going to do when that mini-mini-Budget comes into the Senate? He is going to move a motion on behalf of the Opposition to amend the Government's proposition and throw $57m a year worth of savings right out of the window. That gives us some indication of just how serious this Opposition is about pursuing a mini-Budget. </PARA>

<PARA> The matter which has been submitted for discussion falls into two parts. Firstly, it states:</PARA>
<PARA>The failure of the Government to acknowledge that Australia is in recession . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The second part states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to take the actions necessary to address this situation . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, in the first part the assertion is unambiguously wrong. I am not just talking about Senator Button having said at Question Time earlier today that the economy is in recession. Mr Willis-I do not remember the exact date, but it was about three months ago-on one of the Sunday morning television programs said, `We are probably right now, technically, in a recession'. The figures that were released today verified Mr Willis's judgment, a technical recession being two consecutive quarters when estimated gross domestic product (GDP) was negative. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition got that wrong. It got the most simple statement of fact in its matter for discussion wrong. It is more a question of opinion as to whether any actions are being taken or what actions should be taken. One thing which is not a matter of opinion is that no positive suggestions were put up by the Opposition about what the policy response to this technical recession or recession or whatever anybody wants to call it should be, other than to bring in a mini-Budget with a list of expenditure cuts when the expenditure cuts already being proposed by the Government are going to be thrown out of the Senate by the Opposition, in collaboration with the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition even rolled its own new leader on this issue. Nothing has really changed in the Opposition. It might have a more presentable leader-in my opinion, it certainly does have a more presentable leader than it has had within my lifetime, probably, and certainly within my memory-but nothing has really changed. When it comes to the crunch, the shots are still called by the National Party. This present Liberal Party is as craven a lackey and puppet of the National Party as was the Liberal Party of Menzies, of Gorton, of Holt, of McMahon and of Fraser. Underneath, nothing has changed. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short was having another whinge because I am speaking in this debate. Naturally, I do not apologise for speaking in this debate, and I observe in passing that I have more spare time these days than I used to and I know how little spare time Senator Button would have. I want publicly to endorse Senator Button's judgment that his time can be more productively occupied doing his ministerial duties in his office or wherever else he is doing them than it is listening to humbug and cant from the Opposition and exhortations to the Government to produce a mini-Budget when the Opposition is going to throw out the mini-Budget that has already been produced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's delight at the figures which have been released today-it believes that it has finally been given a feather to fly with, and it has not had too many-is ill-concealed. But I think a few aberrations about the figures should be noted. Some of them could be classified as providing some grounds for optimism and some are probably not as clear. The first point is that there has been a run-down of stocks by almost $1 billion. When an economy is moving into recession it is usual for there to be an accumulation of stocks rather than a run-down of stocks. If stocks are accumulating at the same time that demand is falling off and an economy is moving into recession, that constitutes an overhang which will make it more difficult to come out of recession. The position that we are in now, according to the figures released today, is that stocks are running down quite significantly, so in the context of the prospects of recovery from recession that is a good sign. </PARA>
<PARA> The statistics on imports, when the June quarter is juxtaposed with the September quarter, have to be suspect. These statistics show that there was a 9 per cent decline in imports during the June quarter and an 8 per cent increase in imports during the September quarter. There are some one-off factors that boosted the September quarter imports-principally the import of aircraft-but it is improbable that two movements of that magnitude in opposite directions between one quarter and another are both correct. It is very likely that one or both of those figures will subsequently be revised. In other words, it is likely-as it is always likely-that there will be some revision to the bottom line on gross domestic product growth or negative growth in this quarter. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at changes over six-monthly periods or, better still, a 12-monthly period and disaggregates the figures which collectively produce the bottom line of 1.6 per cent negative real growth, again one can see some positive signs. Over the 12-month period gross domestic product-and gross national product, for that matter-has grown at a significantly better rate than gross national expenditure. That means that net exports are making a significant contribution to economic growth. Indeed, over the 12-month period the growth attributable to net exports was equivalent to almost 2 per cent of GDP-that is, for the September quarter compared with the September quarter last year. That sort of structural change must take place sooner or later in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> However, like Senator Button, like the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his press statement today and like Mr Willis, I am not pretending that the present economic situation will not cause problems for quite a number of people. In that sort of situation I think it is incumbent on anybody who purports to take a serious interest in it to try to analyse what has happened to produce this situation and to think about prospective changes that could be made which might ameliorate it. We did not get too much of that from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened? To get to the starting point of the snapshot of the economy which was published today, one has to go back about two years-I have admitted this before as Minister for Finance and in the Senate-when there was a serious underestimate by the Government and by just about everybody else of the strength of demand. Therefore, imports and the current account deficit blew out in the 1988-89 financial year to a level that the Government had not anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA> In that situation, fuelled partly by an investment boom, the appropriate response, as the Government saw it, was to restrict total demand in order to reduce the alarmingly high current account deficit that was looming. That was done, and the mechanism which was chosen, for a variety of reasons, was to tighten monetary policy. Legitimate criticism could probably be made of that decision to hose down total demand by tightening monetary policy. An alternative is to tighten fiscal policy-in other words, increase the size of the surplus-which would also have the effect of dampening demand, although probably not in a one-to-one ratio. </PARA>
<PARA> We have already touched on that response, of course. Tightening fiscal policy means either increasing taxation or reducing expenditure. When the Government puts up propositions to do that, as likely as not, those propositions will be knocked off by the very people who have the effrontery to turn up here today and say, `The Government should have done something different from what we would have allowed it to do if it had tried to do it'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us come to the effects of the tightening of monetary policy. Firstly, it took longer than anybody had anticipated for the effects of high interest rates to make a substantial impact on total demand, and the final effects of that tight monetary policy have been aggravated by some unbelievably imprudent and irresponsible lending by banks in the past. Senator Button very rightly touched on this yesterday. Until quite recently-indeed, until it became incontrovertible public fact-I would not have believed that Australian mainstream banks, leaving some of the spivvy fringe operators out of it, would have lent hundreds of millions of dollars on no mortgage security whatsoever, and in many cases without even asking the paper entrepreneurs who were borrowing the money how many hundreds of millions of dollars they owed to other financial institutions. I would not have believed, until it became a matter of public record, that that was possible. </PARA>
<PARA> In the five minutes that is left to me I want to make an observation about the Democrats. I will have to anticipate Senator Spindler's speech, but I anticipate that it will be full of pathos, empathy and sympathy for people who will be affected by the recession. That is fair enough; I think all of us would endorse those sentiments. But what makes it so inappropriate coming from the Democrats is that, when people have their incomes reduced or, at worst, lose their jobs, that will be a function of negative economic growth which occurred in the last quarter and the quarter before it. As I understand it, negative economic growth is one of the Democrats' objectives. The Democrats actually believe in negative economic growth. Indeed, if I have understood them correctly, they say that it is absolutely essential, if we are to survive on this planet, that there be negative economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> So before we have too much humbug and hypocrisy from the people who sit at the end of the corridor about how terrible it is that people will suffer from this recession, let us remember that if Democrat policies were ever to be implemented that is only a little taste of what people can expect. It will not be just a limited section of the population which will be affected; it will be the whole lot-with the exception of those new class spongers who have managed somehow or other to fasten themselves onto the public tit. Everybody else will have their living standards reduced. I predict that the humbug and cant of the Democrats will be even more spectacular than the humbug and cant of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regret that I will not be able to fulfil Senator Walsh's expectations. I do not suggest that negative economic growth at this time is what the community and the economy should be aiming for. We should be setting the scene for a sustainable economy in the years to come so that we do not sell our non-renewable resources simply to survive. Nor should we sell them, as Senator Walsh seems to imply, just so that we can run two or three cars and a boat and have two houses and use up all the resources which this country offers but which are not renewable and which we are exhausting at a fast rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter of public importance presented by Senator Short today relates to the Government's failure to acknowledge that Australia is in recession and also to its failure to take the actions necessary to address the situation and to consider the hardship it is causing all Australians. The first leg of that challenge was in fact met by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, when, earlier in Question Time, he acknowledged that indeed Australia, by that measure of two quarters of negative growth, is officially in recession. I regret that Senator Short did not address the second leg to any great extent. I found few, if any, suggestions as to the effective action which should be taken to address this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I intend to address a good part of my speech to that question. In the situation in which we find ourselves, rather than criticising the Government for sending in a speaker who is not currently the Minister responsible for this portfolio, we should be addressing the measures that can and should be taken to redress the deplorable position that we are in when increasing numbers of people are without jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The September quarter result was particularly bad for the Government and indeed for Australia since a drop of 1.6 per cent is fairly substantial. An interesting point is that the June quarter negative result was actually revised downwards from 0.9 to 0.5. So, in a sense, the Government was a little unlucky in its statistics. With an expenditure of an extra billion dollars on public works, it might have avoided the quarter negative growth that it experienced in June. But that, of course, is no comfort to those who have already lost their jobs or to those who are now facing losing them. </PARA>
<PARA> The employment figure certainly supports the fact that Australia is in recession. Since July the number of people employed in Australia has dropped by almost 65,000. Unemployment paints an even bleaker picture. In October 1989, 457,400 people were unemployed in Australia. That figure rose to 569,300 in July and to 607,700 in October. This is indeed a most disturbing trend. The Government should tell us its predictions for unemployment given that the Budget estimate has already been exceeded. There is no doubt that the Budget estimate of 2 per cent growth in gross domestic product for 1991 has been discredited by today's result. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the shadow Treasurer called for further cuts in public expenditure. That is a measure of the irresponsibility that the Opposition brings to this situation and to this debate. The reason the Great Depression deepened in 1930-31 was that the Scullin Government accepted the view from London and from the infamous Mr Gibson, the then Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank, to cut public outlays. We all know the result of that policy-massive hardship. </PARA>
<PARA> Now is the time to increase public spending to counter the social costs which arise because of the recession. But it is a not only a matter of increasing public outlays to alleviate some of the social disadvantage that is the result of the Government's monetary policy; it is also a matter of spending money strategically to achieve improvements in our economic performance. </PARA>
<PARA> From the position that we find ourselves in, it is clear that we are reaping the results of several years of deregulation and reliance on markets. Our governments, both State and Federal, have abdicated their responsibility to the market. In some ways, although fairly late, it is pleasing to see that certain sectors of the private enterprise part of our economy agree that maybe this was not the road to travel, despite the fact that the Opposition parties supported it, and in fact are still claiming that deregulation, privatisation and exposure to markets have not gone far enough. Mr Ian Campbell, Chief Economist of the AMP Society, in the economic notes for the September quarter 1990, states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . deregulation and exposure to market competition, which have been confidently put forward as the answers to economic mismanagement, don't seem to be leading us to utopia either. Such a situation opens the way to widespread cynicism, and that prospect must be alarming to anyone with the wellbeing of the nation at heart. </PARA>
<PARA>The worst of it is that this strategy of high interest rates has not assisted us in reducing our overseas borrowing since our foreign debt is now climbing rapidly well above the $120 billion mark and going towards $130 billion. Unfortunately, that money was not borrowed for productive enterprises but for paper shuffling takeovers. </PARA>
<PARA> We see the Government standing by and not doing anything to increase our export and manufacturing capacity. Even in the current batch of legislation coming before us we see penny pinching in the export market development grants. A recent article in the Australian documented the failure to gear up our partnership for development program, which we are now prepared to let go in contrast to France, Germany, Japan and the United States of America, which are not afraid to support their industries and primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that the Government must take steps to intervene strategically. We believe that the suggestion put forward by the Australian Manufacturing Council to engage in accelerated depreciation allowances on large scale industrial projects destined for exports should be taken up. We believe that tariff reductions should be reviewed and that they certainly should be treated selectively. However, apart from these sorts of measures, we believe that we should also look very carefully at our own capacity and at how it can be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Here I turn to our science and technology capacity. I refer to a question that Democrat senator John Coulter asked recently of Senator Button. It demonstrated very clearly that the sort of technology that enables solar powered cars to race across the continent will be produced and utilised in Spain, even though it was developed in Australia. Clearly we do not have the scientific infrastructure to enable us to utilise the fruits of our scientists; not that we treat our scientists with any deal of respect or give them the support that they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to a recent publication of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) which showed that its 1988-89 budget totalled $503m, including $375m of government appropriations and $106m for research and development projects funded by industry. That is quite a respectable percentage, even for those people who feel that markets should rule the decisions we make in the development of our scientific and technological capacity. Yet it is clear that if we are going to achieve the sort of independence and push in our markets that we need to turn the ship around, we must support organisations such as the CSIRO to a much greater extent. The Australian Democrats certainly support the call for a doubling of its funding.</PARA>
<PARA> Unless we take such measures, we cannot expect to achieve the turnaround that the current situation requires. Rather than do that, the Government, however, actually cuts funding. I am referring here to the recently publicised research on a hydrogen or gas fuelled zirconia fuel cell which has recently been suspended; there is no more government funding. If we are going to proceed in this sort of manner, we have only ourselves to blame if we fall further and further behind. It is not only an economic question; it is also a question of what it does to our social fabric or, to put it more simply, what it does to women, men and children who suffer because our economy is not managed, because our Government is not accepting responsibility for managing our economy for people; rather, it is managing it for overseas financiers and for this nebulous concept of markets to which it abdicates all responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Just to give an indication of the fruits that we are beginning to harvest, I turn to an Age article of 27 June 1989 by Sally Loane which cites some statistics provided by the Catholic bishops inquiry into wealth. It shows the connection between poverty and other social dislocation criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1986 census data, we see that families with an annual income under $15,000 have children who are exposed to much greater risk than families which are well above that income level. In fact, they are 11 times more likely to suffer neglect, six times more likely to endure emotional abuse, five times more likely to suffer physical abuse, and four times more likely to be sexually abused. Those are the sorts of risks to which we expose our children if we believe that the economy that we now have, with the results we are facing, is all we can achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> But it goes further than that. For those people who believe that there must be a financial equation, if we are to spend money to turn the economy around, let me turn to some statistics from the Australian Institute of Criminology cited in the Age on 29 August 1990. The heading is, `Young People and Crime: Costs and Prevention'. A survey found that young offenders were responsible for at least $610m in direct costs. Spending on prevention, enforcement and justice-rather more enforcement and justice than prevention, I suggest-amounted to more than $800m. The characteristics of potential offenders included that one or both parents or a sibling had been convicted of a crime, had a discordant home, and a low income family. The indirect costs of this situation include $250m spent by the private security industry and a $350m police outlay on law and order relating to young offenders. </PARA>
<PARA> We, as a community, have a choice. We can spend our money and our resources on repression, bringing offenders to justice, making our gaols even more secure with barbed wire, or we can spend similar or larger amounts of money on gearing up our industries, training our people and providing jobs for young people as they leave school. The choice is ours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Tate. I want to add a few comments to the comments made by Senator Spindler. As part of the policies that Senator Spindler supports, he believes that we should have over 40 new taxes, charges and tax rises. I invite the public-I do not invite the Australian Labor Party-to reflect on what that would do to the current state of the Australian economy. The fact of the matter is-this is the one point on which I agree with Senator Walsh-that the policies that Senator Spindler advocates would be even worse than the policies of this Government under Mr Hawke and Mr Keating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The two other points I wish to make will reinforce the comments that Senator Short made. Australia is now facing the most serious recession since World War II. It is possible that the recession will deepen quite substantially. I believe that the signs that we received today from the national accounts are frightening, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has brought forward this matter of public importance so that we can debate the Government's policies which have propelled Australia into this recession. It is a tragic indictment of this Government and the contempt with which it treats Parliament that Senator Button, the person who should have been here to take part in this debate and been prepared to stand up and defend his Government's policies, walked out of the chamber. I repeat: when Senator Button was given the chance to stand here and defend his Government's policies, he walked out of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Not one Minister was prepared to stand up and defend the Government's policies. Senator Tate, who is in the chamber now, certainly was not prepared to defend the Government's policies. So what did the Government do? It rolled up Senator Walsh in the hope that he would indulge in the usual abuse of his political opponents. We had a comparatively lacklustre performance from Senator Walsh. Even he could not give satisfactory reasons why the Government's policies-in which he took part, let us not forget-have had disastrous consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I wish to make is a very important point: those who were closely involved in the last election and who listened carefully to the debates in the last two or three weeks of that election heard Mr Keating and Mr Hawke being asked numerous times whether Australia was heading towards a recession. Time and time again Senator Tate's colleagues were asked that question, and time and time again they assured the Australian public that we were not going to have a recession. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened today? Senator Button came into the chamber and, in answer to a straightforward question, we at last got a straightforward answer. The answer is that the Australian economy is in a recession. The point I wish to make is that this Government has been typecast as a government of the big lie. We all remember the big lie on child poverty. That continues to haunt this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me add another one to the extensive list of lies that this Government has made to the Australian public, the promises it has broken. It went to the election and sought the votes of the Australian people. It gave assurances that its policies, the settings, the famous accord of Senator Cook, who gets up here and defends this every day, would not produce a recession. That was wrong; it was a lie, and now Australians all over the country are facing the most serious recession since World War II. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The employment of consultants by Ministers has become one of the few growth areas in the Australian economy. The report which the Government has tabled today shows that during the year to 30 June 1980 there were some 54 engagements of consultants by Ministers under the Act. I understand that there are currently some 25 to 28 government consultants on ministerial payrolls. The employment of consultants-and I stress that I make no reflections on the individual qualities of the individuals so employed-has been one of the key ways in which the Government has rapidly expanded ministerial staffing entitlements. This is just one of the ways, I believe, that the Government has breached a valuable convention. That convention is this: the government of the day, whoever it may be, should not exploit its access to taxpayers' funds to give itself undue advantage over its political opponents. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear from what we learnt yesterday from Senator Bolkus that these positions of ministerial consultants are very well paid indeed. The typical payment of consultants stretches from $70,000 to over $117,000, excluding other entitlements such as access to cars and Commonwealth superannuation. These are very valuable consultancies. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the Government's behaviour in this area, it must naturally expect that the Opposition will take a keen interest in what is happening in the area of government consultancies. I would say that Senator Short has done some great work in this area to bring the community's attention to what has continued to be a matter of considerable concern. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I think that the report would be more helpful if it outlined, in addition to the information on the period of engagement and tasks of the ministerial consultants, information on the consultancy fees and other associated entitlements. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the final report from the Australia Council under the Chairmanship of Professor Donald Horne. I think that certainly calls for some remark by the Senate. Professor Horne in his farewell letter to the Minister for Arts, Tourism and Territories, the Hon. David Simmons, which precedes this report, refers to the fact that this is his final report and he deals with his six years at the Australia Council. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no surprise to learn that Professor Horne and spokespeople for the arts on this side of the chamber have, if I may use the phrase loosely, locked horns at times. During the last election campaign, for example, Professor Horne thought it was proper and within his duties to put out what was clearly an unfortunate press release of a blatantly political nature attacking the Opposition's policies. As a result, there has been a tendency for this very important debate about the role of the arts in our community to be coloured by a touch of emotionalism and prejudice that will, one hopes, go in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not to say that Professor Horne's only mark upon the Australia Council has been to develop that controversy. He has contributed a great deal in terms of force, direction and controversial liveliness to the topic. Nonetheless, one cannot help feeling that every now and again there is a touch of pretentiousness in his style. I notice that in his chairman's letter, Professor Horne says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . without a rigorous intellectual and artistic life a society lacks a market place of options in facing the puzzles of existence. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend his recognition of the fact that there is some kind of marketplace and I note that in the following sentence he talks about goods and services, as though trying to associate the arts in some way with the new trend to a market society. But we have to concentrate on what the Australia Council is all about. Frankly I do not think it is about pretentious statements about society. I think the Council is there to provide, as an instrument of government, assistance to the arts along the lines of its charter. That is pretty simple; it is to promote excellence in the arts, to provide and encourage the provision of opportunities for people to practise the arts, to promote appreciation, understanding and enjoyment of the arts and so on. However, I totally agree with Professor Horne when he says that the Council:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . is not there primarily to serve artists, but, by serving artists, to serve the people who use the things and the activities artists produce. </PARA>
<PARA>To that extent I think Professor Horne has contributed significantly to the recognition of the fact that the Council has a broader approach-as it should have-than simply to serve artists themselves. However, I am concerned that Professor Horne has seen it as a mark of success that Council has become:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too want to say a few words about the Australia Council's annual report, although on a different subject from that raised by Senator Michael Baume. I draw the attention of the Senate to the tabulation in the report on page 56 and onwards in relation to Australia Council grants. I particularly want to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that in 1989-90 a total of $529,855 was given by the Australia Council to trade unions for arts grants. Of that figure, $339,000 went to trades and labour councils and $104,000 apparently went directly to the Australian Council of Trade Unions. There are some notable grants among those figures: for example, $99,526-say $100,000- went to the Victorian Trades Hall Council, courtesy of Mr Halfpenny; $29,487 went to the Building Workers Industrial Union (BWIU) for `performance projects'-heaven only knows what they were--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Poetry on the sites, from the BWIU. A sum of $95,357 was allocated for trade union arts organisers, while $204,910 was allocated for trade union programs. I have spoken in the past on the subject of taxpayers' money being paid to trade unions for these purposes. I think my comments have been misrepresented, in that I have sometimes been criticised as saying I do not believe trade unions ought to be involved in the arts. That is not the point at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My point is that if trade unions see the arts as a priority for their activities and their members, that is fine, but such activities should not be paid for out of the public purse; they should be paid for from the general funds of the trade unions themselves. The Australia Council report unfortunately lists many of the grants under the general umbrella heading of `Trades and Labor Councils'; consequently it is not possible to know which unions were actually the recipients of the grants, nor the purposes of such grants. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Estimates committees I asked for details of the grants to community and trade union organisations. I am afraid the Australia Council provided only answers with details of grants for community development. In due course I hope to pursue that with the Australia Council because I do not fully understand why that was the case. </PARA>
<PARA> In answers provided through the Estimates hearings, there were specific examples of purely community development grants which I believe highlight the need for concern in this area. A sum of $5,000 went to the BWIU for a `work site music program'; $13,555 went to the Gladstone Trades and Labor Council for Queensland work site play and May Day performances; $4,777 went to the Western Australian Women's Union fabric wall-hanging banner, and $18,000 went as a part-salary for an arts officer and program costs for the Victorian Trades Hall Council. I would like to mention many other things but time prevents that. It is important to note that these figures, while large, should be seen only in the context of a total of no less than $6.8m paid out by departments generally to trade unions in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish briefly to mention the retirement next month of Professor Donald Horne as Chairman of Australia Council. I wish him well in his retirement. I note that no successor has yet been named for Donald Horne and I think it is incumbent on the Government to advise us as soon as possible why that is the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few comments about the annual report of the Australia Council in the area of community cultural development. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Community Cultural Development Committee's main work is to encourage and assist communities from different cultures and backgrounds to have an input into Australia's cultural identity and to assist communities to obtain the resources they need to actively participate in the development of their own culture. </PARA>
<PARA>Under that particular program, and the performing arts program, I note in the report that some particular Australian circuses are mentioned, commonly known amongst the traditional circus owners as political circuses, such as Circus Oz, the Flying Fruit Fly Circus and the Rock and Roll Circus from Queensland. The report shows that an amount of $7,000 was given to Circus Chaos, a French circus I saw in Melbourne, which was quite horrific. I have no argument with the fact that the Australia Council has seen fit to sponsor our youth through the Flying Fruit Fly Circus, Circus Oz-which I believe is going to visit the Soviet Union-and the Rock and Roll Circus from Queensland, which received $30,000. They are in themselves quite a culture. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to report to the Senate that the Australia Council funded the first ever Circus Federation conference in Melbourne. I had the honour of opening that particular conference earlier this year. That gave the first opportunity in this country for traditional circuses and the so-called political circuses to get together. Before the conference, the traditional circuses felt that they had been ignored. Honourable senators may remember the demonstration, using traditional circus elephants, that took place last year outside this chamber complaining about the Moscow Circus coming to Australia and upsetting the circus program. As a result of that conference, the political and traditional circuses found they had so much in common that at the end of the day the feeling between the two types of circuses was much better than anybody expected. </PARA>
<PARA> Traditional circuses-such as Ashtons, Perry Brothers, Sole Brothers and Bullens-need to spread their wings to enable their artists to gain expertise overseas. I tried unsuccessfully on their behalf to get a small amount of funds to help some of the young artists travel overseas to a conference in, I think, East Germany to improve their expertise, but unfortunately funds were not available. Whilst the Australia Council sees fit to fund some circuses quite substantially-for instance, Circus Oz received $140,000 and the Flying Fruit Fly Circus $81,000-for a small amount of money the Council could have assisted the passage of some these young, traditional circus people, who are family people and finding the going tough in this economy, to improve their expertise. It would be good for the people of Australia to be able to see these artists with that extra expertise. Perhaps an interchange of artists between countries could be encouraged. I did see some magnificent artists in Moscow and Mongolia. I think we could try to arrange some interchange of circus artists between countries. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the members of the Australia Council, Mark St Leon, wrote a very interesting book on one of our old time circus people named Mervyn King. I had a lot of pleasure in launching that book and reading the accounts of what it was really like to grow up in a circus. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances recently became concerned at some aspects of subdelegation of powers in delegated legislation. It therefore asked its legal adviser, Emeritus Professor Whalan, to prepare a special report on the subject. After receiving the report, the Committee decided that it discusses matters of such importance that it should be tabled as a report of the Committee. The Committee always examines closely each power or discretion granted to a Minister or official by delegated legislation. It first scrutinises the legal validity of such discretions and then decides whether the particular power in question affects personal liberties or parliamentary proprieties. It also ensures that any discretions granted are subject to external review of the merits of any adverse exercise of those discretions. </PARA>
<PARA> However, many instruments of delegated legislation not only grant important discretions to Ministers or public officials, but also provide, usually elsewhere in the instrument, that such discretions may be delegated. Often the Committee finds that there are no limits at all on the persons to whom these powers may be given. In such cases it is theoretically possible for the Minister to delegate quite important powers to any person at all, no matter how unsuitable. Many of these powers are open-ended; that is, they are not restricted by criteria. The Committee has noted cases where such wide powers of delegation include the power to allocate Commonwealth money, to issue directives or directions which are partly legislative in nature, or to make decisions affecting the personal liberties or livelihoods of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> In such cases the Committee requires a careful justification from the Minister for such provisions. In some cases they may be justified. Such cases may involve safety provisions. They may also involve situations where large numbers of decisions, suitably restricted by criteria, are to be made. The Committee is more likely to accept wide delegations where any effect on individuals is protected by right of review to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of the merits of a decision. On the other hand, decisions which are few in number but which affect whole classes of individuals or which have important economic consequences, should only be made at senior levels. As usual, where the Committee indicates that an amendment of the level of delegation may be appropriate, it has received a high level of cooperation from Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Whalan's report-that is, the report that we are tabling today-includes a number of case studies of instances where the Committee has raised subdelegation with Ministers. The resolution of these concerns has, as Professor Whalan points out, influenced the development of this area of delegated legislation. It is hoped that there will not be similar instances to one chain of delegation described in the report. In that case, an Act was passed, regulations were made under the Act, orders were made under the regulations, the orders delegated certain powers to the Secretary, the Secretary could delegate to a senior officer, that officer could delegate the power to delegate to a delegate, and that delegate could delegate the power actually to make a decision. As Anna Russell would earnestly say, `I'm not joking, you know'. </PARA>
<PARA> This report, written in Professor Whalan's inimitable style, entertains as it instructs. I commend it strongly to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am also pleased to commend to honourable senators Professor Whalan's report on the subdelegation of powers in delegated legislation. I think the example Senator Giles has given should leave us in no doubt as to the need for such a paper and the need for this chamber to address the issue of subdelegation of powers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Very significant aspects of Commonwealth administration are conducted through subdelegated legislation. For example, the various State grants Acts administered by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training expressly provide that the Minister may delegate his functions and powers under the Acts to an officer of the Department. The present Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) has done this. Different public servants in the Department approve projects and authorise payments of hundreds of millions of dollars in respect of those projects. All this is certainly legal and probably appropriate. Nevertheless, the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances closely scrutinises such instruments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recently written to the Minister suggesting that advice be sought from the Australian National Audit Office and the Attorney-General's Department on whether the format of this authorisation to spend Commonwealth money could be improved. Following correspondence from the Committee, the Minister has helpfully undertaken to upgrade the explanatory statements which accompany the authorisations. </PARA>
<PARA> In another similar case, the regulations empowered the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to guarantee borrowings of the Australian Wheat Board up to $100m. The regulations also provided that the Treasurer could delegate this power to any officer of the Department of the Treasury. The Committee considered that this power should be restricted to senior officers of the Department. The Minister then undertook to amend the regulations to restrict delegation of this power to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary (Financial) to the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is equally vigilant where subdelegation of powers may affect personal liberties. In these cases, the Committee insists on closely drafted criteria to restrict and guide the exercise of power. It also insists on suitable review of any adverse decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Giles said, in the report Professor Whalan, in his own individual style, covers all aspects of the Committee's scrutiny of subdelegation. Those who might find this topic somewhat boring or lacking in interest I am sure will find sprinkled through this report little gems that will make it much more interesting than they might have otherwise thought. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the subdelegation of powers as an important area of concern to the Committee and therefore to this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of Estimates Committee A contains several reservations put by Senator Bronwyn Bishop, Senator O'Chee and me. One of those related to the Advance to the Minister for Finance. The reservation we put said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Questions asked of Departmental officers within the Departments of Finance and Treasury failed to show that recent payments to three States had not been illegally approved by the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason why my colleagues and I made that reservation was that, in our view, the answers we received from the Department of Finance failed to allay our fears that the Department of Finance had improperly approved payments to South Australia, in particular, totalling more than $100m over a period of four years. The payments had been made in successive transfers. </PARA>
<PARA> Although we did have quite a lengthy discussion in the Estimates debate about this matter, I personally found the situation very unsatisfactory because the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance is required to be only for urgent and unforeseen circumstances. I would have thought that the payments to South Australia quite clearly could not fall into that category because the payments in 1989-90 were made right at the end of the financial year, presumably to get approval before 30 June, despite the fact that there was no way that the money was going to be utilised by South Australia in 1989-90. To the extent that it was urgent, there was a question mark about that; to the extent that it was unforeseen, there was also a question mark because of the fact that it was part of a series of annual payments that had been made to South Australia for a similar purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like Senator McMullan, who, I see, is handling this, to tell the Committee again or perhaps to enlighten it in a way that I do not think was done by officers at the Estimates hearings as to how such a payment could be regarded as a proper use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. I raise it not just in relation to this particular case. Although I think this one is the most obvious and blatant misuse of the Advance that I have seen, it is by no means unique. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a serious issue because the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance in this way means that the payments to which the advances relate are not able to be subject to the same parliamentary scrutiny as would occur with normal appropriations because the Parliament is advised of the payments only after they have actually occurred, or after the Advance to the Minister for Finance has been utilised. The recording of that, or the tabling of the relevant documents, is done in the Parliament only after the event. Also, the notification of them is included in the Budget Papers, but for the following year. Therefore, they are not subject to the normal consideration as are all other forms of appropriation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an important matter. I think it is significant. I would like an explanation as to how the Minister really does interpret the legal requirements that he is bound to operate under of approving only payments which are unforeseen and urgent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is not much to add to the lengthy discussion that was had in the Committee. I understand that we concluded by agreeing to disagree about that matter. At some length Senator Short put his point of view, the officers provided the facts and I put my point of view with regard to them. The tests of urgent and unforeseen were delineated then as they are set down in the Act and the manner in which I believed then, and believe now, they were met.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only thing I have to add is, I think, a bit of useful information. Senator Short will be aware of some of this because it is a matter of course, but he could not be aware of all of it, so I provide it for the Committee's information. The Advance to the Minister for Finance is, of course, audited by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) in the course of the year on each occasion. I understand that officers from the National Audit Office on this occasion were satisfied that the funds detailed in the statement to which we are referring were issued in accordance with the criteria, that the ANAO has verified the statement as correct, and that, accordingly, their written report will be tabled in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> So, in saying that I do not think we ought to have in here again the debate that we had in the Committee, I am not saying that the matter is not important. I accept that it is important; I do not challenge that at all. I simply say that the position has been amply put and I provide that extra bit of information, which I hope is helpful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was in fact $12m, but that does not change the point at all-I understand that. I will reiterate briefly the points that were made before. The Act requires things to be deemed unforeseen such that the amount of money that needs to be appropriated could not have been specified for inclusion in the previous Appropriation Bill or the supplementary Estimates. That clearly is the case on this occasion because the discussions had not concluded about the amount of money that might be paid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know this because it is not really relevant to the point, but even if it were known beforehand by the relevant Ministers that a payment was going to be made-and I do not know whether that is the case or not, and it is not relevant to Senator Short's point, nor to mine-nobody could assess the amount of money required and nobody could put a figure in the previous Appropriation Bill. The urgency relates to the fact that there was a time limit specified by what the required procedure sets down, that is, competent authority-the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-such that it could not be in the next Appropriation Bill. The two things are quite straightforward. One is entitled to disagree with them, but the words `unforeseen' and `urgent' have a clear English language meaning. There is nothing very arcane about this interpretation of them. They were clearly met on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> One is entitled politically to say, `The Prime Minister and the Treasurer made a decision that I do not agree with'. That is a proper matter for parliamentary debate, but I do not think whether the legal requirements have been met and whether the officers have acted properly in the discharge of their obligations under the Act is a matter of any doubt. It is a question of whether one thinks the decisions made in and around the Premiers Conference by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are correct, and that is a matter for political contention and legitimate agreement to disagree. </PARA>

I wonder whether Senator McMullan could provide the Committee with the relevant information-presumably he does not have it now, but whenever possible-from the South Australian authorities to enable us to understand why the decision by the Commonwealth was so urgent. For example, if the South Australian authorities did not require those funds until such time as our normal appropriation processes had been gone through, that would put a different view on the matter compared with if they did need it.

I assume he did not mean to suggest that there could be any possibility that with an amount of money of this magnitude-$12m to $15m-an arrangement could be made between the Commonwealth and South Australia to pay that money over without very adequate documentation surrounding it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report of the Estimates Committee dealt with, among other things, the sale of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (HLIC). I understand that since the Committee met, the sale has been consummated. Prior to the Committee meeting, I think the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, announced in Parliament in September that the Government would keep liability for existing insurance policies for five years and the buyer would manage the policies on behalf of the Commonwealth. He said subsequently that the Commonwealth expected to receive some $80m in net present value terms. That $80m is considerably higher than the $50m which was talked about prior to the sale. Do we have a figure on the real value of the sale? Is $80m the relevant figure or is it some other figure?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator McMullan would no doubt be aware, because the letter was made public, one of his colleagues, Mr Langmore, wrote to the Minister for Finance, as I recall-I do not have the letter with me-asserting that the Commonwealth was paying out money, far from receiving money, on the sale. I assume from what Senator McMullan said that the Government believes Mr Langmore is wrong. Can he enlighten the Committee on where his misunderstanding has arisen?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without going into too much detail, I did read the letter some time ago. I do not have it with me, but on the day I read it thought-and I confirmed it in discussion with the officers-that in that letter Mr Langmore operated on some incorrect assumptions about the basis of the sale. If his assumptions were right, his conclusions would have been right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, there were some flawed assumptions in the document. He has had some subsequent discussions with the Minister for Finance, and I understand he accepts that to be the case. I could go further, but I am not sure it is going to take us far today. The fundamental problem is that the nature of the sale had changed from the original idea to the final way it was sold, as Senator Short knows, and in that transition some of the points of significance had been missed in Mr Langmore's letter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the sale of HLIC was first canvassed there were reports, according to the media, that initial bidders had dropped out because of-to quote one of the press reports-the excessive price tag of at least $50m and the sale conditions, which included a requirement that any successful bidder indemnify the Government against the HLIC's continued government guarantee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Can Senator McMullan comment on that, because if those reports are at all correct, particularly the one that potential buyers saw the $50m price tag as excessive, the $80m which the Government has achieved is an extraordinarily good effort. If that is so-I congratulate all concerned; the HLIC sale has been a long, tortuous process-the two figures, therefore, do not sit consistently together. I add to that the fact that there was a downgrading, or a reported possible downgrading, of HLIC's credit rating which, I would have assumed, again would have affected potential buyers. I do not know whether that was taken into account-I would like to know-in the sale price negotiated between the Commonwealth and CIC Insurance Ltd. What I am really getting at is that the $80m which the Government has achieved does sit somewhat oddly against the $50m. I would welcome any comment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the supplementary point first: nothing happened, as far as I am aware, to the credit rating of the HLIC prior to its sale. Its credit rating may change when it is no longer a Commonwealth-owned asset and does not have all those benefits. So I do not think that is a factor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, although we never put a price tag on it as such, I think that early on some people were excessively pessimistic about the price that would be gained for the HLIC, and have been proved correct by events.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to return very briefly to Senator Short's discussion on the reservation about the Advance to the Minister for Finance and the concern that control over those funds may be inadequate. The question strikes at the heart of some of the Government's rhetoric in terms of restraint in government spending. In that context, today we saw evidence of considerable increases in government spending, not necessarily from the Federal Government alone, but from States as well. The concern relates to advances in relation to some State matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The national income figures show that there appears to have been some laxity in the general thrust of government spending. For example, in the latest 12 months, the September quarter 1990 compared with the September quarter 1989, while the private sector had a 10.9 per cent fall in private sector capital expenditure, the government sector had a 3.7 per cent rise. While recession is everywhere, it is not within the government sector. One wonders whether this sort of relaxed approach to government spending that has emerged, as is evident from Senator Short's questioning, does not reflect some sort of general lack of enthusiasm to restrain government spending at a time when the private sector is in serious economic trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, in the September quarter, government final consumption expenditure went up by 3.2 per cent in real terms, seasonally adjusted, while in the poor old private sector it went up by 0.3 per cent. The whole problem that seems to emerge when we look at gross domestic product is of a private sector in deep disarray, suffering deep and serious economic problems, while governments, aided by some pretty lax administration as well, by the sound of it, are proceeding to spend merrily on their ways-although in New South Wales there has been considerable and effective restraint under the Greiner Government. It seems to me that in this discussion relating to the Advance to the Minister for Finance we are seeing a practical demonstration of the lack of will by a government to apply the appropriate fiscal restraint that is needed at a time of serious economic problem. The rhetoric is all restraint, but the practice is laxity. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the suggestions by the head of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bernie Fraser, that perhaps one could not see any further falls in interest rates before Christmas, emerge very clearly from the fact that there has been a lack of fiscal restraint by this Government. The latest example in an already lax environment is the fact that the much acclaimed wage-tax trade-off involves a reduction in fiscal restraint of over $1.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> This small discussion about the Advance to the Minister for Finance is of far greater significance in the sense that it no doubt reflects an enormous gap between the rhetoric of restraint and the fact of profligacy as is evident in today's disastrous national income figures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to ask a few questions following the discussion we had in the Estimates Committee hearing on the sale of the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline. Senator Bishop, Senator O'Chee and I, in our reservation contained in the Estimates Committee report, said that we were concerned about what we saw as a failure to use proper administrative procedures by the Task Force on Asset Sales in relation to the pipeline. Since then the Government has introduced legislation to increase the haulage rates. The Opposition and the Australian Democrats have announced their intention to oppose that legislation. As a result, the Government, as I understand it, has said that that will affect the revenue to the extent of about $700m to $800m this financial year because the Government had hoped, although there was never any guarantee, that it would be able to complete the sale in the course of 1990-91.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask Senator McMullan what the figure of $700m to $800m, that I understand the Government is now citing as its loss for this financial year as a result of the decision by the Opposition not to support the legislation, is based on, given that in the Estimates Committee hearing officers were unable to provide a figure when asked about it. There were various reasons given. Is the figure of $700m to $800m that has been mentioned the sort of figure that the Government contemplated? If so, how has that been calculated?</PARA>

The $700m figure is sufficiently general and is extrapolated not to prejudice any discussions should the sale go ahead.

One of the technical questions was whether the purchase of the imported paper was made in American dollars. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take this on notice and get a response for me. I presume, because the paper was purchased in United States dollars by News Ltd, that the cost of the Finnish paper was lower.

<PARA>What are the guidelines (referring to those used to determine purchase of paper)? Do they include a weighting for Australian-made products?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer that I have been given is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Currently the only guideline in place for the purchase of goods and services is that the best value for money be obtained. In respect to print procurement, Australian made paper is naturally preferred but is no longer weighted to the advantage of Australian manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA>I am really appalled at that, particularly from the Tax Office, which spent millions of dollars on the Tax Pack. Most of the paper was imported paper-80 or 90 per cent-from Finland. The Tax Office's job is to collect taxes. It collects not one red cent from the Finnish company in company tax and does not collect anything from the Finnish workers in pay as you earn tax. None of that is weighted for the purposes of purchasing paper for this Tax Pack. Frankly, I feel that there needs to be an answer given by the Government as to why there is not some weighting given to Australian manufacturers. It appears that there is absolutely none given. The decision to purchase paper is made just on the basis that the best value for money is obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that this is a very difficult area and that you, Mr Chairman, would not allow me to use the consideration of the Estimates for this purpose, but I simply raise this issue again in the hope that the Tax Office on this occasion, since it has decided again to publish the Tax Pack, looks seriously at Australian manufacturers and obtains quotes from them. The Office did not in this case, because it stipulated a particular type of paper which was not produced in this country. But there was other equivalent paper that could have been used. I hope that the Tax Office gives some weighting to Australian manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not in the business of feather-bedding Australian industry to such an extent that it does not become at all competitive, but I am advised that in the area of paper products we are fairly competitive. On this occasion, we were told in the Estimates Committee-without any proof; it was just asserted-that the Australian product would have been considerably dearer. That was an assertion. When we asked for the basis of that assertion, we were virtually told that we could not know the cost of the purchase because it was presumably commercial in confidence. So we are flying in the dark a bit. I simply ask the Government whether it would have a word with the Tax Office on this occasion so that, when it is considering what paper the Tax Pack is to be printed on, it does give every consideration to Australian manufacturers. The Tax Office does not put onto the scales the fact that if Australian industry cannot sell its products to a major purchaser such as the Government then the Office will not be able to recoup pay as you earn tax and company tax from the people who will miss out on providing the paper from Australian sources. </PARA>

I will ensure that the Tax Office, in dealing with this matter, does adhere to those guidelines and does give reasonable consideration to those issues that Senator Harradine has raised. </PARA>

An amendment was sought to be moved by the Opposition in relation to that matter requesting the House of Representatives to reduce the appropriations for the Department of Administrative Services by $1,028,596 as an offset to the amount that the Government has failed to seek to recover, following the ruling by the High Court of Australia that the increase in postage allowance to members of the House of Representatives was invalid and contrary to section 83 of the Constitution.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the President on much of the fine work that is being done by the Parliamentary Education Office-fine work that, I believe, is sometimes underrated by some of us this chamber, and unfortunately so. I have a great deal of satisfaction in talking to school students who visit this Parliament and in fact have been known to grab some of my colleagues and take them up to Senate committee room 10 to show them mocked up Parliament--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Crichton-Browne" NAMEID="XF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator Crichton-Browne</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is that mocked up or mucked up?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The mocked up Parliament. This is the mucked up Parliament. The Parliamentary Education Office is an integral part of the visit to Canberra in the education of those students. At this hour the glassed-in galleries that surround the Senate chamber are empty. My concern is that in the forthcoming year they will be empty much more frequently than they are at the moment. I believe that is a very sad matter indeed, because the people who usually fill these glassed-in galleries-especially during Question Time but also at other times during the day when we are sitting and conducting our business as members of the Senate-are young school students from all over Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many of those school students come here only because they receive financial assistance under the citizenship visits program. The money required to run this program is some $1m in a full year. I fully appreciate all the arguments about fiscal restraint. Fiscal restraint is very important but, as a young person in Australia, I believe the education of future generations of Australians in the parliamentary processes and the Westminster system is equally important. Every one of us who sits in this chamber has a certain degree of pride-I hope not misplaced pride-in the fine institution of Parliament and everything that it stands for, and has a pride in what this Parliament has to offer the people of Australia. The Parliament should also offer the young people of Australia a citizenship visits program. </PARA>
<PARA> The program, as proposed for the forthcoming year, involves subsidies to students from distant schools on a formula based upon the distances they reside from Canberra. Those students who reside less than 1,000 kilometres from Canberra receive no funding. If the students reside between 1,000 and 2,000 kilometres from Canberra, they receive $50 for their visit. Students residing between 2,000 and 3,000 kilometres from Canberra receive $100, and those students who reside further than 3,000 kilometres from Canberra receive $150 under the proposed scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Representing Queensland, most of which comes under the proposed formula, I think it is very important that young Queensland children have the opportunity to visit Parliament to see what it is all about, and for them to see that Parliament is not just an imaginary place but is a real place where real people make real decisions. What is most important about this is that I know a lot of school students receive a lot of satisfaction from their visits. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Estimates Committee A Hansard, at page 4, the President was kind enough to advise that some 162 schools had been able to attend the Parliament using the citizenship visits program, at a total cost of $498,700; and some 6,000 students attended from those 162 schools. Six thousand students may not sound like a lot but, given that many students will visit Canberra only once in their 12 years of schooling, if one adds up the number of students who will receive this funding over a period of time, the number becomes substantially more than what will be indicated in one year. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Gilbert also said in that hearing that there was a fairly significant multiplier effect-they were his words-when he talked about the educational fall-out from this funding. In other words, students come down here and they tell other students about their experience. They tell their friends about their experience. They say, `We met a member of the House of Representatives and we met a member of the Senate. They are real people; they can talk to us; they are interested in our problems; and we believe that they are trying to do their best by the people of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also very important if we want the next generation of young Australians to take an interest in what this Parliament does and if we are to bring up good parliamentarians in 10 or 15 or 20 years time. If the young people of this country turn their back on the Parliament, we cannot expect to receive the informed decision-making that we, as Australians, look forward to in the future. We, as Australians, after we leave this place, will be dependent upon our successors to make the right decisions for us. </PARA>
<PARA> The support that this scheme gives to distant schools is quite substantial. For people from Townsville or Cairns, for example, the money is sufficient to meet most of the costs of the students travelling down by bus or coach. Obviously, it is nowhere near the money that would be necessary for students to fly down, but those students who could afford to pay the rest of the money to fly would not need the money in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that, if we scrap the citizenship visits program, we run the very real risk of making Parliament and Canberra a reality only for students from New South Wales or parts of Victoria, or for students from very rich backgrounds. I am concerned that this Parliament is a parliament of the people-a parliament where all young people, irrespective of the wealth or income of their parents, have an opportunity to attend and see the workings of Parliament and see how decisions are made in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In May of this year-and unfortunately I do not have the Hansard with me-one of the education Ministers was asked a question in relation to whether the citizenship visits program was successful. His answer, in very general terms, was that the citizenship visits program was an enormous success. He said that it was a very fine program, and so on. Yet we find now, the responsibility having been shuffled off onto the Joint House Department, that the scheme is going to be scrapped because, although the Government gave the responsibility to the Joint House Department, it did not give the Joint House Department the money to run the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a substantial investment in educational infrastructure in Parliament. For example, I have already referred to the glassed-in galleries that surround the Senate. We have a substantial investment in the skills that have been developed by the Parliamentary Education Office; they are very fine and talented people who work very hard for a cause, which is to educate young people. </PARA>
<PARA> We have another investment in the facilities that exist in committee room 10 and elsewhere in this Parliament: the technology that has been purchased to make the visit to Canberra of these young school students an interactive and exciting process. What I am concerned about is that we maximise the access and equity-to use two of the Government's favourite words-of all young Australians to Parliament and what is going on in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As a final comment, I would suggest that we have some 10 years to run until the centenary of Australian Federation. In 1988 we had enormous celebrations to celebrate the bicentenary of white settlement in Australia. For those of us in Parliament, the centenary of Australian Federation is in some ways a more significant date; it is a more significant occasion because it marks 100 years of self-government of Australia as a nation. If this event is to have the significance in this country that it so richly deserves, I believe that the citizenship visits program-enabling, as it does, young Australians from far-flung corners of this country to come and see the processes of Parliament, to see all the things that we hold in such awe in this chamber, and to see all the things that we as parliamentarians are so rightly proud of-should be allowed to continue. I believe it is fundamental in the lead-up to the centenary of Australian Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons, I would beg all those who are responsible to assist in whatever way possible to allow sufficient funds to be made available for the citizenship visits program so that it can continue and so that young Australians can be proud of their Parliament, the people's Parliament, and the Parliament of which we are all rightfully proud servants. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As another young senator-39 years is not old!-I join Senator O'Chee in speaking on this subject, which I did not expect to do. In looking through some papers in my drawer I was reminded of the Hansard on which Senator O'Chee was unable to lay his hands. Mr Dawkins said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I can report that the citizenship visits program has been extraordinarily successful, even more successful than we thought when we introduced this pilot program last year. The reason the program was introduced was that for those who live outside New South Wales and Victoria, we noticed that there was a very important program of school visits to Parliament House where groups of young people came here to observe and, no doubt, be edified by our activities and to learn something more about the democratic process generally, particularly as a result of the education programs that have been put into place in the Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA>In a press statement launching the program with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr McLeay, Mr Dawkins stated:</PARA>
<PARA>As the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training emphasised in its report on `Education for Active Citizenship', it is important, said Mr Dawkins, `that all young Australians have a solid understanding of how our government and democracy works. First hand experience is one of the best ways to achieve this understanding . . . The Citizenship Visit Program will be piloted as a Project of National Significance. </PARA>
<PARA>For the Government to retreat from a program and a project which it judges to be of national significance because it feels it is no longer able to fund it is to me a matter of grave disappointment. I support the views put forward by Mr Dawkins at the time of that launch. </PARA>
<PARA> The schools most disadvantaged by the dismantling of this program are those from Western Australia, simply because they are the furthest away and it costs the most to get the Western Australian students to Canberra. Senator O'Chee talked about entertaining school children from Queensland and introducing his colleagues to them. I do not remember any school from Western Australia visiting this Parliament in the last five years-except some kids from my daughter's school who won an economics prize last year and some kids who won an economics prize from my boy's school this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, they just have good genes. I am sure that there are some schools from Western Australia which have visited Parliament House that I do not know about, but the disadvantage for them is gross. This scheme, modest as it might have been, gave them some opportunity because, in the case of Western Australia, the children were to receive $200 per student. The return economy air fare from Western Australia must be $700 or $800, and with accommodation and that sort of thing the expenses quickly add up. It is almost impossible in this economic climate for schools from Western Australia to be able to visit the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understood Senator Bolkus to be saying that the matter now rests with the Presiding Officers, but their problem is that they do not have funding.

I thought it was the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) who said that no more funding was available. I thought that was where the matter rested, but perhaps I am wrong about that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As is becoming increasingly obvious to all of us, Hansard has been burdened with additional work as a result of the committees of the Senate. I understand that, in fact, this year the committees of the House of Representatives are consuming more of Hansard's time than those of the Senate. That has led to considerable delays in the presentation of the printed Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question that obviously has to be raised in terms of cost and benefit is whether or not it is judged that Hansard has an optimum level of efficiency which militates against having excess resources in times of troughs and, in part, accommodates the peaks. It is my view that Hansard ought to be able to provide a regular and standard service irrespective of the demands of the Parliament. Of course, that inevitably and inexorably leads to some inefficiencies because the resources will not be used to an optimum capacity in the quiet times. </PARA>
<PARA> I will cite two recent examples. As a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority (NCA) I was confronted with a very difficult question in respect of privilege. I could not address that matter because I did not have a Hansard for over a fortnight. It was a grave difficulty for me, I can say. More recently-yesterday-we sought the Hansard for an NCA Committee meeting that took place in Brisbane early last week, and that was not available. In fact, as a result of certain unravellings today we were not able to have access to the tape. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the view on the level of resources that ought to be available so as to provide the sorts of efficiencies and services that inevitably are going to be called upon by senators both in this chamber and on the various committees?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do have some figures which I am sure will be of interest to Senator Crichton-Browne. Since 1 July, Hansard has reported 227 committee meeting days, in addition to the sitting days of both chambers. A further 31 meeting days have been foreshadowed for December. This will come to a total of 258 reporting assignments, a figure which is a significant increase on the last directly comparable Budget sittings of 1988. I say `1988' because in 1989 the Budget sittings were disrupted by the effects of the pilots strike which resulted in the cancellation of many committee meetings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The raw figures are useful in themselves. However, the figures do not include considerations such as the length of committee hearings or the number of simultaneous hearings. I am sure that honourable senators are aware that this current round of Estimates committees has set records in respect of hearing times. Honourable senators will also be aware that the new procedures of the Senate, whereby legislation is referred for consideration by standing committees of the Senate, have also had an impact on Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Senators will be aware that in recent years there have been problems in Hansard which have manifested themselves in serious staffing shortages and unaccept- able delays in the production of some committee transcripts. As a result of the significant changes which are being made to Hansard, additional staff have been and will be appointed. The first priority has been to appoint additional chamber reporters and, over the past five months, eight new chamber reporters have been either appointed or promoted. As well, considerable effort has been made to employ additional transcript editors and additional committee reporters. Moreover, considerable overtime has been worked at night and on Saturdays on a regular basis to deal with the backlog. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, the delay in transcription of committees is around two weeks, although this does change as workloads reach peaks. I can assure honourable senators that every effort is being made to clear the backlog. Seven additional repor- ters-in-training will commence duty with the Department within the next week. They will be trained as speedily as possible to enable their use on committee assignments. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of this sitting period Hansard will review the impact of legislation committees, extended meetings of some Estimates committees and the increased sitting hours of committees generally with a view to providing advice on possible action to provide improved service to senators. I have available a table which sets out the committee assignments undertaken or anticipated by Hansard from 1 July this year. I think it would be a good idea if I incorporated that table in Hansard.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. This Bill includes all the Budget announcements on aged care and many health related issues including pathology, the registering practice of State deregistered doctors in other States, safety net concessions, funding of nurse education, the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee, therapeutic goods, the separation of radiologists from general practitioner clinics and the performing of X-rays by GPs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should not let this opportunity pass without saying that, when this omnibus Bill covering a wide range of health and aged care related issues was brought into the House of Representatives, the shadow Ministers in that House had almost no time to consider or look at the Bill. There was a total of 50 minutes debating time for every stage of the Bill in that House. That says something about the way this Government manages its business. Fortunately, we have more time here in the Senate. Again, this demonstrates the importance of the Senate for the review and consideration of legislation which covers a wide area. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that this is an omnibus Bill, I would have thought it was an appropriate opportunity for the Minister for Community Services and Health, Mr Howe, to have addressed the plethora of issues of concern to people with disabilities and their carers. At the time of the Budget, the Minister said that he would bring the attendant care scheme under the Disability Services Act. Yet, given all the proposals put forward in this Bill, there is no mention in it of the attendant care scheme and what the Government will do with it. I ask Senator McMullan, who is in the chamber representing the Minister, when that Budget proposal will be brought before Parliament. When will we see the necessary legislation to give effect to what I consider to be an important and long overdue change?</PARA>
<PARA> The legislation we are debating tonight implements the Government's Budget decision to abolish hostel care subsidy in respect of residents of aged persons hostels other than those who are financially disadvantaged. It also enables private organisations, as well as non-profit bodies, to be eligible to apply for recurrent funding but not capital funding for aged persons hostels. As from 9 January next year the payment of hostel care subsidies, which is currently $2.50 a day, to non- financially disadvantaged persons, will cease. The Government expects this cut to raise $27m in revenue in 1990-91 and $53m in 1991-92. It states that by extending their maximum fee scale combined with the interest they receive from entry contributions, hostels will be able to compensate for reduced funding. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also includes a charter of rights. I raise that here because it says a lot for what the Government thinks about old people's rights. I believe that this legislation infringes on the rights of current hostel residents-people who have made a decision to go into hostels. Many of them chose to leave their own homes and enter residential accommodation. They have signed contracts with fees calculated at a particular level. In some ways the carpet has been pulled from underneath their feet. It may have been appropriate at least to have some lead time for them to reorganise their financial situations and to accommodate this change that the Government has brought upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been told by a number of people running hostels-the shadow Minister has also been told-that this cut will have an impact on standards. As I move around nursing homes and hostels I realise the tremendous support that is given to older people by volunteers who often not only visit their relatives in those hostels but also offer support and care to other people. In fact, the other day I had a letter from somebody whose friend had been in a nursing home and whom she visited five hours a day. She commented on the care and support that the staff had given. No doubt, she herself had given a lot of support and care, not only to that resident but also to other residents in the nursing home. One sees similar things in hostels. </PARA>
<PARA> Only with that volunteer support will they be able to maintain the standards which the Commonwealth has set and the standards which they themselves want to maintain for older people. So much for social justice from this Government that continually tells us about its social justice policy. It seems to think that it has a monopoly on caring. The Australian public is beginning to realise what the Government's economic policies are doing to older Australians in residential care. </PARA>
<PARA> In October this year the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) met with the delegation from the Australian Affiliation of Voluntary Care Associations. He said that there was a possibility of a clause which would overcome the retrospective nature of the proposal I referred to. It was suggested that the withdrawal of the subsidy, say for two years, might be appropriate. Like the children of Australia and many other people, we know just what we can make of the Prime Minister's word, because no such amendment and no subclause has appeared in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Another decision that the Government has made is to allow private participation in the Commonwealth hostel program. There has been a policy to reduce the number of nursing home beds. The policy has been to move towards more hostel places. Hostel places required for the elderly are not being built at the rate sufficient to meet expected demand. But the Commonwealth has failed to provide the incentive for private operators to augment the supply of hostel accommodation needed. All around the place the Government heralds, especially during election time, the number of beds that it has approved in various areas. I have seen this happen in Victoria; so many beds have been approved. It is so hard to get from the Department how many beds have been taken up. How few of those beds have been taken up is not really publicised. Neither the voluntary sector nor the private sector can afford to take on new hostel beds and operate at a loss. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, if you want to, I will take you to Stawell and to some of the other country towns in Victoria and introduce you to some of the managers of those voluntary sector hostels; they are frazzled-that is the only word I can use. Over three or four years I have visited them and I have watched them dealing with residents who have increased dementia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policy has ensured that category 4 and 5 nursing home residents go to hostels rather than nursing homes. As we know, those residents are more dependent than are hostel residents. We are now seeing the Government's policy start to have an impact on those hostels. Managers of nursing homes are putting in extra time. In fact, one in the southern part of Melbourne was in tears. She said to me, `I can't continue to give the sort of standard of care that I have been used to giving, because I just do not have the resources in staff or physically'. This is not somebody out to make a profit; this is a person running a hostel for local government. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said in this chamber over and over, we will see an exodus from the aged care sector. It has not been fashionable to be in geriatric nursing or to be in aged care. Gradually, with tremendous work being done by some of the tertiary institutions, especially the one from which I came, the Lincoln Institute of Health Services which is now at La Trobe, there has been an increase in the status of the aged care sector and of those people working in that sector. Yet it is being eroded; people are not going to stay. </PARA>
<PARA> The people in the community are not going to go into the nitty-gritty about funding for hostels. They will say, `You know, Molly who has been in that hostel for years as a manager is not coping as well now, and the standard has dropped'. Many managers have said to me, `Senator, I cannot let the standard drop and let the people in the community think it is me. They are not interested about government funding, they think it is me. So after 15, 20 or 23 years I am going to leave this hostel'. That is what the policies of this Government are doing. We are going to stretch hostels to a point where many staff will reach breaking point. We will see an exodus and I will say, `I told you so'. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Bill there is also provision for nursing home residents to have unlimited hospitalisation leave. What did we see in February of this year? We saw Mr Staples gallivanting around the countryside-I should qualify that; gallivanting around the marginal electorates-saying `We will fund multipurpose centres', and `We will abolish the 28-day rule'. Then he leaves the Department and the aged care institutions to pick up the pieces. Some of these places were designated and approved as multipurpose centres in February. On 12 October I asked about this in the Estimates Committee hearings. I was told initially that these people had not received their cheques and then, subsequently, they received their cheques on 18 June-yet the cheques were dated 26 June. It took months for those people to get their funding. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened to the others who have had residents who have been hospitalised and took Mr Staples at his word that there would not be a 28-day rule? They bore the cost of the empty bed while the person was in a nursing home. How long did it take them to get their money? It took 10 months. The Minister seemed unaware that he needed to bring in legislation to meet the promises. This Government has the attitude that Parliament is irrelevant and that it can go around the countryside handing out all sorts of things, but there comes a day of reckoning. The legislation has to be put through the due processes, and that takes time. If the Minister had been a little more careful in choosing his words, then we would not have had people believing that they were going to have these conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also supplements changes being made to the respite care regulations to facilitate the use made of respite care provisions in nursing homes. Changes to the Act are necessary to allow nursing homes to charge prospective respite care residents a booking fee, which is refundable on admission, and to limit the size of that fee to 25 per cent of the resident respite cost or one week's respite fee, whichever is the lesser. Current provisions in the Act prohibit nursing homes charging any fee prior to the admission of a resident. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome these new changes. They remove the financial disadvantages of providing respite beds in nursing homes, and we understand that a geriatric assessment team coordinator will be appointed next year to develop awareness of respite beds and to develop respite referrals. We have to give credit where credit is due. We know that there are many people in the community caring for their aged relatives who could continue to do so if they had that respite care. We also welcome the establishment of more than one nursing homes fees review committee in each State to clear the backlog of cases. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to stress that the nursing home industry is suffering as a result of the reduction in the care aggregated module (CAM) funding for categories three and five. Mr Braithwaite referred to this in his speech in the House of Representatives. I reiterate how fascinated I was to see that in the Budget. When I asked in the Estimates Committee hearings about the CAM review committee and its report, I discovered that the Minister had received that report on 8 October. So it is obvious that the Cabinet in making its Budget decisions pre-empted its own review committee. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also refers to a number of significant changes in health. I wish to address two of these changes. Firstly, an anomaly exists at present in the definition of `medical practitioner' which allows a doctor who has been deregistered or delicensed in one State to practise in another. The legislation we have before us allows deregistered doctors to continue to practise but to be ineligible to claim Medicare rebates for their services for the period of their suspension or deregistration. This goes a long way towards addressing the problem we found of people using the loophole of being deregistered in one State and practising in another. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I wish to address the Government's proposals which pertain particularly to government restrictions on radiology practices of doctors. At the moment, general practitioners can undertake some X-rays. These proposals will look at a number of issues, such as general practitioners undertaking X-rays, and will put the radiologist at arm's length from the general practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been going on-I guess it has been happening in pathology as well-is that a few doctors who were not scrupulous brought into disrepute many of their profession who were behaving and acting in an honourable fashion. I suppose it is a bit like this place. One or two bad apples can bring all politicians into disrepute. Some doctors were referring radiology patients on and there were some scams and schemes being undertaken. This legislation aims to close the loophole. We support that. We think it is not appropriate for there to be opportunities for people to abuse the system and to take taxpayers' money in the form of Medicare payments-and it is taxpayers' money, because the Medicare levy does not cover the costs of medical care in Australia. So we are seeing an abuse of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not know the exact size of the problem, but we are told by the Department of Community Services and Health, the Royal Australian College of Radiol- ogists and the Australian Medical Association that it is significant. We really only received anecdotal evidence rather than quantitative evidence. My concern is that the Department of Community Services and Health has refused to provide the shadow Minister with quantitative evidence of the size of the problem. Surely this evidence exists and can be obtained by researching provider numbers and medical profiles. It would seem to be appropriate to back something that we may agree with, but it is also appropriate to see the extent of the abuse which the Government is trying to prevent. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the fact that the Government has tried to close this loophole. The proposed system will allow the general practitioner and the radiologist to continue practising and even practising on the same premises, but only if a normal commercial relationship exists between them; that is, if there is a proper charging of rents, rates and medical expenses. We support that. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the areas we do have problems with, and one of the reasons that we have referred this to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, is the restriction on the types of X-rays that can be undertaken by general practitioners. There has not been evidence to suggest that this type of overservicing is significant. I think Dr Woods in his speech in the House of Representatives indicated that, of the 25,798 GPs in Australia, about 1,172 take spinal X-rays in their own practices. Only 109 of these take more than one spinal X-ray per week. Only nine take more than one spinal X-ray per day. </PARA>
<PARA> These figures show that it is quite easy to detect cases of general practitioners who may be undertaking excessive or unnecessary X-rays. It does not take much to follow up those few. We know there are only 109 general practitioners who take more than one spinal X-ray per week. There are relatively few GPs who undertake X-rays anyway. The majority of medical practitioners use their professional judgment to refer X-rays that require a great degree of speciality, and maybe very costly equipment, to specialist radiologists. So only a few general practitioners could be accused of overservicing. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence that there is a problem with the health or safety of patients or the ability of GPs to perform these services. There is no evidence that the Government's proposal will benefit patients at all. In fact, the proposal may be financially detrimental, because patients will have to pay for a second consultation subsequent to having the X-ray taken outside the GP's surgery. Also, there is the further cost on Medicare. The other thing is that in country areas a considerable journey may be involved for a patient who is ill. We would like to see medical practitioners, who have ensured that they have the expertise and the equipment to undertake more complex X-rays, exercise their professional right to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) foreshadowed in his second reading speech that there would be the provision of a grandfather clause that would allow some GPs to continue performing restricted X-rays until 1 January 1993 and that any exemption beyond that date would depend on the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners developing a general practitioner radiology accreditation and quality control program. I found it interesting that we did not see the amendment in the House of Representatives and, as far as I know, we have not had the amendment here. The Minister foreshadowed this amendment in his second reading speech and we have not seen it. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that we have some concerns about this part of the Bill and that a number of people have come to us with concerns, we thought it appropriate that the relevant Senate committee examine the amendments that have been put forward in the House of Representatives. I give notice that I will be moving the amendments in the committee stage of this Bill. The Senate Committee has been given notice of those amendments so that they can discuss them. Given the fact that the Minister has foreshadowed the insertion of a grandfather clause, which did not appear and has not yet appeared, we believe that it is appropriate that the Senate Committee examine the matter. Perhaps when the Minister has had time to consider the matter, we will see that grandfather clause, or at least the Committee will find out why the grandfather clause has not been included. </PARA>

Initially, in relation to more specialist services, this practice came to light on the provision of pathology services where general practitioners were providing unnecessary pathology services and charging for them. This became particularly obnoxious when automated devices for doing large numbers of tests became available. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of those excessive tests were clearly a great burden on the public purse. This also exposed patients to unnecessary risks of having blood, various body fluids and so on taken as specimens. That loophole was closed, and division 3 of this Bill before us seeks to do much the same sort of thing with respect to the taking of X-rays. As Senator Patterson indicated a moment ago, the Bill seeks a clear arms-length relationship between a general practitioner and the specialist who takes the X-rays or, as it is described, diagnostic imaging services. That, of course, extends beyond X-rays, but most of what we are talking about involves the taking of X-rays. </PARA>
<PARA> This section seeks to ensure that that arms-length relationship shall hold. We have no objection to the principle which lies behind that, because unfortunately that loophole does exist. If general practitioners take their own X-rays, there is an opportunity to order unnecessary X-ray exposure and to collect fees for that. If they refer a patient to a specialist, there is an opportunity to receive kick-backs by way of what is called in the profession fee splitting from professional radiologists. That is also an objectionable practice. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to X-rays, there is a further reason why one should be very wary of unnecessary exposure. Exposure to X-rays is not without risk. I will have to diverge somewhat here from what Senator Patterson has just said, in that it seems to me that the sort of equipment which general practitioners would have available for their immediate use is likely to be of the less expensive, less current kind and, therefore, more likely to expose patients to higher levels of radiation than the most modern and expensive equipment-more likely to be found in the offices of specialist radiologists. I think that, for reasons of both economy and excessive exposure of patients to X-rays, we need to address this matter seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no complaint whatsoever with the intention which lies behind this section. It has already been explained that the practice of those general practitioners who have traditionally taken a range of X-rays and provided a range of X-ray services, to the extent it has been done in the past, will continue into the future. Eventually that practice will be replaced by the accreditation of general practitioners under the scheme which has recently been introduced as a result of other legislation and a Senate committee report. </PARA>
<PARA> It is envisaged that general practitioners who wish to take their own X-ray images will be accredited, I presume, to take either a range of X-rays or perhaps a limited number of types of X-rays. That seems to be highly desirable, particularly in view of the risk of exposing people to excessive or indeed to any amount of X-irradiation because any amount carries a certain risk. A person behaving in a fully professional and competent manner should seek to minimise absolutely the amount of X-irradiation to which people are exposed and ensure that the benefit arising from that irradiation will, as far as possible, be judged to be greater than the risk associated with the exposure. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, we have some slight problem with one clause of this legislation. Proposed new section 23 dzg (c), under the heading `Prohibited diagnostic imaging practices', reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the person is a practitioner, or the employer of a practitioner, who, without reasonable excuse, asks, receives or obtains, or agrees to receive or obtain, any property, benefit or advantage of any kind for himself or herself, or any other person, from a service provider or a person acting on behalf of the service provider;</PARA>
<PARA>When one takes those words literally and interprets them broadly, that excludes the use of any ordering of x-rays by any general practitioner at all. Turning the wording around, where it says that a practitioner may not receive an advantage of any kind for himself or herself, clearly when a general practitioner orders an X-ray for a patient and a disease is found in the patient as a result of the interpretation of the X-ray by a radiologist, that doctor is then able to better manage the patient and has been given some advantage from ordering the X-ray. </PARA>
<PARA> If one takes a broad reading of that section, one finds that effectively doctors would be prevented from taking X-rays at all. Clearly that is not what is intended; some narrower reading of the section is intended. Where it says `or obtains . . . property, benefit or advantage of any kind', clearly it is referring to advantages of a pecuniary kind or advantages which could be generally interpreted to be of a pecuniary kind, such as a lower rental in a building or something like that which could be translated into a pecuniary advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> The section as it is worded is broadly drawn and it catches some practices which I believe are inappropriate to catch. I give the example of the Pacific Medical Centre, which has approached me on this matter. The Pacific Medical Centre leases rooms to general practitioners; at the same time, the centre employs a radiographer, and a general practitioner in that medical centre may order an X-ray to be taken of a patient and may ask for that X-ray to be taken anywhere at all, but may choose to use the radiographer who works in the medical centre. That would seem reasonable because it is in the same building. The X-ray is then sent off to a radiologist for interpretation; that radiologist reports on the X-ray and gives some part of the fee back to the radiographer because there is no mechanism within Medicare for a radiographer, as such, to charge a fee for the taking of an X-ray. </PARA>
<PARA> The relationship between the general practitioner and the other practitioner providing a service-that is, the radiologist who interprets the X-ray-is at arm's length. There is no advantage to the general practitioner from ordering an X-ray and there is no mechanism which connects the general practitioner to that particular radiologist because the general practitioner may well ask for the X-ray to be taken somewhere else or indeed send the patient off to a specialist radiologist somewhere else. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Walters interjected because this operation is caught by the words `or any other person'. It is extremely difficult to see why these words are there when the whole section is attempting to ensure an arm's length relationship between one professional person and another professional person so that there are no kickbacks or advantages in ordering extra, additional or unnecessary diagnostic imaging services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have just been handed my proposed amendments. I suggest that the words `or any other person' in proposed new section 23 dzg (c) be deleted. The deletion of those words would not in any way remove the intention of the section but would ensure that it does not unnecessarily catch an operation such as the Pacific Medical Centre, where, as far as I can see, there is no illicit practice, no kickbacks and no loophole for the possibility of abuse. To ensure that the words `property, benefit or advantage of any kind' are properly understood, I suggest that the words `directly or indirectly' be inserted between the words `obtain' and `any property'. That is simply doubly dotting i's and doubly crossing t's to ensure that emphasis is given to the nature of the advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the only other matter I wish to address. As I have indicated, we support the thrust of this legislation. It is an unfortunate matter of history that in the past there has been abuse of pathology diagnostic services. That loophole was closed and we have since operated very well under the system. However, there is potential here for abuse in the system and it is appropriate to close it. As far as possible, the operation of diagnostic X-ray services should come under the professional control of people who really understand the danger of exposure to X-irradiation and indeed have the best and most recent equipment so as to obtain the best images with the least exposure. That is a not inconsiderable reason when one realises that some estimates suggest that roughly half the X-rays taken in Australia are taken unnecessarily.</PARA>
<PARA> In this country people are exposed to quite large amounts of X-irradiation. As there is a linear dose response relationship between radiation exposure and mutagenic effects, resulting in birth defects, cancer and so on, not only the doses to individuals but also the total community dose of X-irradiation should be kept as low as possible. For those reasons, we find ourselves in strong support of this section. As this Bill is going to a Senate committee tomorrow, we are putting this amendment on the table now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2). It is divided into two parts. One part amends the Health Insurance Act and the second part amends the National Health Act and the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act. I intend to debate only that part which deals with the Health Insurance Act because my colleague Senator Patterson has dealt very thoroughly with the National Health Act and the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act. Several proposed amendments have been put by the Government to alter the Health Insurance Act. Two of these we agree with and the third one we do not agree with. I will deal first with those two that we do agree with because it will be simpler that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first relates to the closing of the loopholes for those doctors who have been deregistered or delicensed in one State. When that occurs-and it is very rare-it is for a very serious reason. But the medical practitioner in the past has been able to overcome this by simply moving from the State in which he is deregistered to another State where he takes up practice and is able to carry on as though nothing has happened, even during the time of his deregistration. We believe that this is not appropriate and therefore we support the Government's action in saying that, if a doctor has been deregistered or delicensed, should he attempt to take up practice in another State his patients should not be entitled to a Medicare refund. The Government has done that by redefining `medical practitioner' in the Health Insurance Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area on which we agree is that area where a problem exists in the medical centres. The Government has brought this on entirely of its own making-nothing more, nothing less. The Government's ideology of encouraging bulk billing-and it encourages it very vigorously-has been the source of this great problem. It is the infamous Edelsten centres and all the similar entrepreneurial centres throughout Australia that have created this problem. Instead of the Government doing something sensible about it by abolishing bulk billing for all except the disadvantaged patients-all the card holders, all the pensioners, et cetera-it insisted on its ideology and said that doctors should bulk bill. This only encourages the problem that we are faced with in this Bill tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the entrepreneurs setting up clinics. They are not even doctors. They are businessmen, all sorts of people. They set up these medical centres. They employ doctors and specialists, and they get a very large financial reward. As has already been pointed out tonight, many of them employ doctors who are unethical. We find that a general practitioner will order X-rays to be done by the radiologist in such a centre when in some cases-many cases, no doubt-those X-rays are not needed. So we find that the general practitioner is able to order an X-ray and send the patient on to the radiologist, and they share in the finance of that particular order-on, as well as the entrepreneur, who has his fingers in the till too. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned the very infamous case that we are all aware of, the Edelsten centres, that were first set up in New South Wales. When that particular doctor was deregistered in New South Wales, he immediately moved to Victoria. As I indicated earlier, the closing of the loophole of the deregistered doctor moving from State to State will stop that sort of thing occurring. These entrepreneurial centres are rife in New South Wales, but in my state of Tasmania they have not arrived, and I hope they never will. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me explain to honourable senators what has happened in my State because I think it is a very salutary exercise for these entrepreneurs. We had a Mr Rodney Richards come down from the mainland boasting that he was the one who had set up all the Edelsten centres throughout Australia and he intended to do so in Hobart, and throughout the whole of Tasmania following his undoubted success in Hobart. As we know, these centres are very plush, with chandeliers, plush carpet, velvet lounges, grand pianos, soft music and dim lights-the whole lot. The patient goes in feeling like a king or queen, gets treatment, and is sent around to the various specialists in the centre and, because all of this is bulk billed-with the blessing of the Government-the taxpayer has to foot the bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Rodney Richards came down to try to do the same in Tasmania. He built a large centre which included the $7,000 chandelier, the plush carpets and the velvet lounges, all set up with the most elaborate advertising campaign one can imagine. He boasted that he had entered Tasmania and intended to set up the same type of centres he had set up for Dr Edelsten in the rest of Australia. Tasmania is different from other States in the Commonwealth. The local doctors refused point-blank to take part in the centre. Rodney Richards not only did all he could to entice doctors to do so but also threatened them. Indeed, the President of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) had death threats because of the action he took in opposing this sort of centre. He was invited, very lucratively, to be part of it. Of course, he refused. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not just the local practitioners that did not accept Rodney Richards's invitation. It did not seem to matter where he went in Tasmania. Even though he attempted to bring in South African doctors, he was thwarted. So the clinic has not gone ahead. This very lush centre is still completely empty. No radiologists in Tasmania would serve in it and no general practitioners would serve in it. Finally, Mr Richards has had to leave. He said he pulled out because he was being harassed by his financiers on the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian doctors fund assisted the local practitioners in explaining to the public why they were not going to support such a clinic. It is very enticing for a patient to be told, `Here is this luxurious accommodation. You can come in and have a complete overhaul-X-rays and all the treatment you could possibly desire-and it will not cost you a cent'. One can hardly blame patients for thinking this was a rather wonderful idea. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at what Medicare benefits actually cost us, we find that in New South Wales, where these entrepreneurs abound and where these sorts of centres are set up all over the place, 61 per cent of general practitioners' fees are bulkbilled. In Tasmania, 47 per cent of fees are bulkbilled. The cost of doctors' fees per head, that is, for every man, woman and child, to the taxpayer in New South Wales-and I think it would be a good idea if Senator McMullan heard this because it might change his philosophy-is $225. In Tasmania, it is $174 for every man, woman and child. </PARA>
<PARA> If the cost in Tasmania equalled that in New South Wales, an additional $22 1/2m would be taken out of taxpayers' pockets through Medicare, all because of the idiocy of the Government's ideology that bulkbilling is a good idea and encourages these entrepreneurs-entrepreneurs who are not medical practitioners-to set up such centres. Then the Government complains of abuse of the system. We agree that because of the abuse that the Government has been responsible for encouraging, there should be an arm's length arrangement for X-rays. We support the Government in this, even though we believe that it is going about it incorrectly. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing that I and other Opposition members disagree with is that the Government is now attempting in this legislation to override the professional and medical judgment of the practitioner. It tells us that general practitioners' patients will receive Medicare benefits only if general practitioners take X-rays of extremities, chests and abdomens. For any X-ray of the spine that the general practitioner, in his medical judgment, sees as necessary, the patient will not receive a Medicare rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight Senator Coulter agreed with that change to the legislation. He made the sweeping statement that it is needed because some general practitioners' equipment may not be up to standard. If he believes that and if he is quite serious, he should say that for any X-rays taken with substandard equipment the patient should not receive a Medicare rebate. But he does not say that. He just says that general practitioners with substandard equipment should not have access to Medicare benefits. If a specialist has the older type of equipment, bully for him. His patients can still get the benefit even if he happens to have the same sort of equipment as the general practitioner. It just does not make sense to go down that line. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is taking action to interfere with the professional judgment of the medical profession. I believe that it is the thin edge of the wedge. The Government is saying that no matter how much a general practitioner believes his patient needs an X-ray at the time, he cannot do it unless it is for certain areas of the body. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at how big the problem is, as did Dr Bob Woods, our shadow Minister for health in the House of Representatives. He said that there were something like 25,798 general practitioners in Australia-that is, nearly 26,000 general practitioners-and of those only 1,172 have actually taken X-rays of the spine. That brings the figure down a bit and puts it into perspective. Only 1,172 general practitioners out of nearly 26,000 have taken X-rays of the spine. He went on to say that out of that 1,172 only 109 took more than one X-ray of the spine per week. Nine have taken more than one per day. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government already has in place all sorts of mechanisms for accusing doctors of overservicing. It has doctors' profiles from which it can say that it believes that those nine doctors are overservicing. It can have them checked out. There may be quite legitimate reasons for a general practitioner to take as many X-rays as he is taking. He may be specialising in backs in his own way in some country area. He may specialise in insurance work. </PARA>
<PARA> There may or may not be a legitimate reason for the X-rays being taken, but the Government is able to establish that quite easily without passing special legislation to deal with nine general practitioners. I am surprised that Senator Coulter believes that this is the way we should go about dealing with nine medical practitioners who may or may not be abusing the system. </PARA>
<PARA> To me it is very obvious why the Government is going about the matter in this way. It has always maintained that it should have the say over what doctors are doing and charging. It is now attempting, through backdoor methods, to say just what it believes general practitioners should do. This is the thin end of the wedge. Of course, it is quite qualified to do it. The Government is there to say that it does not believe that doctors should X-ray certain parts of the body, and so it will not allow Medicare benefits to those doctors who do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Medical Association and the Royal Australasian College of Radi- ologists have agreed that this should take place. It is going to be very interesting when the AMA and the College of Radi- ologists appear before us next Friday week. They are coming before the Committee and I will be most interested to hear what they have to say in this regard. The radiologists told me recently that this occurs in other areas. I remember how upset they were when the Government refused to allow access to Medicare benefits by all of their patients who were having magnetic resonance imagings-MRIs-if it was done outside certain hospitals. They were very concerned and they lobbied me and said that it was not fair, that their patients should be entitled to these benefits. It is all right for them; it is not all right for the general practitioners. It will be very interesting next Friday week when they appear before us to find out why they believe it is all right for the goose but not for the gander. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the AMA is concerned, I am not quite sure what it is up to. If it wants this centralised Government to keep having a finger in the pie as to what it is entitled or not entitled to do, I will be very interested to see the result. I believe the Government is entering this field because it likes to have a say in what doctors do and what they cannot do. It provides another foot in the door for the Government when it can deal with the matter very efficiently through its over- servicing mechanisms. I am very concerned that this is the way the Government is going and that the Australian Democrats see this method as overcoming a problem of nine general practitioners who appear to be taking more X-rays of the spine than they should be. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, my colleague dealt with the other areas of the Bill. I see no point in going over the same areas. </PARA>

A professional person who is in full time radiological service-a radiologist-is more likely to have the more modern equipment, the more expensive equipment, and therefore expose a person to less radiation than a general practitioner whose practice comprises only a tiny fraction of X-raying and who is likely to have older equipment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish only to speak on one area of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990, the other area having been covered already by my colleague Senator Coulter. I will be dealing only with the charter of residents' rights and responsibilities in approved hostels and nursing homes. This is one part of a two-part package which also contains the agreement that will be considered by this chamber some time within the next couple of weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite last minute disagreements-very public disagreements-the charter and the agreement represent the outcome of very responsible and extensive consultations. These have been carried out over the last two years by the Government. We believe that in this case these consultations were broad and proper, and I want to stress that this is a most refreshing exception to this Government's usual style of bulldozing ahead regardless; of not consulting, or at best consulting in a very minimal and casual manner. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, I wish to contrast the process that has occurred here with the process that occurred in relation to the $2.50 pharmaceutical charge and the deeming provisions which we are still dealing with in this chamber. In those cases they have not only caused considerable difficulties for elderly citizens, but also the actual stress that has been placed upon senior members of our community and the anxiety and concern that have been caused will surely mean that consultation processes such as we have now seen with the charter will in future be the pro- cess that the Government will follow. </PARA>
<PARA> In this particular case with regard to the charter, I do want to congratulate the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, Mr Staples, and his staff for the long, tedious and sometimes difficult consultation that has occurred. Unfortunately, some of the peak bodies that have taken part in these negotiations and consultations do not appear to have been in regular touch with their own constituents. Some of the difficulties that we now see and some of the very public comments that have been made, I believe, have come out of a breakdown in communication within some of these groups. It has been most unfortunate that this has all occurred at the last minute. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to stress that the Australian Democrats very strongly support the charter and the agreement that goes with it. It is most unfortunate but true that there has been, and still is, a very small minority of nursing homes which abuse the trust placed in them by residents and their relatives in the community who, after all, are the ones who subsidise these positions in nursing homes and hostels. While it is fair to say that the level of abuse varies, whatever the level, we believe it should be and must be a priority of Government to make sure that constraints are imposed, and the rights and responsibilities laid down in this charter will go a long way towards doing that. We have only recently seen the closure of a home in Victoria, and I trust and hope that the Minister will be more energetic than his predecessors in pursuing and closing those homes that are not caring properly for their elderly residents. </PARA>
<PARA> The enormous growth that we have seen over the past 20 years in this industry has had very little by way of regulation to follow it until very recent times. We acknowledge that the Government is taking significant and positive steps to rectify this situation. We also want to state that we believe it is a great credit to the Australian Nursing Homes Association that it has been involved very extensively in the development of this charter and agreement. It has been involved in a very sensible and positive way. It has seen and acknowledged its potential for enhancing the services provided by the Association's members. </PARA>
<PARA> The area of aged care still requires significant reform, especially in relation to community and home based care. I think the Government needs to look very seriously at the way it funds these types of care, and it needs to take immediate steps to overcome the split between Commonwealth and State responsibilities in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The charter and the agreement represent but one plank of the Government's eight-stage strategy to reform nursing home care, and it needs to be seen in that context, as part of a much broader strategy. We welcome these documents but wish to stress that we believe there is still a need, firstly, for more advocacy services, particularly outside the metropolitan areas; secondly, for Commonwealth pressures on those States that have not introduced guardianship legislation and protection of estate legislation to do so; and, thirdly, to ensure that standards are monitored and enforced. </PARA>
<PARA> These documents should not be seen as signalling even the slightest shift away from a wholehearted commitment to outcome standards and the rigorous monitoring and enforcing of those standards. We do not believe that we can simply now hand over to the residents responsibility for totally monitoring the services provided. Finally, we believe that we still need a vastly improved financial commitment generally from the Commonwealth in relation to nursing homes and hostels, particularly in respect of the hours of care each patient is entitled to receive. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, we are generally supportive of the charter but it does not give nursing home residents additional rights to those they already have. What it is doing is ensuring that the rights the residents previously enjoyed simply move with them and carry on into the nursing homes and hostels. It ensures that their rights are protected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats will be moving a number of amendments in the committee stage to the charter and an even larger number of amendments to the agreement when it is tabled. The amendments are mainly intended to address the practical concerns and difficulties, to allay some of the concerns of consumer and industry groups, as well as to tighten certain provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to speak for too long tonight. I will conclude by saying that the charter and agreement have the potential to greatly enhance the rights of residents in all nursing homes and hostels whether operated by private, religious or voluntary organisations. Combined with other policies being pursued by the Government and with some positive developments in these areas in various States, we believe the charter and agreement offer the best chance in many years of improving the delivery of nursing home and hostel services to those people who have to move out of their own homes and into this type of care. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. I wish to direct my remarks this evening to those aspects of the Bill that deal primarily with changes to the practice of radiology in Australia. While the coalition does not oppose those changes that prevent what can be an abuse of the system through the association of specialist radiologists with certain medical centres associated with bulkbilling, it does oppose what are heavy-handed, bureaucratic restrictions on the professional judgment of doctors as to who and what they should X-ray.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition agrees that it is proper to insist that there be in effect an arm's length professional relationship between a general practitioner who requests an X-ray and a specialist. There should be financial and, in general, physical separation between specialists and medical centres. I do not believe that the problem of specialists in effect using their names for bulkbilling is necessarily widespread, with the medical centre actually owning and operating the X-rays. Nonetheless, the coalition has consulted with the representative bodies of the medical profession and has been told that the problem does exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Therein lies the difference between the coalition and the Government. The coalition is prepared to consult with practitioners to find out what their position is, in the same way that it is prepared to consult with any interested body on any piece of legislation. Of course, not coincidentally this piece of legislation also contains items about residents' rights. I recall quite clearly the Minister for Community Services and Health, Mr Staples, saying after the event, after he had announced it and after various nursing homes had kicked up sufficient fuss, that what the Government was doing was wrong. He then said, `We might consult'. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it has ever crossed the mind of this Government to consult beforehand. Quite frankly, I believe that that is how change should be examined, particularly in this area-by first of all asking the health professionals concerned for the integrity and reality of medicine. This is, to say the least, not always the approach of the Hawke Labor Government in regard to health. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this Government always believes that it can do better for a patient, whether it is in the delivery of straight-out medical services, whether it is in the delivery of pharmaceuticals or whether it is in the delivery of radiology or pathology-and the list goes on. I find it rather sad that this is all geared to dollars and cents because the Medicare system has failed this country miserably. </PARA>
<PARA> In supporting a necessary check on an undesirable practice, I would at the same time note that the problem has arisen through what can be described as bulkbilling medical centres. A little earlier, my colleague Senator Walters described the Geoffrey Edelsten medical centres where all of this ran riot. If one were to say that all of this legislation had to be geared to wipe out those types of practices, that would be fine. But that is not the reality. Those practices are not the manifestation of a predatory free market in medicine. They are the direct result of the socialistic Medicare policy of this Labor Government that seeks to encourage bulkbilling and then professes concern when the national cost of medical services rockets and a few entrepreneurial doctors take advantage of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is this Government that has created the problem. It is this Government that continues to insist that the health system is self-financing when in fact we know that it is hard-pressed even to self-finance through the levy 30 per cent of the cost of medicine. And yet the Government pushes on, hoping that people will believe it. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I must emphasise to the Senate that the Minister for Community Services and Health actually boasts that 55 per cent of all medical services are now bulkbilled, including 65 per cent of general practitioners' services. The Government actually boasts about that but therein, once again, lies the problem. The Government is not prepared to correct the problem. It is not prepared to look at the root cause of the problem. It just wants to put a bandaid on the bucket wherever it can and make the final judgment as a government on who best can deliver health services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister and his Government should be especially pleased that in New South Wales the rate of bulkbilling has reached 75 per cent. It is no coincidence that this State has been regarded as the main area of entrepreneurial medical clinics. If people can get away with it, they will. And people are getting away with it, so they continue. Does the Government change that practice? No. It still encourages more and more bulkbilling. </PARA>
<PARA> While there is an unquantified but real problem in the relationship between some specialists and medical centres, any supposed problem in regard to overservicing by general practitioners through the use of spinal X-rays can be identified precisely. The facts of the matter are that of just under 26,000 general practitioners in Australia-25,798-only 1,172, on last available figures, actually took spinal X-rays. This is less than 5 per cent of the total. Only 109 of these doctors take more than one spinal X-ray per week and exactly nine take more than one such X-ray per day, which equates to less than one per cent of general practitioners taking spinal X-rays. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about a practice by less than one per cent of general practitioners that this Bill is designed to stop. I ask: how much more absurd is this Government going to get? If it was a big problem, one could understand the need for legislation. It is such a small problem and in most cases spinal X-rays are warranted. Yet, this Government sees the need to swat flies with sledge-hammers. This Hawke Labor Government is, therefore, changing the law to prevent general practitioners from taking spinal X-rays because of the practice profiles of literally a mere handful of doctors. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a classic example of the regulatory, bureaucratic approach of this Government, and the coalition will move amendments to clause 14 in order to delete it. It will, of course, be up to the Australian Democrats to decide whether they are prepared to back the commonsense and integrity of the medical profession and support this amendment. I do hope that the Australian Democrats will back the medical profession, as opposed to backing the Government, because there is great sense in making sure that it is the medical profession that delivers quality health care and not some government that believes it can do so. </PARA>
<PARA> When this amendment was moved and defeated in the disgracefully short time allocated to this Bill in the House of Representatives, the Minister did not even bother to respond to the argument of the coalition. The Government decided to allocate about 30 to 40 minutes of total debate to a Bill as substantial as this. The week before last the Government decided to guillotine through the House of Representatives 39 Bills in three days, allowing an average of 30 to 40 minutes debate on each Bill. Is it any wonder that there was no proper debate and no opportunity for commonsense to prevail? But, of course, the simple attitude of this Government is `Who cares?'. </PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of principle we do not believe that Ministers and departmental officials should be telling qualified practitioners what services they can supply to those patients who in their judgment require them. Quite clearly, the Government has shown that it is not imposing this restriction for reasons of medical safety. If this were the case doctors in isolated areas would not be permitted under this Bill to continue to provide spinal X-rays. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government certainly cannot say that the whole background of this piece of legislation is to protect the patient for medical reasons. This Labor Government decrees that general practitioners may X-ray chests, abdomens and extremities, but not spines. This is frankly an absurd and demeaning restriction placed upon the medical profession for non-medical reasons. I suppose one does not necessarily need a particularly vivid imagination to understand why it would not want spines X-rayed; I suppose it would be fairly difficult to X-ray a jellyback. There would not be too many on the Government side who would have any bones that would show up in an X-ray either. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters is quite right. This whole thing really does make a farce of the professed concern of the Hawke Labor Government. Only last year it required the higher training of general practitioners through changes to Medicare rebates. The profession is now to have its judgment overridden and a further restriction placed upon the doctor-patient relationship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In one essential respect, the Hawke Labor Government is perfectly consistent. It is unwavering in its resolve to legislate, little by little, more centralised control over medicine and, in particular, the general practitioners who are in constant interaction with the Australian public. If I needed medical attention I would prefer to see my general practitioner than to see the Minister for Community Services and Health, Mr Howe, Dr non-medical Blewett, or any of these people who happen to profess to know more about medicine than my general practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not greatly matter what the pretext is for this centralised interference with medical judgment. A rebate of $122 for a full spinal X-ray is significant, but it still does not amount to a major financial problem when only a handful of doctors may be abusing the system. I use the term `may' advisedly. Unlike the supporters of this Labor Government, I do not condemn doctors simply on the basis of statistics. The fact remains that any abuse by so small a number of doctors can easily be investigated, not in respect of the number of X-rays, but whether they were medically necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the same point time and time again: who is best equipped to decide whether a patient needs an X-ray, a doctor or this Government? I put to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that it is the doctor. The procedures are already in place for the investigation of any such overservicing and there is absolutely no reason for intrusive legislation on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition supports another aspect of the legislation-the provision for a committee of medical peers to examine questions of overservicing, providing that it is in practice independent and representative. With such a mechanism there will be even less need for a blanket prohibition on spinal X-rays offered by general practitioners. The logic escapes this Government, or rather it regards the question as irrelevant and distracting from its real purpose of doing what comes naturally-regulating doctors for the sake of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The observation must again be made that overservicing will inevitably arise so long as this Labor Government encourages bulkbilling. It may not be a matter of doctors supplying unnecessary services, but of some members of the public seeking supposedly free consultations. There is one area that really highlights how bulk billing is abused by many people. Senator Walters could correct me but I think it was only last year when information was supplied to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, inquiring into health matters, which said that during the course of World Expo 88 in Brisbane the number of people who actually visited bulkbilling doctors declined. When Expo was finished it increased. People had something else to do. Yet this Government continues to push forward on bulkbilling. It may not be a matter of doctors supplying unnecessary services. True to form, it is the medical profession once again that is scapegoated for the inherent failings of Labor's health policy. </PARA>
<PARA> There have and will be far more significant pieces of legislation that affect the medical profession than aspects of this Bill to which I have referred. Nonetheless, the people of Australia should be aware that quietly this Labor Government is taking another step in restricting the professional freedom of general practitioners for non-medical reasons. Next year perhaps abdominal X-rays will be banned if a dozen general practitioners are said to be performing an excessive number. The precedent that this aspect of the Bill sets threatens proper doctor-patient relationships even further, and the coalition opposes it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank those honourable senators who contributed to the second reading debate on this particularly important legislation relating to community services and health. I believe that the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 deserves to be given a second reading by the chamber. I will briefly outline the main features which I believe should commend the Bill to the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will know that the Bill contains a number of Government initiatives relating to care for the aged, Medicare, therapeutic goods and nurse education. Of course, there will be great discussion at the committee stage in relation to the charter of residents rights and responsibilities for approved nursing homes which form a schedule to the Act in accordance with previous decisions of this chamber. I believe it is encouraging to hear the support that was notified by the Australian Democrats for the general outline of this particular charter and the dependent agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the charter and the agreement reflect the basic philosophy of this Government. It is that those who, at a stage in their life when they are frail and becoming somewhat more feeble than in their more youthful and hearty days, move from their ordinary accommodation into a hostel or nursing home should carry with them as many of the usual rights, expectations and dignities accompanying their home life-in this particular case I am considering nursing homes-as is possible and which are compatible with their growing frailty and their need and dependence on others for their personal care. </PARA>
<PARA> If people are in a communal situation and a situation of growing dependence in a community of fellow residents and in a nursing home which may have a particular outlook-and of course we are talking about a whole range of such accommodation for the elderly-I think it is important to retain fundamental rights and expectations. It is important that a person not lose those matters which are important to their individual dignity when they make the transition outlined in the charter and agreement contained in the Government's proposition. As I say, no doubt that will receive extensive examination in the committee stage. I do not seek to dwell on matters which have been of great controversy over the last several weeks, but the philosophy of Government is a very sound one and I believe that, as I say, the Bill should receive the support of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Two further measures in this Bill are important to the care of the aged in our Australian community. The first relates to the inclusion of the private sector in the Commonwealth's aged care hostel program. Of course that refers to recurrent funding. I believe it is an important matter which should encourage growth in the number of places available in hostels for our aged population. There is also the abolition of the hostel care subsidy for persons who are not financially disadvantaged. I understand that this aroused some concern during the second reading debate but the idea behind the abolition of the subsidy is to enable the hostel to receive from those residents who are assessed as financially better placed to contribute to the costs of their care such a contribution rather than receive that particular funding amount from the general taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a difficult and delicate area but quite clearly there will be occasions when those who are not financially disadvantaged are in a position to make a greater contribution by way of fee to the funding necessary for the running of a hostel. In that situation, the Government considers that that extra fee ought to be forthcoming. Of course, that will enable a greater amount of government funding to truly support those who are otherwise without the financial resources to pay a substantial or significant contribution towards the residence that they occupy. </PARA>
<PARA> Some other matters are of great significance in the practical living of persons within the nursing homes. I know from my experience in Tasmania that the ability of persons to take unlimited medical leave when they require hospital care and up to 28 days social leave each year will be greatly welcomed as it enables people to undertake that hospital care or to have 28 days in every year away from the nursing home with the absolute security that that bed will be available to them when they return from hospital or from that recreational or social leave. That gives a certain sense of security without the feeling of entrapment, and I think that is an extremely important part of the measure before us this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go through various other sections, but I ought to deal with the questions of unethical practices which, I think it is acknowledged generally, have grown up, particularly those relating to radiology services. Generally speaking, those radiology services ought to be paid for by way of Medicare in cases where the service has been provided at the request of a practitioner who has no direct financial interest in the ordering of those services. The Government believes it is important that such a nexus not exist and will take steps to ensure that that unethical practice is curbed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is known that this is not something that has simply emerged from the Government. I recall that former Senator Georges, the then Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, stated that what that Committee had discovered in the area of pathology seemed to be emerging in some instances in relation to radiology. </PARA>

<PARA> I am getting a little side-tracked, Madam Acting Deputy President. The fact is that these medical entrepreneurs who were responsible for the emergence of self-referral radiology and other arrangements designed to encourage excessive services have been a blot on the copybook of the medical profession and I have no doubt that it is for that reason that the specific provisions in this Bill dealing with the introduction of a formal mechanism for the requesting of diagnostic imaging services and so on have now found the full support, as I understand it, of the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists, the Australian Medical Association and now the general practitioners through the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that honourable senators who have contributed to this debate have not given enough weight to the amendments to the Bill which were made at the House of Representatives committee stage by way of Government amendment, which enabled Dr Kinder, the Secretary-General of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, to put out a press release on 6 November 1990 quoting the College's President, Dr Buhagiar, as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The college supports the Government's objectives with the legislation, but has been concerned to ensure the legitimate interests of General Practitioners providing diagnostic imaging services for their patients are effectively protected. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has shown a willingness to listen to reasoned argument and his co-operation on this matter will be welcomed by the General Practitioner community . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The College will be working closely with the Government and the Australasian College of Radiologists in the development of appropriate accreditation and quality assurance programmes for GPs providing diagnostic imaging services after 1 January, 1993. </PARA>
<PARA>With the inclusion of an amendment moved by the Government in the House of Representatives at the committee stage, one now has a situation where the fears and misgivings which Senator Walters was expressing on behalf of many general practitioners have, to a great extent, been allayed and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has given its support to this proposal along with the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists. </PARA>

When I inquired today of the Minister's office, I was told that no letters addressed to the Minister were kept in his office but were forwarded to the Department of Community Services and Health. I then inquired whether they could come back to me with any form of reply. I have finally been given an answer, but unless I can identify the person to whom I spoke this afternoon-which I cannot-then the Department is not even in a position to say who took the original call.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to state why the Australian Democrats will not be supporting these amendments. We are very concerned that, if these amendments are accepted, there will be the removal of any link between fee relief and accreditation. We do understand, however, the concerns that the Liberal Party has with this. But we do emphasise that the guidelines, which I understand we will be seeing very shortly-they are being drafted now-are, indeed, a disallowable instrument. So we are not in fact dealing with their contents tonight, but simply looking at what Senator Alston has quite accurately described as a breaking of the link between the fee relief-in other words, the money provided by the Commonwealth-and any ability that the Commonwealth will have in the future to actually check up on what is happening by way of standards in child-care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree that the particular points (a), (b) and (c) are indeed necessary, and one would hope-and we will be able to check-that, when the guidelines do come before this place, all of those areas will be covered. But one would hope that there will be considerably more considerations as well as these three items. Our concern is that we are tying the Minister in to including only these three areas in the guidelines which are being drafted. </PARA>
<PARA> Other areas the Democrats would like to see particularly deal with standards and outcomes, and I realise that these are difficult matters. They are very difficult to tie down precisely. It is going to be a long and, hopefully, very detailed consultation that goes on. The people that we had appearing before our committee, we have been assured by the Minister, will indeed be part of this consultation process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that we will be able now to quite adequately monitor progress of the guidelines and, indeed, any accreditation system that comes out. However, we are very concerned that, if we pass this amendment tonight, we will be cutting off a real opportunity to assure quality control on child-care centres. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would certainly be grateful for the Minister's response, but my understanding of what was agreed to at that Senate committee hearing is that there will be guidelines issued in relation to fee relief, and that will enable fee relief to commence on or shortly after 1 January 1991; and there will be at some later time additional and quite separate guidelines in relation to the accreditation system. I take the Minister's nodding as an assent to the proposition. Therefore, I say for the benefit of Senator Lees that what we are proposing tonight by way of amendments would simply provide an objective basis for the granting of fee relief to centres which will presumably be receiving that fee relief from 1 January 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a matter of regret that Senator Lees, I think, is not able to hear what I am saying at the present time. I will just say it again. The Minister accepts the proposition that there are indeed two separate and distinct sets of guidelines. One in relation to fee relief will be available shortly, and that is quite separate and distinct from later guidelines that will be developed in relation to accreditation. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems inconceivable to me that granting fee relief pursuant to certain guidelines from 1 January 1991 will at some later time be withdrawn on the basis of subsequent accreditation guidelines. So we can have, if you like, a parallel system where fee relief is provided to commercial centres, as the general proposition has been accepted that it ought to be extended to the private sector and that there are these agreed minima which are objective and in normal circumstances would not require value judgments on the part of the Minister. They would be matters that we could simply test by checking whether a centre was registered, whether it had proper insurance and whether it complied with the audit and accountability requirements. That ought to be a matter of mechanics. The fee relief is then granted. That does not prevent an insistence at a later stage on accreditation guidelines. Indeed, that is what I thought was going to be done at a much later point in time. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot see how there can be a link on that basis. There can be a link between the two only if at some later stage it is decided to withdraw fee relief because it is judged that a centre is not complying. If it is complying on 1 January 1991, on what basis is it withdrawn later on? It will have to be-unless the centre suddenly embarks upon a deliberate deterioration in standards-because a judgment has been made after the event that it should never have got fee relief in the first place. That seems an extraordinary proposition. What I say to the Committee is that, if one does believe in federalism and if one does take the language of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) at the Special Premiers Conference at face value, then one does acknowledge that there are areas of responsibility for State and Federal governments in the area. The Federal Government's responsibility can quite simply be in the area of fee relief. We do not accept that there is a need for an accreditation system. </PARA>
<PARA> But if it is accepted that there is a role to be played by the States, surely it is to maintain and improve upon the system of regulation that has been in place for many years. It will vary, it does vary now and it ought to vary. We do not believe that there ought to be an across the board system that can somehow define absolutely precisely how all child-care centres in Australia ought to operate. Quality control will be a matter of subjectivity and it will be a matter of constant debate. But those matters can be resolved through a ministerial council, and that is the way to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not heard criticisms in the specifics of child-care centres. I often hear people say, `Some are better than others; I can tell you some crook ones' or `Some States are better than other States'. But one never gets down to the point of demonstrating that there is a sufficient quantity of poor quality child-care centres to then lead on to a justification for overturning a State system of regulation. Indeed, the Government has said, `Well, this is not going to be a duplication; this is going to be complementary'. All that means in practice is that there will be a continuing State system of regulation that will continue to insist on a whole range of standards from childminder-childcarer to child ratios, the size of child-care centres, the physical area, and a whole range of other matters that currently operate. Those will continue in any event. But overlaid on top of that there will be an accreditation system. I do not understand what that is meant to achieve, unless it is to basically put those State regulations out of business. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the real agenda, we are talking about a Federal takeover of child-care, which would be utterly contrary to what the Prime Minister has said and to all the rhetoric that has been waved around on the subject. It will not mean `complementary' at all; it will mean `a substitution for'. If that is the situation, it strikes me as verging on a nonsense because the Government might as well come out in the open and say, `We want to dismantle the current system of regulation; what we want to do is put in place a whole new system of Federal regulation, and we are going to tie your entitlement to child-care to compliance with those federally determined standards'. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not accept that that is feasible, politically or otherwise, and I certainly do not accept it as desirable. What it will do is play into the hands of the child-care industry and those professionals who want to put in place whole new career structures, with the inevitable outcome that the costs will be jacked up. If that is what the Government wants to do, this is probably the best way to go about doing it. There is very little doubt that the Australian Council of Trade Unions' agenda in this whole exercise, having had a very strong fundamental objection to the extension of fee relief to the private sector, is now to concede it on terms-and those terms are that there ought to be an accreditation system inextricably linked to fee relief so that there cannot be one without the other. </PARA>
<PARA> What that would have meant is that one would not get one's fee relief until one met these ever-increasing standards. What Senator Tate did in that last Committee was to decouple those two principles. Once one does that, one ends up saying, `We are prepared to grant fee relief to the existing private sector centres. We will go on doing that but at some later point we will talk about standards under an accreditation system'. If the Government is going to tell me that at that later point it will then turn around and say, `We are going to take away your fee relief even though you were worthy of having it on 1 January and nothing has changed in terms of your performance other than that after the event you do not measure up to new standards that we have put in place', I think that is a charade. </PARA>
<PARA> That is certainly not in the interests of child-care users. It can have only one outcome. It can turn child-care into an industrial relations issue. It can move right away from putting child-care preferences in the hands of parents. It will suit what I would have thought was an ideological objective that had been disowned by this Government. I would be very interested to hear from the Minister and the Australian Democrats whether they think that that is the way in which a subsequent accreditation system is going to operate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lees was not guilty of confusion between the sorts of criteria put down in the Opposition's first amendment, in trying to insert a new subsection with three different criteria for the Minister's satisfaction. I think what Senator Lees was saying was that this itself may not be an exhaustive list of even those more mechanical matters. For example, one may wish to cover in the guidelines questions like the hours of opening, the provision of more statistical information to the child-care authorities--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And a type of accountability, but in the provision of statistical information as to the number of children who are cared for over any particular period and so on. In other words, there are other matters that could come into the guidelines. I think Senator Lees was simply saying that one should not adopt this particular provision, which might cut off the development of these guidelines-which after all will in a sense be brought back to the Senate in that they will be made by way of a disallowable instrument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills when reporting on the proposed amendments to the Child Care Act said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee notes with approval that in each case the guidelines concerned are disallowable instruments within the terms of section 46(a) of the Acts Interpretation Act. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose that is the point that I understood the Australian Democrats to be making: that there may be more matters in the guidelines than are covered by the Opposition's set of three criteria and that we ought to allow the guidelines to be developed. They will be published, as I understand it, very shortly and, of course, as they will be disallowable we will be able to have a look at them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the accreditation system is distinct. I decoupled it during that very useful and constructive session of the Committee meeting to discuss this Bill. Those quality measures will be deliberated upon and consultations will occur, particularly with parent groups. This was an important emphasis that came out of that Committee discussion. This is not a matter that should be taken over by the professional providers of child-care services nor by, in some cases, the proprietors of those homes or the boards that run the non-profit child-care centres. The parents have a very real and pre-eminent role, and their voice must be heard in any consultations to do with the quality of the care that is provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not be supporting the particular amendments moved by the Opposition, because we believe that the guidelines will be developed in accordance with the undertakings which I gave to the Committee in our deliberations. They will be available in a form which, as Senator Lees says on behalf of the Democrats, may embrace other criteria but of a more formal kind than accreditation qualitative matters. </PARA>

It may take a year or a year and a half to look at the questions of accreditation in regard to the quality of child-care. But there was no sense, I am sure, of indifference to the undertakings given to the Committee, and I think accepted in good faith by Senator Alston, as he apparently responded by way of a letter to the Minister.

<PARA> Clause 31, page 21, paragraphs (a) and (b), lines 28 to 34, omit the proposed paragraphs. </PARA>
<PARA>We certainly recognise the need to publish aggregate data on pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) prescribing and support the publication of that data as long as it does not identify the individual manufacturer. Confidentiality of individual company data is maintained for other industries and the argument is that surely pharmaceutical manufacturers should be no exception. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says that the manufacturers want information about the sale of drugs and, therefore, it is releasing it. However, it was the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, which represents some 93 per cent of manufacturers, that put this concern in its submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. Its submission stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The APMA supports in principle the ability of DCSH to publish aggregate data on PBS prescribing which is of benefit to the community. However, the amendment goes too far and has the potential to identify individual manufacturers, which is not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government says that there is a lack of data to ensure that subsidised drugs are used in ways that reflect sound medical practice and cost effectiveness, but the pharmaceutical manufacturers disagree with this and claim that the Government already holds aggregate details of their market share. It would seem that for this reason alone the Government's argument does not hold up, and the manufacturers see no reason to publish those figures which are already collected. </PARA>
<PARA> The manufacturers do not believe that the publication of such data will necessarily have any positive effect on doctors' prescribing habits. We agree with this conclusion. Doctors' prescribing habits will be improved only if the Government provides them with some incentive to prescribe a cheaper alternative and undertakes a comprehensive education program informing them about generic equivalents and convincing them that they can be safely prescribed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment proposed by the Opposition, as Senator Patterson said, deals with the revelation of information, even though that information may go to the extent of identifying particular manufacturers. Of course, in certain instances where a particular manufacturer has a product which is used by a very large number of practitioners-as a hypertensive agent, or whatever-it may be that that manufacturer has a very dominant share of the market, and it may also be a particularly profitable line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Patterson said, it is quite clear that the public revelation of this information could identify that market share and could, potentially, open up for other potential competitors the idea that it would be useful to make a duplicate of that particular drug and get it onto the market. Of course, the general proposition that that is the case would become known through the detailers who go round to general practitioners, knock on their doors, leave free samples and so on. What is available through this mechanism is far more precise information. </PARA>
<PARA> Having looked at this, I would like to be persuaded by the Government as to why it needs to reveal this information to this extent. If there is a good reason I am prepared to be persuaded that that reason would be sufficient to keep this clause in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. If there is not a substantial reason as to why one should go this far with the public revelation of information-because, after all, the information is privately held by the Department and the Department can make decisions about it; why this information should be more generally available is not at all clear to me-I would certainly like to hear from the Government as to precisely why it wishes to go this far. As I have indicated, if the Government can provide a substantial reason, we are prepared to support the Government. If the reason is, in our opinion, not sufficiently substantial, we are prepared to support the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>

So long as there is a situation where that privacy consideration is upheld, the sorts of concerns which usually accompany the gathering of statistical data are satisfied. I believe it goes without saying that the provision of general statistical information can be extremely important in the formulation of policy and an understanding of whether a particular scheme or provision of a service is working correctly and in a way which satisfies the original policy objectives. If one is carrying out research into these areas, of course, one needs the best possible statistical data, but in a way which does not trespass upon privacy considerations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it from what the Minister has said that he has not actually read the proposed new subsection.

I believe that in that situation, while there may be some concerns relating to identification-which is always the case where statistics are being gathered and where, as Senator Patterson said, there is a small field of players-the concerns are perhaps magnified to a greater extent than they need to be.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.30)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I take this opportunity to address the matter of the Ravenshoe sawmill. I want to respond to some of the comments made earlier today by Senator Richardson after Question Time and set the record straight on a number of technical matters that relate to the document that was tabled in Parliament earlier this week in respect of this mill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Richardson said that he has been advised by the receivers that the document was not prepared for them. That may be the case. It was my understanding at the time at which the document was made available to me that it had been prepared for the receivers. Whether that is the case or not, I believe that the evidence contained in that document is very important evidence. From what I can see of the document itself, given its detail, it has quite clearly come from the accounts of the company. </PARA>
<PARA> I say that because there are details in the particular document that has been tabled that have not previously been available to the Senate. For example, we did not know the date on which funds were received for the veneer mill that was sold in November. It was only this document that told us that it was 14 November. That fact leads me to the conclusion that it must be reasonably well sourced from within the company. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other factors as well, such as the particular breakdown of the veneer timber that was sold out of Ravenshoe, sent to Sydney and never paid for. The ageing of the accounts and so on makes it very clear that the material was obviously sourced from the accounts of the company at Ravenshoe. Proof of the importance of this document is the fact that Senator Richardson has passed it on to the Attorney-General's Department. He has done so because he believes it is worthy of investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson also has not taken issue with a number of parts of the document. For example, he takes no issue with the apparent fact that $1.15m of veneer timber left Ravenshoe, was sent to Sydney and was not paid for. These are the important aspects of this document. Whether or not the receivers had seen it before is irrelevant. The relevant fact is that this document discloses new information on the company and it is of critical importance to the investigations that I have been urging for some time now. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity wholeheartedly to congratulate Senator Richardson for passing the document on to the Attorney-General's Department. I am very pleased to see that Senator Richardson is treating this matter with the gravity that it deserves. The Ravenshoe sawmill is a very sad case, and I am pleased to see that Senator Richardson, as a result of the work I have been doing, is treating the matter with the degree of seriousness that it warrants. As I said before, Senator Richardson deserves to be congratulated on this. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said before, and I say again, that I am only too happy to cooperate in whatever investigations are suggested and I hope that the Department will cooperate in a similarly frank and open way with my investigations. I am also pleased to hear Senator Richardson's advice that the Attorney-General's Department is supposed to report within two weeks. I hope that that is the case so we can clear the air once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very clear, as a result of all of the evidence that has been amassed, that if the Ravenshoe sawmill were given a fair go it would be a viable financial proposition. Nothing that anybody in this chamber has seen can contradict that. That is why I am concerned to see that the matter is dealt with as speedily as possible and I thank Senator Richardson for the attention he has given to it. I wanted to take that opportunity to set the record straight. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other matter that I was intending to raise earlier today but was unable to do so. I refer to what the Inter-State Commission (ISC) has had to say about road transport. In particular, I want to refer to a number of issues that were raised with me in north Queensland concerning the implications of the implementation of a national road registration scheme along the ISC guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this week in the Committee of the Whole Senator Collins admitted for the first time that the Government does intend to introduce on 1 July 1991 a national road registration scheme for heavy road transport. For the first time we had an admission from a Minister in Parliament that the intention is that the registration fees will be along the lines of those proposed in the Inter-State Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA> Everybody has heard the figures before but I will cite them once again. For example, the road transport operator of a 40-foot semi-trailer registered in Queensland will be expected to pay a charge which will increase from the current figure of $2,500 to $18,500. For the ordinary person in the street, this translates into a 20 per cent increase in national freight cartage charges. Let us look at the implications for north Queensland of that 20 per cent increase in road transport costs. For example, the Atherton Tablelands Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd spends $3m a year transporting its milk and dairy products from the Atherton Tablelands to Cairns and Townsville. A 20 per cent increase in that transport charge would mean about $600,000 in increased costs for the dairy cooperative. On top of this, the dairy cooperative has five milk trailers for which the increase in charges would be something in the vicinity of $80,000. We are talking about an increase in charges of roughly $680,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The response from the Government has been that these companies can pass on the increase. But, unfortunately, dairy industry companies cannot pass it on because the price of milk is regulated by law and the price of other dairy products, for example butter, is effectively set by a market price in Brussels. This is why so many industries throughout provincial Australia-industries that affect the lives of each and every one of us-will be devastated by the introduction of these increased road transport charges. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also spoken about the potato industry. Potato growers are currently earning about $8 a bag for potatoes coming off the Atherton Tablelands and marketed in Sydney. Unfortunately, the cost of getting the potatoes out of the ground, bagged and down to Sydney is $9 a bag-$5.50 of which is the road transport charge. If there is a 20 per cent increase in road transport costs, it will mean that the cost of transporting each and every bag of potatoes from the Atherton Tablelands to Sydney will become $6.60. That will mean that the effective cost of getting the potatoes out of the ground and down to Sydney will be over $10-which is the top market price for top quality potatoes in large quantities. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of that will be to devastate-totally destroy-the potato industry in north Queensland. In addition to the cost of harvesting the potatoes, bagging them and so on, there is also the cost of planting them, fertilising them and tending them in the growing season. This extra cost would destroy that industry in north Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> A final example of the implications of the increase in road transport charges is demonstrated eloquently when one looks at the sugar cane industry around Bundaberg. I attended a rally recently where I spoke to a number of young sugar cane farmers from the Gin Gin area and they said that one of the problems the sugar cane industry faces is that the type of soil found in the Bundaberg area, while very fertile red soil in every other respect, is very low in calcium. They solved that problem by trucking up gypsum and putting it over the soil to increase the calcium content. </PARA>
<PARA> A tonne of gypsum goes for something like $15 in Brisbane. By the time it gets to Bundaberg and the surrounding areas the cost after transport is $50 a tonne. In other words, there is a $35 a tonne transport charge. An increase of another $7.00 in transport charges puts that gypsum out of the reach of the sorts of farmers who need it. These farmers were talking about spreading between two to five tonnes of gypsum on every acre of land planted to sugar cane. The consequence of this increased charge will be that those farmers will not be able to afford the gypsum, therefore their productivity and their yields will shrink and more of them will become marginal operators. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when the Government is talking about micro-economic reform and making the Australian economy more efficient, it seems ludicrous that it should impose increases in charges that will make more operators marginal, make it more difficult for Australian primary producers to be competitive in international markets and make it more difficult for them to improve their rate of return. For these reasons I believe it is necessary for the Opposition to oppose the implementation of the scheme along the lines of the Inter-State Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to get specific answers from the relevant Ministers on two issues. The first relates to the gardens and environs of the old Parliament House. I refer to an answer the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) gave to a question on 22 August when he referred to funds being allocated for the continuing care and maintenance of the old Parliament House. As far as I am aware nothing has been said about what is to happen to the environment and gardens of the building.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to know whether in returning the building to its 1927 configuration the Minister had in mind the gardens of the building. For those who know the design of the 1927 building, the gardens were very much an integral part of it. My understanding-it is certainly the view of the National Trust-is that the retention of the park and garden areas around the building is absolutely essential to maintain the integrity of the building. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about what will occur because the previous proposal of the Government was to place a child-care centre in the gardens on the House of Representatives side. I believe that is not now going ahead but nothing has actually been said about what will occur or whether anything else is planned to go into the location of the grounds on either side of the building. I believe the proposal for a child-care centre is out of character; it was certainly a very expensive way of providing child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason I am concerned about the commitment not only to the building itself but also to the areas which surround it. I think in the longer term, if the building is to be made a museum or an historical place, these matters are very important. I request that the Minister for Administrative Services respond beyond the information he has given to the present time, provide an assurance that the gardens surrounding the building be recognised as a significant and integral part of the heritage of Australia and of the building itself and give a firm commitment to their preservation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I wish to raise relates to the portfolio of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) and the apparent recent intervention by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the question of where the Sea Safety Centre will be located. I am sure the Senate remembers the saga of the centre and the decision originally made that it should go to Newcastle. This would have had a number of severe consequences, and the reasons for maintaining the centre in Canberra were undoubtedly very sound. They included the lack of suitable accommodation in Newcastle and the very likely loss of expert staff which would have occurred and which would have seriously interfered with the capacity of the unit to function. In addition to those reasons there was also the question of disruption to the staff who for some time have not known whether they would be staying in Canberra or whether their employment would be disrupted. </PARA>
<PARA> It was my view that the decision to shift the centre to Newcastle was more to win votes in the Newcastle area than to do something that was in the best interests of sea safety and rescue operations. Subsequently a delegation from Newcastle came to see the Prime Minister and at that time he agreed to review the decision even though it was clear that Senator Collins was firmly of the view that the centre should remain in Canberra. In respect of that I would like to know: what is the nature of the Prime Minister's undertaking to the delegation from Newcastle? Who is conducting a review of the Cabinet decision not to move the centre? What are the terms of reference of the review? What is the time frame within which this review is to take place? The time frame is particularly important because the lives of those involved, who have worked in the Sea Safety Centre for a long time, are virtually being put on hold again by not knowing what the Prime Minister's commitment to review the decision really meant. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the two matters I would like answers on from the Ministers concerned in somewhat more detail than has been given to the present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday this week I asked a question without notice of Senator Collins, the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications. My question read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Is it the practice of Telecom Australia to intercept or monitor telephone calls between its employees and its employers, save for Telecom telephonists? Has Telecom knowledge of such a practice taking place in Western Australia? Under what authority does such conduct take place?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins responded-I had given him notice to enable him to answer my inquiry-by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I have asked Telecom for a response. It has provided me with the following information which, in fact, arrived just this morning. The answer to the first part of Senator Crichton-Browne's question is no-</PARA>
<PARA>-that is, whether it was the practice of Telecom. The answer continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The interception of telephone calls is regulated in Australia by the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. The Act makes it unlawful for any person to intercept telephone calls without the knowledge of the person making the communication, except where it is done by an officer of Telecom in the execution of his or her duties in certain specific circumstances or under a warrant issued under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>With respect to the second part of the question, in early 1989 Telecom investigatory staff in Western Australia incorrectly arranged for call charge analysis equipment-that is, CCAS equipment-to be placed on the services of some employees whose compensation cases were under review. CCAS equipment does not record details of conversations, but records the number dialled, the date and the duration of the calls. The error was detected and the matter was referred to the Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins went on to say that he would seek an answer as to the resolution of that reference. One might well ask what material benefit there was for Telecom to learn the number dialled, the date and the duration of calls of employees who had compensation claims afoot. I made it clear that I thought there was further information to be provided, and the following morning on an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program Mr John Lewis, the manager of Telecom Protective Services in Western Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is, I believe . . . some misinformation  . . . currently being circulated. I suggest maybe . . . what the question is based on . . . is that misinformation. </PARA>
<PARA>The interviewer then said:</PARA>
<PARA>Right. So-who's putting around that misinformation, Mr Lewis?</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . one could only guess that . . .  anyone that may wish to . . . place Telecom or my particular . . . Region . . .  that's the Security &amp;Investigation Branch . . . in a bad light. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Lewis was suggesting that my information had come from mischievous people or I was mischievous in providing it. That is a very unsatisfactory response from Telecom. The fact that I asked the question exposed to the world that Telecom had been bugging its own employees. Further, I am not satisfied that a proper and exhaustive inquiry has been conducted by Telecom, and it has allowed the Minister to answer in a less than complete way. I believe there is further information that is available to it. I believe that Telecom management, at least at the customer/plant management level, is aware of this practice; that it has knowledge of the interception by Telecom of telephone conversations between employees of Telecom and customers of Telecom without either the customer or the employee having knowledge of that interception, with the interception providing a voice recording of the conversation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not Telecom's ombudsman, I am not its keeper, and I am not its investigator. It is up to Telecom to undertake a proper inquiry on the basis of the question thus far asked and to satisfy itself absolutely, impeccably, that the circumstances to which I refer either do or do not take place. I would have thought that Telecom should have been able to undertake that investigation and solve this matter internally. However, it ought not to be forgotten, as Senator Collins reminds us, that it is an offence under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act of 1979-with some very striking penalties for those who breach it-to listen, in an unauthorised way, to people's telephone calls. The great risk for Telecom is that it has at its fingertips the capacity to plug into any telephone conversation it wants to. That is the great risk for society. It is a great temptation for Telecom, and that is why the Act is as it is. I would expect Telecom now to pursue this inquiry and get to the bottom of the matter, and not suggest that anybody who asks questions of this nature is simply putting around misinformation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday in the consideration of Appropriation Bill No. 1 there were a number of occasions on which the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, gave commitments that additional information would be provided for the Senate's consideration. I must express my extreme disappointment that Senator Bolkus has not honoured his commitments. In respect of the Department of Administrative Services, I asked a most important question relating to fraud at the Royal Australian Air Force base, Tindal, in the construction phases of that particular project. The information was complex, but I had given notice of it and had spoken about it the day before. Let me quote the reply of Senator Bolkus as recorded in the Daily Hansard of 28 November at page 4647:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I think the best way to approach that question, since it does go to some fine accounting, is to provide an answer at hopefully a later time today. </PARA>
<PARA>In respect of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, I raised a question relating to the funding of the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association, headquartered in Alice Springs. I was seeking information additional to that which had been provided to a question on notice. After an exchange of various questions and answers, on page 4695 Senator Bolkus said:</PARA>
<PARA>I must indicate that I am embarrassed-and I have no reservation in saying that-that we do not have the relevant person or the relevant information here. That person has been located, but I think we should have been more diligent in providing information to Senator Tambling and Senator Kemp. Can I take that on notice and assure Senator Tambling that by tomorrow morning we will have the answer for him. </PARA>
<PARA>In the consideration of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) and a matter that related to libel and defamation that could have implications for the Government and for the Northern Land Council, again there was an exchange of questions and answers, and at page 4701 of Hansard Senator Bolkus said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have asked officers to provide me with a full and accurate answer by lunchtime tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA>On another matter relating to the consideration of ATSIC finances concerning its regional offices, at page 4702 of Hansard Senator Bolkus said:</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, we will provide full answers. The request has been made that they be provided by lunchtime tomorrow, and I expect them to be available to me. </PARA>
<PARA>On four occasions yesterday Senator Bolkus gave a commitment to provide information relating to the Appropriation Bill. I took his undertakings in good faith, believing that he would honour that commitment, and in doing so did not hold up in any way the consideration of the committee stages of the Appropriation Bill. I could quite properly have requested the postponement of the consideration of that department. That would have frustrated the work of the Senate and would not have worked to the benefit of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Before lunch today a member of my staff approached the office of Senator Bolkus and asked whether this information would be coming today. We were informed that they did not know whether it would be. Since before the dinner break this evening, I have been attempting to locate Senator Bolkus or any member of his staff. We have made repeated phone calls. It was not until just before this adjournment debate that I learned from the Government Whip that Senator Bolkus has been paired since 6.30 this evening. I do not doubt that he is away on proper business. However, the fact that there has not been one member of his staff available to provide information on a day that the Senate is sitting, and on which he has given serious commitments to provide information to the Senate, is a very serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that we note that the performance of Senator Bolkus this week in this chamber has been most unsatisfactory. He has continually not been able to provide answers through Question Time, and certainly he was frustrated on many occasions in the consideration of the Appropriation Bill. But I consider it to be an insult not only to myself but also to the Senate that he is a man who cannot honour the commitments that he gives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have seen a marvellous performance from Senator Tambling of misleading the Senate. But I do have some sympathy. When Ministers genuinely promise, they should deliver. But tonight Senator Tambling has been very selective in his quotes. Let me go through the issues he has raised. In the first issue, Senator Bolkus said `hopefully'; that is not a definite promise. He said that hopefully the information will be available. Therefore, whilst it would be preferable for it to be here, he did not absolutely promise. Strike one! On the second one, Senator Tambling failed to quote from the top of page 4696. When Senator Bolkus promised to get an answer `today', Senator Tambling then asked another series of questions. Senator Bolkus had something else to say, and let me quote that to the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I will ask officers to provide it to me by tomorrow and I will get it to him either tomorrow or Monday. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, because the first one related to the other. Senator Bolkus comes back and qualifies his statement by saying that he will have the answer by tomorrow and will forward it to Senator Tambling either today or by Monday. Senator Tambling did not include that quote. Strike two! Senator Tambling did not go on to quote from page 4701 where the Minister expresses the hope-I am paraphrasing his words-that he will have a full and accurate answer by lunchtime tomorrow. He then goes on to say that if it is provided he or someone else will give Senator Tambling the answer. Strike three!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I go over the page to Senator Tambling's fourth quote. He did not include this. On page 4702, Senator Bolkus said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . and I expect them to be available to me. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the problems with all these questions on notice put by Senator Tambling is that there are so many that it is very difficult in the Committee of the Whole to get the answers immediately. In the Department of Defence, hundreds of questions were put on notice. I think I managed to answer every one before we came into this chamber. What happened in committee? We went off on frolics that had never even been conceived in the Estimates Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Tambling is asking for good will and cooperation, he should have a look at what has happened to the Estimates committee process. A select committee reported last year on changes that one had hoped would improve the procedures and those changes were laid down in this chamber. We are supposed to discuss in committee only what is in the Estimates Committee report. But senator after senator on the other side reserved every one of the hundreds and thousands of questions they asked and perverted that new system. There has to be good will on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw Senator Tambling's attention to the fact that the Minister did indicate that urgent replies were required and that he hoped they would be provided on Monday. But I think Senator Tambling has been a bit unfair in his quotes because he has not batted on with them all and has not put the qualifiers in. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been two or three other speeches tonight. Senator O'Chee had a practice run on a couple. He raved on about Ravenshoe. I have not followed those details, so I cannot give him a response. Senator O'Chee also noted that the principle of user pays in the transport industry is not always of benefit to the community. I simply draw Senator O'Chee's attention to the policy of the Bjelke-Petersen Government on coal charging, whereby user pays charges were doubled; 200 per cent of the cost was paid. He might like to take that up with some of his National Party of Australia colleagues in Queensland and see just how the real experts did it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid raised two issues, neither of which I can add a lot to. I will pass on to the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, her comments on old Parliament House. In these stringent times of economic austerity, it is very hard to find the money to do the things we would like to do to the building. As far as I know, there was no formal inquiry into the Sea Safety Centre, but Senator Collins can deal with that in due course. I congratulate Senator Crichton-Browne on the briefest adjournment speech I have ever heard him make. Could I have 100 signed copies of it?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Land Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yes, the Commonwealth has programs relating to interstate coach safety.</PARA>
<PARA> Bus safety has been a priority on the Commonwealth Government's road safety agenda for some time. Australian Design Rules promulgated or already in preparation cover antilock brakes, bus rollover strength, speed limiting, improvements to bus seat strength and anchorages, seat belts for unprotected seating positions and improvements to driver's seat belts.</PARA>
<PARA> A new Australian Design Rule which provides for improvements to seat strength, seat anchorage strength and padding in coaches will come into effect from 1 July 1992 for heavy buses and 1 January 1993 for light buses. The Federal Office of Road Safety has developed the Rule with the cooperation of the coach industry and I am pleased to have secured the support of my State and Territory colleagues in having the Rule endorsed.</PARA>
<PARA> Further work is being undertaken to examine options for even higher levels of passenger protection, including further increases in seat strength and the provision of seat belts for all passengers. In addition, work is in hand on emergency exits, electrical isolation switches and window glass requirements. I have directed the Vehicle Standards Advisory Committee to give these matters high priority. The introduction of standards as a result of this work will keep Australia at the forefront of international bus and coach safety standards.</PARA>
<PARA> Funding for the support of technical committees developing Australian Design Rules is provided by the Department of Transport and Communications. In addition, the Commonwealth is jointly funding a study on seat strength currently being conducted at the New South Wales Crashlab.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also made a major commitment to the road safety of all Australians with the 10 point road safety package and black spot program which includes extra funding to help eliminate hazardous spots on roads with a history of serious casualties.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter to which the honourable senator refers relates to the treatment of bad debts under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the income tax law bad debts may be claimed as deductions under either of two provisions of the Act. One is a specific provision dealing with bad debts, section 63, and the other is the general deductions provision, section 51.</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the specific provision itself sets out two bases for deducting bad debts. Pursuant to paragraph 63 (1) (a) a debt which has, during the income year, been written off as a bad debt, will be allowable as a deduction if it has already been brought to account as assessable income in any year. Pursuant to paragraph 63 (1) (b), a bad debt will also be deductible if it is incurred in respect of money lent in the ordinary course of a money lending business.</PARA>
<PARA> Alternatively, a deduction may be allowed under the general deductions provision, subsection 51 (1), where the bad debt is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income to the extent that it is not a capital loss or of a capital, domestic or private nature.</PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances outlined by the Honourable Senator, two distinct debts may arise as bad debts. The first is the non-receipt of interest which may have accrued on a fixed interest security, and the second is the inability to recover the full amount invested in the security. To illustrate the operation of the provisions to the non-receipt of both interest and the underlying investment, I will refer to three different categories of taxpayers-individuals, organisations carrying on the business of money lending, and other businesses bringing income to account under the accruals method of tax accounting.</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, an individual who deposits funds in a fixed interest security clearly makes a capital investment. In general, unless the accruals method applies under division 16e of the Act, it is only when interest is actually paid or credited on the security that it will form part of the assessable income of that person. Accordingly, where a debtor institution is unable to meet its liability to pay interest on the security no amount will generally have been assessed to the individual investor. Consequently, there is neither an amount which has been brought to account as assessable income by the individual taxpayer in terms of paragraph 63 (1) (a) nor a loss or outgoing incurred in gaining assessable income in terms of subsection 51 (1). Therefore, no deduction is allowable in respect of the nonreceipt of interest income.</PARA>
<PARA> The return of an individual's capital outlay for an investment can never be assessed as income. As no amount will be brought to account as income the operation of paragraph 63 (1) (a) is quite irrelevant. As to subsection 51 (1), failure by the debtor institution to ultimately repay an individual's capital investment would amount to a loss but such a loss is one of capital and not deductible. However, that loss will be one which may be offset against any capital gains derived by the taxpayer in terms of the capital gains and losses provisions of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, where an organisation carrying on a business of money lending invests in a fixed interest security in the ordinary course of its business, the failure of the debtor institution to repay both the amount invested and the interest on the security will give rise to both amounts being deductible under paragraph 63 (1) (b). That is how the full Federal Court determined the provision applied in F.C. of T. v. National Commercial Banking Corporation of Australia Ltd in 1983. The same amounts are also likely to be deductible under subsection 51 (1).</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, any investment by an accruals taxpayer (other than a money lender) in a fixed interest security will usually be on capital account. Any failure by the debtor institution to pay interest on the security will be deductible under paragraph 63 (1) (a) where the taxpayer has already brought that amount to account. So far as the failure to repay the amount invested is concerned, that amount will be treated in the same way as for individuals and be regarded as a capital loss which may be used to offset capital gains for the purposes of the capital gains and losses provisions of the Act.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The derivation of the estimate consists of two variations. The way each was calculated and the reasons for any increase are:</PARA>
<PARA> - the estimated variation in Running Costs for 1990-91 is calculated on the basis of the increased resources required to provide for the full year cost of those JET Advisers established in 1989-90 and the additional program enhancements (including a further 32 JET Advisers) described on Page 142 of the Social Security Portfolio's 1990-91 Explanatory Notes.</PARA>
<PARA> - The estimated variation in Child Care Expenses to Sole Parents Undergoing Training is calculated as the difference between the 1990-91 Estimate and 1989-90 Outcome. As indicated at page 142 of the Explanatory Notes for the Social Security Portfolio the under-utilisation of the appropriation for this item in 1989-90 was attributed largely to one-off factors. Accordingly, the 1990-91 Estimate ($5.5 million) allowed for a slightly greater expenditure than that originally estimated for 1989-90 ($5 million). The factors expected to generate this increase are set out at page 142 of the Explanatory Notes.</PARA>
<PARA> - It should be noted that the funds provided for Child Care Expenses are appropriated specifically for that purpose. Any unexpended appropriation lapses and reverts to Consolidated Revenue.</PARA>
