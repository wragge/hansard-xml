<TITLE>Austudy: Family Allowance</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain electors of Queensland points out to the Senate that the 1990/91 Federal Budget stipulates that from January next year Family Allowance payments will be subject to an assets test. Family Allowance will be withdrawn if net assets excluding the family home and debt exceed $300,000. Furthermore the parental assets test threshold for Family Allowance Supplement, Austudy and Assistance for Isolated Children has been severely slashed in the 1990/91 Federal Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> Considering the economic crisis facing rural communities in Australia, assets tests of such a nature are not viable because the assets are incapable of generating enough income to sustain families and send children away for schooling.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore ask the Senate to exempt the family farm from the assets test for Austudy, Family Allowance and Family Allowance Supplement.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Air Landing Fee: New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate to support the amendment which has been moved by Senator Short, which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add'', subject to the following request for amendment to the House of Representatives: That the House of Representatives be requested to amend the Bill by reducing the vote for the Department of Administrative Services by $1,028,596, because of the decision to write off as irrecoverable money which the High Court has ruled was unlawfully paid out as postage entitlement for certain members of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>In response to that motion moved by Senator Short last night the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) made a most extraordinary speech, allegedly in defence of the Government and in opposition to this amendment. It was a speech in which he did not seek at any stage to defend the conduct of the Government in relation to this whole sordid affair. </PARA>
<PARA> In so far as the Minister's speech contained any argument at all-I have rarely heard a speech in this chamber so lacking in argument-he seemed to be saying, firstly, that the Opposition should not be moving this amendment because the Australian Democrats are not going to support it. The other argument seemed to be that the Opposition should not be moving a request to change in any way an Appropriation Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal firstly with those two arguments, although they hardly deserve much attention. The first argument that the Opposition is flogging a dead horse, that the whole issue is presumably a dead duck and that the Opposition should simply not be proceeding with this request because the Democrats will not support it, is a most incredible argument for this Government, or any government, to put forward. It comes particularly surprisingly from a member of the present Government, members of which have poured scorn on the views of the Democrats, in many cases quite justifiably, on innumerable occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also surprising that the Government should say that the Opposition should not proceed with the amendment because the Democrats are not going to support it when, in fact, time and again the Government has voted against proposals of the Democrats. A lot of those proposals have been passed only because of the support of the Opposition. So the argument that the Opposition should not be proceeding because the Democrats are not supporting us is totally absurd and does not deserve any further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider for a moment the claim that the Minister uses-it seems to be his only argument-that this is a dead horse, to use a phrase of Senator Powell's. This was her immediate of-the-cuff reaction when she first heard of the Opposition's moves in this direction a couple of weeks ago. It was obviously a reaction she made without having given the matter any further thought. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that, having had the opportunity of giving it further thought and listening to the arguments here today, Senator Powell will recall her stance and that of her Australian Democrats colleagues only a few months ago in this chamber on Senator Parer's amendment to the Parliamentary Entitlements Bill 1990 to reduce the figure for postage proposed by the Government from $30,000 to $9,000, as was allowed by the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Only a few months ago Senator Powell supported very firmly and effectively in that debate the principle that the Opposition has maintained throughout. She in fact was supported by some other of her colleagues, including Senator Lees. I hope that Senator Lees will be consistent in her attitude in this debate. Senator Powell was also supported by Senator Jenkins who, of course, is no longer in the chamber. Other Democrats did not support that view. Nevertheless, there were sufficient Democrats, along with Senator Vallentine and Senator Harradine, who supported the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Our position was supported by the Senate. The Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990 has now restored the position of the Remuneration Tribunal in determining this postage figure at the traditional amount of about $9,000. So this matter is by no means a dead horse because it was a very live one only a few months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened since is that the Government has totally ignored not only the decision of the High Court of Australia but also of the Parliament. The position is that the Government has now decided not to take any further action to recover the $1m that was wrongfully spent. One can call it illegal or unlawful. Senator Bolkus preferred the words `without authority'. He admitted that it was done without authority. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was done ultra vires. There are all sorts of words that one could use. But the fact of the matter is that this money was paid out when it should not have been and the Government has now decided to do nothing about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even if the legal opinion which was received from the Solicitor-General is correct-and there is certainly a lot of debate about that; I do not want to go into the debate on that subject here because it will be the subject of litigation-it only emphasises further the mess the Government got into by its own actions. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to refer to the suggestion that this issue is a dead horse. A few days after the Opposition announced its position, the Sydney Morning Herald in an editorial of 9 November, which has been referred to by my colleague Senator Short, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It's about time, too, that the Federal Government acknowledged it has mishandled the issue. Instead of ensuring that repayments are never made, it should be encouraging those of its MPs who spent their allowances to pay the money back. There is an issue of political integrity involved here. How can the Federal Government expect people to respond to its calls for restraint in spending when it allows its MPs to spend money to which they had no legal right?</PARA>
<PARA>They were the views of a responsible leading newspaper in Australia a few days after this move by the Opposition was described by Senator Powell as a dead horse. The fact is that it is very much alive and running. It is no wonder that the polls show that the Government now has all time record low support. This morning's news indicates that it has only 32 per cent support of the people in this country. No wonder that is the position that the Government is in when it behaves the way it has in this case from the beginning right up until now. It apparently continues to refuse to do the right thing in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> One other very weak argument was used by Senator Bolkus; that is, that the Opposition has no business to be putting forward a request to an appropriation Bill. No Opposition in this country has ever denied itself the right or the power, which it has in the Constitution, and always has had, to make requests on money Bills or to oppose money Bills. The Senate has done so on countless occasions over the years. It is not simply a question of 1975, it is a procedure which is frequently adopted in this chamber. The Australian Democrats have frequently moved amendments to money Bills; they have frequently amended them. They have sought to deny the Government revenue time and time again. There is nothing sacrosanct whatever in our Constitution about a money Bill; in fact, the Government is about to make a request to one of its own money Bills in the Budget process that is going on now. </PARA>
<PARA> A Bill has come into this chamber which imposes an assets test on family allowances of $300,000. That is what the Government's own money Bill, Budget Bill, says. Senator Richardson has just announced that that will be changed from $300,000 to $500,000. How will it be changed? It will be changed in this chamber at the request of the Government itself. So what is sacrosanct about a money Bill? The Government will change its own Budget quite shortly to reduce taxation levels on which the Budget was formulated. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an absolutely ridiculous argument to suggest that the Opposition is somehow out of order in making a request for a very modest change in a Budget of $90 billion, or thereabouts. The Opposition is making a very modest request that it be reduced by $1m. The fact is that the Government has lost $1m, unlawfully, ultra vires, without authority and illegally, by its mishandling, which is a rather gentle way of putting it. The Government thought that it was a very clever rort to help its supporters in the House of Representatives in a forthcoming election, which looked a very difficult one indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> There is simply no substance whatever in the arguments which the Minister put forward in opposition to the amendment that has been moved by Senator Short. Senator Short has submitted very major arguments as to the principles on which the Opposition has moved this motion.  The fact is that at all times there has been a breach by the Government of a fundamental provision of the Constitution. There has to be a legal appropriation from Consolidated Revenue. Section 83 of the Constitution reads:</PARA>
<PARA>No money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under appropriation made by law. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government in this affair sought, at all times, to avoid coming to Parliament to get that authority. It said that it had the power to do it by Executive act. Goodness only knows how on earth it had that power, but it said that it had it. The High Court said clearly that it did not have it. When the Government was ultimately forced to come to Parliament because of the High Court decision, this chamber, including Senator Powell and Senator Lees, supported the denial of that outrageous postage allowance for members of the House of Representatives. When the Government finally asked, the Parliament denied it the right. The High Court said clearly that it had to go to the Parliament; it went, and it failed. For those reasons alone the Government should be suffering a reduction in its Budget to pay for the losses that it has incurred by its own decision-not by anybody else, not by any individual, but by a decision of the Government. The Government, from the beginning to the end, has to carry the responsibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very hard to know where to start. For eight years this Opposition has refused, on the vast majority of occasions, to join with the Australian Democrats to improve Government legislation, particularly money Bills concerning issues like delaying pension payments to the most needy in our community; imposing prescription fees on pensioners, again; imposing charges on tertiary students; limiting access to the young homeless allowance; and refusing to take sales tax off recycled goods-paper in the first instance and, most recently, plastic goods-and equipment for the disabled. The list goes on and on of where the Democrats have sought Opposition support to amend money Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over that same period of time we have been coming into this chamber, week after week, for the appropriations debate-which is about Supply Bills-listening to endless hours of discussion, debate and inquisition, which is really destined to change nothing as the commitment of the Australian Democrats not to block Supply is firm and has been restated year after year. That debate has done nothing other than service the egos of a few people on the Opposition benches. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we come in here today and hear someone of Senator Durack's eminence again confuse money Bills and Supply Bills. In all of that time, out in the community and up in the gallery, the Opposition has chosen to confuse money Bills and Supply Bills. It always went out to the community and said, `We couldn't support that Democrat amendment to help pensioners, students or children because that would have put Supply at risk, and we don't want to block Supply'. </PARA>
<PARA> Suddenly, a couple of weeks ago the Opposition found itself a dead horse to flog and actually said to the media, `On this one, we will go as far as to block Supply'. This is an Appropriation Bill, not a money Bill. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator POWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend to everybody here, particularly new senators and certainly the members of the press gallery, an excellent paper by the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, which makes quite clear what the difference is between Appropriation Bills and money Bills. I am also happy to provide from my office a list of occasions on which the Opposition has wimped out on money Bills. There are plenty of letters to the editors in Opposition senators' local papers excusing their inexcusable behaviour on that matter, and confusing Supply and money Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition now comes in here with all sorts of accusations about the previous positions of me and some of my colleagues. Let me make quite clear what happened when the issue of the stamps first came up here in this chamber. For a start, I can tell Senator Durack that I did vote but I did not contribute to the debate. At that time we were debating an Opposition amendment which, in essence, was to support the reinstatement of the Remuneration Tribunal's position on the matter. I did support the Opposition on that and I still believe that those of us who went that way did the right thing. It was a matter on which Democrat members were split-it happens from time to time that there is a clash of principles or a clash of views-nevertheless, I stand by that vote. That is not the same as the vote I am being asked to support on this occasion. That reinstatement has been made, and it stands. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, the situation has reverted to a political exercise. The decision not to recover the money is now out of the hands of the Parliament and in the hands of the Government, unless of course we are prepared to block Supply to make a political point. The Democrats have always said that we will not block Supply and we will certainly not block Supply to make this particular political point. I suggest to Opposition senators that if they feel vehemently about the so-called loss of $1m or so-I make one aside on that point as it appears that if the Government were to recover the money it would probably recover it from its own Australia Post into its own Department of Administrative Services; so I do not know what kind of recovery that is-a real recovery of at least a quarter of that money could be had if the former Leader of the National Party of Australia, Charles Blunt, were to pay back what is, at the very least, dubious stamp expenditure on his behalf. At least a quarter of that money from a former member of the Opposition could return to the coffers of the Government, if that is really the concern of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that that is not the concern of the Opposition. We know that this is a political exercise of flogging a dead horse by an Opposition which hardly seems to know which way is up on the question of money Bills and Supply Bills. When it was announced that the Opposition was going to make this move on the Appropriation Bills, Opposition spokespeople also stated that this matter would be pursued, if necessary, to the point of blocking Supply. This is an Appropriation Bill, and after eight years of pursuing amendment after amendment to money Bills the Democrats are quite clear on the difference between money Bills and Supply Bills. In this case we are not in any way prepared to give the Opposition what it wants-an excuse to block Supply. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the procedure. There is no confusion about the situation. The amendment put forward by Senator Short is in fact within Standing Orders and within the power of the Senate. That being the case, one needs to look at the merits of that question. I would be very hesitant indeed to support this motion if it did not go to the responsibility of parliamentarians as a whole to uphold the integrity of members of parliament and their standing. I am not talking about our own personal standing but our integrity to be able to pursue properly the interests of the people who have elected us. In saying that, I do not point the bone at any of the Government members in the other place who expended this money prior to the last election, because they did so on the clear understanding that the money they had received for postal allowances was provided properly by the Government. Therefore, it is the Government that is found to have been wanting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last night, in the Committee of the Whole, the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, agreed with Senator Short that the action of the Government has been found to be ultra vires. Therefore, the Parliament itself must be involved in that situation. The amount of money is not great-it is a little over $1m-but a principle is involved, that principle being whether this Parliament, in particular the Senate, is able to exercise its functions of audit and control over a government expending money when it is not authorised so to do. That is the principle with which we are dealing at this moment. That is why I am prepared-because of the extraordinary situation and the fact that the Government has expended money in an unauthorised fashion-to support the motion that has been moved by Senator Short. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that it is a dead horse. I know a bit about the racing industry and I wonder who has nobbled the horse. I wonder whether the people of Australia, having put their money on the horse-which in this case has the integrity of parliamentarians and the integrity of Parliament riding on it-do not deserve to have a steward's inquiry. There has been a steward's inquiry-namely, through the High Court. That steward's inquiry has found that the Government acted in an unauthorised manner. We should really be warning the Government off this particular course. If we do not take this action now, who is to say that this Government or any future government will not do precisely the same thing and use precisely the same excuses and get away with the unauthorised expenditure of public moneys. I believe Senator Short's amendment will put a check-a rein, if you like-on such illegitimate government actions in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Short's amendment and also to commend Senator Harradine on what I thought was a most eloquent exposition of the situation as it stands. I think it is proper to go back and recount briefly the whole sordid story and explain the reason that we are debating this matter today. The Remuneration Tribunal had the role of determining the postage allowance for members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. It made a determination at the end of 1988 that that figure would be $9,000. In July 1989 the then Minister for Administrative Services decided that the executive Government would determine the postage allowance. In December 1989 it increased the allowance for the House of Representatives from $9,000 to $30,000 per member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A press release was put out-I see Senator Kernot nodding; she will remember this well-that said that this was done to enable members of the House of Representatives to write to their electors once a year. It was phoney; everyone knew it was phoney. It was done to enable members of the House of Representatives-particularly those in the Australian Labor Party-to use that postage allowance simply for the direct mail campaign which was set up for them. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to note that the amount was not increased for senators. Of course, the reason for that, as everyone was aware, was that it disadvantaged the Labor Party to go along that route. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Powell" NAMEID="O14">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Powell is quite right. It was a great disadvantage to the Australian Democrats and their former leader who was standing for a seat in the House of Representatives. The whole thing was shoddy from the word go. Even the press release put out by the then Minister was dishonest-and we all knew it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Hon. Neil Brown took this matter to the High Court of Australia, which found five to nil that the actions of the Government were illegal. The then Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia, Mr Peacock, advised his members not to overspend because the High Court had found it was illegal, but the then Minister for Administrative Services put out a press release saying, `Spend, spend, spend; it is okay'. Following the election the Government brought in the Parliamentary Entitlements Bill, the legislation to which Senator Powell referred. The purpose of that legislation was to validate retrospectively something the High Court had found to be invalid. To their credit, Senator Powell, Senator Lees, Senator Harradine and Senator Vallentine supported the Opposition in throwing out the legislation, which would have retrospectively validated something found to be illegal. </PARA>
<PARA> In the debate that went on I asked a series of questions of the Minister. The major thrust of those questions was: why are you introducing this legislation when we all know it is to validate retrospectively something that is illegal? We did not get a satisfactory answer, except that the Minister said that on legal advice-which the Government would not produce-the Government could not collect the money, so it might as well validate it. A few other red herrings were thrown in, such as saying that some other entitlements for members of the House of Representatives might also be at risk because of the decision by the High Court. However, the Government failed, thanks to the support given by some of the Democrats and some of the independents. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell has just said that she supported the Opposition's amendment to that Bill to enable the postage question to go back to the Remuneration Tribunal, where it should have remained in the first place. With respect to Senator Powell, that was not the background to the Opposition's amendment. The basis of that amendment was not to support something which retrospectively validated an act found to be illegal by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> Having lost that, the Government then decided that it would waive the debt. Had the Government made some attempt to collect that debt, we might not be engaging in this debate today. No attempt was made whatsoever, and I know no-one in society who would say that we could not collect the debt without having at least attempted to collect it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Estimates Committee I asked a question of one of the officers of the Department of Administrative Services. I will repeat that question:</PARA>
<PARA>How can it be concluded by anyone that the amounts were irrecoverable if the people who had spent it had never been asked to pay the money voluntarily?</PARA>
<PARA>That question was never answered. Subsequently I applied under the freedom of information legislation for the legal advice which the Government claimed it had from sources within the Attorney-General's Department but which it refused to provide to members of the Senate. I might say that it was an interesting exercise. All I sought was a copy of the legal advice which has now subsequently been tabled in the other place. I received everything but the legal advice. In fact, I received a complete list of overspending by all members and a couple of senators, which I believe is not very accurate, but that does not matter. Although I did not ask for it, I received a list of spending by every member of the House of Representatives. That list is publicly available and I would be happy to table it. </PARA>

No-one was asked to repay the debt, hence the request by Senator Short.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a further comment on freedom of information: it can be a costly exercise. Having been through it, I wonder whether I would do it again because I received a lot of information, but not the information I sought. The excuse given to me for not providing that legal information was a little thing called `legal professional privilege'. I am not sure to this day why the information was not provided, because it was subsequently tabled in another place. That will be the subject of further litigation, as the Minister mentioned, so I will not go into that. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Executive Government made a decision for purely political purposes. It put its snout in the public trough to run its election campaign. The Government called it something else, but found it could not retrospectively validate it because of support given in this chamber by the others I have mentioned, as well as by members of the coalition. The Government has now waived the debt without making any attempt to collect it. I think that is most reprehensible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very simple thing. I believe the Australian Democrats are trying to muddy the waters by saying that they will not support us because we had not supported them previously on many issues on which they would have liked our support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats have picked up some of the more emotional stuff, saying that we would not support them on, for example, some of the pensioner issues, et cetera. The Democrats say that we claimed at that time that we would deny the Government its Budget amounts. But the situation has never been one of illegal money being denied to the Government. There has never been a decision by the High Court of Australia saying that the Government should not be doing that to pensioners, nor has there been a High Court decision saying that the Government should not be putting through its Budget. However, on this occasion the High Court is saying that the Government should not be using that money. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been sickened to death by the Democrats telling us that they are here not to take government but to keep the bastards honest. We have a High Court decision that this Government was wrong and spent money it should not have spent. What do the Democrats say? They say the High Court's decision is not worth following up. Because we follow up its decision, we are-what is it, Senator Powell?-flogging a dead horse. The Democrats are not concerned about upholding a unanimous decision of the High Court. It is inexplicable to me that the Democrats could possibly deny the High Court's decision. I do not understand them. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand the Government's attitude, because it has been hauled before the High Court by us on several occasions. The Government may remember the High Court decision on the referendum. We dragged the Government before the High Court and won. We have won several times. The Government is not acting any differently. It has always had to be dragged before the High Court before it will be honest about things. This is just another example of the way in which the Government behaves. If the Government can get away with it, it sure will. It is the Democrats who are enabling the Government to get away with it again on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to go over the history of the case; that has already been gone over by Senator Short, Senator Durack and Senator Parer. It is sufficient to say that if the Democrats do not support our amendment, which would make the Government abide by a High Court decision and return the money it has illegally spent-not only illegally in our view; illegally in the High Court's view-then I hope they will never raise their heads again in the electorate. If they are ever hypocritical enough piously to say that they have morals, we will remind the people that they refused to support a High Court decision because they claimed that that was only flogging a dead horse. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Harradine's comment regarding Senator Powell nobbling the horse is very accurate. Effectively, that is exactly what she has done as the new Leader of the Democrats. She has denied the power of the High Court in this country. The Australian people must understand that this small group of senators are not the people they have ever claimed to be because of this particular decision. When the crunch comes, they will support the Labor Party on any illegal deal because they are prepared to allow the Government to override the High Court. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment moved by Senator Short. There is no doubt that the Government acted illegally and unconstitutionally. It was interesting to hear Senator Powell's comments. We heard three or four times about her strong principles on the issue of Supply. It would have been nice to hear her in some way condemn what the Government has done. We listened very carefully for that, but she coined that great phrase which the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, has picked up that the whole issue is a dead horse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me state it clearly: it was an illegal and unconstitutional expenditure of over $1m by the Australian Labor Party to help fund its election campaign. That is what the issue is about. When this expenditure has been declared unconstitutional and illegal, I think the taxpayers would expect the Government to take appropriate steps to collect that money. We have heard time and time again that the Government proposes to write off this debt and that no request will be made to Labor Party members of parliament to repay the money which they have received illegally and unconstitutionally. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Bolkus spoke about this matter, he made a big issue out of this move. He held a big press conference about the whole matter and he said that this was a dreadful act. We thought Senator Bolkus would come in here and give us some decent arguments. This is a big issue; it is an important issue of principle. We waited in vain, as Senator Durack said, for Senator Bolkus to put forward his arguments. What did Senator Bolkus say? He said two things. First of all, he picked up that wonderful phrase from Senator Powell about dead horses. The second thing he said was that we were out of touch. </PARA>
<PARA> Those were two really powerful arguments of great principle by the Minister. He probably used the phrase `flogging a dead horse' five or six times, maybe more-I have not seen the Hansard. It was as though it had to be said that standing up for a principle and standing up for propriety in public administration was a dead horse. We all know that principle and propriety on the part of this Labor Government and Labor Inc. are dead horses. I say to people who are listening to the broadcast of the proceedings that Senator Bolkus is smiling; he thinks it is a great joke that taxpayers' funds have been used illegally and unconstitutionally by the Labor Party for its election purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me carry forward the metaphor about dead horses. The Minister's colleagues in Western Australia, WA Inc., Burke and Dowding, have gone to the political knackery, but the smell from the dead horse continues to linger over the Labor administration in Western Australia and Victoria. Thanks to people like Senator Bolkus and his colleagues, the infection has come to Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus said that we were out of touch. What great timing that was; it was fabulous timing. We all rushed out this morning to pick up copies of the Bulletin, just to see how out of touch the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia are with public opinion. Senator Bolkus told us last night that we were out of touch, so we wanted to check whether he had a particular source of information. What did we find out? We found out that the Liberal Party's popularity rating is at a record level-50 per cent. What about the Labor Party, Senator Bolkus? How in touch is Senator Bolkus with the public? I say to Senator Bolkus that 30 per cent of the people think that Labor is doing a great job. </PARA>

I would be happy too, I suppose, in their shoes, because Senator Bolkus has told his colleagues that they do not have to repay $1m. Let me pursue this point a bit further. The Labor Party used to be a party which cared for pensioners and beneficiaries in this country. Indeed, it used to talk about it a lot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many pensioners and people on benefits will be listening today. We know what happens when pensioners and beneficiaries are overpaid by the Government. They are pursued with great vigour. Secretary Volker of the Department of Social Security does not write off their debts; he pursues them through every means available to make sure that this money is repaid. But a Labor Party member of parliament (MP) is treated differently from the rest of the people in this country. When a Labor MP has a debt owing to the Government he or she is not pursued. We have a Minister of extraordinarily low standards, a Minister who says, `We will write off your debt'. That is what he says. So when Senator Richardson has to go out into the community to reclaim all those overpayments that his Department made-I am not attacking him for that; it happens in public administration-it is not surprising if the people out there wonder why they are not treated in the same way as Labor Party MPs who, by and large, to a man and woman, overspent by $20,000. So I suggest to the Committee that it is not only a question--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Patterson has raised again the other issue of double standards, the taxation of Mr Keating, and his famous travel allowances. I thank her for that intervention. So the issue is not only one of legality; it is also an issue of propriety. People want to know-we will be fascinated to hear the Minister explain it very clearly to all those listening to this broadcast-why he will not send a letter to Labor Party MPs asking them to return the $20,000 that they, each and every one of them, illegally spent. It is a simple question wanting a clear response from the Minister. I will repeat it because he probably has not heard it again; he is probably still smiling. Why does he not write to Labor MPs-as Secretary Volker's people in the Department of Social Security write to pensioners and beneficiaries who are overpaid-and ask them to repay the money? Those who repay and those who do not can then be appropriately judged. I ask the Minister when he stands up to respond to these comments to give us his thoughts on why that simple action cannot be taken by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, I strongly support the comments by Senator Short. I strongly support the comments made by Senator Harradine. I am saddened by Senator Powell. The great rallying slogan of the Democrats-of which Senator Walters reminded us-was to `keep the bastards honest'. It was a good slogan and it had a lot of appeal in the electorate. But, like the Labor Party, the Democrats seem to be changing their spots. I regard it as a matter of law, as a matter of the Constitution, and as a matter of propriety. Therefore, I strongly support the views that have been put forward by my colleagues in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to ask the Australian Democrats what happened to their principle of `keeping the bastards honest'. They have the chance to make the Government account for $1m of illegal money and they do not do it. It is a different party from the one that was originally formed by Don Chipp. It was a party that was formed to keep this lot in here honest. What have the Democrats done? They have sided with the Government. They have been bought off again. What did the Government give the Democrats this time-a few more staff, a few trips? They have been bought off again. The Democrats were brought into existence to `keep the bastards honest'. The `bastards' are sitting opposite. They are dishonest; they are using illegal funds. The Democrats have the opportunity to keep them honest, and what do they do? They crawl over with them. They should get up and explain why they crawl over with them. Perhaps they will get a few extra staff or a few extra trips. It is a different party altogether from the one that was originally formed by Mr Don Chipp.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has happened to the Democrats? I suggest that their change in direction is being well noted. We laugh at the Australian Labor Party losing 15 per cent in the public opinion polls, but when we look at the polls we see that the Democrats' support has fallen by over 20 per cent. That is what the public thinks of the Democrats because they have changed their spots from those of the original party. It is a 20 per cent loss on the support that they had. They used to have around 12 per cent at the election; now they are down to 9 per cent. They have lost 3 per cent out of 12 per cent, which is really more than 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The public have at last woken up to the Democrats. They know what they are. They know that they are the fourth wing of the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party is embarrassed about that, and well it might be. I suppose that is why Labor Party support is falling as well. What I want to know is what the Government offered the Democrats to crawl over with it and save it the political embarrassment of having to get its members to pay back all that money. </PARA>
<PARA> It is probably not the money that counts. I guess that many of the Labor Party people who overspent can well afford to pay back the money. So it is not the economic issue that is at stake; it is the political embarrassment that the Democrats are saving their friends on the Government benches-the embarrassment of having to ask their colleagues to pay back that money. I cannot hear what the Democrats are saying, but no doubt they are trying to make some excuse, to tell us why their vote has fallen by over 20 per cent; to tell us why they are crawling back with the Government; to tell us how many extra staff they have been given because they crawl over and do the Government's bidding. </PARA>

I ask them to tell us whether they joined their Party to keep the bastards honest or to side with the Government and be its fourth faction. I ask Senator Kernot, a good Queenslander-and she has been through a State where there have been rorts and rorts and rorts; she knows what it is all about and that people go to gaol for it-why she is going to let this Government off the hook, to let it spend this money illegally. It was not my decision that it has been spent illegally. The High Court of Australia decided five to nil that the expenditure was illegal. I ask Senator Kernot and Senator Spindler why they are going to let those opposite off the hook. Why are they going to let them spend money illegally? Why do they not do what their charter says and keep the bastards honest? That is why they were put here. The voting public now knows that they are the fourth faction, and that is why their votes have fallen by over 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell spoke to us in what I can only say was confused righteousness. What she voted for was principally right the last time we took a vote on this matter. Now, for some reason, it happens to be wrong. What absolute rubbish. There is already public funding for political parties. The Democrats get their money out of the public till, as we all do. It is a decision of government that we be publicly funded. Why do they let the lot opposite spend another $1m of taxpayers' money in publicly funded electioneering? If they want to do that, let them move a motion that we increase the public funding. If that is what they want, they should do it deliberately. They should let the public see what they are on about. They should not do it through the back door by supporting the people opposite in $1m of publicly funded electioneering which we want them to pay back. The Democrats reckon they are going to keep them honest, and what do they do? They crawl over there with them like the political ladies of the night that they probably are. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to thank Senator Harradine for his very sensible explanation of the issues and his very sensible contribution pointing out that this is all about the integrity of Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA> I refer the Australian Democrats and the chamber to a whole series of debates. Let us start off on 2 October 1951 when a gentleman called Dr Evatt, who was Leader of the Opposition at the time, moved that the first item of the appropriations be reduced by one pound. That was the traditional device, the reduction of the appropriations by an amount-and it varied; one pound in this case was a formal protest. Dr Evatt said that by moving this motion he would be compelling a revision of the Budget. He believed that by doing so the Parliament would:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . save the people from the dangers of avoidable recession and depression. The object of the Opposition is to force a revision of the budget insofar as it imposes taxes, levies, and duties. That is essential in the national interest, and that is why I move, on behalf of the Labour party. </PARA>
<PARA> That the first item be reduced by one pound. </PARA>
<PARA>We can say, `Okay, that is just an objective, a gesture which is not meaningful'. The fact is that reduction of the Estimates by an amount is not blocking Supply and never has been. It is phoney and dishonest of anyone, particularly the Labor Party, to pretend so. I am glad to see that it has not run this line of garbage. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, the Democrats do not have a sufficient sense of history. No wonder! They are going to be very fleeting creatures on the face of history. Having no sense of history, they have not bothered to find out that it was not so long ago in this chamber that the following motion was carried. Senator Poyser moved that the House of Representatives be requested to amend the vote by reducing it by $1. It was carried 23 to 22. The walls did not collapse. Supply was not blocked. </PARA>
<PARA> There is such a total volume of nonsense coming out about this blocking of Supply that I am intrigued that media representatives, who should have a sense of history, have been unable to establish the truth, have listened to this garbage and have printed with large print that the Opposition is threatening to block Supply. </PARA>
<PARA> I say that when this request was carried to the House of Representatives there was no dissolution, no double dissolution, no shock, no horror; nothing. The Opposition's motion is simply an extension of that device to cover the recouping of an illegal payment, one found to be illegal by a unanimous decision of the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> By the way, the Labor Party did not keep its moves to reduce the Budget to small amounts like one pound, the equivalent of $2. It in fact raised the ante. Back in 1970, Labor's Senator Bishop moved that the House of Representatives be requested to amend the vote by reducing it by $10. If the Government stays here for much longer, I suppose the current value of $10 could well end up at $1m. But what we have to establish very clearly is that, if the Democrats really look at this issue, they will see it is not an attempt to block Supply whatsoever. Supply proceeds quite clearly and uncomplicatedly, and in fact what is happening is very clear and very simple. It is what has happened in the past, and the Labor Party is making no comment about it because it is what it has done consistently. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats have no understanding of the democratic process, and it is very interesting indeed that the word `honest' has been brought up in connection with the role of the Democrats. I would have thought that there is one very simple proposition, and that is: if you break the law, you are not acting honestly. I would have thought if one were dedicated and committed to the concept of honesty, particularly maintaining honesty in a public institution, one would be committed to the concept of maintaining the law-maintaining the law where, in fact, it is found that a payment was not in keeping with the law. It was not an honest payment, and a failure to recoup it is not honest. A failure to attempt to recoup it is blatantly dishonest. So here we have a situation where the Democrats are refusing to require the Government to seek to recoup it; they are refusing to force it by denying it the cash in this context. The Democrats are refusing to force the Government into honest behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> I am intrigued at some of the interjections that have been made and, if they have not been recorded in Hansard-and maybe they were not because the speaker at the time did not respond to them-I think we should make certain that they are recorded. For example, Senator Powell interjected when one of our speakers-I cannot remember who it was now-was saying that it was the law which was being broken. Her response was, `We put pensioners above the law'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good, I would be overjoyed. If Senator Powell denies that she said they put pensioners above the law, I would be interested to see how she changes the words to make it sound less, if you like, contemptuous of the law and I would be overjoyed then to have an opportunity to respond to her. But she will not accept my invitation to correct me now, and I note how curious her decision is because that would have given me the opportunity to respond to her. In the absence of her response, can I say that if that is her view, if that contemptuous approach to the rule of law is what prompts the Democrats, then I can understand why they are refusing to support Senator Short's motion to bring honesty to this Government and to deny a government and its members the opportunity, illegally, to take advantage of a payment which should never have been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is also worth mentioning that there does seem to be some confusion in the minds of the Democrats about the Opposition's approach to money Bills. I would have thought that they would have heard of the Guilfoyle interpretation, which generally is that a government is entitled to its Budget-particularly a government that has recently been elected. The big question we have to face in this case is this: did the electorate know when it voted for this Government that members of the Government had in fact grossly and disgracefully appropriated to themselves-quite illegally, through a gimmick, a device-$30,000 to promote their election prospects; that the election was in fact won partly on a fraud?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will accept that interjection and ask Senator Schacht to consider seriously whether he wants to enter into that debate, because he must be aware that we all hold many examples. It is a very dangerous game. If the honourable senator wants to play it, I ask him to let us know because I warn him, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that no-one will be the victor in the resulting dispute-and there are people sitting in this chamber who would be very, very embarrassed if that situation developed. I thought Senator Schacht's leadership was far more sensible than he was when it did not raise this matter in this debate, and I caution him to perhaps have a word with his leadership to see why it did not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I was making is that a government is generally entitled to its Budget, and the Opposition sticks strongly to that view. It is also of the view that Supply, as we have heard in the past, is not something that should be blocked in any situation other than total disaster. I might remind the chamber that, when Supply was blocked last time-in a totally different situation anyway-the democratic result was that the people of Australia gave their judgment. I would have thought, just in passing, that even the Democrats would accept the fact that maybe the people of Australia do have a right to express a view at a time of crisis. But maybe the Democrats, like the Labor Party, believe that the people of Australia do not have the capacity or the intellect to make decisions when there is in fact a time of crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> But in that circumstance I think it is quite clear that this Budget, the first Budget after an election, contains in it a major element in terms of principle which was not presented to the people of Australia at the time the Budget was brought down. It was in fact this dishonest payment which helped this Labor Party to win. Even though it used this illegal device, it got something less than 40 per cent of the vote. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the points that I have made about the tradition of reducing the Estimates by specific amounts for specific purposes, in the absence of a coherent Democrat response to that I think it is reasonable for the Senate and the people of Australia to come to conclusions as to the motives of the Democrats in refusing to support the Opposition on this matter, a matter which strikes at the heart of the honesty of the Government and the honesty of its administration and the integrity of its individual members who have so far not offered to return the money. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well saying that the Government has not asked them to. Not one of these people who was on the receiving end of this money has offered to return it-which strikes me as interesting-and this Government has not required its return. It seems to me that, in the face of such a clear High Court decision, this is a matter of grave concern. Of even perhaps graver concern is the fact that the majority in this House is provided by a party, the Australian Democrats, which apparently is incapable of making a decision on a matter of principle relating to honesty. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment moved by Senator Short strikes at the very heart of this Government's dishonesty. One would have thought that $1m of crooked dishonest spending would at least generate something in the Democrats' minds and it does not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Michael Baume has asked for a response on a couple of things. One thing which the Australian Democrats have not said-I think it was first raised by Senator Harradine, although it may have been raised by someone else last night-is that we have not at any stage in this debate challenged the ability of the Opposition to do what it is doing. To attach a request in the way that Senator Michael Baume has outlined has been done before. We have not challenged that at all. All we are saying is that we know what the consequences of supporting such a move will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me just outline what those consequences will be. If we support Senator Short's motion and it is successful-whatever it was about-it will go back to the House of Representatives where the Government has the numbers. The Government will reject the request, send it back to us and so on. So we have Supply stalled and/or blocked, according to the way it is interpreted, in this place. Of course, as Senator McLean has said recently in this debate, the Government will potentially be brought down. But that, of course, would be in the hands of the people. Of course, the Opposition is very keen to bring the Government down now, just in case its Leader, Dr Hewson, who is under pressure in the electorate-I might add, from the Australian Democrats-falls on his face once or twice more. The Opposition wants to get to an election as soon as it can. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition was not losing its votes to the Government, whose initiative this was, and which, under normal circumstances, on its record on Budget Bills, it would be expected to support. The Opposition back- bench was afraid of losing votes to the Democrats so it went into that meeting and rolled its Leader. Fair enough. It was its right to do that in a democratic situation, but it did not look good in the media. It did not look good for such a dry economic rationalist, who usually sides with Mr Keating and Mr Hawke on these issues, to be rolled by a backbench that has been put on the run by the work of my colleagues in the bush: Senator Lees, Senator Bell, Senator Bourne, Senator Kernot and others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition wants an election before its Leader gets rolled many more times and before the honeymoon starts to end. Fair enough. That is its political right. All we are saying is that we do not support the Opposition in this political exercise. We are not saying that we do not support it on the principle of the grubby business of the stamps, to quote my colleague; we are just saying that this is a political exercise in which the Opposition is engaging. When the Opposition announced it publicly, it told the public via the media that it would take it to the point of blocking Supply. We are not prepared to do that. That is the simple fact of the matter and it does not require all of the time that it has taken in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now respond to the second thing that Senator Michael Baume asked about. As to the interjection in which he heard me say, `We put pensioners above that' I do not know how much of that will have been recorded by Hansard because there were a great many interjections being made at the time. Among those was the very issue being canvassed across the chamber-in a quite disorderly way, I will admit, and with the indulgence of the Chair at the time. Included in that crossfire engaged in were references to the political stunt that was going on. It was in that context that I said, `We put pensioners above that'. We put pensioners above the political exercise and we have done so all along. I do not speak just about pensioners; I speak also of the welfare of the people of this community. That is why over the years that those opposite have been in opposition we have attempted to amend Government Bills, Budget Bills and money Bills. We have not attempted to amend Supply Bills. In this instance where the Opposition is exercising its proper right to do that, which we do not deny, we are not going to support it, because we have always gone to the public saying we will not block Supply. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we have put many initiatives before this chamber over the years to amend government legislation. Very few of them have been supported by the Opposition. The consequence has been that the Opposition has voted again and again with the Government. For some reason, Senator Macdonald seems to be implying that we vote with the Government all the time. That is not the case and the record shows it. It is the consequences of Senator Short's motion that we oppose. That is the reason we will not support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to say a few words, largely in relation to remarks that have been made by the Australian Democrats, but also to make one or two other comments about the opinion that the Government has received and which Senator Bolkus seems to take great comfort from. Firstly, I refer to some remarks by Senator Powell and Senator McLean, who seem to be somewhat confused as to what I was supposed to have said. It is not very clear to me exactly what allegation Senator McLean is making, but it is certainly not the case that I have ever said, publicly or privately, that it was the Opposition's intention and purpose in this exercise to bring the Government down or force an election. It was clearly spelt out by me that that was not the Opposition's intention. We were moving a reduction in this expenditure for the purpose of keeping the Government honest-using the phrase that the Democrats rather colourfully use. That was their purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At all times I have made our purpose perfectly clear. I can only assume that was at the press conference, because I never had any discussion with Senator McLean. He was raving on in such an emotional way, it was difficult to understand what he was saying, but I had no discussion with him or with any Democrat about the matter. The only discussions I am aware of were those that took place between the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill) and Senator Powell, to which I was not a party. They are not in discussion here. Senator Powell has not mentioned them, and that is fair enough. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply rise to reject this notion that it has been the Opposition's intention to bring the Government down. The Opposition's intention has been to require the Government to account for the $1m it unlawfully and illegally spent out of last year's Budget and which it does not intend, apparently, to try even to recoup in this Budget. I want to know what the Democrats say should be done about the $1m misappropriated by the Government. The Opposition's position is clear. It is seeking to have the Government account for that, and the only way it can do so is to move that the Government's Budget be reduced by $1m. The fact is that if the Democrats had supported that, which would be consistent with their whole stance on the matter, the Government simply would have acceded to it and would have reduced its Budget by $1m. There would never have been any sort of Supply crisis, or blocking of Supply, or whatever colourful language the Democrats, the Press Gallery or Senator Bolkus want to use. In fact, the phrase `blocking Supply' is one of popular manufacture--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a total red herring, as Senator Short says. What I intended to say when I got up to speak was that the High Court of Australia made it perfectly clear in a judgment that there is no magic about a Supply Act as such. The High Court says that, under modern parliamentary practice, a Supply Act is simply an Appropriation Act. The person it quoted as the authority for this proposition was none other than Mr Justice Evatt, as he then was. Later he became the Leader of the Australian Labor Party. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In truth the modern Supply Acts . . . are not merely Supply Acts but also Appropriation Acts so far as they operate and extend. The constitutional practice is that such Acts are subsequently embodied in one Appropriation Act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The word Supply is one, as I said, of popular manufacture and it is time that honourable senators started using the appropriate constitutional language as to what is in issue here. There is certainly no magic about an Appropriation Bill, as far as the Senate's powers are concerned, and there never has been. There is simply a restriction on whether the Senate can amend certain types of Appropriation Bills. In fact, if the Senate cannot amend them, it can request an amendment and, of course, it can always oppose it. It is a very technical distinction between amending a Bill and requesting an amendment to a Bill. In modern parliamentary practice, it is quite a distinction without a difference. There is a constitutional provision about it, and that is why we do it this way. As far as Appropriation Bills and taxation Bills are concerned, both of which are referred to as money Bills in general terms--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am more interested in what I am saying than in worrying about what the Minister is doing. There is no magic about the Appropriation Bills, as such, because two-thirds of the revenue of a modern government comes from appropriations in countless legislation. I would just like to point out to Senator Powell that the Parliamentary Entitlements Act-Senator Parer's amendment to which Senator Michael Baume and Senator Lees supported-is an Appropriation Act. After all the benefits are set out in the schedule, section 11 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>11. The costs of benefits are to be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Powell supported the amendment to that Bill. She has supported amendments to numerous Appropriation Bills and numerous taxation Bills. It is the height of hypocrisy for the Australian Democrats to come in here and act holier than thou about the fact that this is an Appropriation Bill. They had better go back and study these matters a bit more carefully before they make these sorts of statements in the chamber. As I have already pointed out, the Government will shortly use this procedure to amend a Bill which appropriates money for pensions and social services when it amends its own legislation about the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing magical about this being an Appropriation Bill. Senator Michael Baume mentioned the Guilfoyle principle. The Opposition laid down that general policy approach some years ago. It was expressed by Senator Guilfoyle when she was, I think, shadow Minister for Finance and when she represented the shadow Treasurer in this chamber. She announced that the Opposition would follow generally the principle that the Government should get its Budget every year, except in exceptional circumstances. That has always been the Opposition's reservation. We regard this case as exceptional and that is why we are taking this action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By Senator Durack; he has been very stoutly defending this action. Let me refer to the two honourable senators with the Scottish names-Senator Campbell and Senator Macdonald. The Scots have a reputation for being very concerned about money matters. They have proved their stodginess and their concern about money in the way in which they have addressed this matter. We are dealing with an amount of just over $1m. The Opposition has been at great pains to point out that a High Court decision has been given in this matter and that therefore certain action should automatically follow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Powell has pointed out, but I must reiterate, that more often than not the Opposition has sided with the Government on very important matters involving the expenditure of money in the area of welfare and social justice for Australians. The principle of the rights of the most disadvantaged in our community is very important to us. I would like to highlight just a couple of occasions on which the Opposition has crossed the floor and voted with the Government. Coalition members have sat virtually cheek by jowl with the Government senators-in their laps-in support of matters which involved the expenditure of money to help the most disadvantaged people in this community. </PARA>
<PARA> On several occasions I have sat in this chamber when the Democrats have proposed removing the sales tax on wheelchairs. We have moved on a number of occasions for the removal of sales tax on computers to be used by disadvantaged children for educational purposes. On every single occasion the Opposition has voted against those proposals by the Democrats and has gone across and voted with the Government. Surely the principle that underlies those sorts of decisions to provide modest amounts of money to the most disadvantaged people in the community is more important than simply accepting a High Court decision, no matter how uniform and how technically correct that decision may have been, simply because it is a High Court decision. </PARA>
<PARA> A great deal has been said of a certain former member of the Opposition ranks. The situation is quite clear: over a certain period there was expenditure at a certain rate-expenditure presumably for legitimate electorate purposes for which the postal allowance is made. Suddenly, just before an election, that expenditure accelerated to an enormous level. A figure of $100,000 in one day has been mentioned. We are asked to believe that that expenditure was legitimately incurred for electorate purposes. This same group of senators who belong to that same Party are asking us to vote here on a matter concerning $1m. </PARA>

We are elected to the highest court in this land to make decisions about the expenditure of money for the welfare of the Australian community, and Opposition senators regularly vote with the Government to disadvantage some of the most disadvantaged people in this community because technically that is what they believe and legally they believe it is correct to do that.

That took up half of his speech in a debate about this matter on postage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that there are other members of the coalition still to speak, so I thank my coalition colleagues for their support in the amendment that I have moved on behalf of the Opposition.

<PARA> Before I go on to the couple of comments I want to make, I would just pick up Senator Coulter's last remarks about the question of whether we are trying to force an election. It is a similar sort of point to the one that Senator Powell was making. If I understood her correctly, she said that the Australian Democrats are not supporting this amendment because of its possible consequences, namely, the blocking of Supply. Are the Australian Democrats really serious in saying that if the Government wants its Budget--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Powell" NAMEID="O14">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator Powell</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Its appropriations.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Its appropriations-it is going to refuse to accept a request from the Parliament to reduce its appropriations by $1m in the Department of Administrative Services, the budget for which this year is $445m, the Government's total appropriations being $90,000m? Are the Democrats seriously suggesting that the Government would not accept a request for a reduction of $1m out of a total expense of $90,000m? That just defies comprehension and is quite obviously not the reason why the Democrats are not supporting this motion. They are not supporting the motion because they are in the pockets of the Government, of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition's actions may be seen by some as essentially symbolic because a million dollars, as I have said, is a very small amount of money in the context of the Government's Budget of $90,000m, and it is small even in the context of the appropriations of the Department of Administrative Services of $445m. But to most people a million dollars is a lot of money, particularly in the recessed Australia of today-an Australia that has been recessed as a result of the policies of this Government; a Government that says average Australians must pull in their belts and accept lower living standards while still paying exorbitant levels of taxation to a Government which spends without inhibition, even if that spending is illegal and unconstitutional, as is the case in the present instance. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is also much more than symbolism. What is at stake here, as has been pointed out by several speakers on this side of the chamber, is a basic matter of principle. The Government and the Democrats today have thrown principle out of the window. They have shown their true colours. They have ignored principle. They are paying no regard to the law or to the Constitution by refusing to accept this amendment. They pay no regard to the basic rights of taxpayers who expect this Government, their Government, only to spend their taxpayers' dollars legally. That is what this is about. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government and the Democrats will stand condemned before the electorate for this decision today-condemned by their own actions in failing to support the amendment and by their comments in this debate. This debate and this amendment are about honesty. The Government has acted dishonestly; it has acted illegally. The Committee does not need me, and the Government does not need me, to tell them that. The High Court, by unanimous decision, has said so. Even the Government apparently agrees with the High Court judgment that the decision is illegal. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are discussing matters of basic principle, the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) parades around this chamber like a peacock. Having just read the newspapers and having left the chamber for several minutes, he is not paying one iota of attention to a matter which goes to the very basis of democratic parliamentary government. The failure to accept the coalition amendment will mean, in effect, that this Parliament will be acting in contempt of the High Court. That is what this will mean. Certainly it will be acting against the spirit of the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only is this matter about honesty and legality and observance of the views of the highest court in this land; it is also about integrity, and integrity seems to be a word that this Government and the Democrats have forgotten all about. It is also about propriety and the rights of citizens to expect parliamentary standards which incorporate these qualities, which are essential for the continued functioning of any democratic parliamentary system. </PARA>
<PARA> That, let me say again, is what the coalition's amendment is all about. That is why its acceptance by the Parliament is so important: to demonstrate to an understandably and increasingly cynical electorate that the Parliament still adheres to certain basic standards, including in particular respect for the law and the Constitution of this nation. That is what this amendment is about. It will be a very sad day indeed when, as appears likely, this chamber votes against this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope in speaking to conclude this particular debate. In doing so, I wish to make a couple of points. I think it is fair to say that this has been, in terms of its timing, one of the most irrelevant debates that this chamber has had to go through. It is also fair to say that, for those who might be listening to it, it has become the `flogging the dead horse' debate. I think those terms that were used by Senator Powell in the early stages of this event are quite appropriate to what we are going through now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has been subjected to more than 3 1/2 hours of debate on this issue. If a figure can be put on it, it must have cost the Australian taxpayer about three-quarters of a million dollars for us to go through what is a fruitless exercise-an exercise that the Opposition knew was fruitless from the start. The taxpayer has to ask, `For what purpose?'. This was a political farce from the moment Senator Durack tried to walk out of a press conference. As I said last night, in Inspector Clouseau fashion, he kept on walking into cupboards and doors that would lead nowhere. There was great embarrassment. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a political farce, as has been highlighted here today, from the time of the announcement that the Opposition would try to stop or stall Appropriation Bill (No. 1). Members of the Opposition had not done their homework; they had not contacted the Australian Democrats. It was a political farce from the moment that the Democrats made it very clear that they thought this was flogging a dead horse. This farce exposed the inadequacy of the coalition when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), when confronted with the question from the media, `Aren't you stopping or stalling Supply?', could not give an answer. This farce has exposed the irrelevance of the Opposition and the incompetence and inadequacy of young Dr Hewson. The Opposition is driven, as I said last night, by the same forces-the ghosts of 1975. Members of the Opposition thought it was a great trick at the time but they cannot do it twice and they cannot do it in respect of something such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> In this debate members of the Opposition have exposed their lack of homework, their lack of competence and, as I said last night, their irrelevance. They are fiddling at the fringes. As time goes by during this Government's term of office, those opposite will be more and more exposed as being preoccupied at the fringes but not being able to tackle the big issues confronting Australia. That is what is coming out. Those opposite must think seriously about it. They sat here laughing this time last year and before the 1986 election. But the reality is that when they went to the election last year they had not tackled the big issues; they were not big enough to grapple with them. </PARA>
<PARA> That has been exposed again by their concentration on this issue and their lack of adequacy to confront the issue that they think is the most important one-that is, cutting government expenditure. It is very easy to come in here and make political speeches about issues such as this. Even Senator Walters can do that. But when it comes to cutting back even $30m or $40m-the Opposition has a program to cut back $3 billion-its Leader cannot carry the weight. He has not got the strength, the political fortitude or the adequacy. Members of the Opposition might as well stay with these issues which they think they might be getting something out of-and for a while they were. But it has been a long time since this issue has been an important one out in the electorate. The electorate is concerned about other matters; it is about time those opposite woke up to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another way in which members of the Opposition have exposed their inadequacy is the way they have tackled the legal issues related to this matter. They have come in here and said, `The Government has acted illegally; it is illegal'. They have spread the word around Goebbels-like in the expectation that people might attach something to it. But, as I explained last night, in what was probably a short lesson on justice, the law and the process of courts, it is not uncommon for State or Federal governments in this country to have their legislation, regulations or administrative action ruled ultra vires. That is what has happened here. No-one disputes that. We know that. </PARA>
<PARA> What did the Government do after that? We sought advice from the highest authority available to us, the Solicitor-General, as to whether we could recover. That was not mentioned at all by the Opposition. The advice was that it was very clear that the moneys were irrecoverable either from Australia Post or from individual senators or members. </PARA>
<PARA> If those opposite are to understand the issue at stake, if they are going to be honest enough and comprehensive enough to tackle the issue at stake, they have to accept that point. They have not. They have gone off and used the buzz word `illegality', which is totally inappropriate. They are stuck on that. What the Government will do in this matter, what it has done in this matter and what it will do in other matters before it is seek the same sort of advice and, if we can recover, we will. We have been told we cannot. </PARA>
<PARA> This debate has been irrelevant. To the extent that it has been relevant to anyone, once again it has exposed the fact that the Opposition is in a time warp. We can understand why it is in a time warp. As I said last night, it has a worse batting line-up-both in this chamber and the other-than the English 11. At least the English have a captain, an opening batsman and a good bowler or two. But the mob opposite, the pretenders to government, as they have been for almost all of the last decade, cannot take the heat. As I said last night, they are playing in the nets while the rest of society is playing on the main pitch. To that extent, let me say also that it is not just the Government that recognises the concerns of the electorate at the moment; it is good to see the Democrats also showing a greater degree of competence and intelligence than has been shown by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter has been useful to the extent that it has exposed the Opposition. As I have said, to every other extent it has been a `flogging a dead horse' debate. But let me also say that it has cost the Australian taxpayer probably three-quarters of a million dollars. It has been a fruitless waste of money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the risk of costing $1,000, I still want to make this contribution. At the invitation of Senator Macdonald and possibly Senator Kemp, if I remember correctly, I want to place on record the position of the Australian Democrats. I was not here when the previous vote was taken but I want to place on record that I think the increased postal allowance was a rort. I deplore it. I would have voted with the coalition had I been here at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I am a person who believes in examining the long term consequences of actions and I am persuaded that the long term consequence of supporting this amendment at this time would be to give the opportunity perhaps to trigger a double dissolution. I think this has become an exercise in crude politicking. I am not prepared to be a part of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I really wish the Opposition was providing us with an alternative action that I could support. But the one proposed asks me to take no regard for the long term consequences of my action, and I am not prepared to do that. In his maiden speech Senator Macdonald talked about an alleged-he said it was more than alleged-Democrat-Labor liaison. I watched very carefully and noted that in about the first 25 divisions in this place Senator Macdonald sat with the Australian Labor Party. The Australian public does not hear about these things. There is no Democrat-Labor liaison in this chamber; time and time again there is a Labor-Liberal-National liaison in this chamber, as the Hansard and the record will show. </PARA>

Apart from that, as a good Queenslander, as Senator Macdonald pointed out, I cannot think of any justification for his making an unsubstantiated allegation about this liaison, which the facts absolutely do not bear out. I want to put on record that time and time again in this chamber it is not the Democrats who vote with Labor; it is the Liberal-National coalition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall not detain the Committee long. I wish to address the claims made by Senator Durack, in particular, Senator Short and others that the Opposition parties did not say that they were prepared to take this issue to the point of blocking Supply. I refer the Committee to the Australian of 7 November which said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Durack, said the Opposition would not support the Bill supplying the Government with $24 billion for general services unless it was amended. </PARA>
<PARA>I also refer the Senate to the Canberra Times dated 10 November. In an article entitled `Politics', Tony Wright, a respected journalist, said:</PARA>
<PARA>A few days ago, the Opposition Leader in the Senate, Peter Durack, raised the stakes by declaring that unless the Government sliced the outstanding $1 million from the budget of the Department of Administrative Services, the Coalition would vote against Appropriation Bill No 1. This Supply Bill authorises government spending in several government departments . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that this was based on statements made by Senator Durack, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. If he did not want to be quoted in this way, why did he not challenge the reports that appeared in the media several weeks ago? He had plenty of opportunities to do so. If he was misrepresented or misreported or if he did not want to own up to those statements, why did he not do something at the time? The Opposition's intentions are, therefore, in black and white. In this ludicrous debate the Opposition has raised the spectre of blocking Supply. It has stated that it would block Supply. It is also a matter of record that the Australian Democrats will not lend themselves to such a grubby party political exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to contrast this exercise with the fact that the Opposition voted against my amendments when I tried to remove sales tax from communication aids for disabled people. When I asked members of the Opposition why on earth they would vote against such an amendment, I was told, `We cannot amend a money Bill'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will have another opportunity to go down this track. In just a few days we will be dealing with the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, to which I will be moving amendments to remove the duty from wheelchairs and other aids for disabled people. The Opposition will have another opportunity to do what it is trying to do now-oppose the Government, with the Democrats, on an issue which benefits people rather than indulging in the ludicrous party political exercise that we are debating today which does not benefit the people but costs the taxpayers of this nation dearly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I promised to get some further details on some questions Senator Tambling raised last night. I will provide some information in respect of the air-conditioning at the Tindal Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base. I am advised by the Department that the RAAF brief proposed a combination of natural ventilation, ceiling fans and air-conditioners as a means of ventilating and cooling the new defence homes at Tindal. With external temperatures of up to 45 degrees centigrade common in the Tindal area, reliance on air-conditioning alone would result in unaffordable running and maintenance costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that the brief quite competently envisaged the use of natural ventilation alone in the milder months, ceiling fans and natural ventilation in combination where the occupants preferred not to rely completely on air-conditioning or, when the ambient conditions were slightly more adverse, a combination of ceiling fans and air-conditioners cooling the air to 27 degrees centigrade in the more trying months. </PARA>
<PARA> My Department was involved with the RAAF in the development of the brief. While the brief is novel, it is an extremely practical solution. It most cost effectively provides the appropriate comfort level and gives tenants a choice in matching the type of cooling to their preferences. I am further advised that RAAF and the Defence Housing Authority have a tenant briefing in place to explain the features of the houses' cooling systems. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also advised that the air-conditioning systems were purchased by competitive public tendering. The adopted systems have a very high level of Australian labour content and materials and off-the-shelf components were used wherever possible. The cost of providing Australian-made systems was some $2.7m less than the publicly tendered price for imported systems. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the off-the-shelf components, the controller, has given tenants the capability of directing the air-conditioners to cool to a temperature well below the briefed 27 degrees centigrade. Attempts to lower the temperature inside the house to lower levels-down to 19 degrees centigrade-can lead to consequent labouring of the plant and the creation of condensation problems in the houses if the windows and doors are kept open, as happens in the case of some tenants. </PARA>
<PARA> I am further advised that the situation is being corrected by a relatively simple adjustment which costs about $60,000 across the 379 houses. That cost and the $2.7m saving in using this system, still leaves us far in front. I do not know whether Senator Tambling wants to pursue any of these matters before we go on to the staff and fraud issues at Tindal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the answer given by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) highlights the original design problems that were inherent in the air-conditioning units. It was anticipated that the Royal Australian Air Force tenants would be satisfied with an operating temperature of 27 degrees. Of course, anyone who is familiar with living in a tropical environment knows that that is not an adequate temperature, particularly for sleeping in the evening. If there is a capability for the temperature to be set lower, the control settings will certainly be adjusted to try to reach the more appropriate 20 to 22 degrees for evening sleeping. That, in turn, will produce major problems in the housing. It will continue to do so because the original design was obviously inherently inadequate, incorrect and did not address the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that over the coming years the Defence Housing Authority will have to allocate considerable additional funds to continuing repair and maintenance programs on the air-conditioning. There will need to be a longer term adjustment to the air-conditioning design of many of these homes. I am sure that in future estimates the Defence Housing Authority will be making claims on Australian Construction Services with regard to what is now considered and widely recognised to be a very basic design fault in this housing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is academic for the Minister to argue that the adjustments were made because of savings in the original tender. The problem was primarily caused because of inadequate, incompatible and very unprofessional design by Australian Construction Services. I will certainly be monitoring the matter over the next six months. If I feel that there is a necessity to raise the matter, I will certainly do so at the Estimates next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the next matter-allegations of fraud at Tindal. I am advised that allegations of fraudulent practices by both contractors and Australian Construction Services (ACS) employees have been made over a period of time and have been given, as we all know, quite a deal of publicity and, of course, airing through this Parliament and the Estimates Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am further advised that every allegation has been investigated by either, or a combination of, internal departmental inquiry, the Department of Administrative Services' fraud control unit, the Australian Federal Police or the Northern Territory Police. The upshot is that charges have been laid against one contractor and one former employee. The matter is currently before the courts, as we know. In respect of that, further discussion may be sub judice. I also indicate that investigations are continuing and there is a possibility of further charges against others. This cannot be ruled out. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tambling's questions in this area also related to redeployment and officer grievances in respect of the Tindal base development. I am advised that no staff have been discriminated against in the Northern Territory. There is, as we know, one officer who has a grievance. This officer, who was an architect previously engaged in the Tindal project, pressed a grievance through the various processes available to him. The grievance related to an allegation that a departmental undertaking to transfer him to Darwin on completion of the Tindal project had not been fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA> The officer, as we know, took the matter to the Merit Protection and Review Agency, where his claim was dismissed. He has now initiated another complaint to that same agency. The officer in question was declared excess to requirements on 22 December 1989 and has since been engaged in administrative duties at the ACS Darwin office. Attempts to redeploy the officer both within this Department and elsewhere in the Australian Public Service (APS) in Darwin have so far proved unsuccessful. Under the APS excess staff provisions, the officer may be retained in employment until 22 January 1991, at which time he may be retired. </PARA>

The Minister has accepted that every case has been investigated by the internal departmental inquiry and review process. But he has not mentioned how many officers were involved, how many contractors were under investigation, and how many were counselled or disciplined. I particularly asked these questions last night. It is quite apparent from any reading of the Hansard that all these issues were raised in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA> I also asked questions relating to how many officers involved in these reviews or inquiries had in effect been relocated within the Department and how many had been redeployed or made redundant. I asked for a considerable amount of additional information in that regard. I would seek that additional information, as I did last night. The Minister has not answered my questions in the detail that contemplated. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the issue of redeployment, the Minister referred to one officer who is currently attached to administrative staff in ACS Darwin. Certainly, that is one of the issues. My question was again much broader. It related to the redeployment of other staff between-and I mentioned this last night-the Adelaide office and the Canberra office. I want to know what adjustments and movements have been made in this regard. I feel that the Minister's answer is totally inadequate and has not addressed the issues that I raised last evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of Senator Tambling's first inquiry-and I know that he has been quite sensitive in the way in which he has approached this matter in the past and I ask him to do so in the future-the investigation is still going on. It has been wide ranging. Quite a number of people have been interviewed-public servants, private individuals and private contractors. It would probably best suit the purposes of the investigation if we did not at this stage indicate how many have been interviewed. Of course, at an appropriate time that information can be made available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also take the point in respect of Senator Tambling's second question as to how many officers have been relocated within the Department and how many have been redirected elsewhere to South Australia or wherever. That is a very broad question. I have asked officers to give us the answer. In doing so, we recognise that, for instance, all the project team has been relocated. But the question Senator Tambling asks demands study and firm detail, and I will guarantee that he gets that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the cooperation of the Minister in this regard. Whilst this matter was certainly raised by me on 13 September, I would have hoped that the Minister would now be in a position to give better and fuller answers. However, I will not pursue the point today as I feel that major administrative attention is needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is obvious that there has been considerable mismanagement and maladministration in this regard. The Minister now acknowledges that a number of cases are under review. He has not chosen at this time to comment on the internal disciplines, counselling or adjustments that have been made within the Department. But the fact that he acknowledges that this is going on certainly highlights the degree of the problem. I will certainly pursue that in other places and at other times. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has not yet addressed-and I do not know whether he intends to-the issues I raised with regard to regional offices and the arrangements between the Northern Territory and South Australian offices of Australian Construction Services. In particular, he has not referred to the document I read from last night which was headed Principles for co-operation between Northern Territory and South Australia. That document did not refer to the involvement of the private sector in the Northern Territory in the future operations of Australian Construction Services. I ask the Minister whether he would turn his attention to the information I sought last evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect to the principles of co-operation, I am advised that the paper referred to, as Senator Tambling indicated, is an internal Australian Construction Services memo between ACS regional managers and project services in the Territory and South Australia. It sets out business arrangements to cover the period of transition following the establishment of the Northern Territory projects office and assets services businesses in early 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the underlying considerations-and Senator Tambling alluded to this last night-is to ensure that work is executed as efficiently as possible and that available ACS resources are employed fully. Accordingly, the skilled personnel already employed by ACS will be utilised first where they match the task at hand. Consultants will be employed where in-house skills are not available or where it is clearly more cost effective to the business, and hence the taxpayer, to do so. Similar principles do apply in places other than the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the allocation of work between South Australia and the Northern Territory-another question that Senator Tambling asked last night-I am advised that of the projected fee income of $9.36m for the South Australian ACS projects business, a component of $3m relates to work done in South Australia for the Northern Territory. Work executed by ACS must be managed in the most cost effective way, as I have indicated earlier, if ACS is to achieve the objective of break-even trading, which we all want it to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The current allocation of Northern Territory work to South Australia is in accordance with that approach. It recognises the need to match the correct resources to the job in hand and also the need to match the high cost of maintaining staff in the Territory compared with South Australia, particularly in this transition period. Of course, it recognises the availability of otherwise underutilised staff resources in South Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to assurances given by the Prime Minister that the Australian Labor Party (ALP) Left would be consulted regarding any change in the nature of Australia's commitment in the Gulf. I ask: was the Left consulted on the Government's decision to support the proposed United Nations (UN) Security Council resolution authorising force? Will the function of Australia's naval ships in the Gulf change as a result of the passage of the resolution, presumably in preparation for the offensive function that might have to follow?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have the Prime Minister's exact language, as used both publicly and in the Labor Party Caucus, in front of me. But, as I recall, his commitment was to consult as widely as the circumstances permitted both within the Party and, as I said before, in relation to the Leader of the Opposition, on all of these matters as they related to the deployment of the Australian military assets-the ships. The Prime Minister made no general statement about consulting each step of the way with anybody so far as the successive political issues that arise and general policy issues are concerned; although of course it is the Prime Minister's practice and that of our Party-unlike some others I know-to maintain the closest possible dialogue on these sensitive and difficult issues with as wide a range of people as possible. That said, I am not sure whether there was any specific discussion at the prime ministerial level so far as our position on the UN resolution issue is concerned. If there was, it was not pursuant to any particular obligation in that respect; it would have just been as part of normal discussion processes that go on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to newspaper reports indicating recent political instability in Thailand. What information is available to the Australian Government on the situation in that country? Will developments there affect the prospects for Australian commercial interests in Thailand?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4656" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The domestic political scene in Thailand has been unsettled in recent days with speculation that Prime Minister Chatichai might resign over a dispute with the military. In the event, that speculation proved incorrect and Prime Minister Chatichai did not resign. He did undertake a minor reshuffle of the Cabinet and as a result the tension has receded. At no time was there any overt move by the military to mount a coup. It is noteworthy that there have been important moves in Thailand towards a more participatory political system, with Prime Minister Chatichai being the first elected Prime Minister in Thailand since 1976 and his Cabinet almost entirely composed of elected parliamentarians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The events of the past few days have not affected our significant and expanding bilateral relations with Thailand. Indeed, we have a diverse and constructive relationship now, including expanding commercial relations, close consultations on Cambodia, pursuit of common interests in international trade-the Cairns Group and the conference of Ministers on Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation-a large program in the aid area, and cooperation on narcotics and in the defence arena. Australia has substantial and positive political relations, underlined by a successful exchange of prime ministerial visits last year, as a result of which some very substantial commercial matters are now in the pipeline-not the least of which is the building of the bridge over the Mekong, which is likely to operate as a significant demonstration project in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has assisted Australian exporters in expanding their market in Thailand through negotiations to improve market access through the conclusion of the economic cooperation agreement and other agreements such as the double taxation agreement, and through cooperation in the energy field. So I do expect commercial prospects for Australia and Thailand to remain very positive. In short, we do not anticipate any adverse effects on them from recent, current or likely political developments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, the case came before Deputy President Riordan of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission today and, upon hearing argument from the advocates, he has adjourned the case for hearing I think until 5 December, although it may be a later date in December. He obtained from the union representative in the hearing an undertaking that there would be no industrial disputation between now and then, and for the period of the hearing of the case. He decided he would review the conduct of the parties on a daily basis leading up to the time for which the hearing was scheduled and, if there was any breaking of any undertakings, he would immediately bring the case on and determine it. I think that is the procedure. It seems to me to be a quite proper and judicious exercise of responsibility by the Deputy President in this case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Crane has now asked on two days whether the Australian Government will intervene. I indicated to him the first time he asked, and indeed the second time, that I would review that question. I have obtained my departmental advice on that matter. I point out that the advice offered to me by the Department is independent; it is its advice to me. Its advice is not to intervene. Its advice is that it is not normal in cases of this nature for the Government to intervene. I propose to take that advice and not to intervene.</PARA>
<PARA> I say again to those opposite that the record of this Government in dealing with industrial issues in this economy is vastly superior to the record of the previous Fraser Government. There has been a 62 per cent reduction in the level of industrial disputation in Australia under Hawke compared to the level of disputation under Fraser. It is a vastly superior record. It ill behoves the Liberal Party, with such an atrocious record in industrial relations, to lecture us on how we should conduct our affairs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government very warmly welcomes the signature of the historic CFE agreement at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe summit on 19 November. The CFE agreement is the most ambitious arms control treaty ever achieved and the first conventional arms control treaty since the Second World War to include both the superpowers. It strengthens the new political order in Europe by establishing the upper limits of the military forces of the 22 nations that are covered by the treaty. This codifies the security gains that have been made as a result of the dramatic changes that have taken place in the European political order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The agreement sets limits for each group of parties, that is, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and Eastern countries, to 20,000 tanks, 20,000 artillery pieces, 30,000 armoured combat vehicles, 2,000 attack helicopters and 6,800 combat aircraft each.</PARA>
<PARA> Agreement was reached on the proportion of forces in each alliance that any single country can station in Europe-that is, the so-called self-sufficiency rule. This ensures that no one country covered by the treaty can maintain more than roughly one-third of the limits set in each of those five categories of equipment that I have mentioned. Military equipment in excess of the limits established is to be destroyed. A limited exception allows each side to convert 750 tanks and 3,000 armoured combat vehicles to civilian use.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to on-site monitoring of destruction, the agreement has provision for effective verification, including detailed information exchange, on-site inspection of military facilities and challenge inspections. A joint consultative group has been established so that questions relating to compliance and implementation can be discussed.</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of additional political commitments outside the CFE agreement which have been made. Germany is committed to limit its manpower to 370,000, of which no more than 345,000 will be ground and air forces. Each signatory is committed not to increase its ground and air personnel levels and each group of parties is committed to limit its land based naval aircraft to 430, with no more than 400 in any one country. The parties to the CFE have also agreed to begin follow-on negotiations to the CFE. These talks are expected to cover areas such as personnel, aerial inspections and stabilisation measures.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government strongly supports the efforts of the United States and the Soviet Union to build a more stable global security environment and it hopes that the CFE agreement will provide impetus for further progress in arms control and disarmament.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to Senator McLean, I want to very adamantly reject the notion that the Australian War Memorial is being starved of funds by the Australian Federal Government. Indeed, this financial year, I understand the Government has appropriated some $16m to the memorial. I believe this is a very considerable sum, but well justified in supporting the activities of the Australian War Memorial Council. That funding of $16m includes money to go towards the first stage of the construction of a new exhibition hall. That is an example of the way in which the Federal Government, through its funding, is supporting the extended activities of the War Memorial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No doubt all institutions would like to see more funding, but that is not always possible. It is against that background that the War Memorial Council came to the decision to introduce a charge. I want to repeat and make very clear to the chamber that it was the War Memorial Council that decided on implementing this charge, and not the Government. I believe I am right in recalling that that Council is headed by Dame Beryl Beaurepaire, a woman held in very high regard from all sides of the Australian community and politics. I believe she has come to a very defensible decision in this matter. It would not be open to the Government to try to reverse that decision under the autonomy and independence guaranteed to the War Memorial Council in its Act. I am sure the ex-service community-which Senator McLean professes to be concerned about-would not wish that particular section in the War Memorial Act to be altered in any way.</PARA>
<PARA> It has to be emphasised that the charge for entrance, which the War Memorial Council has determined, applies only to the exhibition halls; it does not relate to those more sacred spaces, if you like, within the War Memorial: the courtyard; the Roll of Honour; and the Hall of Memory. The charge is small, $3 for adults, with a concessional charge of $2 for Australian war veterans and pensioners. Children will be free, in line with the Memorial's main education objectives. Of course, on Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, entry will be free to all visitors.</PARA>
<PARA> When we consider the very small magnitude of those charges I believe we see very readily that Australians and overseas visitors who visit the Memorial will find it a very small payment indeed for the many hours of absolute fascination and almost literal entrancement that one has when one wanders around those exhibitions with no sense of time at all. One can easily spend a day there for $2 or $3, understanding better the history of Australia's service men and women in their various conflicts overseas. I believe that is a very small fee to pay for that very wonderful experience.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that most veterans understand why this was necessary. The extra funding generated will enhance the exhibitions and the collections of the War Memorial and make them available to present and future generations in a way which is not possible now despite the very generous funding of $16m per year. I believe all Australians will support the decision by the War Memorial Council.</PARA>

Certainly, whether or not the Government supports it, it has been applied by the Council which administers the Memorial.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. Is he aware of controversy surrounding the alleged harmful effects of urocanic acid in some cosmetic products? Is there any substance to such concerns, and what is the Government doing about them? Is anything going to be done to allow consumers to be informed about the ingredients in cosmetics and their effects?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As far as the presence of urocanic acid in some cosmetics is concerned-and I have no evidence of which cosmetics might contain this particular ingredient-the Committee on Toxicity of the National Health and Medical Research Council is meeting on 14 and 15 December to consider the particular allegations that have been made surrounding this ingredient. I believe that it would be very prudent to await the decision of that Committee before I take any action. I will look to its advice on that matter in mid-December.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today I have been able to announce that from now on consumers of cosmetic products in Australia will have the benefit of mandatory full ingredient disclosure on the labels of various cosmetic products which they purchase. I believe that this is going to be extremely acceptable to all consumers, not only from the point of view of protecting themselves from skin irritants and allergies which may be occasioned by an unknown ingredient in a particular cosmetic, but also, of course, in that it will enable them to go into the marketplace and compare those products which perhaps have very similar listings of ingredients but are packaged and marketed in different ways. Sometimes it is the mere packaging which leads to an increase in price. From the point of view of both the skin and purse of the purchaser, he or she will be well served by this provision.</PARA>
<PARA> Full ingredient labelling, a notice on the product of the country of origin, a use by date where the product might deteriorate in less than 30 months, the stating of the Australian manufacturer's or importer's address, the batch code number, and a warning if, for example, the product might be an irritant if placed close to the eye-those sorts of informative labels are very much required by Australian consumers out in the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about an industry which sells $30m worth of products every week. I believe that this industry can well afford, and is cooperating in making available, these labels. The Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association of Australia and the Royal College of Dermatologists are both very strongly supporting this initiative. I believe that with that support we will be able to ensure that within 12 months there will be 100 per cent compliance within this mandatory cosmetic full ingredient disclosure. I believe that that is going to be to the great benefit of all consumers in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. The Minister will be aware that the Australian Taxation Office has been seeking since 1985 to tax leasing incentives given to tenants and that this approach was recently upheld in the High Court in the so-called Cooling case. The Tax Office will extract additional tax from individuals and firms, running into some hundreds of millions of dollars going back through the six years. I ask the Minister why the Australian Property Group, when seeking space on behalf of Federal governments, includes in its tender requirements rent-free periods and up-front cash payments, the latter being for office space for the Tax Office. How prevalent has this Government practice been for the last five years? Given that the Commonwealth Government does not pay tax, is this yet another example of the Labor Government's double standards?</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Parer last night in the Committee of the Whole talked about the imperatives of making the trust account operations within the Department of Administrative Services operate on a commercial basis. The Australian Property Group has been competing in the marketplace for rental or owned space. In the marketplace, the provision of rent-free periods and other benefits is very much in practice. The question of taxability thereof accrues and, as he rightly said, in view of the recent court decision, will apply. But the Australian Property Group is operating in the marketplace as another marketplace operator. If it were not doing that, Senator Parer would probably come in here and criticise us for that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. It has been estimated that a lack of sufficient literacy skills in the workplace now costs Australia approximately $3.2 billion a year in the additional time taken to communicate instructions. I ask the Minister: what is the Government doing to address problems of literacy within industry?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4661" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Aulich for his question. He has, through his involvement in committees in this place and elsewhere, shown a great degree of interest in this area. As honourable senators would or should know, the Government has maintained a substantial contribution to implementing the aims of the International Literacy Year. Recently the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, announced a package of about $40m over the next three years to continue the work already begun in 1990. In that package was an additional amount of $4.5m for each of the next three years for adult literacy training through appropriate State authorities. Also as part of the package, we will be maintaining existing funding through vocational education and literacy programs. Nearly $1.3m will be available for adult literacy courses in technical and further education, for instance, next year. A further $1.6m will also be available to non-government adult education providers. The bulk of these funds, it is expected, will be directed to adult literacy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We recognise that there is a problem. There is undeniable evidence that poor communication skills adversely affect productivity in the workplace. The problems emanating from them include inconsistent product quality, excessive wastage of products, failure to meet product quality standards, damage to equipment, injuries and so on. All of these difficulties, singly and collectively, obviously inhibit our capacity to be competitive in world export markets.</PARA>
<PARA> As one measure taken by the Government last month in Melbourne, we held the first literacy in industry conference, bringing together for the first time representatives of industry trainers and managers, both of whom are crucial in improving the level of literacy skills across a wide range of industries. This week in Sydney, Mr Dawkins also opened the second of these national conferences, a conference aiming firstly to improve the relationship between productivity and a literate and numerate work force; secondly, to provide strategies for improving and utilising workers' literacy and numeracy skills; and, thirdly, to analyse the implications of structural efficiency principles and award restructuring in industries where workers do not have adequate literacy and numeracy skills.</PARA>
<PARA> The conference is targeted towards specific industries, including the public sector, metals, electrical, tourism, plastics and retail. The other important part of this particular conference is that participants have been drawn from managers, employers, training personnel, union officials and representatives of industry training councils.</PARA>
<PARA> Together with that, the Government is producing an information kit entitled `Literacy Training: the Key to Long Term Productivity'. It is designed specifically for the corporate sector, providing business people with information about the value of improving literacy training in businesses. Thirdly, literacy and language training can also qualify as eligible expenditure under the training guarantee. We also recognise the importance of transmitting information to employees in plain English. For example, an Australian study based on compensation payouts estimated that the total cost for employment injuries attributed to poor English is between $10m and $30m.</PARA>
<PARA> One aspect of handling this particular problem is to change the forms that emanate both from government and from industry. For instance, over $400,000 a year in staff time was saved in the Victorian Attorney-General's Department after rewriting and redesigning just one summons form. Just to indicate the level of the financial savings that can be made, in Britain the Department of Health and Social Security rewrote its legal forms at a cost of about $30,000 and it then recouped $2m in just one year.

Can the Minister for Administrative Services advise why he has put the brakes on the reform process in the Australian Construction Services (ACS) by instructing his Department to stop any further rationalisation planned in an endeavour to streamline the work force? Is the Minister aware that it is the view of his Department that he is frustrating its efforts to properly commercialise the programs within his Department? From where does he expect the additional cost savings to come in order to offset the cost of retaining people in positions which have been identified as being redundant?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Herron was not here last night for the consideration of Estimates. Had he been here he would have understood that what is happening in the Department of Administrative Services is a progressive moving towards trust accounts and commercialisation of the operations. One cannot do that overnight and in fact the trust account operation to which he refers is one going through a transition period at the moment. In view of that and as part of the transition period, there is a substantial degree of untying which has already been announced by Government-untying meaning that the Australian Construction Services will not have tied government clients as a normal practice. As a consequence of that, it is anticipated that there will be a decrease in workload, at least for an interim period. That has been the experience in some other parts of the Department and we anticipate it will be the same here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also as part of this, the restructuring and commercialisation process is, and should be, going on in cooperation with the relevant trade unions involved. To give an indication of the complexity of the issue facing the Government, and one that we are tackling, there are something like 41 unions with some interest in the Department of Administrative Services. It is not uncommon, both in the public sector and in the private sector, when one is moving towards restructuring an organisation, for there to be redundancies. As a consequence, redundancies have already been planned and announced in the ACS. It may well be that there could be others and that notice has already been given to relevant participants in the consultative process.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not have an indication that it is the view of my Department that I am frustrating this move towards commercialisation. I think that people in the Department, as in responsible parts of government, realise that there are costs involved in redundancies, and also that there are other ways of tackling the problem, whether by attrition or by retraining and redeployment of personnel. In fact, that was an issue that was raised by Senator Tambling both last night and this morning. The Government is facing this transition period to commercialisation in Administrative Services in a way which will take the players a long way. I must place on record the recognition and cooperation that we have had from the diverse range of unions involved, not only in the ACS but also across the board in the Department, in getting us to the final outcome that we desire.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Senate knows, this Government is committed to the principle of social justice for all Australians. In support of that general principle, in 1983 the Government issued a policy paper entitled Reforming the Public Service and committed itself to `equality of employment opportunity that gives all Australian citizens the chance to compete equally on merit for entry into the Australian Public Service'. In the terms of its own employment responsibilities, in 1984 the Government amended the Public Service Act to require agencies to implement equal employment opportunity (EEO) programs for, amongst others, people with physical disabilities and intellectual disabilities. The Government has also recently upgraded the status of the senior position within the Public Service Commission which is responsible for the promotion and continued development and implementation of EEO policies in the Australian Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government announced on 10 August that it had ratified ILO Convention No. 159-that is, the Convention entitled `Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Disabled Workers) 1983'-which provides for the adoption of a new international standard in relation to the employment of people with disabilities. The Convention requires that countries adopt and implement policies on vocational rehabilitation and employment of people with disabilities, and provide guidance, training and placement opportunities for them.</PARA>
<PARA> In pursuit of its social justice policies, the Government announced in the recent Budget a major income support related reform package that seeks to provide people with disabilities with much better opportunity to become active in the work force and the wider community. Building on this initiative, in the Australian Public Service the Public Service Commission has taken the lead to improve the recruitment and retention of people with disabilities in the service through two separate programs: the extension of the intellectual disability access program (IDAP), which is a program for people with intellectual disabilities, who will be considered for appointment on individual merit rather than having to compete in the standard selection process; and the development of a service-wide information strategy promoting the focus on ability. The IDAP extension and the resource material were launched on 23 October by the Minister for Community Services and Health, Mr Brian Howe.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that recent employment statistics for the Australian Public Service show that 7 per cent of Australian Public Service staff are identified as persons with some disability or other.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the first two questions are yes and yes. As the Senate will know, under accord mark 6 the first wage increase for 1990 is to be based on the September quarter consumer price index. Yesterday the ACTU executive meeting in Melbourne adopted the officers' recommendation to accept the Government proposal on the wage-tax trade-off, that is, substituting a tax cut for the September quarter wage increase. Earlier there was a suggestion that the officers of the ACTU might call a special unions conference to further endorse the executive decision. Given the views of its affiliates, the executive was unanimous that that was not necessary. There will now be no special unions conference. Therefore, accord mark 6A, as it has been styled, or 6 1/2 or 6(i)-the new accord-is now official and it has been adopted by both the Government and the ACTU.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the content of the new accord, previously it had been announced that the second wage increase to follow the September quarter was to be a $12 across the board increase to be paid six months after the operative date of the first increase. Today we have agreed with the ACTU to put an actual operative date on when that $12 will be paid. That operative date will be 16 May next year.</PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Commission has announced the calling of a national wage case, which will convene in Melbourne on Monday. It will commence its proceedings with submissions from the ACTU. The Australian Government will appear later next week and we will put our submissions. Given the timetabling of the national wage case, our hope that there would be a national wage case decision before Christmas may now not be realised as logistically it may not be possible for the hearings to be completed in time for a decision to be brought down. But whether it is before Christmas or early in the new year, I believe the point that we are concerned should be held to is that very early in the commencement of calendar 1991 the wages outlook for the whole of that year will be clear, settled and predictable. That will mean that employers can plan their budgets and strategies against a settled background of wages policy and a clear perspective of what outcomes will be over the course of calendar 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday I said that the wage-tax trade-off means that middle and low income earners do slightly better than they would have done had they received their wage increases. I demonstrated that by resorting to examples of $20,000, $25,000 and $30,000. I said yesterday as well that the tax trade-off gives a better quality money improvement for ordinary workers in the sense that it will not impose costs on industry. Thus, it will not have the impact on prices that a wage increase would have. As well, I have said that effectively we now have a 12 months wages pause, from March this year to May next year; that our inflation target of 6 per cent, as set out in the Budget, will be realised, if not undershot; and that Australia's inflation is now of course trending downwards, when inflation levels in all Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development economies are going up. That puts us in a much more beneficial trading position. I have also said that we have revised our aggregate wage outcome for the year--</PARA>

The question is a pretty general one in that it refers to one hotel. I am not so sure if that is not part of a package or whatever. Given the hypothetical nature and the generality of the question, I think it is probably best for me to find out in what context this hotel has in fact been advertised and whether it is part of a general program. As far as I am concerned, there is no wholesale scheme to advertise private sector facilities and services. This may, of course, have been one instance or even part of a specific package, but we will find out the information and let the honourable senator know.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade aware that United States (US) Rear Admiral William Fogarty yesterday pronounced the blockade of Iraq effective and that a US authority on sanctions, Gary Hufbauer of Georgetown University, is reported as saying that he expected sanctions to work, but that it would take a year for that to happen? Does the Government agree that more time should be allowed for sanctions to work, especially as Iraq's industrial output has already fallen by a reported 40 per cent? What information does the Government have about the impact of sanctions on the health of foreign nationals, Kuwaitis and Iraqis, particularly children?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government shares the international consensus that United Nations (UN) sanctions are being effectively implemented against Iraq. I certainly agree with the view that was expressed yesterday by Rear Admiral Fogarty that the multinational naval force operation in which Australia has actively participated has been very effective in enforcing UN sanctions against Iraq. Estimates are that less than 5 per cent of Iraq's pre-invasion oil exports are now getting through, that Iraq's industrial production has fallen by as much as 40 per cent, and that no more than about 10 per cent of usual imports are entering the place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not seen the remarks that are attributed to Mr Hufbauer, but I am aware of a wide diversity of views among commentators about the time frame which might be required to allow sanctions to exert sufficient pressure to persuade the Iraqi leadership that it must withdraw its forces from Kuwait. The sanctions strategy, of course, remains an important element in international efforts to secure a peaceful resolution to the crisis. As we have repeatedly emphasised, a peaceful solution is much the preferred option. Whether a peaceful solution can be achieved through waiting for sanctions to take effect depends not just on the sanctions physically taking some effect but on the Iraqi Government responding to them in a way which recognises the inexorability of hurt and pain and suffering to its own citizens and drawing the logical conclusion from that. We simply cannot make judgments about when it might be prepared to make that kind of judgment. That is why it now appears that the sanctions strategy needs to be reinforced by a further demonstration of the international community's resolve to bring about an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. It is in that context that the Australian Government supports current moves in the UN Security Council to increase pressure on Iraq by authorising all necessary measures-as the resolution has it-to implement relevant UN Security Council resolutions.</PARA>
<PARA> While fine detail about the working of the sanctions is not available, as I have already said, most assessments indicate that they are having a significant effect and that their main impact has been on Iraqi infrastructure and industrial production rather than food or medical supplies. Certain foodstuffs have been rationed to ward off serious shortages and apparently the prices of some products have risen, but otherwise food supplies appear to remain adequate at this stage-including for children and foreign nationals.</PARA>
<PARA> Security Council resolution 666 provides a framework for the provision of food under UN auspices if and when the `humanitarian circumstances' exemption to sanctions is determined by the UN Security Council to exist. That has not yet happened. The Iraqi Government has made some allegations about the adverse impact of sanctions on particular vulnerable groups in Iraq, but we view these as really no more than another dimension of Iraq's current propaganda efforts. Iraq has not allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross, other recognised international humanitarian agencies or the UN Secretary-General's special representative to visit Iraq to assess the situation. One would assume that, if there was any credibility at all in these claims that are being made, such visits would of course be allowed.</PARA>
<PARA> The point that needs to be made is that Iraq's invasion and occupation have of course resulted in very considerable hardship for the Kuwaitis and foreign nationals trapped in Kuwait. That has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the operation of UN sanctions. The Government is also concerned about reports of deteriorating conditions for some of the hostages who are detained at strategic sites. This too has nothing whatever to do with sanctions, but rather is the result of the Iraqi Government's illegal and totally inhumane actions.</PARA>

In light of these alarming statistics, I ask the Minister how he responds to the statement today by the Chairman of the Australian and New Zealand Banking Group, Mr Bridgland, when he said that this last year was probably the harshest economy environment for small and medium sized businesses in Australia since World War II.

If I were sitting in one of the major banks that lent a lot of money to the high-fliers of the 1980s and lost fortunes, I would be a bit concerned about the economic environment in which I found myself. I suppose it is easy to make that a little more acceptable by saying that small and medium size business has had it pretty difficult too. In terms of small size business in this country, any environment policy induced by this Government has been compounded again and again by the behaviour of the banks, as anybody who knows anything about small business in this country knows.

For over 18 months in Question Time in the Senate we have been answering questions about the interest rate environment and making the point that in terms of Government strategy it was a course which we felt we had to adopt and one from which we would not retreat because of the necessity to dampen demand in the Australian economy. I repeat: that has been compounded by the behaviour of the banks. I am surprised at Senator Hill waltzing in here seeking to endear himself to some small business constituency and quoting Mr Bridgland, the Chairman of the Westpac Banking Corporation, in support of his case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final part of the question relates to whether the Government will embark upon policy changes as a result of the figures published today or because Mr Bridgland or somebody else has a view about all this. The answer to that question is no. The Government has made quite clear what its policy position will be. The current economic circumstances which are being endured and which are difficult for business at the present time are in part a result of earlier policy decisions, but there is no policy change that the Government can make at present which will alleviate those problems. There are no magic wands. If honourable senators opposite go into the electorate and pretend that there are, they are kidding themselves as well as others.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a big topic but I will keep it as short as I can. The Uruguay Round of GATT talks is regrettably in a state of considerable confusion just one week before its scheduled conclusion in Brussels next week. There are a great many issues, covering major subjects in the Round, where positions of the major participants appear to be too far apart now to enable a comprehensive conclusion to the negotiations by the end of next week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most significant area of those for Australia and, indeed, for the Round as a whole, where there appears at the moment to be no basis for negotiation is, regrettably, in agriculture. The Cairns Group and the United States have proposed, of course, that support and protection in agriculture be substantially reduced over the next decade. The European Community's response to its commitment substantially to reduce agricultural support and protection has been to offer only minimal reductions in internal support, leaving border protection and export subsidies without any firm commitments to reform. It is for that reason that the EC offer is considered by this Government, by other Cairns Group countries and by the United States to be totally deficient in critical respects.</PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, despite pressure at the highest levels from our own Government and other governments seeking reform in agriculture, the EC has indicated that it has absolutely minimal flexibility in negotiations. Obviously, we hope that the EC will be able to bring to the Brussels meeting next week a greater flexibility and a greater sense of commitment to reform. A failed agricultural negotiation will have significant detrimental effects on the Round as a whole and therefore on the future health of the multilateral trading system.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several days ago, Senator Boswell asked me a question concerning the labelling of country of origin on food products imported into Australia. He referred in particular to the labelling of imported orange juice products. I strongly believe that Australian consumers have the right to know the country of origin of the foodstuffs they purchase. I hope that people certainly have a very good look at the label which must be displayed on all packaged food.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The minimum requirement is that the country of origin label be 1.5 millimetres high. I only wish that those distributing Australian food products would adopt even larger labelling denoting Australian origin to encourage Australians to buy our farm produce. Some do; some do not; more should. I believe that distributors and retailers should be advocating to their suppliers that where a food product is Australian, it should be proudly labelled that way in bold print.</PARA>
<PARA> Whether the minimum should be greater than 1.5 millimetres, which was the question put to me, is a matter of dispute. I will give some comparisons: health warnings on tobacco products are 4 millimetres high; the tar and nicotine content is displayed 1.5 millimetres high; and health warnings on food products are 3 millimetres high. In relation to whether 1.5 millimetres is a suitable minimum, I have recently asked for two things to be done. I have asked the Australian Food Standards Committee to look at the matter and I have asked the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs to liaise with Professor Tony Worsley of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, who is working on the benefits to consumers of food labelling information.</PARA>
<PARA>As to orange juice, which is the second part of Senator Boswell's question, I am very concerned that orange juice concentrate is being imported into Australia and being converted into orange juice by either the addition of water or simple blending with local single strength juice and the resultant product is being labelled as `Made in Australia' or `Product of Australia'. Recently, a South Australian survey showed some products contained only 25 per cent of local orange juice but were being marketed and labelled as `Product of Australia'. I believed this matter was of such concern that I asked the Australian Food Standards Committee, which met in Perth yesterday, to fast track a recommendation to all Australian Ministers to require that orange juice products containing imported ingredients are labelled as such. Yesterday, the Committee recommended that the label `Made in Australia from Imported Ingredients' be attached to such orange juice. I hope Ministers act on that immediately.</PARA>
<PARA> I strongly support the proposition that consumers are entitled to know the truth about the origin of the food and beverages they buy. I have asked the Trade Practices Commission to examine whether some current labelling might mislead or deceive consumers as to the country of origin. Consumers should be able to make an informed choice, and I hope that that choice favours Australian products and therefore farmers and orchardists who are working so hard in this country.</PARA>

<PARA> It has been my attitude to allow latitude in the asking and answering of questions. I also keep an unofficial time limit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I understand that it has been agreed that I can comment on the Government's response by the Leader of the Government to the National Taxation Liaison Group meeting of 4 April 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a result of Senator Button's response and the minute paper which was incorporated into Hansard from the Australian Taxation Office, we have an unparalleled situation whereby the Commissioner of Taxation, Trevor Boucher, has been made the sacrificial lamb for the political indiscretions of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is responsible for the Australian Taxation Office. Unfortunately, we now have one indiscretion compounded upon another with that unfortunate minute being introduced into the Parliament to defend the indefensible. That process has brought the Taxation Office's administration into disrepute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In our Westminster system, the role of a member of the Executive Council, which is indeed a senior position, demands maturity and a respect for the law and an ability to cope with the cut and thrust of parliamentary performance, on the one hand, and an even-handedness in the execution of administrative functions in looking after, in this case, the Australian Taxation Office, on the other hand. However, neither the Commissioner nor the Parliamentary Secretary claims support from the minutes of the National Taxation Liaison Group-and that was not surprising because of the brevity in this area. The many parties had to rely on memory and, to be kind to each of the participants, there were certainly some variations which perhaps could be on the agenda at the next meeting of the National Taxation Liaison Group. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan still has to reply to an incomplete presentation. For example, I ask: Why did he not at the time quote to the Senate the issues which were raised in clause 7 of Mr Boucher's memorandum, in which Mr Boucher said that it seemed that the solution to the substantiation matter could in practice be found by giving some sort of discretionary power to the Commissioner? This was a blatant omission by the Parliamentary Secretary and would have changed the thrust of the whole debate-and the Parliamentary Secretary knew that. </PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of discretions, the one that I provided was a relieving provision, and I remind the Senate that these will always be in taxation law and are not as repressive as the others which we are finding incorporated and included in the foreign income legislation which is yet to come before this Parliament. They are the objectionable provisions; the relieving ones are acceptable. Unfortunately, the Parliamentary Secretary chose not to provide that segregation. He should have known a lot better. However, what was objectionable was the use by the Parliamentary Secretary of a tax liaison meeting to support the thrust of a Government response to a member of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Most people believe that the role of the National Taxation Liaison Group is to provide independent advice and views to the Australian Taxation Office in relation to taxation law and practice, and not to act as an instrument of government against any opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I find perhaps even more incredible the humiliating position in which the Parliamentary Secretary has now placed the Commissioner of Taxation. I refer to the tabling of that minute from Trevor Boucher, the Commissioner of Taxation, in its present form. Some people have described this document as quite astounding; others have said it is a remarkable document. It is quite a self-incriminating piece of paper. I quote from paragraph 9 of the document which was incorporated in the Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA>It was also agreed that because of the nature of the issue, the outcome should be conveyed internally to taxation officers by me, and internally to practitioners and their representatives. </PARA>
<PARA>This means that the Australian Taxation Office is now applying an illegal de facto discrimination whereby there will be an effective picking of winners and losers and no guarantee of equal treatment. It is a shonky arrangement, and it is quite clear that this outcome is not a solution to the problems facing taxpayers, particularly honest taxpayers such as the Evangelist, who are the losers in this type of situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now up to the Government to do the right thing and to speedily amend the law, because what is at risk is the integrity of the tax law, and this-as a result of this action and because of these indiscretions, one upon another-is now very much at stake. I therefore call upon the Minister to dispel the rumour that is widely circulating that the Evangelist case was not an unfortunate one but was carefully selected to dramatise the fact that the Taxation Office was determined to enforce the full rigours of the law, an enforcement that made the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) quite livid. </PARA>
<PARA> To dispel this assertion, I now call upon the Minister to ensure that the Evangelist case be re-examined; to ensure that the tax is not administered in a discriminatory fashion but is even-handed. It is now a matter of urgency for the Government to bring in legislation to clear the practice of the Taxation Office and the Government's administration of taxation law in Australia. Again, the vehicle could be an internal ombudsman reporting regularly to a Senate committee or the establishment of a board of internal review. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot afford to have this no interest approach. Butterworths Pty Ltd, in the weekly circular to its members, was appalled about the Government's attitude to this particular issue. The Opposition is providing the vehicle but the Government is not prepared to take it up. Perhaps the establishment of a board of internal review would also be another part solution, and perhaps this is not far from the mind of Senator McMullan, seeing that he has seen fit to table this internal minute publicly. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that in the past the Government has not been loath to incorporate some of the best ideas from certain private member's Bills in Government legislation. But, in this circumstance, what is so disappointing is the Government's fundamental opposition to the concepts and to the Bill. My simple Bill, the Income Tax Assessment (Substantiation Requirements) Amendment Act 1990, introduced a degree of latitude in allowing deductions under section 51, where the taxpayer had satisfied section 190(b), the onus of proof provisions, but was unable to obtain a deduction because of the tightness or the rigours of the substantiation provision. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the Bill sought to provide a legal basis for the exercise of an appropriate discretion to apply the law with commonsense, and in doing so we would not be placing the Commissioner above the Parliament. In the present situation, with this administrative discretion, there is effectively no appeal. That is an atrocious system of administration of law. We must have a proper appeal mechanism. The Government is going about its business and is encouraging the Taxation Office to apply administrative commonsense from which there is no appeal to a senior authority such as the AAT or a court. That is quite reprehensible in a democracy. Minister Evans, as a lawyer, surely could not support that sort of proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be around that legislative discretion that the Commissioner, in my case, could then have drafted adequate income tax rulings. I ask that the matter be reviewed as a matter of urgency to respect the integrity of the administration and the application of tax law in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This matter causes me some regret, not because of anything that I have done, because I do not resile from anything that I have said, any document that I have tabled or any of the processes with which I have been involved-including the decision not to support Senator Watson's Bill-but rather because I set out in the early days of my role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer on the basis that the Westminster system would work best if I shared with my counterpart, Senator Watson, all the information that I could reasonably make available. I did so on the basis that we ought to have a common information base so we could then debate our different interpretation of the principles. I initiated the process whereby he is supplied with things such as the minutes of the National Taxation Liaison Group and similar bodies.

<PARA> The first time I find it was used was in a scurrilous, outrageous and wrong attempt to accuse me of misleading the Parliament. I have to say that I have been the subject of somewhat more vigorous attacks during my parliamentary career and ones that caused me a bit more concern; not because I do not take being accused of misleading the Parliament seriously. I do. I regard it as gratuitously offensive and so appallingly ill-founded as to be an insult to me and to my intelligence that anyone would think, firstly, that I would do such a thing in such stupid terms, or, secondly, that such an argument could possibly be sustained. But I understand that it is probably motivated by wounded pride. Senator Watson thought he was about to achieve a great reform and he had people queued up around Australia to applaud him. Some of them have already written articles saying what a great reform of the legislation he has made, and now he finds that the legislation is not going to be amended because I and others oppose his proposal-quite correctly. </PARA>
<PARA> What I did in this Parliament in the debate on Senator Watson's Bill was to accurately convey accurate advice. When I say that I accurately conveyed advice, I am not seeking to pass the blame to others. The advice I gave was also accurate. Even if it was not, I do not think I would have misled the Parliament, but it was accurate. I have gone back to check it. The Australian Commissioner of Taxation has confirmed, firstly, that what I communicated was the advice that I had received and, secondly, that advice was accurate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. We are all sick of those spurious points of order, but worse things can happen, I suppose. I will briefly talk about the substance of the Bill, but before I do, let me say that I was astounded to have Senator Watson call on me to ensure that the Commissioner of Taxation changes the way in which he administers the Income Tax Assessment Act with regard to the Evangelist case. I know that he knows, because he has acknowledged it and we have discussed it on several occasions, that the one thing I cannot do is go to the Tax Commissioner and say, `I want you to re-open this matter and review the way you have dealt with it' in terms of changing the way he administers the Act. I can, of course, ask him to review a process, but not a decision or a discretion that he has exercised because, quite properly, he has that arm's length role from the Government, most particularly with regard to the handling of the affairs of any individual taxpayer. That is exactly what we are dealing with in that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is the concern of the Commissioner and the Taxation Liaison Group that led to its expressing the view to the Commissioner that it did not believe that the legislation should be changed, which I conveyed to the chamber and which I shared. I did not come to that view because of their advice-I came to it independently-but it is their view and it is our view, and it is correct. The view was that Senator Watson's proposal was the wrong solution, as I said in the debate then, to a problem he legitimately raised. I am firmly of the view that proper public administration should be based upon discretions being reviewable. I have no argument with Senator Watson about that objective. Obviously, better public administration requires that. However, the nature of the discretion which he sought to put into the legislation caused the Government concern because it was too wide and it would have served to undermine the strictness of the substantiation rules and would therefore have opened up the potential for the very abuses which the strict substantiation rules were brought in to overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that that was not Senator Watson's intention. He would not set out to do that, but I believe that he would have achieved that objective. For that reason, I opposed the legislation and will continue to oppose any such legislation. But I said then, I advised the Minister yesterday and he communicated to the Senate accordingly, and I repeat today, that that does not mean that I believe there is not a need to review the legislation to deal with this question of making discretions reviewable. That is what I said in the debate. It is what I have said to Senator Watson in other circumstances and to Senator Spindler, and I reiterate it to the Senate today. I have also said it to the Australian Taxation Office and to the Treasury. It is a matter which is under way. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not easy to have a reviewable discretion which can operate to overcome some problems without undermining the very rigour of the substantiation provisions; that is the secret of their success. But it is a matter that needs to be addressed; I do not argue that. It is simply that Senator Watson had the wrong solution after having identified the right problem. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no grounds for criticism of any public officers on the grounds that they say that the legislation for which they are responsible has to be administered with commonsense. I had the good or ill fortune to participate in one of those Geoffrey Robertson Hypotheticals recently in which the Commissioner for Police in the Northern Territory very articulately outlined the need for officers to exercise discretion and commonsense in the application of the laws they enforce. I endorse his view entirely and I endorse what the Commissioner has said with regard to that. </PARA>
<PARA> That does not mean that unreviewable discretions are in any way preferable to reviewable ones, and I would not in the slightest contend that, nor would, I am sure, any of those officers to whom I am referring. I intend to continue to try to find a formula which will achieve that part of the objectives which Senator Watson and I, and I know the Australian Democrats, share. I have not yet found it; Senator Watson has not yet found it, but we will continue to try. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I repudiate entirely any accusation that I misled, in the slightest, the Senate. I resent both the accusation and the way it was raised, and I welcome the opportunity, even if 48 hours late, to say so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I enjoyed Senator Watson's oratory, as I am sure we all did. I therefore regret that I cannot follow him in his reasoning, at least not all of the way. Looking at the statement that was tabled from the Taxation Liaison Group, I find only one matter with which I must disagree, and that is the statement in paragraph 8 that the matter could be dealt with by the application of administrative commonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is counter to advice I received from the Australian Taxation Office when I took up the case of a constituent that was similar to the Evangelist case. I was told that although the Taxation Commissioner is aware of the justice of that particular complaint his hands are bound by the legislation and he is not able to give relief in that instance. We would not have had this debate and we would not have had Senator Watson's private member's Bill and my foreshadowed amendment if in fact the Taxation Commissioner or any of his officers could deal with it in an administrative manner. </PARA>
<PARA> So we must return to the need to amend the legislation. While the Australian Democrats supported Senator Watson's private member's Bill, we did so to register the principle and the value of the point he was making, not, I regret to say, the manner in which he went about it. I must agree that the way in which he phrased his private member's Bill really would have opened the floodgates as far as the Taxation Commissioner was concerned. It would give him virtually unfettered discretion to say that he may exercise his discretion provided he is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to allow the deduction. That would mean that any citizen who is aggrieved by a particular statement or adjudication of the Taxation Office would feel he had nothing to lose by writing to the Taxation Commissioner and asking him to exercise his discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason that I foreshadowed an amendment, which I supplied to the Government, that would ensure that the Commissioner can exercise his discretion only provided he is satisfied that the taxpayer has actually incurred an expense; that the expense would, apart from the operation of the subdivision, constitute an allowable deduction under the Act; that the expense would have been allowed if the taxpayer had so complied; and, finally, that the Commissioner considers that the non-compliance by the taxpayer can indeed be rectified simply, and that the Taxation Commissioner can then permit the taxpayer to rectify the non-compliance. Provided that happens, the deduction is then established. I believe that is a reasonable solution to the problems that Senator McMullan is obviously wrestling with. I foreshadow that I will be moving that amendment at a suitable time when an appropriate Bill is before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the Wheat Research Council annual report 1989-90 and, in particular, to the report of the Wheat Research Committee for Queensland. I draw the attention of the Senate to a number of comments made on page 30 of the report.  The Queensland Committee is working on areas that I believe are of great importance; in particular, I refer to the work on protein profiles on wheat deliveries, which is mentioned on page 30 of the report and which I believe will have a significant impact on the management of the wheat crop in Queensland. I know that various areas in western Queensland are having problems getting the necessary protein levels to ensure that the higher grades of wheat are produced, and I believe work in this area is important. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I would like to address the comments made in the opening paragraph on page 30 relating to the expected increased planting of wheat this year. The report says that over recent years Queensland has experienced a reduction in the area planted to wheat, and it says that it expects a substantial increase this year as a result of the depressed prices for beef and wool. Unfortunately, I am forced to take issue with that. I think in some respects this report has become a little dated, as it was presented on 28 September this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to hand a letter that was sent to me by a constituent. This letter was also sent to every Government Minister by a number of wheat growers in the Maranoa area with whom I spoke when I visited Roma recently. A couple of paragraphs in the letter are of importance. One of these paragraphs states:</PARA>
<PARA>Our harvest finished on 2.11.90 and we now have to assess our future. The price we received for grain delivered will not cover the cost of production. Thus it does not appear a practical proposition to attempt to grow wheat again in the short term, or indeed grow any grain crop. Our family group produces 4000-5000 tonnes annually, and present indications would support our leaving all machinery in the shed for 12 months and ceasing production. </PARA>
<PARA>This means that the cost of production is now well above the effective market price-the effective market price having been decreased substantially by the United States export enhancement program. The problem facing wheat growers in the Maranoa area-and I know that it is a problem not just around Roma but all over western Queensland-is whether they are going to plant another crop as it appears that the cost of production will be too high. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter in question isolates a number of areas where the Government can do something to improve the cost of production. It says that the Government is partly responsible due to the artificially high rate of the Australian dollar, which effectively makes the exports more expensive; high interest rates; and high fuel prices, because the harvesting of wheat is very expensive in terms of the use of fuel. </PARA>
<PARA> These particular wheat growers-and I agree with them-believe it is necessary to do everything we possibly can to lower the production cost. That means lowering the fuel price to enable the growers to get their wheat off more cheaply and easily. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by quoting another paragraph from this letter, which I believe is also very important:</PARA>
<PARA>Primary producers are in the main older people, the younger family members have been forced out by short sighted government policies. We urge you to act now to provide some incentives to keep people on the land. The older farmers are fed up with working hard for very little reward, and the young farmers can see no future. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe Australia is a very cost efficient primary producer. Unfortunately, a number of factors are conspiring against Australia at the moment. I urge the Senate, in taking note of this document, also to take note of the concerns of wheat growers in the Maranoa. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>I move this motion because, as I sit here, it occurs to me that on today's paper this is the first of five reports into Aboriginal deaths in custody. It could be fairly said that these reports come before the Senate on a regular basis. Although it has not occurred, I hope that in the future we do not become inured to compassion by the regularity with which these reports come before the Senate. However, I think these may well be the last reports of this kind. I understand the final summing-up by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody is about to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> The various inquiries into Aboriginal deaths in custody have all been crucial to the work of this Parliament. They have raised a lot of issues which are proper for this institution, of which we have the honour to be members, to consider. While Senator Tate is here, I will refer to a couple of them. The first is the way in which we keep citizens of this country whom we consider are proper to be imprisoned in gaols and lockups. It has been said-and I agree-that the way we treat prisoners is a significant indication of the sort of society we are. These reports show that concern should be entertained in respect of the administration of gaols and lockups. When we are faced, as we are on this occasion, with the tragedy of Aboriginal deaths in custody, it is well to remember that not only do Aboriginals die in gaol, but so do people of other ethnic and racial backgrounds. Now is perhaps not the appropriate time to talk about this matter. The proper time to consider the many questions that this inquiry has raised for us will be when the final report comes before the Senate. </PARA>

Before I do, however, I would like to make special mention of the 17 years of dedicated service which Professor R.L. Mathews AO CBE gave to the Commission. Professor Mathews resigned as a member of the Commission on 31 January 1990. I believe it is appropriate that the Senate acknowledges his long and selfless period of service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Grants Commission is a statutory authority operating under the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973. The primary function of the Commission is to recommend to the Government the share of general revenue assistance made available by the Commonwealth which is finally adopted at the Premiers Conference. On page 12 of the report we see reference to a report prepared by the Commission into issues affecting fiscal equalisation into the 1990s. The Commission has been required to make a number of recommendations on matters which it believes to be relevant to a review of the application of the fiscal equalisation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I have long held the view that serious mitigating factors affect the ability of local government authorities to raise revenue and pass on any increases in costs when unweighted population figures are used as a basis for determining shares of the total funds available for financial assistance grants, and that the use of such figures should be totally discontinued. Quite clearly, as the economy continues to deteriorate, services to the Tasmanian local government community will become increasingly dependent upon the level of untied financial assistance grants. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context, it is my view that funds must be distributed between the States and Territories in a manner which reflects the application of fiscal equalisation principles. In a practical sense, fiscal equalisation means that after grants have been made to the local government sector for each State when considered as a whole, local government units in each State are able to provide services comparable to those provided in other States if they make a comparable effort to raise taxes and charges. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, fiscal equalisation, when applied to grant allocation, means that those States and Territories that may suffer disadvantage due to factors such as isolation or a scattered population which is expensive to service are compensated for those special disabilities. It is reasonably easy to see that where the opposite applies and funds are limited to an arbitrary formula, for example, population or the number of properties, on the one hand it will be these States and Territories which are unintentionally assisted, and on the other hand, those with contrary figures which are penalised unintentionally. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several factors which affect the capacity of Tasmanian local government authorities to raise revenue. One glaring example is the low value of real estate properties when compared with mainland States. In Tasmania, for example, $150,000 will purchase a very nice home. In many mainland areas, such an amount will purchase little more than a shack. Rating base is another area in which Tasmanian councils struggle to match their mainland counterparts. Several mainland capital city areas contain a higher population than that of Tasmania as a whole. Major regional centres and dense commercial and industrial developments do not occur in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> These very brief features demonstrate the extra effort required to generate a matching amount of rating income. Further to this can be added the fact that, when compared with the mainland, wages and salaries are lower for comparable positions in Tasmania. The necessary result of a lower household income means the imposition of a maximum on the amount of rates that can realistically be levied. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to remember that, whilst there is a limit to how much Tasmanian councils can raise by way of revenue, there are also costs which must be borne which are far and above those costs facing councils on the mainland. I refer, of course, to freight imposts across Bass Strait and other matters, such as petrol costs-we have increased petrol taxes because of freight-and our limited rail system. Most of our internal freight goes by road, with higher fuel costs reflected in higher cartage costs. The point remains that fiscal equalisation remains the only method of equitable grants distribution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to say a few words about the Commonwealth Grants Commission annual report 1990, the fifty-seventh report. First, I would like to congratulate the Commission on the work it has done in a very busy year. It has produced some excellent reports. There is a general misconception in the community about the Commonwealth Grants Commission. It is often perceived simply as being involved in recommending on the distribution of payments to the States. Of course, the Commission is also involved with the Territories, with local government, and with the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The work program for the Commission has involved grappling with new and complex problems, some of which Senator Calvert has mentioned and which the Commission has dealt with very commendably under a fair amount of pressure. I am glad to see the acknowledgment by the commissioners on page 20 of the report of the professionalism and dedication of the staff in a period in which the pressures have been unusually heavy. The quality and quantity of the Commission's reports have been very good, particularly given the relatively scarce resources on which the Commission runs; it has a relatively small staff and a limited budget. The quality of its work is very good value for money. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent progress has been made on making the Commission's documentation more user friendly, perhaps dejargonised. It is a very welcome development. The Commission's language often in the past has been somewhat arcane. That is changing and it is all to the good. This has been the first year under the chairmanship of the new Chairman of the Grants Commission, Mr C.R. Rye, formerly a very senior officer, Deputy Secretary to the Department of Treasury and holder of several other important posts on behalf of Australia, including Executive Director to the International Monetary Fund. The Commission has been very lucky to obtain Mr Rye's services. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with Senator Calvert, I would like to acknowledge the retirement of Professor Russell Mathews since the last annual report was presented. He retired as a member of the Commission on 31 January after no less than 17 years service. His contribution to the debate and discussion on the range of matters bearing on Commonwealth-State relations was quite outstanding. He was the architect of the basis of the current system used to achieve fiscal equalisation among the States. His contribution has been and will be sorely missed. I hope that the Commonwealth and the Grants Commission, in particular, will be able to retain his services in some sort of capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of the Commission's work has been heightened recently by the increasing emphasis given to Commonwealth-State relations. My own leader, Dr Hewson, on his election to the leadership of the Opposition earlier this year, named Commonwealth-State relations as probably the major issue of the 1990s. As the shadow Minister assisting him in Federal-State relations, I can well understand and increasingly come to recognise the importance, relevance and probably the accuracy of that statement, because the issues concerning Commonwealth-State relations impinge across the whole range of government activity and the lives of most individuals. The way in which we go about that is something that affects us all, not just in the financial sense but in a much wider range. Since then, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has taken up the call for a revision of Commonwealth-State relations. He has programmed a series of Special Premiers Conferences on the matter. The first one has been held. We look forward to important things coming out of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The integrity of the Commission's work is very important. It means that the effective role of the Commission as an independent umpire in recommending the distribution of funding to the States and the Territories must be preserved. I have to note that it is unfortunate-this is not a criticism of the Commission at all-that its work as an independent umpire has been undermined by the Government on recent occasions manipulating the system of grants to suit the Government's own political ends. The abuse of the Advance to the Minister for Finance, to which I have drawn attention on numerous occasions here, and evidence of some payments being made in the form of capital rather than recurrent grants, so as to escape Grants Commission scrutiny, are matters of concern. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate the Australian Honey Board on its annual report and the work it does in trying to maximise the returns to Australian honey producers from the export of honey by generating a greater demand for Australian honey both here and overseas. I note from the report that the total recorded production of honey for the 12 months to the end of June was 22,619 tonnes, with exports totalling 12,637 tonnes. This is slightly down on the figure from the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> The domestic scene in the honey industry is becoming quite exciting. The range of honeys on the Australian market is staggering. Created exclusively from a combination of bees, flowers and sunshine, honey is one of the few truly natural foods remaining. Australia's long hours of sunshine and its great selection of native trees and ground flora have given us a marvellous selection of unique floral honey varieties. </PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of fact, at home on our property in Kingaroy we are growing Kiwi fruit at the present time. We get someone in the area who keeps beehives to bring in bees to pollinate our flowers so that we can be sure to get a good crop of Kiwi fruit, although that does not always eventuate. There may be no rain, a hail storm or something like that. One can never exactly guarantee the crop. Nevertheless, the honey that comes from that Kiwi fruit is beautiful, clear, light and most enjoyable. </PARA>
<PARA> However, because the beekeeping industry is relatively small in size and number, it is often ignored by government. It is not a large industry and it does not have a lot of money. We therefore have to be ever vigilant in keeping an eye on the industry to ensure that the beekeepers stay in business and look after the agricultural crops for which we need them so desperately. A healthy beekeeping industry is absolutely essential but, as the report notes, it is very much tied to circumstances out of its control. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>The cost of market entry in a number of countries is high. World market prices for honey in US dollar terms remained relatively static . . . While we continue to export nearly half our product in bulk, the ultimate return is tied to the world market . . . With only four per cent of the world trade in honey, Australia is in no position to substantially alter world prices . . . While Australian honey has a good reputation on the world market, there is only a limited premium that we can obtain over other origins-and then the exchange rate determines the return . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The report notes on page 8:</PARA>
<PARA>World prices are measured in US dollars and the effect that they have on Australian prices is largely determined by the Australian and US dollar exchange rate. </PARA>
<PARA>With 40 to 50 per cent of Australia's total honey production exported in bulk, world market levels and exchange rates continue to be the major influence on returns to beekeepers. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite maintaining a minimum price structure and a good market intelligence network, the return from the world bulk market is limited to the general level of world trade . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier, it is in Australia's interest to maintain a viable honey industry, and it therefore worries me that the chairman's report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The decline in real incomes of Australian honey producers continues to be of concern. The main influences on price remain the level of the world bulk market for honey in US dollars, the Australian and US exchange rate and demand on the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA>Further in the report, it notes that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . domestic operating costs continue to grow as a result of inflation and high interest charges. </PARA>
<PARA>I can tell honourable senators that, under those circumstances, it is no wonder the chairman reported:</PARA>
<PARA>During the year, it proved difficult to encourage honey packers to actively pursue new export markets for Australian branded and 100 per cent floral varietal honeys. </PARA>
<PARA>It is vital, therefore, under such adverse conditions that we do all that we can to maintain the strength of the industry, whether by watching the effect of economic factors or the importation of not only honey produce but also diseases. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>Right from the outset I say that I am very interested in this matter because, having grown up on the land, I am well aware of the need for conservation. In fact, on my own property I have been involved in some conservation projects in the past. I note from the report that the national soil conservation program received an allocation of $23.184m in the 1989-90 Federal Budget. Whilst I appreciate the Government paying attention to that matter, I believe that soil degradation and the need for soil conservation is probably one of the biggest problems facing this country at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I note in the report-and I am not going to speak about Tasmania today, for a change-a small section on land care in the Northern Territory which says that land care there is in its infancy. It goes on to say that, for example, one of the large areas needing conservation is the Victoria River District Conservation Association. It covers an area of 140,000 square kilometres which is almost twice as big as Tasmania-so, quite frankly, the problems it faces are rather huge. It identifies the main degradation issues as being native pastures and rabbit control. </PARA>
<PARA> I would say I am disappointed that it has not mentioned large feral animals because, along with Senator Bell and others, we visited the Northern Territory last week investigating the effect of feral animals. Just for the information of honourable senators, as they might not realise, there are 200,000 feral horses, 83,000 feral donkeys, 283,000 feral buffalo-not to mention 25,000 wild camels and 20 million rabbits. The overall effect of those animals is that, if you put them all together, you have the equivalent of 858,000 head of cattle. The soil degradation those animals are causing in the Top End has to be seen to be believed. But I must say that I was very encouraged to see that, since a large number of the buffalo has been shot out in Kakadu, the area has rehabilitated itself in a very short time-something like less than 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> So we will be making a report on the feral animal situation in the Top End in the near future, but I think we should take note of the horrific effect that feral animals are having in causing soil degradation in large areas of Australia. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>I table the explanatory memorandum and seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill proposes several amendments to Acts dealing with Defence matters. The more important changes:</PARA>
<PARA>a. amend Defence Force retirement and death benefits legislation to index children's pensions, and to enable surviving spouses to commute part of their pension; and</PARA>
<PARA>b. exempt Commonwealth-owned Defence companies from capital gains tax on assets acquired by the Commonwealth before the imposition of that tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Other amendments remove obsolete provisions requiring the Governor-General's authorisation for certain Defence activities, and make technical drafting amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>I will now deal with the more important amendments. The other changes are explained in the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>RETIREMENT AND DEATH BENEFITS LEGISLATION</PARA>
<PARA>These amendments alter the arrangements for the payment of benefits under existing Defence Force superannuation and death benefits provisions to the spouses, children and orphans of deceased members of the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA>The Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Review Committee recommended that spouses be provided with the option to commute a portion of their pension entitlement (that is, the equivalent of two years of their former spouse's salary for pension purposes at the time of death) to a lump sum. It also recommended that the fixed rate elements of children's and orphans' benefits ($312 and $5000 respectively) be indexed to movements in the consumer price index. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepted these recommendations, and has taken the opportunity to include the necessary amendments in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Commutation for spouses will generally be available from the date of commencement of the legislation. However, there is special provision to ensure that in the unfortunate event of any casualties in the Persian Gulf deployment prior to the commencement of the amendment, a surviving spouse will also be eligible for commutation. </PARA>
<PARA>Indexation of the fixed rate elements of children's and orphans' benefits will commence from the first pension pay day in July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that all of these changes are beneficial and thus in accord with the ``Ironclad Guarantee'' given by the Government at the time the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Review was announced that the benefits for which serving Defence Force personnel were currently contributing would continue to be available to them when they left the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA>CAPITAL GAINS TAX RELIEF FOR DEFENCE COMPANIES</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate will be aware that the Government has taken a number of initiatives to improve efficiency within the Defence portfolio. A key step in achieving greater efficiency has been the commercialisation and corporatisation of Defence production activities, with the establishment of the Commonwealth-owned companies Aerospace Technologies of Australia and Australian Defence Industries. </PARA>
<PARA>These companies are in the process of adapting to direct competition from other Australian and foreign companies, and are expected to operate in the open market with only commercial restrictions and controls on their mode of operation. In this context, it is important that the companies are not placed at a disadvantage in comparison with their competitors. A case in point is taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>The current rules dealing with the application of capital gains tax provide an exemption for assets acquired before imposition of that tax, on 20 September 1985, and also provide roll-over relief from the tax where such assets have been transferred to subsidiaries of companies but the underlying ownership of the assets has not changed. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the underlying ownership of their assets has not changed, this roll-over relief is not at present available to the Defence companies because the Commonwealth is not a taxpayer. Provision is therefore necessary to give these companies the same roll-over relief from capital gains tax as that obtained by subsidiary companies within corporate groups when assets are transferred within the group. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed relief is in respect of assets that were acquired by the Commonwealth before 20 September 1985 and transferred to the companies in connection with their establishment. An associated amendment will ensure that the value of those assets in the calculation of depreciation for taxation purposes is the depreciated value that would have applied had the Commonwealth been a taxpayer claiming normal depreciation. </PARA>
<PARA>FINANCIAL IMPACT</PARA>
<PARA>Indexing the children's (including orphans') pensions for the financial year from 1 July 1990 will cost approximately $92,000. The future cost will depend on the rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>Surviving spouses' right to commute pension could cost up to $1.2 million in the first full year. This will be offset by reduced pension in future years. </PARA>
<PARA>The capital gains tax concession will reduce revenue by $2.2 million this financial year. Future impact would depend on capital sales. This will be offset to some extent by increased revenue stemming from the associated depreciation adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA>The other provisions in the Bill are not expected to have any significant financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> In view of the heavy legislative programme for the remaining sitting weeks and the need to ensure that the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 is considered during this period, the Committee has reviewed its previous recommendation to refer this bill to a Committee after its second reading. The Committee understands it will assist with the programming of the legislation if the bill is referred immediately i.e. before it is read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the committee recommends:</PARA>
<PARA> (3) That the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 be referred to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs before the bill is read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Committee to present its report on the bill by 4 December 1990. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the reservation listed on parliamentarian entitlements and facilities under program 3 of the Department of Administrative Services. There has been a veritable explosion in the number of ministerial staff and consultants since the advent of the Hawke Government. This clearly has major expenditure implications. For example, in 1984-85 payments to ministerial consultants totalled only $360,000. Today the figure is close to $2.3m. What will the figure be next year unless some restraint is shown by the Government in awarding itself new staff?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Expenditure has been lifted not only by the increase in staff numbers and consultant numbers but also by changes to the guidelines which have resulted in substantial increases in salaries and entitlements to ministerial staff. There is, I suggest, a paradox here, because time and again Ministers in this chamber-particularly Senator Cook-have talked about the restraint that is needed in wages and salaries in the wider community. But they seem to have awarded their own staff and senior managers hefty increases-not only in salaries, as I have said, but also in entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that since 1983, when the Hawke Government came to office, the total number of ministerial staff and consultants that have been employed by Ministers has risen by almost 80. By contrast, on the figure supplied to the Estimates Committee, the number of staff available to shadow Ministers has risen by only 11. I am not quite sure what increase there has been for the Australian Democrats. Perhaps the Minister will supply a figure on that. There are some specific matters, therefore, relating to expenditure in this area that I would now like to raise with the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus).</PARA>
<PARA> The first series of questions relates to ministerial staff and their entitlements. Have any additional staff positions been made available to Ministers since the end of September when the last series of figures was supplied to the Opposition? Have any additional staff positions been made available under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act since the end of September?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is worth while reciting a bit of history before leading up to a specific response to Senator Kemp. Salary levels of senior staff members were determined in the mid-1970s. At that stage they were determined by establishing a relativity with senior executive salary levels. The Government felt that there had been quite a number of changes from the mid-1970s to May 1990. Of course, substantial restructuring of Commonwealth administration took place in 1983. Out of that came greater responsibility in terms of inter-relationship between junior and senior ministerial staff officers and the Ministers themselves. There has been an enhanced policy role. There was the new technology which people had to adapt to. Multiskilling also was enhanced during that period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We felt therefore that, because of the lack of substantial addressing of staffing levels from, in some instances, the mid-1970s and, in other instances, the early 1980s, we did need to establish a new structure which provided a career path, as well as anything else, for ministerial staff members. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, we decided upon a remuneration package for ministerial staff, Opposition office-holders' staff and officers of the Parliament staff; and as part of that restructuring, particularly in respect to the senior staff in ministerial and office-holders' and leaders' offices, we established a rate of salary which was linked to the Senior Executive Service (SES) rates applicable in the Public Service. As I mentioned earlier, that is where it started in the mid-1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of that, entitlements which accrue to SES officers will now accrue to ministerial staff and all leaders' staff members. As part of that linking, the ministerial staff allowance, which applies to some senior officers in offices in this place, will no longer apply when performance pay applies. At the same time as that, in the linkage, motor cars are made available to appropriate senior staffers. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect to telephone entitlements, I cannot say what has happened with respect to individual ministerial officers because that is very much the responsibility of individual Ministers and their departments. What I can say is that last week I made a decision to, I think, either triple or quadruple the telephone entitlement of staff of the Leader of the Opposition and other office-holders in this Parliament. That was, as I say, done last week, and those listening will probably be pleased with that decision when they hear it.</PARA>
<PARA> But the important thing to note about all these things is that all these changes, and the linkage as well as the entitlements, were announced in a very comprehensive press statement in May. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the document promised we will have the new rates applicable to senior staff members. I should ask the Committee to note that, although we have made linkage with SES positions for both ministerial and Opposition senior staff-now called senior advisers-the actual pay to which an individual staff member is entitled is assessed within that range and assessed through a process which essentially means that the actual salary is recommended to me by the head of the Department of Industrial Relations. That particular person makes an assessment of the merits of the individual involved and accordingly recommends a specific salary within the salary range which applies to that person's formal position. So senior advisers do have a range in which their salary is assessed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. As part of the restructuring package we also felt that there was a need to give titles to staff which more appropriately suited the positions they had. Though we in this place understood the position of senior secretary to Dr Hewson or Mr Hawke, for instance, to be a senior advisory one, people outside this place probably had no idea that that is what it was. So we felt that the title of senior adviser was more appropriate for the senior staff person in ministerial and office-holders' offices.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister will be aware that considerable concern has been expressed in the community and in this chamber that senior government advisers have been awarded effectively very substantial increases in salaries-salary increases, I guess, which would have made Mr McCarthy of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots jealous. Can the Minister enlighten us or give an assurance to the Australian public, who are labouring under very serious wage restraint, as to whether figures that have been thrown around indicating increases of the order of 30 per cent to senior staff members of government Ministers are, broadly, right or wrong?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no broad or general increase that could be said to apply. In some instances the increases were of the order of 6 or 7 per cent. Others, of course, as part of the restructuring, were much bigger than that. The staff restructuring was addressed in consultation with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and we were quite keen to ensure that what we were doing was within the wage fixation guidelines. The changes to the salary levels and the ranges are consistent with the structural efficiency principle which provides for career paths to be established and the creation of appropriate relativities. The efficiency principle handed down by the Industrial Relations Commission in its national wage case decision of 1989 allows for salary increases by applying the Commission's work value principles. I can give an assurance-and this was confirmed by the ACTU at the time-that the national wage case guidelines were fully recognised by the Government in reaching a decision regarding staff salaries.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is being portrayed here this afternoon is that we have done something on the quiet and that the public was not informed. The press statement of May or June, whenever it was, very clearly sets out the new salary scales. I have said to honourable senators that individual staff members have been assessed individually in accordance with and pursuant to the wage case guidelines and that they have all had to go through a work value assessment. The new rates, as I said, reflect the fact that there had not been any substantial addressing of senior staff positions in particular for the best part of 15 years or so.</PARA></TALK.START>

The salaries now in question were addressed within the same guidelines. </PARA>

We are talking about a substantial restructuring, one that had not taken place for over a decade and one which was in accordance with wage fixation guidelines. It is one which recognises the substantial restructuring in offices, administration of government, roles of the staff involved, and also provided a career path.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addressing a restructuring which at the top level had not taken place for over a decade, if one talks about 20 per cent or thereabouts as an average then if that figure is within the wage fixation guidelines, which this one is agreed to have been, we are talking about the Government still pursuing its wage policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, the information the Minister for Administrative Services is giving is helpful. I am not arguing that the ministerial staff are not talented, hardworking people, but I think the Minister should understand that we are regularly lectured to by him and his colleagues in this chamber, particularly Senator Cook, about managers and directors in this economy who are awarding themselves high salaries, and I have to say in some cases outrageously high salaries. When we are asking the average worker to fit within what have been very onerous and crushing guidelines which have reduced their living standards, it is not unreasonable to ensure that the Government practices what it preaches. That is my concern. There have been clearly-as the Minister has now said-very substantial increases given to ministerial staff which Bill Kelty says are within the guidelines. I would like Mr Kelty to go out and to tell his union members that. The advice that the Minister gave the chamber was particularly helpful, but there is concern.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I respond very briefly to that point. When we are talking about staff, I emphasise the fact that we are talking about both ministerial and opposition staff. I also make the point that nothing I have said today was not said at the time of the release of the press statement in May-June. I also indicate, to get this in its total picture, that since March 1983 the average salary mix of the Opposition's staff has improved substantially, from 60 per cent of average Government staff salaries to 78 per cent. There has been an upgrading of positions there and an enhancement of the levels of advisers available to the Opposition. So let us get this in its full context, but let us also recognise that nothing new has come out of this discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope for the sake of the Minister and Bill Kelty that what the Minister says is correct. As the Minister is aware, there has been considerable concern, as I mentioned, that the Government awarded itself very substantial increases in staffing numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to the issue of consultants. The Minister was kind enough to provide me during the Estimates hearings with a list of consultants and their respective salaries. Ministerial consultants are, of course, one of the major ways in which the Government has been able to increase the staff of Ministers over and above parliamentary staff. Under the Fraser Government-and the Minister referred to the Fraser years-it appears that only three ministerial consultants were employed. I believe, but I am not able to confirm this, that these were in fact part time. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Hawke Government, the numbers of ministerial consultants have increased markedly. From the list the Minister gave me, there were 25 in September, although I noticed in some of the comments made at the Estimates hearings that the figure given was 28. Of these 25 people who were listed by the Minister, it appears that only four are part time, or at least are paid on a daily rate. I would like the Minister to indicate whether all the other positions, for which salaries range from close to $60,000 to over $117,000 a year, are in fact full time positions, or do the guidelines permit these consultants to obtain other work and fees in addition to those being paid by the taxpayer?</PARA>

At this stage we are looking at the position of ministerial staff and targeting that.

<PARA> To maintain it in context, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) recently requested the Government to increase the Opposition's staffing block by 30. Consideration was given to Dr Hewson's justification for this increase and, when we considered it, we felt that only an additional eight positions were needed to maintain the relativity with increases in Government staffing since 1983. Since it took office, this Government has increased the Opposition's staff resources by 53 per cent, from 43 to 66 staff, compared with the staff allocated to the previous Opposition by the then Government. I am informed that in the same period the Government increased its own staff resources by 55 per cent, and that includes ministerial consultants. </PARA>
<PARA> I made the point earlier that not only has the Government increased resources to that level, but also the average salary mix of the Opposition has improved substantially, from 60 per cent of average Government staff salaries to around 78 per cent, which means that the level of staff that can be applied by the Opposition has been upgraded.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It should be recognised that in respect of ministerial staff we are talking about the Government having as a resource highly competent and qualified people, whether they come from the private or the public sector. There are instances of people in ministerial offices being paid much less than they would be paid were they working, for instance, in the Public Service. There are also people in ministerial offices being paid a lot less than they would otherwise be earning were they working in the private sector, whether in business, as lawyers or in other capacities. The restructuring which took place was geared to ensure that we have a high level of competence and experience among staff in ministerial offices. The Government is pretty proud that it is attempting to do that. Good government can only be enhanced by the quality of the staff working in ministerial offices.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Bolkus will remember that he had to correct Senator Cook in his answer, which was fair enough; it was quite legitimate. At the end of Question Time, Senator Cook corrected the answer he gave to me, on Senator Bolkus's instruction. At that time, I said that some of the ministerial staff had received increases of up to 35 per cent. That was said in response to the Prices Surveillance Authority inquiry that Senator Cook had deemed necessary to set up in relation to executive salary increases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I asked Senator Cook whether he was going to include ministerial staff in the Prices Surveillance Authority inquiry, because they had received increases of up to 35 per cent. Senator Cook assured me that he would not. He also assured me that the people who had received that increase worked terribly hard. I would not argue that point for one moment. I think that Senator Cook's staff, particularly, would have to work extremely hard to make the Minister aware of all the answers that we give to him. I am not debating that angle at all. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time, neither Senator Cook nor Senator Bolkus-who, as I said, had to correct Senator Cook's answer to me-questioned that some ministerial staff were granted increases of up to 30 per cent. Today, Senator Bolkus has said that no-one, not even staff of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), received a 30 per cent increase and that the average increase was 20 per cent. Am I correct in assuming that no-one received an increase of 30 per cent or more? Therefore, the average was between the 6 per cent or 7 per cent that Senator Bolkus indicated earlier, and 29 per cent. I would be grateful if Senator Bolkus could answer that.

What the Minister said before in answer to Senator Kemp was that the Government engaged on a program which I thought he said involved restructuring, career paths, and nice in-words like that. I want some clarification on the matter of reclassification. Presumably Mr Kelty when he agreed to these increases agreed not just to increases in salaries within a particular classification. Did he also agree to the reclassifications? It is an old trick, as everyone knows, to increase salaries without increasing salaries-a Clayton's increase that shows a nil percentage but a reclassification. I can see Senator McKiernan smiling about that. The old trade union man over there knows what this is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding as regards the people who have a new classification of media adviser-I understand this would not necessarily be across the board-is that in the main, where we have these media advisers located in various capital cities, the sort of increase they received was $18,000 a year. We talked earlier about new career paths and restructuring. What are these people doing that is any different this year from last year, apart from listening into talk-back programs so they can feed back information indicating that what Senator Walters says might be a little different from what Senator Kemp says-all that very enlightening material-and putting out weekly bulletins on the things the Government has done over the past week, month or whatever?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am intrigued to know just what justification there was for the salary increase. I think I asked the question earlier. I can understand perhaps Mr Kelty saying-because he seems to call the shots for the Government anyway; the Government cannot make a decision without his approval-that there was agreement to a certain percentage increase within a classification. But was his eye also cast over the reclassifications and the new titles?

<PARA> I go back to Senator Parer's question. Yes, Bill Kelty, amongst others from the ACTU, did have consultations with the Government, as is always done. It is a feature of good government on our side, as opposed to confrontationist government on the Opposition side. We discussed these matters in a calm, rational way and we have come up with a solution to a particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Parer said that what was happening in the last 12 months has meant that the salaries of people in the National Media Liaison Service have required restructuring. What I have said is not that anything has happened in the last 12 months that has required restructuring or reclassification of any Opposition or ministerial staff members. Over a period of time-in some instances over fifteen years-there has not been a substantial addressing of the particular salary scales and ranges that apply to these people. I have said that consistently. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Parer asks me about the last 12 months. Fair enough, he can go to the Remuneration Tribunal, as we as members of parliament often do, and say that we need reclassification and we now need our salaries to be adjusted given the fact that no adjustments have been made over a number of years. We do that. The Tribunal does not say, `Well, what has happened to you over the last 12 months, Senator Parer?'. It says, `Yes, we recognise that over a period of time there have been changes-technological changes, a whole range of changes in the media and the demands of those jobs have become quite different'. They are different from what they were when Malcolm Fraser had his Government Information Unit in the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also indicate that there has not been much of a change in National Media Liaison Service staffing levels since those times either.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the Department of Employment, Education and Training has taken an unduly long time to provide answers to many questions on notice. Until the last week or so, answers were still flowing in. Perhaps of more concern is the fact that answers to questions on notice for the May Estimates Committee hearings were still coming in only weeks before the September hearings were due to commence. We understand the often onerous demands which are placed on Government departments and we know that in some cases it is difficult to get the information that we seek, but I have to make this point: it is quite incongruous for a department which places such onerous information demands on participants in the education sector to be so tardy when it comes to supplying information on itself. Some of the Department's answers were inadequate in so far as there was no declaration of the assumptions which were relied upon to answer the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A prime example of this is the information provided for the forward projections of revenue flowing from the higher education contribution scheme, often referred to as HECS. These projections should have contained assumptions about future student numbers, future levels of the HECS charge, future repayment levels and projected levels of total accumulated debt. No information on these assumptions was provided, and I now request this information. What information was provided paints a very disturbing picture about the manner in which the Government has managed and monitored developments in the education sector. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a paucity of information on qualitative indicators for the portfolio. The explanatory notes for the higher education system-subprogram 2.1, which entails the allocation of $2.5 billion in expenditure for 1990-91-contained only one qualitative indicator. This indicator-graduate employment and salary rates-is in itself inadequate as it is more a reflection of labour market conditions. While studies have been undertaken by the University of Wollongong on qualitative indicators, departmental officials were unable to provide information at the hearing as to what they considered to be other qualitative indicators. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the Government's obvious disinterest in qualitative factors, not surprisingly, on several occasions departmental officials were unable to report to the Committee on what impact Government policy had on the sector. They were unable to provide meaningful information on the effect of basic changes to higher education such as, firstly, the 11 to 12 per cent fall in funding per effective full time student unit; secondly, the clawback of $65m from the operating budgets of the pre-1987 universities to the funding of the Australian Research Council; thirdly, the amalgamations process; and, fourthly, the greatly increased departmental demands for information. </PARA>
<PARA> The indicators relied upon by the Government for higher education and assessed by the Committee are clearly inadequate. Indicators to measure the effects of several highly controversial Government policies simply do not exist at all. Indicators to measure quality hardly exist. One indicator that is relied upon has provided deficient information. I have a number of specific questions regarding higher education which I would now like to put to the Minister. What were the assumptions upon which the answer on that--</PARA>

Agreements will be negotiated between the Commonwealth and State systems. States will be paid differentially, with the Commonwealth's contribution being 10 per cent of the agreed cost incurred for award restructuring. In the non-government sector within each State, the Commonwealth will enter into agreements to meet its share of the costs of award restructuring based on the nongovernment award in that State. For non-government systems, the Commonwealth's contribution will be the product of the actual additional cost incurred by systems for movements in approved salary elements and the Commonwealth rate of assistance for that system's funding category. For nonsystemic non-government schools the Commonwealth's contribution will be calculated as follows: weighted average non-government teacher salary increases within the State multiplied by number of teachers in the school multiplied by Commonwealth percentage share for category. This information will be included in the annual non-government school census.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question relates to subprogram 4.5, `Aboriginal employment' under the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET). Perhaps the Minister can give me an indication of whether he would be able to respond to the questions and whether he has the suitable officers present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a detailed answer to a question on notice from myself which has been provided through Estimates Committee D, there was some comprehensive information given with regard to the funding for Aussat Pty Ltd, for the Northern Territory Government, for Imparja television and for the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA). </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to concentrate in particular on the part of the answer that related to the funding for CAAMA. In a three point answer that was provided to the Committee there was an indication that some $2.3m was provided to the CAAMA group in 1989-90 under the `Training for Aboriginals' program as part of a three-year training strategy; then additional funding of $209,000 has been provided this financial year to enable the current trainees to complete their training, and supplementary funding of $320,000 is currently being negotiated to enable further training to be conducted pending finalisation of a review of the CAAMA group's structure and operations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not clear to me how that funding fits. I can accept that the $2.3m fell into the last financial year, but I would like to ascertain whether the only commitment of the Department of Employment, Education and Training under the funding to CAAMA this financial year will be the $209,000 plus the $320,000-that is, some $520,000-or if in fact this Department's commitment to this program will be of a larger amount than the 500,000-odd dollars. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of that information from the Minister, it is probably important that I also place on notice several other queries that are also related to this issue. I have mentioned that I want clarified the extent of funding in the current financial year in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also want to know to what stage the review of the CAAMA group's structure has progressed and what departmental involvement is taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to know to what extent the review also extends more broadly to the review across the whole of Australia for Aboriginal broadcasting generally. I am of the opinion that it would appear the Government has in a very piecemeal way been funding various Aboriginal broadcasting networks, associations and organisations in many parts of Australia from various Government departments. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to receive an assurance from the Minister that there is a form of coordination and a checking with regard to the provision of Aboriginal broadcasting. I have recently visited in the Northern Territory the excellent facility that is being established at the Batchelor College, which is an Aboriginal training college near Darwin, where I have seen programs that are obviously of great benefit to Aboriginal people in northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the CAAMA group which operates from Alice Springs has now been in existence for a number of years and has been receiving from the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET), the former Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the body now known as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) very extensive funding that probably amounts to something of the order of well over $10m, since its inception, for the provision of facilities. I want to know to what extent the reviews are addressing the adequacy and the outcomes of these particular programs. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that further on the Committee will be considering the funding of ATSIC. In that section of the consideration I will again ask similar questions with regard to the funding of CAAMA. I notice under the provisions for ATSIC in 1989-90 that CAAMA received a grant of $562,980 and a capital grant of $40,000. An additional one-off operational grant of $200,000 was paid to CAAMA in May-June 1990 to meet what was called in the ATSIC notes anticipated overexpenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to know what the coordination is between ATSIC and DEET with regard to the provision of facilities to CAAMA. Could the Minister clarify for me what ATSIC has identified for the current financial year for the $638,000 allocation to CAAMA as recurrent funding? I want to know to what extent this is complementary to the funding by DEET and to what extent there has been a proper coordination to ensure that there is not a wastage or a lack of control in this particular area. Certainly from my electorate's point of view there has been concern expressed with regard to the management adequacies of CAAMA and to the benefits that are being provided to the Aboriginal people of central Australia from this very generously funded organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, the issue that I am looking for the departmental officers to advise the Minister on and for the Minister in turn to inform the Committee on relates to the broad review of policies relating to Aboriginal broadcasting throughout Australia, and very specifically with regard to the extent of cooperation between ATSIC and the Department to ensure that the funding to CAAMA is reasonable and can in some way be properly measured. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.45)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to a reservation that I put into the Department of Employment, Education and Training in respect of a Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) directive to potential employees of non-union organisations. This is a very interesting case. As honourable senators would know, there developed in Queensland a method of industrial relations called `voluntary employment agreements'. One company in particular was a small employer-I think it had about 12 or 14 employees-called Mini Movers which developed a voluntary employment agreement which was by no means secretive. All that it did-and I saw the agreement-was amend the payment to casual workers. It was a straight award with an amendment to casual workers. So a casual worker would be paid a minimum of two hours, even though he might work for one hour, instead of four hours. That agreement went right through to the full bench of the industrial court where it received its blessing. The whole basis of voluntary employment agreements-and this is what causes the disturbance within the power structure of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU)-is that an agreement is reached between an employer and his employees without any outside involvement of either employer organisations or the structured trade union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 22 January 1990, a fax was sent to the Commonwealth Employment Service offices throughout Queensland, I believe, which stated that:</PARA>
<PARA>Telephone advice has just been received from central office that the CES should not accept vacancies involving voluntary employment agreements (VEA), nor should job seekers be referred to any such vacancies. </PARA>
<PARA>A formal minute confirming this information will be forwarded to you as soon as confirmation in writing is received from central office (expected in the next day or so.)</PARA>
<PARA>It is signed by Mr DeYoung. A couple of days later, a letter was sent to all employment office managers and zone managers for information. It referred to the Job Bank Message, as it is called, of 22 January which confirmed that. It was again signed by Mr DeYoung `for the Manager, Network Coordination Unit'. </PARA>
<PARA> In Estimates I asked these questions-and I will summarise them: first, was a directive issued to State CES officers? Secondly, what would be the legislative basis for that directive? Thirdly, would it be considered discriminatory, bearing in mind that a minority of employers in the private sector in fact have union labour? Fourthly, would it not reduce the job opportunities for young people who wish to get a job within those organisations?</PARA>
<PARA> I subsequently received a response-well after the closing date of the Estimates report. It is fascinating that the response was that the directive was issued by the Department at the request of the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin). So here we have the Minister coming in, presumably at the request of the ACTU-the club-and saying, `For goodness sake, do not let us, do not let the CES operation, offer jobs to people if they have a voluntary employment agreement'. The instance to which I refer is a legitimate one from an industrial relations point of view. It received the blessing of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> When I asked what the legislative basis was, the answer was that, the directive having been issued by the Minister, under administrative arrangements orders Ministers are given responsibility for the administration of their portfolios. I have to say that, in the time I have been here, I have yet to see such a lame excuse for doing something that can be described only as petty in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA> That did not worry Mini Movers one iota. An advertisement in a newspaper could get the company as many people as it wanted-particularly these days with the rise in unemployment which is attributable to the Government's policies. I raise that matter with the Minister because, frankly, I think that what the then Minister for Employment and Education Services did is something that needs to be brought to the attention of the Australian public. It was totally irresponsible and it was an abuse of his power. He should be castigated for having done it. </PARA>
<PARA> I raised the question of whether the directive could be considered to be discriminatory, and the answer I got-I think it is worth repeating-was that it did not discriminate between union and non-union employment but, rather, between employment for which the terms and conditions are available and that for which they are not available. If ever I have heard doublespeak, that is it. That is classic doublespeak. The agreement was not secretive; it was an amendment to an award that had been registered, and yet that particular little company was being discriminated against. The same rule applies to Power Brewing Co. Ltd and it will be interesting to see what happens now. In a subsequent answer it was indicated that, as the legislation has now been abolished in Queensland by the State Government, this was no longer a problem. The fascinating thing is that the same agreements remain in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The question I want to ask is: what was the real reason for this ban and a fax followed by a minute to CES officers, who, I might say, did not appreciate it much as individuals, but who were acting under instructions? What was the basis for sending out a petty minute such as that to say that if companies have a voluntary employment agreement they cannot use the services of the CES-a body which is funded by all taxpayers throughout Australia?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the time of the production of the report of Estimates Committee D there were some 29 outstanding questions that related to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Whilst a number of these questions have probably been answered to the satisfaction of honourable senators in the meantime, I am sure that some of them will require the particular attention of the Committee. I certainly addressed a reservation on a couple of questions and I am sure that others will arise and become outstanding as a result of those 29 listed questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, I would like to address a question similar to that I put to the Minister with regard to the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) and the provision of funding for the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA) in Alice Springs. In question on notice No. 90/48, provided to me by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, I notice that ATSIC identified $638,000 in its 1990-91 budget for allocation to CAAMA as recurrent funding. Comment was made with regard to the funds made available in the last financial year, which totalled over $800,000. I am keen to establish what cooperation exists between ATSIC and the Department of Employment, Education and Training with regard to the coordination of funds coming from the two areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In the earlier discussion I established that at least $500,000 was being provided this financial year from DEET funds in addition to the $600,000 now being provided by ATSIC. The DEET answer in detail suggested that a review of the structure and operation of the CAAMA group was currently under way. I am keen to establish to what extent this is consistent with a review of Aboriginal broadcasting policies nationally, not just in regard to the provision of services to CAAMA. What proposals does ATSIC currently have to coordinate any review of national Aboriginal broadcasting policies? Is the funding of some $500,000 from DEET and $600,000 from ATSIC in effect the limit, or ceiling, on funds for CAAMA this financial year, or are other programs being run by ATSIC, DEET or any other government authority providing funds to CAAMA in central Australia?</PARA>

This is a matter that still greatly concerns me because I believe the subsequent answer that has been provided to me may also still be providing incorrect and insufficient information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter relates to a libel and defamation claim against the Chairman of the Northern Land Council, Mr Galarrwuy Yunupingu, by an anthropologist in the Northern Territory, Mr Arthur Palmer. The alleged incident apparently took place in an interview with an Australian Associated Press journalist based in Darwin on 25 July 1990 in which Mr Yunupingu made a number of accusations against Mr Palmer. Mr Yunupingu made comments such as, `Palmer has a chip on his shoulder' and that Mr Palmer had been fired by the Northern Land Council. When asked why Mr Palmer was fired, Mr Yunupingu replied that there was a lot of talk that `Palmer ran away with film and camera equipment'. Mr Yunupingu was asked what action had been taken and the reply given was that `Palmer was charged and at the time he left and that is why he was fired'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Yunupingu was asked what Mr Palmer was charged with and the answer was that, `Palmer was keeping photos of land claims which we tried to get back'. When asked whether action proceeded, Mr Yunupingu gave the answer that it proceeded to a court case in 1983. Of course, it was subsequently proved that every one of those assertions by Mr Yunupingu was totally false and, in fact, maliciously so. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Palmer is a highly respected anthropologist in the Northern Territory who was an employee of the Northern Land Council for five years. At the time of his resignation, he received a request from the then director of the Northern Land Council, Mr Wesley Lanhupuy, that he not resign and reconsider his status. All of the equipment that he is accused of taking, or whatever, was his own property. So it is not surprising whatsoever that Mr Palmer has instituted proceedings against Mr Yunupingu. Mr Yunupingu replied to Mr Palmer on Northern Land Council letterhead dated 1 August 1990, and I read that letter:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Arthur Palmer</PARA>
<PARA>Yugal Mangi Community Council</PARA>
<PARA>Ngukurr, NT</PARA>
<PARA>Attention Mr Arthur Palmer</PARA>
<PARA>I apologise for the remarks I made about you to AAP journalist, Warwick Stanley, on 25 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>I withdraw those comments and recognise them to be incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA>Galarrwuy Yunupingu AM</PARA>
<PARA>This letter is on Northern Land Council letterhead. It is obvious from the officials that have discussed the matter with Mr Palmer's solicitors, that staff and solicitors of the Northern Land Council have acted for Mr Yunupingu in this matter. The answers given to me on this matter imply that, to the knowledge of the Northern Land Council, the comments are not the subject of any libel or defamation action and, secondly, that there has been no claim made against the Northern Land Council in relation to this matter. In view of the fact that staff of the Northern Land Council have been involved in this particular matter, I am concerned that the answers given to my original question, which sought to know what legal costs, including internal appropriations, had been incurred by the Northern Land Council in respect of the libel and defamation matters, made no response whatsoever with regard to this particular incident. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer to my original question gave amounts of money relating to two other defamation actions, in 1982 and 1989. I noticed that the 1989 one was in respect of an obvious claim by the director of the Northern Land Council, Mr John Ah Kit. It is a matter of concern. What I am seeking to establish is whether or not the Government may have to stand behind the Northern Land Council for any financial obligation in this particular matter or whether any particular matters, given the involvement of Northern Land Council staff, solicitors and Mr Yunupingu, in his capacity as chairman, will require any form of financial assistance from the Northern Land Council, the Government, or from mining royalties that should more properly be going to the Aboriginal beneficiaries, for which they are intended, in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a most serious matter. It obviously has implications. I am concerned that the answers given to me were not provided in good faith; they were not providing the truthful answers to the question, and there is in some way an attempt to camouflage this entire issue. The Northern Land Council has been notified officially, and has been requested to even settle the matter out of court, and I find it very insulting that the answers have been provided by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission in the manner in which they have. </PARA>

I am keen to ascertain whether that $3.6m is in addition to the budgeted expenditure for this financial year, which was set out in a schedule detailing totals of some $2.1m for office accommodation and almost $2.7m for staff accommodation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have finished with the questions that I have with regard to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). However, on behalf of Senator Patterson, I pursue some matters that were also listed as an outstanding question in the report of the Estimates Committee relating to issues arising from questions raised about the Barwon Aboriginal Community in New South Wales. At the time of the Estimates Hearings there were also reservations in respect of the auditor's reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Senate well knows, Barwon Aboriginal Community is situated at Walgett, New South Wales, and we certainly had a lot of discussion in this place in 1988 arising from a number of projects in that particular region and with this particular organisation. In the stamped audit, signed by Shahid Khan of Mary Street, Gympie in Queensland, it is stated that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . he has not performed a full system review and evaluation of internal control-</PARA>
<PARA>and that-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . he has not inspected the register of directors, managers, secretaries and members although he is advised that this register exists. </PARA>
<PARA>As we know and certainly established here in 1988, Barwon was one of the organisations that the former Aboriginal Development Commission and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs had had continuing management problems with. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask a series of questions in this regard on behalf of Senator Patterson. Are either of these reservations by the auditor of continuing concern to ATSIC? If ATSIC was presented with such an audit, would it consider it reasonable and responsible to question why a full systems review has not taken place?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that in respect of a systems review and evaluation of internal control, the answer is yes. If there are indications from other sources or from the auditor's financial statement that there are possible systems weaknesses or mismanagement occurring, it is preferable of course to have both matters fully addressed in every report but, given the locality, the availability of auditors' reports and cost, this cannot always occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the sighting of the register of directors, et cetera, I am further advised that this would not be considered a major issue as it is a requirement of the Companies Act-not the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC)-grant rules. ATSIC is concerned to ensure that the organisation is incorporated and that it will continue to be so while receiving ATSIC funding and, as such, ATSIC encourages organisations to comply with all of their incorporation requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the second question, I am advised that the answer is yes, but ATSIC does not believe that a full systems review is required each financial year unless there is evidence of possible mismanagement. Costs of a full systems review, I am advised, can be a prohibitive factor. Does Senator Tambling have another five questions to ask on this?</PARA>

<PARA>QUESTION ON NOTICE</PARA>
<PARA>ATSIC AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Teague asked in regard to an auditors' report of the Barwon Aboriginal Community Ltd dated 15 February 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Would either of these reservations be of concern to ATSIC if they received such an audit?</PARA>
<PARA>2. Would ATSIC think it reasonable and responsible to question why a full systems review had not taken place, if presented such a report?</PARA>
<PARA>3. Is ATSIC aware whether or not it is in fact illegal not to see the register of directors, managers and secretaries when awaiting a registered company?</PARA>
<PARA>4. Does ATSIC find it at all unusual that a community in Walgett uses for their audit, an accountant in Gympie?</PARA>
<PARA>5. If ATSIC was presented with such an audit, could ATSIC have reasonable surety that monies were not being misappropriated?</PARA>
<PARA>6. Would ATSIC think it strange that on receipt of such a report, funds should continue to be advanced?</PARA>
<PARA>7. If such audits had in fact been provided over successive years, would it not be negligent to continue funding without an attempt to ensure that internal control was such that monies were not properly spent. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Question 1</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, in regard to a systems review and evaluation of internal control, if there were indications from other sources or from the auditor's financial statement that there were possible systems weaknesses or mismanagement occurring. It is preferable, of course, to have both matters fully addressed in every report but, given the locality, the availability of auditors and the cost, this can not always occur. </PARA>
<PARA>With regard to the sighting of the register of Directors etc. this would not be considered a major issue as it is a requirement of the Companies Act not ATSIC grant rules. ATSIC is concerned to ensure that the organisation is firstly incorporated and that it will continue to be so while receiving ATSIC funding and as such ATSIC encourages organisations to comply with all of their incorporation requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>Question 2</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, but ATSIC does not believe that a full systems review is required each financial year unless there is evidence of possible mismanagement. Costs of a full systems review can be a prohibitive factor. </PARA>
<PARA>Question 3</PARA>
<PARA>Under the Companies (NSW) Code 1981, there are penalties for companies not maintaining their Register of Directors. ATSIC is aware that it is an essential step of most company audits to inspect the Register of Members and Directors. However, ATSIC does not believe that it is illegal for auditor's not to sight this Register. It appears from the auditor's report that he, in fact, did attempt to sight the Register but it was not available. ATSIC understands that the Register now exists. </PARA>
<PARA>Question 4</PARA>
<PARA>No, Barwon continued to use their existing auditor after he had moved to Gympie. The north west of NSW has always been poorly serviced by auditors. Barwon has since changed auditors. </PARA>
<PARA>Question 5</PARA>
<PARA>ATSIC considers that it would have reasonable surety that monies are not being misappropriated given that project officers maintain constant contact with organisations and that the organisations are also required to provide other financial and physical reports. If an auditor continued not to provide a detailed report or there were reasons to suspect misappropriation, then an auditor's report including a full systems review and internal control evaluation would be requested prior to further funds being released. </PARA>
<PARA>Question 6</PARA>
<PARA>No, given the above reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>Question 7</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, it would be negligent if no action was taken, especially if mismanagement was suspected. ATSIC focuses considerable resources on improving client management and accounting systems. In Barwon's case, ATSIC has provided assistance to computerise its accounting system and train staff. Currently, ATSIC is funding two professional accounting advisers to assist the organisation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I think I got the Minister's reply. I understand what has been said-that there are responsibilities there to prevent fires and that there is a responsibility, if a fire gets going, like that of any other land-holder. The point is that, whether the liability is there or not, not all land-holders hold public insurance policies. If another property gets burnt out that is alongside a property that lets a fire go, then it is a lot easier to get compensation if there is a policy in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there is not, from experience I have had in other places, it is like getting blood out of a stone. In the case of Oombulgurri, which lies west of Wyndham in Western Australia, fire has escaped on more than one occasion and has burnt out three-quarters of one particular station. Getting information out of the community as to whether there is a public liability in place or not has been rather difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already said, if public liability insurance is in place, at least there is some encouragement to start an action. If no public liability insurance is in place and an action is commenced, the owner of the property that has burnt out in the first place finishes up with the bills for litigation. Of course, the Government could pick up the tab-if it wanted to do so-if there was an action. </PARA>

When this matter was considered on 20 September a number of issues relating to the business migration program were raised and there were concerns in respect of the measurement of the effectiveness of the business migration program and so on. I ask: what efforts have been made since we last met on 20 September to improve the esteem with which the business migration program is held? A number of people have attempted to bring it into disrepute. One of the areas where the scheme seems to be very weak is the Government's monitoring of the effectiveness of the scheme and its monitoring of the number of people who have actually commenced businesses, for example, within the first 12 months. Perhaps the Minister is in a position to make some comments on that at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator O'Chee's question is based on the assumption that the program is not working all that well. I am advised that we are talking about a program which has a lead time in terms of investment of money and, consequently, in terms of assessment of how well that program is going. Of course, people do not come straight in and invest $1m immediately; they do need a lead-in period during which they can make business assessments and decisions such as what amount should be invested and particularly how it should be spent. Having committed themselves to spending money on particular programs when they come here, it takes some time before those programs get off the ground and the money that they intend to apply is in fact applied to them. Basically, we think it is too early to make the judgments which Senator O'Chee makes on the business migration program.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am not, in fact, making a judgment on the business migration program. I am merely relaying judgments that other people have made. At this point I think it might be pertinent to refer to an answer given to a question that I put on 20 September. I asked what percentage of people had started business within the first 12 months. Mr Hughes, one of the departmental officers, advised that some 45 per cent had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Parer then asked how that figure was arrived at and whether it was as a result of a survey. The answer was yes, and that the response rate on the survey was 50 per cent of those who had been given business migrant visas. The consequence is that some people have asserted that only 22 1/2 per cent of business migrants have actually started businesses within the first 12 months of their being in this country. Given that business migrants enter this country supposedly with a set plan as to how they intend to set up business, is the Department able to give a better estimation of the percentage of business migrants who commence a business in the first 12 months?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator O'Chee's assumption in dividing 45 per cent in half to get 22 1/2 per cent as the relevant figure emanating from the survey is wrong. The survey was in fact voluntary. As a consequence, no inference can be drawn from the fact that only half of those who were asked to reply did reply. The Department, however, is continuing with more surveys in this area to make better assessments. I ask the Committee to note that a 45 per cent commitment within 12 months-and even a marginal decrease on that-to a business and to the employment of people is not a bad return as a benchmark. I say that so that we do not apply a devaluation to those who have not replied to the survey.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Obviously the business migration scheme cannot be assisted to continue, cannot be assisted to get a wider acceptance in the population, if other people make comments that do not reflect well on it. I am concerned that the Minister does something to try to improve the reputation and the acceptance of the business migration scheme. I come in here and I ask the Minister very straightforward questions, very easy questions, and he gets into his lager mentality and decides that he has to resort to personal abuse. That was never my intention, Minister. I never came in here to point score. I came in here because I have a genuine concern that the scheme operates as well as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> I have a large number of ethnic constituents who come to me and say they are very concerned about the scheme. They say they are concerned because so many people outside the ethnic community are knocking the scheme. I therefore come in here with the intention of trying to clear up some of the grave misconceptions there are about the scheme, and what do we find? We find the Minister resorting to personal abuse, getting into his lager mentality. If the Minister wants this Estimate to go very quickly, I am very happy to assist in that taking place, but I want straight answers, and I do not expect the sort of gratuitous insult that we have seen from the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Maybe he has had a hard day, but when some of us are trying to play the game fairly I think it would be only reasonable for the Minister to respond fairly as well. So they are the points that I have made. I am just concerned; I want to see this business migration scheme work and I want to see the Department doing something to ensure that it continues to be a success. I do not believe that the 22 1/2 per cent figure is right. I am just hoping that the Department will be able to give me a better figure so that I can go out to people and say, `No, you are wrong. It is not 22 1/2 per cent'. If the Department cannot at the moment, I want to know when the Department can. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; My next question relates to the assistance, if any, that is given to business migrants coming into the country. I am not going to ask the Department whether it has changed the processes but I ask the Department: is it aware of concerns that many business migrants who come into this country with perhaps grandiose schemes that were drawn up by a migration consultant outside of this country are unable to commence business because they do not really quite understand how the business community works in this country?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question, therefore, is: is the Department aware that there is concern amongst the ethnic community that people are coming in and are sometimes getting frustrated in their attempts to set up a business because of the cultural barriers that exist?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator O'Chee will recognise that the Department has in fact adopted a system whereby agents can be involved in the obtaining and certification of migration processes in respect of business migration. One of the main reasons for that is to enable those who are on the ground, those who are in business-whether it is major chartered accountancy firms or others-to be in a position to consult with and assist those intending to come into Australia for business migration purposes. Of course we realise that that does not always work as well as it should. That is understood, but the process of using agents is geared very much towards assisting those coming in to invest, to ensure that they have as much knowledge as possible about what the environment they will be working in is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will elaborate further on the answer I gave earlier. The reason for the provision of agents in the process is essentially to stop this particular problem. Agents are not there purely to facilitate and assist in procedures for migration. They are there-whether they are law firms, accountancy firms, or whatever-to try to ensure that these people are made more aware of the culture and the environment they are coming to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think Senator O'Chee would accept when we are talking about marketplace migration that those who are in the marketplace are best suited to assist those who are coming here to invest as part of a business migration program. As I said earlier, one would never claim that we have a 100 per cent success rate, but this mechanism has been put in place in order to enhance the success rate of the program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this point I think it might be appropriate for me just to make a comment and the Minister can respond to the comment if he wishes. I wish to put something on the record. I accept and understand the Minister's statement that we are not ever going to have a perfect system. One of the concerns I have about the current system, however, is that a large number of people overseas who are accredited migration consultants do not seem to be doing the right thing by their clients. Numerous allegations have been made to me by people in the ethnic community. They say that they know of instances where intending migrants have been asked for very large sums of money, sometimes four-figures sums, just to make an application with no guarantee of success. In many cases that have been raised with me, these migration consultants do not do anything more than fill out the form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it leaves a very bad taste in the mouth, it gives a very bad image of Australia in some countries, and is causing a certain degree of anxiety that nationals in other countries are effectively getting fleeced by people who are accredited migration consultants, and they are not getting anything in return for it. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that we are never going to have a perfect system, but I am concerned that at first sight it would appear that there are a very large number of accredited migration consultants, and there does not seem to be sufficient control over the activities of those accredited migration consultants. As a consequence, some of them would appear to be abusing their accreditation. They are making a profit out of perhaps naive people, but certainly well-intentioned people, and are not really being asked to perform. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no difficulties with the market system provided that the market is a fair one. I am just concerned that the system as it runs at the moment does not seem to be doing the right thing by the intending migrant. As I said, it is causing a certain degree of anxiety amongst the ethnic community. </PARA>
<PARA> My other concern is that it would appear that the Department is relying very much on those accredited migration consultants not just to prepare the application but to assist migrants after they come to this country. It may be that I am wrong. If it is the case that the Department is relying on accredited migration consultants to assist migrants after they have come to the country, it appears to me, from the anecdotal evidence available to me, that that function is not being performed, because in many cases the accredited migration consultants reside outside this country and do not have an affiliate within this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some very sound and fine migration consultants who are affiliated with organisations or persons within this country who, I believe, do a good job, but there are many more who are not affiliated and who appear to be only filling out the forms and not doing anything else. If there is an area where we can improve the business migration system it would perhaps be there, because from the anecdotal evidence available to me the scheme is breaking down at that point. These people come here with good intentions but, for reasons of cultural difficulty, do not seem to be able to carry them through. Maybe that is an area that the Department needs to look at to improve the service that it makes available and the efficiency and effectiveness of the business migration system. </PARA>

<PARA> Perhaps it would be appropriate to move on to the special humanitarian program and the problems currently being faced in the assessment of various types of refugee applications. One of the concerns that I have is that it does not appear that there will be sufficient resources available to process many of the applications. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, I understand that Chinese student applications in various categories are taking 12 months for screening. Some Chinese students who have made applications to stay in this country, who are awaiting work permits and have been asked to fill out the necessary forms, are being told that they will not be able to get the work permits until they have been interviewed under the Determination of Refugee Status Committee (DORS) procedures. When they ask when they will be interviewed by DORS, the answer is, `Probably in about 12 months time, and no special circumstances are being taken into consideration'. That is causing a great deal of hardship, resulting in some of those intending applicants working illegally and, thus, breaking the system down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that this is an area which has been under Government consideration for some time. The objective of the Government is to enable processing of these sorts of applications within a nine-month period. To that effect, Cabinet has recently allocated extra resources to the Department for this particular function. I know Senator O'Chee will be pleased to hear that over the last fiscal year there has been a capacity for a fourfold increase in resources in this particular area. The Government also recognises that there will be a need for ongoing resources in this area, so it will not be a one-off this financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take that as a sufficient answer to my question; obviously when we come back and look at the Estimates in six months or 12 months time we will be better able to assess how well that has worked. I am very pleased that has been done because it has tended to make the whole system unworkable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would prefer, therefore, to move on to the discussion of English language intensive courses for overseas students (ELICOS) visas, which was the last area where I made reservations. When the matter was examined on 20 September, I was concerned that there did not seem to be any sufficient check on the origin of the money that would be used to finance a student's expenses in this country. Mr Bugden from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs agreed that the cost of a student staying in Australia for six months was approximately $4,000 in course fees, with living expenses of about $2,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern I had at that time, and the concern I still have, is that in many cases the money is not coming from outside this country but, rather, is coming from within this country, that is, the money is borrowed from an individual or a company in Australia and is being repaid through the student working in this country. The whole purpose of the ELICOS scheme was to earn export dollars for Australia. Therefore, I would like to extend to the Minister the opportunity to comment on that in a general sense so that, if I am incorrect in that assumption or if I am incorrect in saying that currently nothing is being done to check where the money comes from, he can correct that matter now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the first point to make here is that a number of mechanisms can be utilised to ensure that those applying to come in under the scheme are bona fide. There has been a substantial tightening of checks over this year. For instance, at the moment nine out of 10 applying from the People's Republic of China are not getting through the system because they are not assessed as being bona fide. Having said that the Government has recognised and put in place tightened checks across the board in assessing whether someone is a bona fide student or not, I should also say that we do make checks as far as possible in respect of the money trail, but it is, I think it is fair to say, not possible, I am advised, to enhance those checks that apply at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think Senator O'Chee's concern is to ensure that a bona fide student is the only one who comes here. The whole range of enhanced checks that are in place this year has ensured that that has applied, as far as possible, to date. I do, however, ask Senator O'Chee to recognise that to follow the money trail is sometimes just not possible. It is not possible to do more than we are doing at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this stage it might be appropriate to refer to questions and answers that were given on 20 September, when I questioned Mr Bugden about this. On page D143 I am reported to have said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>When you talk about access to funds, does that also mean loans available to the applicants at the time at which they apply?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bugden answered:</PARA>
<PARA>If they have got that money. The source of the funds does not matter terribly much to us, providing they have the funds. </PARA>
<PARA>I then asked:</PARA>
<PARA>So quite possibly people could justify their ability to pay upon the basis that a loan would be made available to them in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA>Then Mr Gibbons answered:</PARA>
<PARA>It is possible. I emphasise the point made by Mr Bugden: an assessment is made of a person's capacity to earn while in Australia. Part of the rationale behind the scheme involves time for the students to work to earn income, to offset the costs of their stay and their education in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>He then recommends further questioning of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. My concern is that quite clearly the Department is aware that many students are financing the cost of their education and their stay in this country solely from work within Australia rather than from money outside, and that would appear to be a clear admission by at least the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs that the system has broken down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I anticipate that it would satisfy Senator O'Chee's concerns if I were to say that evidence of a person's capacity to repay a loan or to pay for his or her stay in Australia is taken into account when an assessment is made of whether a person is a bona fide student or not. That, coupled with the fact that checks have been tightened and that, as a result of those tightened checks, there has been a substantial reduction in the number of people coming in, I think effectively meets the two concerns. The point to be made about the question that Senator O'Chee asked is that we really cannot stop people from coming in just because they have borrowed money to come in. However, we need to ensure that they have the capacity to pay off a loan once they are here. That is part of the test applied to ensure that a person applying is a bona fide intending student.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to see that the tests have been tightened up. But that still does not answer my principal concern that we are not really earning export dollars. The whole purpose of this scheme was to earn millions of dollars for Australia every year from the money that would come into the country. We now find that the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs is admitting that the money does not come into the country. The money exists in this country; it is borrowed outside this country and is repaid from earnings in this country, so it is not really earning anything more for this country. All that is being achieved is that jobs are being taken from Australians. That is not a racist comment. In fact, it is a comment made to me in some respects by the Chinese community. It appears that many nationals of the People's Republic of China, who have very limited access to funds in their home country, are coming to Australia under the English language intensive courses for overseas students scheme, working for six months and repaying, solely from their endeavours within Australia, the money that they have borrowed. The people they are taking jobs from are Australian born Chinese or Chinese who have migrated to this country and become Australian citizens. The concern and consternation of the Chinese community over this matter is very great. I extend another opportunity to the Minister to say whether Mr Gibbons's and Mr Bugden's comments are correct-that the Department does not really care where the money comes from.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Senator O'Chee raised a concern about the People's Republic of China (PRC). It is a concern that has been put to me also by my friends in the community. I think there was wider concern in the community some time ago, but I ask Senator O'Chee to take into account the fact that, with the enhanced checking in this area to which I referred earlier, nine out of 10 intending students from PRC are now denied entry because they are not assessed as being bona fide students. </PARA>
<PARA> There is more than one aim or objective for this program. The export of education services and getting money from overseas students is one objective, but not the only one. The enhanced checking has produced results already and I think Senator O'Chee would accept that that has ensured that the students that he is concerned about-the non-bona fide ones-do not come in. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask Senator O'Chee to consider that, for instance, Australian students going to study overseas are not denied access to that study because they borrow to go and study. There has to be some fairness in this. But at the same time let us take as the important consideration that we will allow in genuine students and, to that extent, the tightening of the criteria and the enforcement of them has enhanced the program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again it does not seem appropriate at this point for me to continue asking questions. I will therefore make a comment to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), and again he is free to respond to it if he wishes. I understand the Minister's point about bona fide students; I think that is a very important point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From my understanding, one of the selling points of the English language intensive courses for overseas students (ELICOS) scheme is that it would earn export dollars for Australia. It now appears that it is not earning as many export dollars as was originally intended. Instead, we are now finding other points being thrown up as principal reasons for the scheme. When Mr Dawkins, I believe, talked about the scheme when it was first mooted, it was one of the ways of making Australia an exporter of education and, hence, of increasing the wealth of the nation. We now find that what the Minister has said is a back down of the Government's position because the earning of export dollars is not the sole principal criteria-it now seems to be giving education to people. I do not find that terribly satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that when Australian students go overseas they have an opportunity to borrow money. Yes, that is true. I did my university degree overseas, but the point I make is that I was not allowed to work in the United Kingdom for all the time I was there. It was a condition of the visa that I was not allowed to work. In fact, it was also a condition of the visa that the money to pay for my education had to originate from outside the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand all the arguments: we have an obligation to South East Asia and to other developing countries; that this does something towards improving international relations and improving our friendships overseas, and hence the standing of Australia in 10 or 20 years time. I understand all those things, but what I do not understand is why the Government should hide behind the fiction that the ELICOS scheme is successfully earning dollars for Australia when quite clearly that has been misplaced and there are now other justifications for the scheme. If there are other justifications for the scheme, I believe that it is incumbent upon the Government to come clean with those justifications, say exactly what it is attempting to achieve with the ELICOS scheme and then let us get on with the job. What I do not like is the use of fiction to justify what is being done. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I say that there is still real concern in the community about the students who are working. I went into a Chinese restaurant in Brisbane for lunch. I subsequently had meetings afterwards, had dinner, worked a little bit later and then came back for late evening coffee in a hotel. The period of time that elapsed had been about 10 hours. I was very surprised to find the same waitress serving me in the hotel as had served me lunch in the restaurant. She explained very simply that she works something like 15 hours on a Sunday, works also on other days and works well in excess of the 20 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> There are substantial flaws and loopholes in the scheme and it is not working at the moment. I have said in the past and repeat that unless this scheme can be tightened up, run properly and unless we can be assured that we are actually earning export dollars for Australia, the scheme ought to go because at the moment it is the soft underbelly of immigration into this country. It is being used for all sorts of other rorts. I have no problems with bona fide students who are coming in and bringing dollars into this country in the same way that I was asked to take dollars over to the United Kingdom. But what I do find objectionable is that so many other jobs are being lost and so many people are being disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> I just make one point while we are talking about this because the biggest overstayers, from the latest figures that I have seen, are not in fact the People's Republic of China nationals at all. They do overstay in excess of the average for student visas, but they are not the biggest overstayers. All I am saying is that the whole system needs to be tightened up. If we cannot tighten it up and get clear in our own heads why we are running the scheme, then we have to question the existence of the scheme itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I repeat my previous comments. It is time that we got the purpose of the scheme clear and it is time that we started to really crack down on the people who are using the scheme and disadvantaging Australians. If we cannot do both of those things it is time we threw the scheme out the door, because it is just not working. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point I would like to raise about this matter relates not to one specific program, but rather to the annual report documentation that was provided to the Committee. The matter was raised during the Estimates Committee F hearing that we had received the annual report only a very short period before the Committee sat. I point out to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) that this situation existed the previous year and a suggestion was included in the report that more effort should be made by the Department of Industrial Relations to have the report ready on time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to highlight some facts in regard to that. I know that the reason given for the delay was that the Department was concerned that there might be some errors or omissions in the report, but I think that is something we have to live with. I am quite certain that, had we received that report, firstly it would have saved a significant amount of time during the Estimates Committee hearing because members of the Committee would have been able to brief themselves much more thoroughly and, secondly, it would have saved Committee members from having to bring matters before the Committee of the Whole at this particular time. But, once again, we did not have access to that information. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Minister to take note of the fact that for two years running the annual report has not been available until shortly before the hearings.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise some matters in respect of program 1.2, relating to workplace reform. As I put in my reservation, I have a number of additional questions and examinations I would like to ask in respect of that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, I raise the issue of the expenditure involved in the establishment of the various reform centres. In examining this, I am curious to learn why there are enormous differences between the establishment costs of the various centres. If one looks at the situation in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, one finds they required only $241,000 in the initial grant. However, when one looks at other centres, particularly the Hunter centre, one finds that the establishment cost of that centre had blown out to $785,512. That is an extraordinary amount of money compared to the expenditure incurred for the establishment of the other centres. What did that expenditure relate to? Was it capital expenditure, or did it relate to structure and so on?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The $241,000 referred to for the other centres named by Senator Crane relates to the capital costs of setting up those centres and the fact that it took up to five months in each case to get those centres established, resourced and up and running.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The $785,000 for the Hunter centre, to which the honourable senator referred, includes both the capital and the recurrent costs. The Hunter centre is regarded by both the employer organisations that access it and the unions covered by it as the most efficient centre in Australia. The establishment time for that centre was short and truncated; it took six weeks to get it running. However, there was solid demand within the Hunter region for its services that had to be met in a very short time. </PARA>
<PARA> While that figure is both capital and recurrent, the other explanation about the size of the amount relates to the shortness of time in which it had to be established. That required a consideration about whether we met the earlier deadline to pick up the client base that stood there and could be picked up or we took a more leisurely stroll down the course and risked losing some of the client base that existed. That is the sort of decision one makes when one is in a position of promoting this type of commercial undertaking. They are the reasons for the extra amount. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that explanation. In summary, we are not comparing apples with apples; we are comparing apples with oranges. That was not clear in the report. I understand it was intended that these centres should be self-financing within approximately three years. Can the Minister advise the Senate what the total cost of all these centres is likely to be by June 1993? In addition, does the Minister have any information on fees received to date for the services provided? Having regard to the amount now received and the likely costs up to June 1993, will these centres have become profitable when the deadline arrives?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I may be in receipt in a moment of some advice about the total costs by June 1993; someone is scribbling feverishly away in the corner. It is the Government's intention that these centres be self-financing and independent business entities operating on a tripartite basis to help speed the process of workplace change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The position of the Government is that we would cease any financial support by then. If they could not survive in the marketplace, they would fold. If they could survive in the marketplace and be commercial propositions, they would be outside the Government's immediate control but working nonetheless within the articles of association and the registered objectives of the organisations. They would still be rendering that service as self-supporting organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The workplace resource centre based in the Hunter, and to a slightly lesser extent the Sydney centre, are coming close now to being self-financing and look like coming in well under the three-year period. Although the centre in Perth was only opened-by me, actually-earlier this year, it has succeeded magnificently in attracting clients from a whole spectrum of industry. I would expect it to be another centre which would become self-financing, certainly within the three-year period, and maybe a lot quicker than might otherwise be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I am able to confirm that the New South Wales and Hunter centres are essentially self-financing now. Western Australia, Victoria and South Australia are coming close to that point. The fees already received by them-this is their income-amount to close to $1m. Total outlays by 1993, for the seven centres around Australia, would probably be $10m, or a figure of that order. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the Minister's answer that funding would cease by 1993. My next question relates to the establishment costs and what occurs when the centres come into profitability.

If it is to remain with the centres, will there be a system whereby the government investment is in fact recouped from those centres?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is a very good question. The present arrangement is that the centres would use their profitability to reinvest to improve the quality and extension of their services. Their articles of association, as I understand them, require that that cannot go into higher remuneration or any outrageous level of remuneration for the people employed there. It must go into the improvement of the quality and scope of the services. This program was under way when I assumed this portfolio. As part of my commitment to review all the elements of the portfolio, the question that Senator Crane has asked occurred to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not yet taken any initiative on the subject, but what emboldens me to consider it further is that a number of these centres have proved to be able to reach sustainability a lot quicker than anticipated. Whilst I have not yet addressed the matter, it is still open, as far as I am concerned, as to whether, in the face of that good performance, there will be a requirement for part of the moneys or all of the moneys to be repaid at some level or in some form. That is a matter that I have not finally resolved, but it is under active consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I urge very strongly, and it is my view, that the long term objective should be to recover those funds if the centres do come into profitability. Once again, I will summarise two or three questions to endeavour to save time. I note that New South Wales has two centres; none of the other States has two. This leads me to a concern relating to rural Australia. Of course, Senator Cook is well aware, as are other honourable senators, that there are some difficulties, particularly with small business, the farm sector and some mining enterprises in rural areas. I would like to find out what accessibility rural businesses have to this service and what services are provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will give some examples: are there 008 toll free numbers whereby contact can be made? Do officers of the centres travel to the rural areas and service those particular areas? If so, how regularly, and what type of rural skills and knowledge do they have? Have any provisions been made in the scheme to provide specialist information to the farming community in association with businesses in these times?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, that is a very appropriate and responsible line of inquiry. The honourable senator is right that the Hunter centre is almost an example of spontaneous combustion, based on Newcastle in a heavily industrialised area. There has been for some time in that region a call for services of this nature. As I said in my answer to the first question, thus it was that there was a demand for its services before we could actually establish the centre properly. But it is the only regionally located centre in Australia. It does occur to me that places such as Geelong, the Illawarra based on Port Kembla, the Whyalla-Port Pirie-Port Augusta triangle-the Iron Triangle in South Australia-parts of the north coast of Queensland, some of the hinterland major provincial cities in that State as well and, in our own State, Western Australia, the Pilbara region stand out as possible candidates for centres of this nature to be established in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Their focus is mainly in areas of industry where it is possible to reap the benefits of award restructuring by reforming workplace practice. To that extent, it may not always be something that is appropriate for the farming community. But, in my view, that is not something to be dismissed or put aside. If the farming community has an interest in looking at how employed labour can reach greater levels of productivity, then these centres should be open to meet that demand from there. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not have provision now for 008 numbers, and the travel to provincial areas is done from time to time depending on which industry-in the Western Australian case, which mining activity-is calling upon a contractual relationship between it and the centre to render its service. I know that places such as Darwin, where there is not a centre at this stage, and some of the other places have pooled their resources to supply a service. With the centres coming into profitability, I expect that a travel to regional centres budget can be worked out for them and they can better service those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The last element of Senator Crane's question asked what types of skills and what types of services they actually provide. As the honourable senator knows, it is a commercial service where both unions and employers wish that service to be introduced. It is to look at how, under the advances made by restructuring of awards, by reducing the number of classifications to one, and by introducing multiskilled workers in place of rigid demarcations of particular skills, one can achieve efficiencies in the workplace. The centres advise that, firstly, they conduct a skills audit to see what the levels of skills might be at a particular enterprise, on contract. Having achieved an audit in association with the management and usually with the unions in the enterprise, they work out how career paths and training programs can be introduced to broaden the skill base in that enterprise and to create a more flexible work force better able to absorb new technology, new processes, new methods of doing things and work out, appropriate to the needs and the market that that enterprise serves, how high levels of productivity per head of employed worker can be generated. </PARA>
<PARA> Where employed labour is working on farms, there is some scope for that, but the more obvious focus is in heavier industry or in larger scale industry at this stage. That is not in any sense to deny the right of small business either, because it does have an interest in receiving these services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his answer. I guess that the emphasis I was putting on that question was related to small businesses in rural Australia because of the number of enforced lay-offs of people employed there. I see this possibly as an opportunity to ease some of that burden. I would hate to see a return to 1971 when we saw a whole host of people suddenly put into a training program for meat inspectors only to find out that we had about five meat inspectors for every job. We need to give a little more thought to what is happening now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to page 32 of the explanatory notes for Estimates Committee F. I will have to be a little careful because the Minister has just told me that I have asked two good questions. I will have to do better than that in the future. I have some questions about the work change training scheme. I point out that the explanatory notes state that the Department is still evaluating the scheme. Is this the current situation? If so, when will the results of that evaluation be available? If not, what is the current situation of the evaluation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, this evening has great historic significance for all those who belong to the Australian Labor Party (ALP) or support its objectives. On this day, 28 November, we commemorate the occasion when the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council resolved to support a motion of one Robert Joseph Harris. Some would say that the ALP for a century has been sustained only by divine intervention. Given the splits of 1917, 1931 and 1954-57, that view has great merit. But a century ago this evening the resolution that Robert Harris moved read as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That with a view of securing better representation of labour in Parliament, and to effectively organise all that are favourable to the said, object, this Council deems it advisable to establish Labour Electoral Leagues in every centre where practicable throughout the colony, and the Parliamentary Committee be instructed to prepare a scheme for the organisation and government of same. </PARA>
<PARA>In short, that is the original resolution that had as its objective the formation of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, as you are aware, this occurred hard on the consequences of the great strikes of the 1880s and 1890s, the great strikes in the maritime and pastoral industries in particular. It occurred as a consequence of the failures of the infant trade union movement and, hence, the peak body of the trade unions of the day, the Trades and Labour Council of New South Wales, took the decision through the Harris proposition to form a political labour movement. Hence, this evening, we are able to commemorate the initial decision that gave birth to the Australian Labor Party. One hundred years later, Harris's words have been fulfilled in the electoral successes of the ALP. The Trades and Labour Council was visualising the formation of a uniquely and original political party, one which would pave the way for the development of a more egalitarian and prosperous Australian society. On 17 June 1881, just one year after the formation of the Labour Electoral Leagues in New South Wales, the fledgling Labor Party won 35 of the 141 contested seats for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. These elections brought to end the long-standing tradition of two party politics in New South Wales-liberal versus conservative-a tradition which had impeded political growth and had served to stratify the society of the State. Despite its infancy, the Labor Party managed to demonstrate beyond doubt to critics and supporters alike that Labor was a force to be reckoned with for the future-the future of Australian as well as New South Wales politics. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, the formation of the new party did not pass unnoticed, as this quote from the Sydney Morning Herald somewhat nervously anticipated:</PARA>
<PARA>The leaders of Labor seem to have set themselves a large task. They are preparing for more systematic and more completely organised action in the political world, and by way of preparation they are showing forth in a political sense the whole duty of men. </PARA>
<PARA> The opposition to the political wing of the labour movement has been hard and it has been enduring. In its initial stages, the Labor Party was greeted, again by the Sydney Morning Herald, in sarcastic terms. I quote from the newspaper:</PARA>
<PARA>The creation of a Labor Party in Parliament, if it did nothing else, must have a salutary effect in turning the minds of the unsatisfied among the working-classes to the right direction for the removal of their grievances, whether real or imagined . . . and good cannot fail to come of it if the appearance of such a party in Parliament is the means of removing any sense of grievance under which the working classes may have considered themselves to be suffering . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Some might suggest that one can continue to read sentiments of that kind in the Sydney Morning Herald currently, but that is what it said in 1891. The Labour Electoral Leagues were founded on the need of working Australians for political representation. Working Australians required a political party which endeavoured to deliver for them, through legislation, that which was needed to combat the injustices of the society at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party started simply from the basic need for the protection of the rights of working men and women. It started from the concern amongst ordinary Australians for their own future and for the future of their children. The catalyst for the decision of the Trades and Labour Council to form the ALP was the maritime strike of 1890, as I mentioned earlier. The defeat of the massive industrial action undertaken by trade unions, not only in New South Wales but all over the country, saw the beginning of a new era in Australian politics. </PARA>
<PARA> After a long period of economic growth, the end of the 1880s signalled the beginning of hard economic times. This precipitated a major industrial and then political confrontation. The strike in the maritime industry arose from efforts by unionists to protect their wages and conditions at a time when wages were falling and the economy was in decline. So it was in the pastoral industry almost at the same time. I will say a little bit more about the pastoral strike in a moment, but the Melbourne Age reported at the time of the maritime strike:</PARA>
<PARA>The shipowners are chiefly blamable for pushing this quarrel to the point of a rupture. They admit, and could scarcely deny that the officers have a perfect right to form a union for the promotion of their own interests . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In the circumstances of the maritime strike, the shipowners were victorious and the defeated unionists were left only with the realisation of the necessity of political action. It was a defeat that would have profound effects and consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> The labour movement discovered that it needed the strength of a political force in Parliament to adequately represent the interests of working Australians, for the States had been deployed by the conservative political parties against the trade unions. The police and the courts had been used as deliberate weapons to defeat the trade unions industrially. Mr Deputy President, everyone in the labour movement is familiar with the words from Reedy River about the pastoral strike at the end of the 1880s:</PARA>
<PARA>The price of wool was falling in eighteen ninety one;</PARA>
<PARA>The men who owned the acres saw something must be done:</PARA>
<PARA>`We'll break the shearers' union and show we're masters still,</PARA>
<PARA>And they'll take the terms we give them or we'll find the men who will!'.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, history proved otherwise. The newly formed ALP sought to achieve as priorities free education, an eight-hour working day, fair wages, safe conditions for workers and the establishment of invalid and age pensions. I think it is fair to say that the ALP continues to this day to exemplify the spirit and intentions of its forefathers and foremothers. </PARA>
<PARA> The relationship between the political wing and industrial wing of the ALP continues to be a feature of our strength; a feature built on cooperation. The ALP and the trade union movement are bodies still acknowledging their original role as representing the interests of ordinary Australians. Our continued relationship is a reflection of the dynamism of the labour movement in this country. The labour movement has broadened its base and it now reflects the interests of the vast majority of working Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The prices and incomes accord is a fine example of the cooperation and effectiveness of the political and industrial wings of Labor working together. It is, in fact, the manifestation of the historic relationship between the ALP and the trade union movement. As the Labor Party approaches the centenary of our electoral success in June of 1891 in New South Wales, and in different months in other States, our Party as a national organisation is looking at the structure of the Labor Party itself. We have to focus on the constituency party structure; we have to focus on the role of the parliamentary Labor parties; and we have to focus on the powers of our conferences at State and national levels. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have to focus on the historic nexus between political and industrial labour. This nexus has served us well for nearly a century. It distinguishes the ALP from our fraternal parties abroad, amongst other social democratic and democratic socialist parties. The nexus is a sheet anchor both for reference and for support, but it is appropriate that we examine its applicability for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Political Labor in this country has never been seen to be dominated by the trade union movement as perhaps British Labour governments of the 1960s and 1970s were so perceived. The apparent domination of the Wilson and Callaghan Labour governments by a handful of enormous trade unions has never occurred in this country, nor will it. So at a time of trade union amalgamations leading to larger industrial organisations, and a time of greater diversity in the Australian electorate and in Labor's constituency, it is appropriate that the political and industrial nexus be examined. Many people in the Labor Party, myself included, will need to be convinced that the nexus ought to be altered; but a rational and deliberate debate on this and other matters relevant to our organisation is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision of the Trades and Labour Council of New South Wales to form a political Labor wing highlighted the need for the labour movement to reach beyond trade unionism to all sympathetic Australians. The ALP continues to pursue new objectives and, at the same time, seeks to maintain its relevance in a modern industrial society. I believe we have achieved that. It is a matter of history that the ALP has led the way in areas such as environmental protection and issues associated with anti-discrimination while maintaining its customary role in the areas of social security, health, education, producing a sound economic policy and, over the decades, producing an independent foreign policy and a strong defence policy for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as today it is the contribution of individuals who give the labour movement its place of prominence in Australia, so it is a matter of record that the vision and dedication of the pioneers of the early labour movement enabled the ALP to become the potent political force that it is today, in 1990. The ALP has been responsible for many achievements in this country's history. Again, it is a matter of our history. I know that Senator Collins, as someone who is steeped in the labour tradition, will acknowledge that the Labor Party has brought this country through wars, through depression, through a period of post-colonialism in our region, and has forged a vision of the future which has opened the doors consistently to equality and opportunity and to a better Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision of the Trades and Labour Council on that night 100 years ago this evening has led ultimately to an unprecedented decade of national Labor government. In my view, that is something all Australians can acknowledge and we in the labour movement in particular ought to celebrate. </PARA>

<PARA>Given that a whole smorgasbord of subsidised imported food products is flooding into Australia at a cost of $2.134 billion or 10 per cent of the current account deficit; and given that these imports are causing great harm to our farmers and our horticultural industry; and given that most Australian shoppers would prefer to buy Australian products but find it difficult to distinguish between Australian and imported products on the supermarket shelves because of the present labelling regulations; will the Minister agree to enforce a code of labelling that will allow a shopper to readily identify Australian products by having the country of origin clearly marked on the label on the same side of the container as the contents and the brand name in lettering that is no less that 5mm? Will the Minister also investigate the loophole in the law which allows imported ingredients to be processed in Australia and then be labelled as a product of Australia, for example, imported fruit juice concentrate which is mixed with Australian water and labelled `Product of Australia'? Will the Minister give an assurance that he will give Australia a labelling code that ensures that there is accuracy and authenticity in labelling of imported foods?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today the 1989-90 annual report of the Soil Conservation Advisory Committee was tabled in the chamber. I would like to address a few remarks to that report. It is very important that we take notice of this report which is, in fact, a report of the first full year of operation of this Committee as it is now. The work of the Committee is particularly important to Australia's future. A significant part of the Committee's work is concerned with the community land care support subprogram. I am pleased to see in the report that funds available for land care projects have been increased through transfers from uncommitted areas of the national soil conservation program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has also been a steady shift of emphasis from simply the awareness programs to an increasing flexibility in the guidelines which are used to administer that. Page 7 of the report states this shift has:</PARA>
<PARA>made allowances for organisations and individuals not eligible for a grant under the Community Landcare Support sub-program to participate in soil conservation and landcare activities. </PARA>
<PARA>Because of that shift, we are now fortunately able to recognise the role played in the conservation of our soils by individuals. One such individual who has come to notice, certainly in Tasmania, is Mr David Stephen of Taroona. For his work during the past two decades at least Mr Stephen has been presented with an inaugural land care award for an individual non-primary producer. </PARA>
<PARA> While Mr Stephen is not mentioned in this report as a recipient of a land care grant, it is appropriate at this moment that the Senate also notes the efforts of individuals such as Mr Stephen in contributing to the welfare of Australia's basis for its primary production. Mr Stephen, for example, is particularly enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge with any other interested people. In the Hobart Mercury of 21 November it is reported that he holds classes to encourage people to care for the soil by replenishing its nutrients and protecting it from further deterioration. Mr Stephen is described as an ecological gardener who appreciates the need to maintain a natural balance when cultivating the soil. </PARA>
<PARA> When commenting on the Wool Research and Development Council's report some time ago I drew attention to that group's work with worms to improve pasture productivity. I mentioned the work of another individual in Tasmania, one of Tasmania's great agriculturalists, Mr Bert Farquhar of Rushy Lagoon. Like Mr Stephen, Mr Farquhar has persisted with farming practices which actually involve the assistance of what Mr Farquhar calls the invisible army-that is, the army of worms underneath the soil. The contribution made by the worms in this instance has greatly increased the productivity of the pasture. It is really important to note the contributions made by individuals such as these. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to note the efforts of other organisations. I turn to page 15 of the Soil Conservation Advisory Committee's report. The point that Senator Calvert raised earlier struck me also. We have both recently travelled to the Northern Territory. I know that Senator Collins will be particularly thrilled about this. Although the Landcare program in the Northern Territory is described on page 15 of this report as being in its infancy, it has been identified that the main degradation issues being tackled are: the extensive degradation of native pastures; water erosion, particularly along perennial water courses; property planning; scalded land reclamation; rabbit control; and woody shrub invasion. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, I have just returned from public hearings in the Northern Territory conducted by the Select Committee on Animal Welfare. I am sure that the Soil Conservation Advisory Committee is aware of the information that was given to the Committee regarding the devastation being caused to Australia's soils, especially in the Northern Territory, by feral animals. </PARA>
<PARA> Without needing to go into the exact description of just how many feral animals there are and their categories, I think that the Senate, perhaps in anticipation, should make sure that its attention is drawn to the report which will come from the Animal Welfare Committee. The reference that was given to that Committee was to report on the animal welfare implications of the culling of large feral animals in the Northern Territory, but it was apparent during that Committee's visit that feral animals have the potential to destroy what is particularly Australian about our outback and, if left unchecked, will destroy our vegetation, our water systems-and thereby our soils-and also our native animal species. </PARA>
<PARA> Solving this massive problem is obviously beyond the capacity of the Landcare program that was described on page 15 of this report. But it is important to note that the program has begun and also that other programs exist which should assist in the overall conservation of Australia's soils. </PARA>
<PARA> This set-up that is described in this report is actually the best thing that has ever happened in this area of potential government expenditure. The Committee that has prepared the report in fact has the capacity to advise on and coordinate the funding of programs throughout Australia, and it is so doing. We can see from the report that State agencies received some $20.73m and that other organisations received $2.804m. </PARA>
<PARA> There are hundreds of organisations funded for a variety of programs as described in the report. I will just read a couple of them because I think it is important to be aware of the variety. For example, the Adelaide Hills Potato Growers Soil Conservation Committee was funded for $16,700 to conduct a program to reduce the risk of erosion from potato paddocks. In Tasmania the Bracknell-Liffey River catchment management project was funded for $6,000 and, as part of the research subprogram, the New South Wales Department of Agriculture and Fisheries was funded for $39,547 for a grass weed management for sustainable farming systems program. </PARA>
<PARA> The variety continues when we see that the Western Australia Department of Agriculture was funded for $7,000 to study the effects of tillage and run-off on soil loss. In Tasmania again, the Department of Primary Industries was funded for $16,591 for its midlands tree project. There are hundreds of programs throughout Australia, and this amazing variety of effort is in fact often conducted with the assistance of volunteers. I think that is an important point. The volunteers and community groups gain no particular individual financial benefit from successful programs, but are people who recognise the fundamental truth-that Australia's future and prosperity depend on the welfare of the soil. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that, as this program continues, so the number of applications for funding under it will rise from the 580-odd applications which were made this year as more people are aware of the usefulness of doing this sort of thing. The aims and the five major goals of the Soil Conservation Advisory Committee are reported on pages 3 and 4 and will take only a second to read. I think it is important to do so. Those major goals are:</PARA>
<PARA>* that all lands in Australia be used within their capability;</PARA>
<PARA>* that soil conservation activity and land use decisions be based on whole catchment/regional land management planning concepts;</PARA>
<PARA>* that all land users and levels of government meet their respective responsibilities in achieving soil conservation. </PARA>
<PARA>* that effective co-operation and co-ordination occur between all sectors of the community, disciplines and agencies involved in the use and management of land and water resources; and</PARA>
<PARA>* that the community adopt a land conservation ethic. </PARA>
<PARA>I again emphasise that they are most worthy goals. But in reading this report, and in reading of the level of community support that there has been for it and the community interest there is in the programs, it occurred to me that the achievement of those five major goals would require a funding level realistically 10 times the amount that has been devoted to it here. While I subscribe to the objectives and endorse the activities so far, I would be much happier if there had been an indication during the Budget that a huge increase in funding had been proposed for this particular program. </PARA>
<PARA> It is amazing to see the effort that is already going into dealing with the problem, for example, in the Northern Territory. When faced with the magnitude of the problem of feral animals, and realising that this particular program devotes only something like $500,000 to the Northern Territory when, in fact, $50m might be required to address the feral animal problem properly, I think we can see that a huge funding increase would be necessary. I am not being at all critical of this program as it is; I would just like to see a lot more of it. With that, we would also be able to coordinate more effectively the many programs which have the capacity to address the problems of soil conservation in Australia. </PARA>
