As the honorable senator is aware, the sovereign has not been part of the currency in general circulation for upwards of twenty years, and the increased price of gold in relation to commodities during recent years is not an indication of depreciation in the purchasing power of money. Actually, the retail price index numbers reveal that the purchasing power of the ##£##1 note has appreciably increased since 1929, as will be seen from the following figures :  - </para>

At this stage I need only add that both my predecessor and I devoted considerable time to an endeavour to make this bill as nearly perfect, and as generous, as possible. With respect to the exhibition of petulance by the Leader of the Opposition last evening, when he complained of my failure to proceed with this- <inline font-style="italic">measure,</inline> I may explain that the delay was due to the fact that the honorable senator had not contributed his usual second-reading speech.

                    <para class="block">I consider that ##£##25 is insufficient to cover medical, surgical and hospital expenses. Although the bill is an improvement on the existing act the amount is below that provided in other legislation. For instance, in the Commonwealth Employees##'## Compensation Act of 1930 provision is made that in addition to any compensation payable by the Commonwealth under that act to, or in respect of any employee, the Commonwealth shall pay the cost not exceeding in any case the sum of ##£##100 of such surgical, medical and hospital treatment in relation to the injury as is, in the opinion of the Commissioner reasonably necessary. In these circumstances, the Government should agree to the amendment which 1 have moved. The life of a seaman has many extraordinary angles, and his  work  differs considerably from that in ##"##other industries. As the Queensland and Victorian workmen##'##s compensation acts provide higher medical benefits than those provided in this bill. I trust that the Government will accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para class="block">Australia - Assistant Minister)##[##3.37 . - I have already mentioned that the Government considers that ##'##this is a very generous measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> has moved that the amount payable in respect of hospital, surgical and medical expenses shall be increased from ##£##25 to ##£##100. I regret very much that the Government cannot accept (the amendment. The only workmen##'##s compensation act which provides for the payment by the employer of hospital, surgical and medical expenses up to ##£##100 is the Commonwealth Employees##'## Compensation Act of 1930 which applies only to Commonwealth employees. The Commonwealth Government is in a position to be more generous to its employees injured in the course of their duties than is any private employer, and the Workers##'## Compensation Act of New South Wales, whch is probably the most generous in respect of injuries to workmen, .fixes ##£##25 as the maximum amount for which an employer shall be liable in respect of hospital and medical treatment. Contrary to what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong,</inline> the Victorian Workers##'## Compensation Act fixes a maximum of only ##£##10 for both medical and hospital treatment. The acts of Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania provide for the payment of medical expenses, plus burial expenses, only in cases where no compensation is payable, that is, where death occurs as the result of the injury, and there are no dependants. The amounts payable by the employers in the different States are: Queensland ##£##50, South Australia ##£##20, Western Australia ##£##100, and Tasmania ##£##25. In the present Seamen##'##s Compensation Act no provision whatever is made for the payment of medical or hospital expenses except in respect of a seaman without dependants. In such case a sum of ##£##30 is provided to cover both burial and medical expenses. Honorable senators will note that in that case no ordinary compensation would be payable. Under this bill provision is made for the pay,-##"## ment by the employer of medical and hospital expenses up ito ##£##25, and burial expenses up to a similar amount in the event of death and if the deceased sea man leaves no dependants. Having regard, not only to the generous provision proposed to be made by this bill, but to the considerable benefits* which seamen receive under the Navigation Act with respect to wages, surgical, medical and hospital treatment and maintenance during incapacity due to illness or accident, and their relative award provisions, it is considered that the amount provided to cover medical and hospital expenses is reasonable and equitable. </para>

                            <para>.- Recently I have had brought under my notice cases in respect of which payment of an amount of ##£##25 would not be sufficient. I have in mind particularly the position of an unfortunate seaman who, for some years, had a latent growth on one of his legs. Not long ago, in the course of his employment, he was struck a blow which, although not serious enough in itself to warrant a claim for compensation, aggravated the trouble and caused a dangerous swelling of the leg. He could not prove that his condition was a direct result of the blow, but the company employing him has acted generously and is paying his hospital expenses, which will probably amount to a considerable sum. Another case, instanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arthur,</inline> is that of a man who has suffered an injury to his eyes, and may require expensive ophthalmic treatment, for which ##£##25 will probably be insufficient. In all social legislation the Commonwealth should give a lead to private employers. The Commonwealth Employees##'## Compensation Act provides for compensation to the amount of ##£##100. There is no reason why the Seamen##'##s Compensation Act should not be brought into line with it. </para>

Hospitals, therefore, have to make a remission of all charges in excess of that amount. The bill should provide compensation to the amount  of  ##£##100, or, at least, ##£##75. Hospitals then would not be penalized in the treatment of serious accident cases. </para>

                            <para>- That being so, the reasons given by the Minister for his opposition to the amendment are rather weak. _ Should the amendment be accepted every claim for compensation would not necessarily result in the payment of ##£##100. As I have shown, it might be any amount from ##£##1 to ##£##100. Our opponents talk sympathetically of the dangers and hardships encountered by seamen in the course of their work, but when a proposal such as this is submitted to provide justice for these men in their claims for compensation, the narrowness of the soul of the tory government is revealed. In fairness to those who follow this arduous occupation, adequate provision should be made for compensation in case of injury. I myself have worked on ships and can speak from personal knowledge of the conditions. There will be a grave danger of injustice if the compensation be limited to ##£##25. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The shipowner is, as a rule, able to recover the medical and surgical expenses of his injured employees from an insurance company. Surely a maximum of ##£##100 is not an excessive sum to provide in respect of a seaman who is maimed. I recall the case of a man, not a seaman, who has been attending hospital for three years. He has required expert medical attention, and his expenses will exceed ##£##200. If adequate compensation be not available to seamen who are injured, they will be forced to enter public hospitals, the finances of many of which are already in a serious condition. Honorable senators opposite are humane, and they must realize that ##£##25 is insufficient, in many instances, to meet medical, surgical and hospital expenses of injured seamen. The Minister would have the final voice in determining what is a reasonable sum to allow in each case. </para>

                        <para>, -  Honorable senators on this side are as anxious as members of the Opposition are to see that seamen are adequately compensated for injuries sustained in the course of their employment. No sum could fully compensate an employee for total and permanent incapacity. All the money in the world would not compensate for blindness or for the loss of limbs. We are dealing now with the shipping industry on the Australian coast. Provision has been made in other Commonwealth legislation for a certain standard of wages and living conditions for seamen in the employ of Australian companies. Those conditions, I think, are unequalled in any other part of the world; but, no matter how anxious the Government may be to assist the seamen - I have personal knowledge of the arduous nature of their work - there is a limit beyond which we cannot go. Consideration has to be given to the cost that will be imposed on the Australian shipping industry. Should that cost be too heavy, the only result would be the withdrawal of the Australian mercantile marine and the substitution of overseas ships registered in other than Australian ports. I ask honorable senators opposite to remember that we are not now dealing with the Commonwealth purse, but with a private industry in which business. is highly competitive. In providing for a contribution by the employer which has not previously been required of him, we have fixed what we consider to be the reasonable amount of ##£##25. A seaman who falls from the crow##'##s nest of a ship, and is seriously injured, requiring long - weeks and sometimes years of medical or hospital attention will be covered by this measure. Therefore, it is not reasonable to suggest that the Government is callous or ungenerous in limiting the sum which the Minister may authorise to ##£##25. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> suggested that the Minister might not be reasonable regarding this ##£##25. </para>

                        <para>. -  I support the amendment, and I do so because of the statement just made by the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Allan MacDonald).</inline> Under the law of Western Australia, an employee who meets with an accident in the course of his employment is entitled to expenses for hospital and medical attention amounting to ##£##100. The Assistant Minister has stated that no sum, however large, would fully compensate him for the loss of his eyesight or of a limb. Probably it would be foolish to limit the medical expenses to the maximum sum of ##£##25, because, in the course of time, the injury might prove more costly to the employer than if the maximum allowance for medical attention were now increased to ##£##100. Several X-ray examinations might be necessary before and after the patient had left hospital, and, if the whole of the allowance had been used, the employee##"##, probably anxious to return to work, might overlook the fact that a re-occurrence of his injury or a relapse would result in the injury becoming semipermanent or permanent. When the time came for a final settlement, the sum required as compensation might be much larger than ##£##100. Therefore, the Government should consider the wisdom of accepting the amendment. Since a. lumper is entitled under the law of Western Australia to medical expenses to the amount of ##£##100, as compared with the maximum of ##£##25 proposed under this bill, the Government should consider the advisability of making the Commonwealth law in this matter conform to that of the State. The amount to be paid by the employer would depend on the nature of the injury; it would not necessarily bc ##£##100. I hope that the Assistant Minister will accept the amendment. </para>

In Europe, where there is little or no provision for compensation, the employees are exposed to greater risks than are Australian seamen. I agree with the Assistant Minister that there must be a limit to the amount payable by way of compensation, but he made no attempt to explain what the limit should be. He did not set out to prove that the limit has been reached at ##£##25. According to the Assistant Minister, the medical profession is likely to take an unfair advantage of legislation fixing a higher maximum. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable senators opposite may not realize that the Opposition is not asking that the amount to be paid to an injured seaman shall necessarily be ##£##100. We on this side ask only that the hands of the Minister shall not be tied by a limit of ##£##25. In cases of severe injury, unavoidable incidental expenses might make a limit of ##£##25 unreasonably low. An increase of the maximum to ##£##100 would not necessarily mean that that amount would be expended in every instance. Although ##£##25 might not be sufficient, ##£##30 might meet the situation. At a later stage, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> will move a further amendment to include other expenses, because the term ##"## medical expenses##"## does not cover charges made by druggists and chemists, or the cost of an ambulance to convey the injured person to his home or a hospital. Payments in respect  of  workmen##'##s compensation represent a tax upon employers ; the money does not come from the taxpayers generally. That, however,  is  not  a  reason for making unreasonable demands. I was astounded to hear the Assistant Minister SkY that  if  the maximum payment were increased, doctors, chemists and others would immediately increase their charges. His statement agrees with my estimate of the ethics of private enterprise. I am pleased to have confirmation  of  my views from such a trustworthy source as the Assistant Minister. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> ask the committee to treat seriously this and the other amendments which will  be  moved. The Opposition proposes to divide the chamber in respect of each of them, for it believes that the seamen  aTe  as worthy of proper treatment as are the members of  any  other section of the community. If the Assistant Minister be not prepared to accept ##£##100 as the maximum payment, he might consider a compromise at, say, ##£##50. Should he express  any  such willingness, the Opposition would be prepared to meet him. In the meantime the Opposition presses for an increase  of  the  amount  to ##£##100, in order to give greater latitude to the Minister than he now has. </para>

                        <para>. - The Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Allan MacDonald)</inline> was under  a  misapprehension when he said, that the act of Western Australia provided for a maximum payment of ##£##100 only when the injured person had dependants. I have handled  a  number of compensation cases  in  that State, and I have yet to know that the act contains any such limitation. T should like the Assistant Minister to cite the section which contains that proviso. </para>

                        <para>. - There is  a  great diversity of opinion as to the maximum amount which should be paid. In fixing the amount at ##£##25, I take it that the Government must have had some guiding principle. It would be  interesting  to know the reason for fixing the amount at ##£##25, particularly when injured public servants may be paid ##£##100. Why is it that a seaman, who follows a hazardous calling, may not receive more than ##£##25? Until we are informed exactly of the basis on which the##"## Government arrived at this maximum of ##£##25, we cannot say whether the amount is equitable or not, particularly when the Assistant Minister admits that in respect of  The  Public Service a maximum of ##£##100 is allowed in similar circumstances. The Assistant Minister might submit that any increase of this maximum would be a very heavy levy on shipping .companies. I admit that it would harshly affect the smaller shipping concerns, but not all of the shipping companies. </para>

                        <para>.- I am familiar with this class of legislation, and I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> is correct when he says that the maximum allowed under the Western Australian act is ##£##100. I remind honorable senators, however, that the insurance premium rate in that State is higher than that operating in any other State, and, probably, that is one reason why manufacturing does not thrive so readily in Western Australia as in the other States. Every honorable senator will agree that costs of this kind must inevitably increase the cost of production, and, in this instance, although the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> says that it is not a tax on the people of the Commonwealth, it will really be a tax on those who ship their goods from one State to another on coasting vessels. I have no doubt that should the companies which control 80 per cent, of the coastal shipping trade of Australia find it necessary to add this cost to freights, they will do so. I am not now discussing the equity of such action, but simply the business aspect. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Any extra cost which the companies are obliged to incur, will necessarily increase the costs of production and will, in this case, be added to freights. Any increase of production cost must be taken into consideration in this way, irrespective of the kind of business affected. We cannot get away from that fact. Therefore, any shipping company which can pass on this extra cost will do so. I should have thought that honorable senators opposite would have welcomed this measure in so far as it provides for this payment of ##£##25, whereas no amount at all has been provided hitherto. That is a distinct improvement. I quite appreciate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp##'##s</inline> suggestion that a maximum of ##£##25 will be insufficient to pay hospital fees. At the same time the Assistant Minister is incorrect in saying that the maximum is only ##£##10 in Victoria. It is now ##£##25 in that State. Our experience in Victoria in connexion with most cases of workers##'## compensation, however, is that immediately a worker is injured, he is picked up by the ambulance and taken to hospital. When special allowances are (provided for medical or other expenses, the injured man, provided that his injury was not serious, went to his medical adviser, and when the medical fees exhausted the allowance of ##£##10, and the man had not been cured, he was forced to go to the hospital, which was then obliged to give him free treatment. The medical man had already got the whole of the compensation. Perhaps this difficulty could be overcome by apportioning certain amounts in respect of ambulance, medical and hospital treatment. None of the State governments has exhibited any desire to make particular sums available in every case, and neither should this Government do so, because an unscrupulous medical adviser might be enabled to collar the lot, leaving nothing for the hospital. I have found, from personal experience, that a grave danger exists that the system will bc abused if large amounts are provided. In any case, the rates proposed in this measure will involve a good deal of money, with the result, probably, that the compensa tion premiums will have to be considerably increased. We should not attempt to  foster opposition to so humane a measure us this, which, after all, gives to the injured man the right to consult his medical adviser in respect of ordinary ailments. In this, and in other respects, it is a big improvement on any previous arrangement. </para>

                        <para>. - ##[## thought I had made clear in my previous remarks bow this maximum of ##£##25 was fixed. The maximum amounts allowed under workers##'## compensation legislation for medical and hospital treatment in the various States are - Victoria, ##£##10; New South Wales, ##£##25; Queensland, ##£##50; South Australia, ##£##20; Western Australia, ##£##100 ; and Tasmania, ##£##25. In the four last-named States, however, these amounts are applicable in cases in which death occurs, and the deceased is not survived by dependants. No such stipulation is made under this measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> suggested that the Western Australian act does not contain a provision of that kind. I refer him to that act. He will see that -the section starts with the words, ##"## Where death results from the injury##"##; and, further down, in section 3, he will find the words, ##"## if he leaves no dependants ##"##. I assure honorable senators that when I cite State legislation I am quoting from current acts. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; because under the amendment the Minister could not do these things until after consultation with the seaman##'##s medical adviser. The Minister should be unfettered in the exercise of his discretion. No such amplification as that suggested by the amendment is contained in the Commonwealth Employees Act, the New South Wales Compensation Act, or in any other of the more important State .compensation acts. The words proposed to be added by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> are not necessary or or desirable. Therefore the Government cannot accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - I direct the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to the effect on the clause of the interpolation of the words contained in his amendment. In its present form the clause makes provision for the payment of medical, surgical, hospital and other expenses to an injured seaman. The amendment would fetter the Minister in the exercise of his discretion because consultation with the seaman##'##s medical adviser would be a condition precedent to action by the Minister. In some cases there might be interminable delay if consultation with a seaman##'##s medical adviser were made mandatory. The Minister could not arrive at a decision. Furthermore, in the event of that medical adviser##'##s death, no payment could be made. The insertion of the amendment would not have the effect desired by the Leader of the Opposition; on the contrary it might, in some cases, prevent the Minister from giving the relief contemplated under this proposed new section. In the event of an accident, surgical or medical treatment would be urgently necessary. The nature of the treatment and its cost would appear in the records of the hospital or surgery where it was given, and the first duty of the Minister, in case of dispute, would be to produce the record. The addition of the words suggested by the Leader of the Opposition, might operate to the detriment rather than to the advantage of a seaman claiming compensation. The clause as drafted permits the Minister to act in whatever way he thinks fit. </para>

                        <para>. - I am interested in legal technicalities mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan, but they carry no weight with me. The Minister administering the act would be the only individual concerned in fixing reasonable compensation for hospital, surgical or medical expenses incurred by an injured seaman. We have just been told that the Minister might desire to consult certain authorities. I have no desire whatever to prevent that; but I am very definitely of the opinion that a seaman##'##s own medical adviser and the seaman himself would be in the best position to know what compensation is reasonably necessary. The suggestion that ##'##because my amendment would make it mandatory for the Minister to first consult a seaman##'##s medical adviser, it might cause delay, seems to me to be an attempt to cloud the issue. It is not right that the Minister should decide what payment shall be made without first consulting the medical adviser of the injured seaman. </para>

                            <para>- No ; but since we are considering legislation which will vitally affect the interests of seamen we should state its terms clearly, so as to avoid misunderstanding or difficulty in its administration. I approve the amendment because it would assist the Minister in determining what would be just compensation, and the interests of an injured seaman would be safeguarded. At first I thought that the clause was quite  a  reasonable one, but, after studying it carefully, I came to the conclusion that an amendment was desirable, and the best suggestion that has been made is that of the Leader of the Opposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> .T. McLachlan pointed out that a difficulty might arise in the event of the death of the medical adviser of an injured person; but, under the amendment, the injured person would not be confined to a particular doctor. The medical adviser would be the doctor selected for the purpose by the injured worker. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have submitted this amendment on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arthur.</inline> Representatives of the Seamen##'##s Union have conferred with members of the Opposition, mid, after careful consideration of the hil##]##, several proposed amendments have been circulated. The proposed new section 5b corresponds with section 12 of the Common wealth Employees Compensation Act 1930. The corresponding provision in the New South Wales act is section 16, which permits a worker to elect whether he shall take the lump sum provided for in the relevant schedule, oi whether he shall take weekly payments. Proposed new section  ob,  as it now reads, limits a seaman##'##s  right to compensation to the amount specified in r lie second column of the third sc##'##hedule in respect of each listed injury, less any amount received by the seaman under the first schedule. We do not know of any case which involved consideration of the question whether a worker covered by section 12 of the Commonwealth act was limited to the amount so specified, even in a case where the weekly payments might, or would have, exceeded such amounts. The section is, however, open to that construction, and, for that reason, and for the purpose of definitely conferring a right of election on n seaman, we suggest that the words mentioned should be added. </para>
                    <para>An anomaly might arise if the proposed new section means what we believe it does in its present form, inasmuch as the seaman might be permanently and totally incapacitated when suffering none of the injuries specified in the first column of the schedule, and in that event his right to (receive .weekly payments would not be exhausted when he received payments aggregating ##£##750. The seaman who is permanently and totally incapacitated by reason of his having sustained one or more of the injuries specified in the first, column of the third schedule would be limited to ##£##750. That schedule corresponds with the third schedule to the Commonwealth Employees##'## Compensation Act. If also corresponds to a great extent to the schedule contained in section 16 of the Workers##'## Compensation Act of New South Wales. Attention is drawn to the fact that the injuries in respect of which ##£##750 is-specified as the amount payable almost certainly involve total and permanent incapacity. These remarks have particular application to the position which arises where such injuries are suffered, because, if the injured seaman has not the right to accept weekly payments, he , cannot recover more than ##£##750. Accordingly, it  i3  submitted that the words ##"##if the seaman so elects ##"## should be inserted in the proposed new section 5b, having particular regard to the fact that ##£##750 does not appear to be sufficient compensation for a seaman who is permanently and totally incapacitated. The advisers of the Seamen##'##s Union, in collaboration with several members of the Opposition, have examined practically every detail of the bill, and this amendment is regarded as a particularly desirable one. </para>

                        <para>. - During my speech on the second reading of the bill, I explained that the purpose of the proposed new section 5b is to provide certain improved allowances in respect of definite and specified injuries. I indicated that a seaman who had lost the index  finger of his right hand might receive, through weekly payments, in respect of such injury a relatively small sum which was not in any degree commensurate with the disability which he would suffer for the rest of his life. Under the proposed amendment, he would receive a lump sum payment of ##£##150. If the seaman were given the option to elect to have a lump sum in preference to weekly payments, it is conceivable that such election might act detrimentally to his own interests, or the interests of his dependants. For example, a seaman who lost a leg would, under the provisions of the proposed new section 5b, be entitled to receive, by way of compensation, a lump sum of ##£##600. If, having the right to elect to accept a lump sum payment of ##£##600, he did not do so, and later was unfortunate enough to die from some cause not associated with the accident, or bc killed in a street accident, the weekly payments would cease on his death, and his dependants would be the losers. The seaman concerned might have drawn his weekly payments for a relatively short period. In the interests of both the injured seaman and the shipowners who are required to meet the liability, it is considered that the payment of definite sums in respect of specified injuries is most desirable. For those reasons, I cannot, accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.  -  This is an amendment on which the Opposition is particularly keen. The proposed new section as it stands is exceptionally dangerous. It provides that  a  man who incurs an injury to his arm by which he is totally and permanently incapacitated, may get compensation to the limit of ##£##750. If he loses his arm he can get only the scheduled sum, although he may be permanently and totally incapacitated. As a matter of fact, the employer might benefit if the amendment is accepted, for an employee might elect to accept weekly payments. In its present form, the proposed new section is particularly dangerous to the injured seaman, because he has no option. All that Ave ask is that the simple words ##"##if the seaman so elects ##"## shall be inserted. After .all, the seaman is the person who is injured, and, therefore, the person most concerned. Under this legislation he will be given certain rights. We ask that he shall be the person to say which of the benefits he will accept. I emphasize that these amendments are the result of close collaboration with the representatives of the seamen. Unless the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Allan MacDonald)</inline> can show that serious harm would follow the acceptance of the amendment, I ask him to accept it. </para>

                            <para>- If honorable senators will study the third schedule to this bill they will see that it corresponds to the third, schedule of the Commonwealth Employees##'## Compensation Act and also to the schedule contained in section 16 of the Workers##'## Compensation Act of New South Wales. I draw attention to the fact that an injury in respect of which ##£##750 is specified as the amount payable almost certainly involves total and permanent incapacitation. The provisions of the third schedule have particular application to the position which arises where certain injuries are suffered, because if the injured seaman has not the right to accept weekly payments he cannot recover more than ##£##750. The Opposition asks that the words ##"## if the seaman so elects ##"## shall be inserted in the clause, having  particular regard to the fact that ##£##750 does not appear to be sufficient compensation for a seaman who is permanently and totally incapacitated. We do not ask that he shall get either one or the other, but that he shall have the option to say whether he will accept the amount specified in the schedule, or prefers to take weekly payments during his incapacity. The limit is ##£##750, but the amount may be less than the specified amount if the injured seaman goes back to work of any kind. </para>

                    <para class="block">Australia - Assistant Minister) ##[##5.34##]##. - The principal act contains no schedule of disabilities in respect of which compensation is payable. This measure is designed to rectify that position by definitely specifying the disabilities in respect of which a seaman will be entitled to compensation, and the amount of compensation payable in respect of each specified injury. Henceforth, he will know what amount he will be entitled to in respect of an injury, and his employer will know exactly what he will have to pay. If the proposed amendment be adopted, a claimant may do himself, and his dependants, a very grave injury by electing to accept his compensation in weekly payments. I cited, for instance, the case of a man who loses an index finger. Under the schedule embodied in this measure he would be entitled to ##£##15.0 compensation, but if he were enabled to elect to take his compensation in weekly payments, and did so, say, at the maximum rate of ##£##3 10s. a week, and, as is usually the case with injuries of this kind, he recovered within ten weeks, he would receive only ##£##35 instead of ##£##150. I repeat that it will be in the interests of the seamen themselves to reject the amendment. </para>

Immediately he accepts his compensation in a lump sum he will have no further claim in respect of that injury.

                            <para>- The only benefit an injured man would receive under this amendment would be that he would be given the option of taking his compensation in a lump sum or in weekly payments. He is asking for that option. I point out that such an option is allowed under the Workers##'## Compensation Act of Western Australia.##'## As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays suggests, a man might be foolish to elect to take his compensation in a lump sum. Nevertheless, the seamen desire the right of making that choice, and should a man make a mistake it would be his own fault. A man, on recovering from an injury, might be unable to carry on his occupation as a seaman and might desire to purchase a small business. In such circumstances he would naturally elect to take his compensation in a lump sum. The Government has no reason to reject the amendment, particularly as it is a definite request by the seamen themselves. It would involve no extra cost to the employers. </para>

                        <para>. - From <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser##'##s</inline> remarks T gather that, under the amendment, it is intended to give an injured seaman the right, at any time during the period of his injury, to elect whether he will take the balance of his compensation in a lump sum, or continue to take it in weekly payments. Such a request is unreasonable. Apparently, it is proposed that if an injured man had been receiving ##£##3 10s. a week for six months he would elect to take the balance of his compensation in a lump sum. </para>

                            <para>- Such a provision would defeat the real purpose of this measure, which is to clarify the position generally hy specifying amounts of compensation to be payable in respect of specific injuries. To my mind any man who elected to take his compensation in weekly instalments instead of in a lump sum would do himself an injustice. The amendment instead of clarifying the position would merely continue the old practice of making assessments in respect of each injury. </para>

                    <para>Should a seaman lose a limb he would be entitled to the ##£##600 specified in the schedule, but should he merely injure it and be incapacitated sufficiently long he would be entitled to weekly payments up to ##£##750. In the Queensland act it is definitely laid down that, ##"##Nothing in the schedule shall limit the amount payable during total incapacity except the maximum amount payable under this act ##"##. The maximum amount payable under that act is ##£##750. Under this bill, should a seaman lose a limb in the course of his employment he would be entitled either to ##£##600 or to weekly payments amounting to ##£##750, and after that, he could not receive any more. Surely it would be fair to allow the seaman to elect whether he would accept  a  lump sum or weekly payments ? He would have to decide whether he would take ##£##600 in a lump sum or receive weekly payments. It has been suggested that such a right of choice might be injurious to  a  seaman ; but on the other hand it might benefit the employer. </para>

                            <para>- Surely it would not be dangerous to give an injured seaman the right to elect what he should do. I know of numerous cases in which the injured person has sought a lump sum and the employer has informed him that as his condition is improving he will soon be able to resume work. On the other hand the employer may inform the employee that as his condition is not likely to improve he should draw the money in a lump sum. All that I want to ensure is that in such cases a seaman should have the right to elect which of these courses he would adopt. I know that he could not have it both ways. </para>

                        <para>. -  This position is somewhat complicated, and I am rather inclined to agree with the Leader of the Opposition that if an injured person is given the right to elect it may not really amount to much. According to the proviso an injured person cannot receive more than ##£##750, and I am afraid that if this legislation is not considered carefully we may do something injurious to seamen. As the Assistant Minister has promised to re-commit this clause I suggest that he ask the Crown Law authorities to examine the position because it is not quite so simple as some suggest. If the amendment were withdrawn, temporarily, it would also give the Leader of the Opposition an opportunity to study the proposal further. The bill expressly provides that ##£##750 shall be the maximum amount payable, but if this legislation be carefully studied, and read into the principal act, it may be found that the position is not as some suggest. </para>

                        <para>. -  A few moments ago I interjected that the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition might he dangerous in that it would enable an injured seaman, should he  so  desire,  to  forgo his claim to the difference between ##£##600 and ##£##750. A seaman would, in the first stages of his injury, be entitled to claim the amount specified in the first schedule which may involve a total PaY.ment of ##£##750. Should the amendment be agreed to, an injured worker would have the right to elect whether he would accept a lump sum payment of, say, ##£##600 before he had recovered from his injury. Does not the existing act provide for a lump sum payment in the event of the loss of a finger, foot, arm, or eye, as provided in the third schedule of this bill? In most workmen##'##s compensation legislation provision already exists whereby a worker has a legal right to demand a lump sum payment of the compensation to which he is entitled. I understand that there is no such provision in the Seamen##'##s Compensation Act. </para>

                        <para>. -  There appears to be some misunderstanding concerning the effect of the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings).</inline> The bill provides that weekly payments shall be made in respect of certain injuries. Should the injury be one of those specified in the third schedule, a fixed lump sum payment will be made, and the claimant will have no option. Should the injuries not come within that category the employee must accept a weekly payment. In both cases a limit is fixed. The fixed amounts are in respect of certain injuries shown in the third schedule. The weekly payments provided in the first schedule must not exceed ##£##750. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the claimant should have the option. A man who has been injured in. such a way that he cannot follow his usual avocation may wish to receive compensation in a lump sum. in order to enable him to purchase a small business. Should he wish to do so, the cash would be available to enable him to make a fresh start. On the other hand, should he be a married man with a family, it might suit him better to accept weekly payments. I believe that there is a lot of merit in suggesting that there should not be a hard-and-fast rule, because under both schedules the maximum is fixed. In some instances it would be rather dangerous to give a claimant the right to draw a lump sum. An injured married man might be requested by his wife to accept weekly payments in order to ensure that there shall be a regular income at least for a time. Should a claimant have no alternative but to accept a lump sum payment, if addicted to alcohol, he might spend the lot in hotels, and leave his family stranded. It is rather dangerous to compel a claimant to take his compensation in a lump sum, and I suggest that he be allowed to take it in instalments, or what is even better, that he have the opportunity to elect the way in which it shall be paid. </para>

                        <para>. -  There is not the danger in my amendment that some honorable senators suggest. The real danger is that a claimant under the third schedule must take, say, ##£##600, in a lump sum because the bill provides that such payments shall be made in accordance with the third schedule. Our desire is to safeguard the interests of an injured seaman by affording him the option of accepting a lump sum as compensation or continuing to draw weekly instalments until the total amount payable under the first schedule has been exhausted. Although I do not follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson##'##s</inline> reasoning, I agree with his conclusions.##"## This proposed new section will be a danger unless the words which we propose should be inserted are inserted. </para>

It is possible that, under the amendment, a man might elect to accept something less than he could otherwise receive under the third schedule.We say that if an injury results in total incapacity, the injured seaman should be given the option of weekly payments until he exhausts the proposed lump sum provided in the third schedule. </para>

                            <para>- If the words ##"##or death ##"## were retained, the rights of seamen would be unduly limited. If an employee, who contracted a disease in January , and became incapacitated about November of the same year, made application for compensation, and proved that the disease had been contracted within the previous twelve months, he would have the right to draw compensation. If, after receiving compensation for a few months, he died in the following March, his death would have occurred fifteen months after the date when the disease had been contracted, and, because of that fact, his dependants would receive no compensation. That is one interpretation of the proposed new section as drafted. I understand that the Crown law authorities state that it is immaterial whether the words ##"## or death ##"## be retained or deleted; therefore, I ask the Minister to accept the amendment. </para>

I wished to give the Acting Minister an opportunity to explain his proposal really, but I shall now give to the Senate my interpretation of it. If agreed to, the proposed new section will mean that in no circumstances will an injured seaman be entitled to receive more than ##£##750. Under the existing legislation, an injured seaman may continue to collect his weekly amount as long as his incapacity lasts. Under the Minister##'##s proposal payment will cease after ##£##7.50 has been paid, even though the seaman is still incapacitated. Naturally, the Opposition is opposed to the proposed new subsection, because it takes from the injured seaman rights which ho now possesses. </para>

Under the Seamen##'##s Compensation Act, compensation must be paid to an injured seaman even though the employer has not in any way been negligent. That is an extraordinary liability to place upon an employer. As the Acting Minister says, it is imperative that there shall be some limit, otherwise a perfectly innocent employer, who had in no sense been  negligent, might be forced into bankruptcy because, a seaman in his employ had unfortunately been injured or become sick. </para>

                            <para>- I can assure the honorable senator that if there were no limit to the employer##'##s liability, great difficulty would be experienced in insuring employers at all. Insurance companies will insure employers against negligence, for the reason that they know that employers take steps to ensure that there shall be no negligence. Similarly, they will insure when there is a limit to their liability. The suggestion that there should be no limit to the liability of the employer, even though he has not in any sense been negligent, is unthinkable. I support the contention of the Assistant Minister that there must be some limit in this respect. There is no limit where negligence is proved. If an employer has been negligent, he must answer for the consequences ; but for an innocent man to have an unlimited liability placed upon him would be unjust. </para>

                        <para>.- I cannot understand why this amendment was introduced at this late hour, especially when it covers an aspect of insurance which was not discussed with the representatives of the men most concerned. I have a recollection of an arbitration award giving full compensation rights to men who were injured, or became ill after signing on or after leaving port. I confess that I do not like the idea of limiting to ##£##750 the amount payable to an injured man by way of compensation. As has been pointed out, a seaman would not need to be ill for very many months before he exhausted the maximum of ##£##750. I should like the Assistant Minister to take this opportunity to explain the relationship between the provisions of the Navigation Act and those of this legislation, so far as they deal with privileges and benefits to seamen. </para>

                        <para>. -  There, is quite a close relationship between the privileges provided for seamen under the Navigation Act and those provided under this compensation legislation, but a considerable time would be required to deal with thai: relationship in detail. In any case, it is not material to the consideration of this measure. At the moment we are discussing a proposed new section, which fixes the maximum compensation payable at  ##£##750,  and, in doing so, we are only following the usual practice in workers##'## compensation legislation. Each State act fixes the maximum amount of compensation payable. Therefore, there is nothing novel in this amendment. It is not very involved, and, I submit, honorable senators will be well advised to adopt it, in order to enable the industry to know exactly to what it  ia  committed under this measure. </para>

                            <para>- In that case, the argument advanced by honorable senators opposite that the fixation of a maximum in excess of ##£##750 would involve the bankruptcy of many employers is merely a quibble. If an employer insures his employees against accident, he will have no difficulty in providing a greater measure of compensation. On this point, honorable senators opposite, apparently, are again endeavouring to mislead the committee. I suggest that the Government should not proceed with the amendment proposed by the Assistant Minister. </para>

                    <para>Another point concerns the position of seamen in New South Wales who might meet with an accident which would entitle them to the maximum amount of compensation. Would such men, because they happened to be seamen, be deprived of a measure of compensation equal to that to which other workers in that State are entitled under the State Workers##'## Compensation Act ? That point is uppermost in my mind. I cannot believe that honorable senators opposite are of opinion that the sum of ##£##750 is a fair amount to fix as the maximum compensation payable to an employee who is permanently incapacitated through accident. I prefer to believe that, as was the case when they opposed the Opposition##'##s amendment to increase the medical allowance from ##£##25 to ##£##100, they are merely supportingthe Government on this point because they regard it as a matter of Government policy, and are, therefore, bound to support it. I urge them to abandon that attitude on this occasion. In view of the fact that the maximum compensation payable under the Workers##'## Compensation Act of New South Wales is ##£##1,000, it is unreasonable to fix the maximum under this measure at. ##£##750. One would expect the Government to specify an amount at least equal to that prescribed under the act of New South Wales. Indeed, it could reasonably be expected to fix it at a greater amount, say, ##£##1,250. Honorable senators opposite have an opportunity to extend a measure of social justice to the seamen by supporting their claim -for a greater maximum. The Government has also acted unfairly towards the seamen, I suggest, in proceeding with this measure without giving them and their legal advisers an opportunity to peruse the amendments now being proposed. </para>

It is of vital importance to the seamen that, in respect of total incapacity, a maximum amount of compensation should not be fixed, and the action of the Government in limiting the amount at ##£##750, is grossly unjust. This amendment was not circulated sufficiently early to enable us to submit it to thos.e who are watching the seamen##'##s interests. If the Government fixes the maximum amount of compensation to be payable in the event of total incapacity at ##£##750, the seamen will have little for which to be thankful. </para>

                        <para>. - I may inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> that I know exactly what the proposed new section means, and I. have already explained it. It definitely fixes the maximum amount of compensation payable to an injured seaman. The amount provided in the bill, which has not been selected at random, is an average of the maximum amounts provided in various State workmen##'##s compensation acts. New South Wales provides a high maximum amount, whilst other States, such as Tasmania, provide a lower amount. There is no ambiguity about the new section, and I deny the assertion of some honorable senators opposite that the legal advisers of the seamen were unaware of this provision, because the third schedule, in which the maximum amount is provided, has been available for some weeks. During my second-reading speech I distinctly stated that the debate on the bill would be adjourned in order to give an opportunity for interested parties to study its provisions, and, if they felt aggrieved concerning the benefits provided, to submit suggestions. The proposed new section is practically the same as that which appeared in the bill when ##"##it was first circulated, and the representatives of the seamen and other interested parties were aware that the maximum amount of compensation to be payable under this measure would be ##£##750. I have already mentioned the benefits to which seamen are entitled under the Navigation Act, and I may now state that where such benefits are not included in the Seamen##'##s Compensation Act, seamen will not be deprived of any privileges. They cannot, however, expect to claim for an injury or disability under both acts. If a seaman wishes to be protected under the Seamen##'##s Compensation Act he must elect to remain under that act.  His  privileges under the Navigation Act aro in no way interfered with by this legislation. In most cases, the privileges under the Navigation Act have no relation whatever to the  assistance proposed to be afforded under this bill: <inline font-style="italic">i</inline></para>

                        <para>. - I trust that the Assistant Minister understands that the Opposition has no desire to impede the passage of the bill, but there are certain principles for which we have to fight. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> said that we cannot deprive the seaman of his right at common law. That may be so until he accepts compensation under this legislation, but as Boon as he does so his common law rights disappear entirely. The Assistant Minister has said that##'## the Government has taken an average of the maximum amounts payable in the various States. That may be all right from the standpoint of the Government or an employer, but the injuries of seamen cannot be averaged in the same way. Under the bill as originally drafted the weekly payments to an injured seaman would continue so long as he was incapacitated; but should the proposed new section be adopted, a seaman who  became paralysed or blind, a fate worse than death, would not be able to get compensation in excess of ##£##750. This is a matter upon which the Government will not give way, but the Opposition intends to oppose the amendment with all the strength at its command. If our amendment be not accepted we  shall  resist the passage of the bill to the last division. </para>

                        <para>.- The crux of the discussion is that instead of this being a measure from which the seamen are to gain an advantage, it will adversely affect them in many ways. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Eraser</inline> has said, the Navigation Act gives certain specified benefits to seamen. If a seaman is insured and is injured in the course of his employment he receives compensation equal to his usual weekly wage until one week after he recovers. Under this measure the maximum payment will be ##£##750. All the shipping companies are protected through insurance with powerful companies which we are not obliged to protect. They all seem to be carrying on quite satisfactorily without special protection from this Parliament. If this measure be passed without our amendment an injured seaman may receive the maximum amount as compensation, and after it has been spent he will ##'## look to ##'## the Commonwealth for an invalid pension. Therefore, the bill merely proposes to remove the burden of compensation for injuries received by seamen from insurance companies, which can well afford to carry it, and place it upon the people of the Commonwealth. It is the duty of this Parliament to safeguard, first the interests of injured seamen, and secondly, the people of the Commonwealth, leaving the insurance companies to fend for themselves. Recent figures  show that these insurance companies are extraordinarily wealthy and need no protection. We do not approve of a statutory maximum of ##£##750 as compensation for injuries received. We do not think the limit should be even ##£##1,000. We contend that the benefits conferred upon seamen by the Navigation Act should not be prejudiced by this measure. That legislation has been in operation for many years, and so far as I can gather, no insurance companies have been forced into bankruptcy as a result of it. I do not like delaying the passage of a measure such as this. I was very encouraged by the second-reading speech of the Minister in charge of the hill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Allan Macdonald)</inline> and the remarks of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay).</inline> Government supporters approved the bill, as a piece of legislation for which Australian seamen have been waiting for some years. The Government has also been helpful in accepting some amendments moved by honorable senators on this side. But now we have reached a most important section, and a united front is presented by Government supporters in an endeavour to penalize the seamen by taking away from them benefits conferred by the Navigation Act. I support the Leader of the Opposition in opposing the Government##'##s proposal. </para>

                        <para>.- The remarks made by my colleagues in opposition to the Government##'##s proposal have been very mild. Shorn of its trimmings, it contains no element of  humanitarianism.  As my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has said, no matter howlong a seaman may live in agony after an accident, he is not to receive one penny more than ##£##750. There is truth in Emerson##'##s statement that ##"## the cheapness of man is every day##'##s tragedy ##"##. Because the Government believes that seamen are cheap, it is not disposed to give to them more than they can be forced to accept. Those who are opposed to the amendment are influenced by purely mercenary motives; there is not one ounce of humanitarianism in the Government##'##s proposal. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister should not lose his temper because I am getting under his skin. If he had any humanitarianism in his make-up he would see the force of the arguments from this side of the committee. Should this amendment be not accepted, a. man who may have given the best years of his life in the maritime service will be in danger of being thrown on the industrial scrapheap if he becomes totally and permanently incapacitated through, possibly, the negligence of his employer. The maximum compensation payable Ls to be ##£##750. If the Government can satisfy claimants  with a lesser amount it will no doubt do so. The same conditions operate in respect  of  employees in other industries under our existing wage system. The unemployed do not receive more than the dole because, for the time being, they can be forced to accept it. Seamen are in precisely the same position. If they were organized to the same degree as are legal or medical practitioners, and . were receiving ##£##50 or ##£##100 a month, we should find the Government proposing to give thorn much more by way of compensation than is provided under this bill. The Government is not concerned in the  slightest  with how much disabled seamen deserve or are entitled to get. Because their labour is cheap, the maximum compensation is to be a paltry ##£##750. While posing as friends of the seamen, supporters of this measure are endeavouring to limit the amount of compensation payable. The Government should be criticized in no uncertain terms, and its supporters should not be allowed to leave this chamber with the impression that they have succeeded in gulling the Opposition into the belief that the Government, in introducing this legislation, is actuated by humanitarian motives. The Government is not willing to give to  the  seamen one penny more than the absolute minimum which they can be forced to accept. As workers##'## organizations become stronger - and they certainly will in the near future - the  Government  will find it increasingly difficult to impose on them conditions such as those contained in this bill. In my opinion, if a worker is insured he should, in the event of injury during his employment, be paid compensation equal at ##"##least to the basic wage for the  Test  of his life. He should not be forced on to the industrial scrap-heap  after  payment of a paltry ##£##750. </para>

I feel safe in saying that the intention is to supersede the Navigation Act, which has given some measure of protection to Australian seamen for so many years. The purpose of the bill is to limit the medical and other benefits given to seamen under the Navigation Act. </para>

                        <para>. - I am impressed by the repeated statements by the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Allan MacDonald)</inline> that he  is  anxious to  do  something to help the seamen; yet, under the present proposal, they would  be  deliberately robbed of benefits now  received.  Earlier in the discussion, the Assistant Minister implied that medical and hospital fees would be raised if the amount allowed under this bill for such expenses were increased from ##£##25 to ##£##100. If a serious accident occurred, and  it  would be more profitable to pay a lump sum  of  ##£##750 by way  of  compensation instead of a weekly allowance which might continue for 30  or 40  years, the medical and hospital bills might reduce that amount by ##£##200  or  ##£##250, Therefore, a permanently incapacitated employee who had a family dependent on him would be in a hopeless position if he were left with only ##£##500  or  ##£##550. Let the . Assistant Minister imagine himself  in  ##'## the position  of  such a seaman. If  we  allowed the insurance companies and  the  big shipping companies  to  get off with such a provision as that proposed  by the  Government, we should be throwing  on  the shoulders of the taxpayers a burden which should be carried by those companies. </para>

                            <para>- Many employees have returned to work a fortnight after the loss of the joint of a finger, hut, whether the period be a fortnight, a month or six weeks, the employee would, under the present law, receive only 50 per cent, of his average weekly earnings for that period. Under the amendment now proposed, the injured employee would receive a maximum amount of ##£##750. The Opposition has said that the seamen welcome the introduction of this hill, because they know that the. measure is a vast improvement on the present act. That is why the Leader of the Opposition has been instructed to support it, but now the Opposition wants to have it both ways. It not only desires the payment of a fixed sum which may be greatly in excess of the actual loss sustained by the seaman- </para>

                            <para>- If he did, that might cause loss to the seaman. As far as I am aware, the shipowners are not compelled to insure against injury to their employees. Under the act, no fixed sum is provided for, but under the amendment there would be a fixed payment which has no relation whatever to the loss suffered. The seamen have said, and rightly so, that they much prefer the payment of a fixed sum for a specified injury. That is why the Opposition sup ports this very wise proposal, but it now goes back on the whole arrangement and wants both the fixed amount and a weekly amount without a maximum. Its attitude is most unreasonable. </para>

The seamen have never said that they prefer a fixed sum, and, even if they had that would have nothing to do with the present amendment. At an earlier stage of the proceedings the Opposition asked that an injured seaman should be given an opportunity to say whether he preferred a lump sum or a weekly payment fixed in accordance with his previous earnings. The amendment provides that the injured seaman shall not, in any circumstances, be able to get more than ##£##750. The seamen have never had an opportunity to express an opinion on this proposal. We on this side, and not honorable senators opposite, represent the class to which the seamen belong. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable gentlemen opposite have not been returned to this chamber by the votes of the seamen. The Opposition is united in its determination to resist this amendment in every possible way. We know that the Government will probably. succeed in this proposal, but we are determined that the issue shall -not be camouflaged. I have worked with seamen, and I have been brought up among them. I am familiar with their daily lives, their hopes and aspirations. Let us imagine that we have before us a seaman who has been, injured through no fault of his own  oi- of  his employer, but merely in the course of his ordinary daily avocation. The seamen play an important part in the life of this nation. If some of the things that are happeing on the other side of the world wore to take place in Australia, an appeal would be made to the seamen to do a job which no other section of the workers could do. Let us take the case of one of these men who has been injured. He may not be a gentleman and he may not be well educated, but he is essential to the economic structure of the nation: Suppose that he is paralysed or totally blind. An honorable senator opposite says to him, in effect, ##"##I do not care what it costs you to get relief after your accident. I do not care how many weeks you were in hospital. I do not care what dependants you may have, or whether, as the result of your injury, the future of your family is black, indeed. All I am concerned about is that you will not get the ##£##1,000 to which you would be entitled under the New South Wales law or the ##£##800 payable in Victoria, or the ##£##750 payable in Queensland ; but you must take ##£##750 regardless of what it is worth to you, and not another penny will you receive##"##. No honorable senator on the other side of the chamber could look that seaman in the face, lying on a hospital bed, and tell him such a story as this amendment would require us as his friends to tell him. I implore honorable senators, whatever they may have done in regard to previous amendments, or whatever may be their attitude to amendments that may be submitted subsequently, not to sear their souls with the crime of being a party to this heartless proposal. </para>

After all, only ##£##5 may be awarded as expenses. In addition to the maximum payment of ##£##750 by way of compensation it is proposed to pay expenses ranging from ##£##2 to ##£##25 subject to the consent of the Minister. The Opposition desired that the amount should be ##£##100, but honorable senators opposite claimed that ##£##25 would be sufficient. I desire to know whether such payments as are made under section 5a will come out of the ##£##7.50 payable as compensation ? </para>

                    <para>The amendment seeks to provide for the payment of ##£##25 for each dependent child under sixteen years of age, in addition to the maximum compensation of ##£##750. A similar provision is already included in the Workers##'## Compensation Act of New South Wales. It is reasonable because in cases in which compensation is payable at death, the person in respect of whom it is payable had probably suffered a prolonged illness which had almost exhausted the full amount of ##£##750 before his death. Many cases of that kind are on record, and in such circumstances dependants under sixteen years of age are left without any income whatsoever. I am aware that in some cases no compensation is payable prior to death, because very often accidents prove fatal immediately. It would be very difficult, however, to discriminate between the two kinds of cases. This Parliament usually looks for precedents in support of proposals of this kind, and, as a similar provision is already in operation in the Workers##'## Compensation Act of New South Wales, that requirement is fulfilled. I do not, therefore, anticipate any objection to my amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - In mentioning the Workers##'## Compensation Act of New South Wales in support of his amendment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cunningham</inline> selected the only piece of legislation of this kind, which includes a provision similar to that embodied in his amendment. That act provides an allowance of ##£##25 for each child under sixteen years of age, but no similar provision is made in the workers##'## compensation legislation of any other State. The Government considers that no further payment, as suggested by the honorable senator, is warranted. Under this clause it is proposed to amend paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of clause 1 of the first schedule to provide for the payment of an amount of 7s. 6d. a week in respect of each dependent child under the age of fourteen years in cases where total incapacity for work results from the injury. No provision of this kind is contained in the principal act. The Government, therefore, considers that it has gone as far as it possibly can in this direction, and I regret that it cannot agree to the amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - The position is not as has been stated by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings).</inline> Under this measure we are increasing the allowance for medical expenses and burial combined, from ##£##30 to ##£##50, and under this particular clause we are adjusting accordingly the amount which covers burial expenses only. This clause has been responsible for holding up the measure for some time, because the Government desired  to  exercise the greatest care in order to ensure that the amount finally fixed for burial expenses would be reasonable. The amount of which the Leader of the Opposition complains was not fixed without careful consideration. Inquiries were made from four different undertakers in industrial districts of Melbourne, or in localities where seamen usually reside, and the quotations for  a  funeral, including a new grave, a casket, hearse, one mourning-coach, clergyman##'##s fee, and advertising expenses were: ##£##20 14s., ##£##17, ##£##15 3s., and ##£##21 5s. In these circumstances honorable senators must admit, that the amount of ##£##25 is reasonable. The ##£##30 provided in  the present  act covers medical and burial expenses, but separate provision is now being made in respect of each item.  The  best way in which to state a case is  to  state it accurately. I have done so. For these reasons the Government cannot accept the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>. - -I am not only astounded, but also horrified at the way in which  the  Government has fixed the amount at ##£##25 instead of ##£##30 as provided in the existing act. Apparently the Government sent its representatives to make inquiries from the cheapest undertakers they could discover in certain industrial areas in Melbourne, and in that way obtained what it considers a fair price for a funeral to meet the needs of an ordinary citizen. The experiences I have had in connexion with deaths in my own family, and in working-class families known to me, disclose that no undertaker is prepared to conduct a decent funeral for ##£##17 10s. The estimate includes the cost of only one mourning-coach; but the average seaman would have at least half a dozen good union comrades who would wish to attend his funeral. Seamen have to be buried, not only in Melbourne, where the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Allan MacDonald)</inline> or his departmental satellites went ##"## sticky-beaking ##"## around amongst the cheapest undertakers in order to obtain a low quotation, but also in other centres. I ask the Assistant Minister in all sincerity if he can possibly be happy in the knowledge that he has sponsored a proposal under which an unfortunate seaman is to have the cheapest and nastiest funeral that could possibly be provided. I trust that he will be fair in this matter, and accept the amendment which I have submitted. </para>

                        <para>. - I am astounded to find that the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Allan MacDonald)</inline> arranged for his representatives to make investigations in certain industrial centres in Victoria in order to ascertain the average cost of conducting a funeral. Apparently those inquiries were undertaken merely in order to give some peace of mind to large employers or insurance companies who may have to meet the cost of disposing of the body of an unfortunate seaman. Apparently quotations were obtained for the cheapest possible funerals. Does the Assistant Minister think that at the rates quoted any funeral director would supply a hearse, one mourning-coach, a good quality casket, a new grave, and meet the cost of advertising? When so-called distinguished citizens pass away, the Government provides State funerals at the expense of the taxpayers, but when a friendless seaman dies it considers the cheapest possible funeral is sufficient. Instead of providing State funerals for distinguished citizens, the Government should arrange for one of the undertakers from whom the Assistant Minister obtained quotations to conduct the burial. Seamen are quite as good in every respect as many of those for whom the Government provides State funerals. Unfortunately, I have had occasion to negotiate with undertakers in connexion with funerals, and I know of none who would carry out a burial at the prices quoted. Moreover, the price varies according to the circumstances of those with whom the undertaker is dealing. </para>

If the Minister##'##s satellites who obtained the quotations had stipulated that an oak, maple, or cedar casket had to be supplied, a much higher price would have been quoted. Apparently the Assistant Minister had his officers chasing around the slums of Melbourne in order to get the lowest possible quotations.  His  action in this respect is despicable, to say the least of it. </para>

                        <para>. -  The action of the Government in this respect is a further confirmation of the fact that it is influenced by mercenary motives. It now proposes that seamen shall be buried at pauper rates. Merely because it has been influenced by public opinion to grant a few extra pounds for medical benefits it now proposes to insult the corpse by reducing the funeral rates by a paltry ##£##5. I have read the utterances of many who are now dead and gone, but I have yet to read anything more despicable or contemptible proposed in the name of a national government than the proposal now before the committee. I have never known class bias and class distinction to be carried to such an extent. It is almost inconceivable that in these enlightened days we should revert to the dark old days when human beings were treated as cattle. The Assistant Minister must know that the amount provided is ridiculously low. </para>

I suppose the Government had in mind the possibility of a seaman being buried at sea, in which case the cost of burial would not be anything like ##£##25. The Opposition is not asking for something that is unreasonable. There is no doubt that in many parts  of  Australia the cost of a funeral would exceed the amount stated by the Minister. I hope that the Government will accept the amendment. </para>

Also, did the Minister inquire into the cost of cremation? If the Government persists in its opposition to the amendment, it is obviously considering the interests of influential insurance companies which will be called upon to pay for the funerals. </para>

                    <para>The Opposition considers it unwise  to  specify causes of dermatitis. An  employee  might contract that disease through handling the slings or trucks used by men suffering from dermatitis. ##"## Oil or grease or dust or caustic or corrosive liquids ##"## are not the only things that might cause dermatitis. If an employee contracted the disease as the result of his employment, there should be no inquisitorialprobing as to how he contracted it. </para>

I certainly think that pneumonia and pleurisy should be mentioned among the specified diseases, because seamen are very liable to them. </para>

                        <para>. - Several months ago, when representatives of the Seamen##'##s Union approached the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> and myself in regard to seamen##'##s ##'##duties and compensation, the subject of occupational diseases was discussed at length. The Minister for Commerce, being a medical man and a surgeon of prominence, immediately asked how one could determine the cause and effect of occupational diseases, and say definitely whether a disease or its aggravation had resulted from a seaman##'##s employment. It was admitted that it would be difficult to specify occupational diseases in general terms, and that is the reason why the Government has included in. the schedule only four diseases. Medical authorities have been consulted from time to time, and not one has suggested general terms suitable for inclusion in this measure, on account of the difficulty that would arise in determining specific limits of occupational diseases. There- font  I regret that the Government cannot accept the amendment. It has considered the matter from all points, and not- from the parsimonious aspect suggested by some honorable senators opposite. </para>

                        MacDONALD.They have been selected in accordance with the considered opinion . of medical men conversant with the occupational diseases of seagoing workers. Most of the diseases mentioned in the schedule were referred to by the representatives of the Seamen##'##s Union who conferred with the Minister for Commerce and myself in Sydney. The union representatives, having a good knowledge of the occupational diseases of their members, mentioned dermatitis and also pneumonia, pleurisy and other diseases which they suggested could be caused by employment in the shipping industry. I point out, however, that any person is liable to contract pleurisy. A person might contract it before becoming a seaman, or after ceasing to be one.

                        <para>. - I was sorrY to hear the Assistant Minister##'##s reply to the very reasonable amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings).</inline> He seems determined that there shall be a limit to the ailments to be specified as resulting from the occupation of a seaman. He said that a seaman could contract pleurisy on shore. Of course, a seaman could do that, and he could also contract dermatitis or any of the other diseases specified in the schedule. Seamen are not particlarly  liable to the diseases mentioned. The Opposition claims that, if pleurisy or pneumonia be contracted by such employees, they should be entitled to compensation on that account. The quarters provided for them on colliers and trawlers are by no means palatial. Rather is the accommodation such that nobody would choose to avail himself of it for a. longer period than was absolutely necessary. On such vessels men live in veritable rabbitwarrens and rat-holes. The seaman who emerges from a hot. engine-room or stands for hours on the bridge of a vessel is very liable to contract pneumonia or pleurisy, or both. If a seaman contracted such a disease on shore, his employers would probably notice that he was sick when he rejoined his ship. The men in charge of vessels are not so simple as to allow a sick man to go aboard.  Whilst  I am prepared to listen to arguments submitted on behalf of the Government, I have heard nothing from the Minister in charge of the bill to convince me that the diseases mentioned in the amendment should be omitted from the schedule. Dermatitis is merely a skin disease, and I fail to see why the Government has  qualified ##"##dermatitis##"## with the words ##"## produced by oil or grease or dust or caustic or corrosive liquids.##"## There are many ways in which dermatitis could be contracted. A steward would have no occasion to touch oil, grease, caustic or corrosive liquids, but he could easily contract dermatitis through contact with  a  passenger. That man is to be debarred from receiving compensation although the disease from which he suffers is just as serious whether contracted in one way or another. It would appear that the purpose of the fourth schedule is to limit the liability of employers and insurance companies. I believed the  Leader  of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> and the Assistant Minister in charge of the bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Allan MacDonald),</inline> when they said that they wanted to make this legislation something of which we all could be proud, an enactment that would minimize friction between employer and employee. Now it would appear that the chief object of the Government is to protect, not the seamen in whose interests the bill is supposed to have been introduced, but their employers and the insurance companies. If that be not the reason, why is dermatitis to be qualified? It is a disease which  a  ##"## seaman may contract in the course of his employment. Most skin diseases are easily contracted, so easily, in fact, that according to some advertisements, four out of every five persons are affected. If, in the course of his employment,  a  seaman who previously was free from skin disease becomes affected, ho should be compensated, lt is even more difficult to understand why compensation, is not to be paid to seamen who contract pleurisy or pneumonia, for no one will deny that they are diseases which seamen, who are exposed to all weathers, are likely to contract. </para>

                            <para>- It seems a logical conclusion. A man living under conditions such as exist on small coastal steamers is particularly liable to contract these diseases. Germs are about us wherever we go, and not least on board ship. Freedom from disease is difficult if the conditions under which men work encourage contagion. </para>

                            <para>- That may be, but the conditions of life generally on board ship are conducive to the contracting of these diseases. For instance, a fireman may leave the heated stokehold to get some fresh air on deck, and the sudden change of atmosphere may give him a chill. Should he go straight from his work to his bunk, he is no more certain to escape, because he remains in a stifling and disease-laden atmosphere. The request of the Leader of the Opposition is reasonable. Indeed, he might have asked for the inclusion of other diseases about which doubt exists. There can be no doubt of the risk of contracting pleurisy and pneumonia. If we are honest in our professed desire to help the seamen, and to compensate them for diseases and accidents which befall them while engaged in their occupation, we shall include both pleurisy and pneumonia, and not qualify dermatitis. </para>

                        <para>.  -  I suggest that any embracive clause in this bill would not be in the best##'## interests of this legislation and our desire to provide for seamen the maximum amount of compensation possible. In the opinion of medical officers, there would be extreme difficulty in associating certain diseases with the occupation of a seaman. The diseases which a seaman is most likely to contract are enumerated in the fourth schedule.  Lead poisoning is provided for because of the association of members of the crew, particularly deck hands, with lead paint. Poisoning by benzol or its homologues is included for the reason that benzol is used as a fuel in certain internal combustion engines which may occasionally be used in shipping. Provision is made in respect of poisoning by carbonmonoxide, owing to the fact that carbonmonoxide is the chief harmful constituent of exhaust gas from internal combustion engines, whether of the Diesel type or driven by lighter fuel. Moreover, leaks in the exhaust system of motor ships may affect seamen. Dermatitis, produced by oil or grease or dust, or caustic or corrosive liquids, is provided for because a chronic inflammatory condition of the skin of ##"## oilers ##"## or ##"## greasers ##"## of motor ships is fairly common. Caustic or corrosive liquids may be used in cleansing metal on a ship, or may be handled in the cargo. Any inflammation of the skin as a result of these liquids would be included. Various types of dust, such as cement, may be handled as a cargo, and cause skin disease among seamen. Such cases also would come within the scope of the proposed new section 5c. As regards the general application of pneumonia, rheumatism, pleurisy and other respiratory diseases,- the highest medical opinion is that it would be difficult to regard them as industrial diseases. It would be a simple matter for a seaman to contract pleurisy, pneumonia or rheumatism while on shore: and several days later, when the disease made itself manifest at sea, it would be difficult to say that it had, or had not been contracted while the seaman was following his occupation. For these -reasons the Government, on medi cal advice, has decided to restrict the fourth schedule to the diseases mentioned therein. </para>

                        <para>. - The medical profession has not found it difficult to associate certain diseases with mining where men work in an impure atmosphere. In consequence of the liability of miners to contract certain diseases, legislation has been enacted to make compulsory the provision of proper ventilation. Similar legislation has been passed in respect of certain phases of sea-faring life. Any one who has experience of life on hoard ship knows that stewards are not housed under the same favorable conditions as apply to first-class or even second-class passengers. Pleurisy and pneumonia are common diseases among stewards. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> said that on small coastal vessels the accommodation provided for seamen is far from satisfactory. Those conditions apply also on large steamers. Many stewards scarcely see the sun for days; they are below deck where the ventilation is imperfect. When his work for the day is finished, a steward goes to his ##"##gloryhole ##"##, where be may be associated with men suffering from various diseases, not to a degree sufficient to prevent them from working, but still sufficient to infect others. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> referred to a fireman coming out of the stokehold into the cold air and contracting a chill. One can understand medical practitioners in the pay of the insurance companies saying that it is difficult to associate certain diseases with specific occupations; but if these men were economically free to give their honest opinions, instead of being afraid of losing their livelihood, they would express different opinions. </para>

                            endeavoured to convince honorable senators on this side of the conditions under which ships##'## stewards work and live. I am quite sure that he has not convinced himself that what he said was correct. He would lead us to believe that he speaks from experience, but honorable senators generally will take with a grain of salt his account of the conditions under which stewards live. He suggested, for instance, that working conditions on board ship are not controlled in any shape or form, whereas the honorable  senator himself must know that, due to the provisions of the Navigation Act, Australian seamen and stewards enjoy conditions superior to those under which seamen in any other port of the world are obliged to work. The Navigation Act, which has been in operation for about twenty years, also lays down standards of accommodation to be provided for seamen and stewards. The honorable senator obviously knows nothing about the subject at all. If he did, he would know that, on passenger ships, stewards perform much of their work in the saloons and enjoy the same fare as the passengers.  The Navigation Act specifies the minimum cubic area of space which  must  be provided in cabins used by the ship##'##s crew. Employees, through their able representatives, can air before their union or in the Arbitration Court any complaints which they may have. The honorable senator should not indulge in such flapdoodle. He may convince the man in the street with such  tarradiddles,  but, I suggest, honorable senators will completely discount his remarks. He should leave it to union leaders among honorable senators opposite, who are better qualified to do so, to speak on behalf of these employees. The honorable senator, by his remarks, proved that his knowledge of seafaring conditions is antiquated.

Any one who has any knowledge of the conditions under which seamen are obliged to work will admit that they are more liable to contract pleurisy and pneumonia than are workers in any other occupation. I trust that the amendment will be supported by at least some honorable senators opposite. </para>

The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of yesterday stated that the Australian Broadcasting Commission proposes to bring a number of overseas artists to Australia; but I contend that the money to be expended in that way should be used to train promising Australian artists, many of whom are highly qualified. The ex-Postmaster-General, in opening the annual convention of the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations, said - </para>

                        <para>I regard as a serious deficiency in the programmes of commercial broadcasters the absence of items calculated to make Australia and its culture and achievement better known to radio listeners. Commercial stations are doing very little to foster an Australian sentiment. Truly Australian programmes would be far more acceptable than some of the records from overseas. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">As records made by prominent overseas artists are brought to Australia for broadcasting purposes there is no need to pay unnecessarily high fees to induce the artists themselves to visit Australia. The records provide all that is required. Even the ex-Postmaster-General, who declined to give me a definite reply to my question, said that commercial broadcasting stations are doing very little to foster Australian sentiment. The Australian people have a right to know the fees paid to visiting artists, whether they were popular with the Australian people, and whether their concerts were a financial success. This Government will not be in office indefinitely, and when a change of government occurs we shall be able to ascertain the actual fee paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Tauber and other artists engaged by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </para>
