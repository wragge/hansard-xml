                        <para>- Has the attention of the Leader of the Senate been directed to a statement made at the meeting of the Sydney County Council on the 1st November by Councillor Cramer, who, in discussing the proposed additional expenditure of ##£##46,000 on the Bunnerong Power House, Sydney, said that the Council was merely making another target for enemy aeroplanes? Has the Minister##'##s attention also been drawn to a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Butters on the 2nd November that a single authority for the control of power sources and their distribution should be created ? Will the Minister, in the interests of national defence, and the security of established industries and transport, urge upon the Government the necessity for decentralizing power units, and when making additions to power units, taking into consideration the suitability of western New South Wales as a less vulnerable area, particularly as the cost of coal there would be reduced by one-half, owing to the saving of freight charges? </para>

                        <para>- My attention has been directed to the specific case to which the honorable senator has referred. Most of the undertakings which the honorable senator has in mind fall within the jurisdiction of the States ; but, from my personal contact with the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> and my knowledge of his policy, I am sure that he will take all the factors mentioned into consideration. He has not overlooked the importance of the various activities of his department being carried on in localities which are the least exposed to enemy attack. </para>

 <para> So far as I am aware, no representations have been made by or on behalf of the aerial medical services for a rebate of tax on petrol. Experience in the past has shown that exemption from the tax in  the  case  of  petrol used for specific purposes is subject to such serious administrative difficulties as to render this course impracticable. Assistance has, however, been granted  to the  aerial medical services by way  of  a subsidy  of  ##£##5,000 per annum. </para>

                        <para>. - I believe that your ruling, sir, was given in good faith; but it does not necessarily follow that it was in strict accordance with the standing order. The words ##"## motion without notice ##"## mean exactly what they say. They imply that a motion may be moved without previously informing any one of the action proposed to be taken. I believe that that interpretation of the Standing Orders would be accepted by all competent authorities. You, sir, have stated that your ruling is in accordance with previous rulings, and I agree that it is, but that does not make it correct. We have no right to place upon the Standing Orders a construction that was never intended. The Standing Orders must be interpreted as they would be by competent authorities. When a ruling is challenged, the Standing Orders must be adhered to. If a procedure which is not in conformity with the Standing Orders is not challenged proceedings are more or less conducted under  what are known colloquially as ##"##Rafferty##'##s rules ##"##. In such circumstances feelings are aroused and senators are prone to act contrary to their better judgment. Standing Orders have their origin in the practices, experiments and consultations of the past; they should represent the sum of parliamentary experience and once they are adopted they should not be departed from without the consent of honorable senators. I regret the position which has arisen at this juncture, but I feel that your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> should be challenged, other-##'## wise we should not know exactly where we stood should similar circumstances occur in the future. Allowance must be made for the fact that after all honorable senators are only members of this chamber temporarily; they come and go at election time. It is not fair that new senators, particularly those who have been accustomed to a very hard and exact school, should, after reading one thing in the Standing Orders, find out that in practice theStanding Orders are not invariably applied. This anomaly may suit the convenience of older members of the Senate who are fully aware of what might be termed the ##"## unwritten law ##"## in respect of the Standing Orders, which has been applied on this occasion to the detriment of honorable senators on this side. In order to avoid a repetition of the present position, I believe, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that your ruling should be challenged. For that reason I support the motion. </para>

                        <para>. -  I support the motion. I suggest that in giving your ruling, sir, you should have informed honorable senators forthwith of the actual precedents on which you relied. It may be, for instance, that the rulings to which you have just referred were given in circumstances entirely different from the present. I trust that in future when rulings are given in similar circumstances the precedents on which the Chair relies will be immediately explained to honorable senators. </para>

                        submitted that in order to comply with Standing Order 64 the Leader of the Opposition in proposing his original motion, should have stated a day or hour for the adjournment other than that fixed for the next ordinary meeting of the Senate. Such a provision was impracticable in this instance, because the Leader of the Opposition wanted to secure the adjournment until the debate on the motion of want of confidence in the House of Representatives is concluded; as that debate is still proceeding no one is able to fix such a time. I cannot help feeling that whenever the Leader of the Opposition proposes to adopt a procedure which is not  palatable to the Government, some obstruction is raised to defeat his purpose. It is all very well for the Leader of the Senate to smile, but it was very patent to me that when he urged the  President  yesterday to rule the motion out, of order he was seeking to delay the matter, because he thought that the Government did not then have sufficient numbers to defeat the motion. In fact the Leader of the Senate resorted to subterfuge in this connexion. I should not attempt to pit my knowledge as a layman against that of the Leader of the Senate who is a legal man, but J strongly object to his attempts to mislead honorable senators on this side on what is, after all, a technical detail of procedure. So far as I can see the Leader of the Opposition, in drafting his motion, conformed fully with Standing Order 64.

Every honorable senator who was here yesterday knows that the Postmaster-General had as much to say as I had, both on the point of order and on the motion of dissent. However, the point is not how much he had to say, but that he made a speech. He was as prominent in the discussion as I was. </para>

I have here the proof of the official report, from which it will be seen that the Leader of the Opposition in moving that the ruling be dissented from spoke sufficiently long to fill nearly a column of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Then the Leader of the Senate made a few remarks after which the Leader of the Opposition continued to speak. Obviously, he had not concluded his speech, and therefore the Minister##'##s remarks must have been by way of interjection. Unless the remarks of the Postmaster-General were in the nature of interjections, the Leader of the Opposition made two or three speeches. </para>

                        <para>- The meaning of Standing Order 64 is unmistakable, and I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> that for this reason, the motion of dissent is not in order. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane,</inline> and to one other honorable gentleman opposite who shares his view, by and large, that these rulings have governed the procedure of the Senate. There is a considerable pile of bound volumes of rulings of past Presidents on the Senate table. Those decisions are available for perusal by every member of this chamber. The customary and constitutional procedure is that if the Standing Orders are silent, or if there is a doubt as to their meaning the point at issue is settled by the practice of the Senate itself. In respect of the matter now under discussion, established practice has been departed from on only one occasion. Thus the rulings of the Chair govern procedure. The Leader of the Opposition was quick to cite <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> in support of his argument in this chamber recently on the question of the relevancy of amendments. If he will read <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> carefully, he will discover that the procedure of the House of Commons has, for ages, been dictated by usage. It is always desirable to have as much clarity as possible, and I admit that there may have been room for doubt in connexion with the ruling over the trouble that took place between the Leader of the Opposition and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> on the memorable first meeting of the new Senate; but I still maintain that your ruling, sir, on that occasion, was right. I had intended, when the report of the Standing Orders Committee came before the Senate, . to deal with the history of procedure relating to formal motions for adjournment, but you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have anticipated my observations. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker, the first  President  of the Senate, gave an important ruling which has been regarded as a precedent. He laid it down that - </para>

                        <para>- He said it was the practice of the Senate and he intended to follow it. The practice of the House of Representatives is clearly laid down and differs somewhat from that of this chamber. However, the Standing Orders Committee of the Senate has already addressed itself to the problem, and has recommended an amendment to Standing Order 64, which, if adopted will have the effect of clarifying the procedure. But whatever qualifications we may find necessary to incorporate in the standing order, I emphasize that your ruling is in keeping with the practice which has been followed with only one exception for so many years. In <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> honorable senators will find a hundred and one different matters which are not specifically provided for under the Standing Orders but which are governed by usage. I submit that your ruling is right because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> has said, it is in line with the practice of the Senate for so many years, and has been the subject of pronouncements by various presidents from time to time. To depart from that practice would be to establish an extraordinarily dangerous precedent for a deliberative chamber. We must have some settled rules of practice, and this, I repeat, is one of them. On one occasion-,  President  Baker omitted to open a letter handed to him by a senator who wished to move the adjournment of the Senate.  President  Baker held that the fact that the letter had been handed to the Chair prior to the meeting of the Senate permitted the senator to proceed with his motion. </para>

                            <para>- Not at all; it merely provides the Leader of the Senate with another string to his bow. I notice that this standing order was amended on the 1st October, 1937 ; its terms are not ambiguous. As stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cunningham,</inline> the motion, in addition to being handed to the  President  in writing, must be supported by four honorable senators rising in their places. I ask honorable senators not to takenotice of the new matter that has beenintroduced in the debate. So frail is the case submitted by the Leader of the Senate that he immediately seized on the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline> Nothing in the standing order requires that the notice of motion shall be handed in at any specific time prior to the meeting of the Senate. It is clear that if the notice is submitted in writing to the  President,  and supported by four honorable senators rising in their places, the  President  must accept it. The Leader of the Government knows quite well that he has said nothing to support his argument that the standing order has the meaning which he has attached to it. That is why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> has raised the objection that the motion for the adjournment did not specify a time or hour other than that fixed for the next ordinary meeting of the Senate. I am surprised that the Leader of the Senate, after making two speeches, has subscribed to the argument advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline> He has acted in this way for a specific reason; it is because of the numbers in this chamber. </para>

                        <para>. - Every honorable senator must know that Standing Order 64 was framed to provide an opportunity for any member of the Senate to. draw the attention of the Government to a matter of urgent public importance. During the time that such a motion is under consideration, it amounts to one of want of confidence in the Government. It provides that the Senate shall adjourn until an unusual hour, and, if it were carried, the business of the Senate would be taken out of the hands of the Government. Why has the practice always been followed of requiring notice of such a motion to be given? If an honorable senator submits such a motion for the purpose of discussing a matter of urgent public importance, it is only fair to assume that it is a matter in which the Government is directly concerned. The object of requiring notice is to give a member of the Government an opportunity to prepare an answer to the criti  cism.  If honorable senators opposite were in office, it would be to their advantage, as well as to the advantage of every other member of the Senate, that the responsible Minister should have time to prepare a reply to the mover of the motion. In every British parliament, the practice is to require notice of such motions for this very purpose. I suppose that the Leader of the Opposition has no object in view other than to have the matter mentioned by him ventilated. Instead of questioning the ruling of the  President,  every honorable senator should, in his own interests, and for the benefit of the Senate as a whole, support it. Every parliament in the British Empire is, as I have said, governed by similar procedure to that which lias been adopted in this Senate, and various authorities have laid it down as the proper practice. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> referred to Standing Order 64 to support his argument that notice need not be given. The standing order refers to ##"## a motion without notice,##"## clearly meaning a motion that has not appeared on the notice-paper. The object of this standing order is not to give an advantage to the Government, but merely to give to every member of the Senate an opportunity to draw attention to matters of urgent public importance. </para>

The whole argument of the  President  himself suggested that Standing Order 64 should be broken. That Standing order lays down a certain procedure, and this has been followed by the Leader of the Opposition; but, for reasons best known to Ministers, they intend to oppose my leader in this matter. I desire to know whether you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> are compelled to take cognizance of what past presidents have laid down. Is it mandatory on you to do that, or can you use your own judgment in the interpretation of a standing order? I should say that you can exercise your own discretion. If you read the standing order carefully, without importing into it any additional words, I submit that you can come to no other conclusion than that the Leader of the Opposition is in the right. I also desire to know whether, under Standing Order 64, any day or hour must be mentioned in the written notice. The idea of the Leader of the Opposition was that the adjournment of the Senate should take place ##"## now ##"##. </para>

You, sir, have not dealt with that point, but have ruled in accordance with precedents established by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker and the late  Hon.  T. Givens, both of whom once held the position of  President  of the Senate. The rulings of your predecessors contain words which are not in the Standing Orders, and therefore they should be disregarded. No specified time is in the standing order when notice must be given. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber are only simple-minded workers, but we understand plain English. Although the procedure set out in the standing order was followed by the Leader of the Opposition, he was prevented from proceeding with his motion. I am sorry that you, sir, have been guided by the ##"## misrulings ##"##  of past presidents. You have held your present position for a comparatively short period, and I should have imagined that you would have been guided, not by rulings given by your predecessors, but by the Standing Orders. I know that it is not mandatory upon you to be governed by decisions given by persons now deceased. You have to use your own judgment, and, had you done so in this instance, I feel sure that you would have permitted the Leader of the Opposition to proceed. I support the motion. </para>

                    <para class="block">When I first took my seat in this chamber I was advised by the then  President,  Honorable P. J. Lynch, to study the Standing Orders, and I have taken the trouble to become as conversant with them as is practicable in a comparatively short time. Although a layman in matters of this kind, I can place a reasonable interpretation upon plan English. I trust that you, sir, will answer the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> as to whether the Senate is to be governed by the Standing Orders or by the rulings of past presidents. You have cited rulings contained in volumes which are not in the possession of honorable senators, and consequently we cannot be expected to have a knowledge of the rulings which have been given from time to time. When you were elected to your present position the supporters of the Government had a decided advantage in that they knew beforehand that you were to be elected  President.  That knowledge enabled <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> to hand to you, before you were elected, an intimation that he proposed to move the adjournment of the Senate to discuss a. matter of urgent public importance. The Leader of the Opposition (SenatorCollings), not knowing who was to be elected  President,  could not notify you of his intention to move the adjournment of the Senate. An honorable senator opposite should not have the right to speak when an honorable senator on this side of the chamber is prevented from doing so. The rights of members of the Opposition have not been fully protected. I believe that you, sir, have endeavoured to be impartial, but you are not infallible. We contend that you should be guided by the Standing Orders and not by precedent. The Leader of the Opposition submitted his motion because he considered it improper for the Government to proceed with business in the Senate while the fate of the Government was in doubt. Although, the Leader of the Senate said that he did not propose to deal with Government business, the debate on the exportation of iron ore, which involved an important matter of government policy, was proceeded with. As I contend that your ruling is not in accordance with the  Standing Orders, I intend  to support the motion. </para>

                        <para>. - I trust that this motion will not be debated on party lines merely because it has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition. Having been nominated to represent my party on the Standing Orders Committee, I have found the debate on this subject most interesting, and particularly the remarks of honorable senators who have had a somewhat lengthy parliamentary experience. The Standing Orders Committee dealt with the standing order under review from one viewpoint, and the recommendation which will come before the Senate later will lay down the procedure to be adopted in the future. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> is correct in his assertion that the words ##"## motion without notice ##"## govern the matter. You, sir, have stated that you propose to adhere to your ruling that notice in writing must be given before the Senate meets. Even had the motion of the Leader of theOpposition been in the form suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> it would have been ruled out of order on the ground that it should have been placed in your hands prior to the meeting of the Senate. As Standing Order 64 stands at present, the original motion proposed by the Leader of the Opposition was quite in order. It was in accordance with the standing order a motion without notice. The  President  is above party. He is not supposed to be in any way an ally of the Government.  His  duty is to see that the Standing Orders are carried out and that honorable senators as a whole receive fair play. However, if we accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays##'## contention that it is necessaryfor the  President  to be given notice of a motion of this kind some time prior to the assembling of the Senate in order that he may advise the Ministry of it, we shall place him in a false position. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know where that practice has been adopted. When discussing Standing Order 64, the Standing Orders Committee did not consider whether the  President  should be enabled to get into touch with the Leader of the Senate or the representative in this chamber of any particular Minister. The only matter considered by that committee - and I understand that  it arose as the result of the skirmish which occurred at the first meeting of the now Senate - was the question of precedence in connection with motions of this kind. </para>

                            <para>- That point was not discussed by the Standing Orders Committee. The recommendation of that committee for an alteration of Standing Order 64 deals only with the order of precedence in which notices of motion shall be dealt with, because, as we know, only one motion can be taken on the one day. The recommendation of the committee is designed solely to obviate that particular difficulty. After listening to this debate, however, I doubt whether the committee has done the right thing in making its recommendation. In this instance, there is a danger that a right which honorable senators should value highly may be taken away. If this motion of dissent be defeated, it will not be possible for any honorable senator to raise a matter of urgency unless he gives notice of his motion prior to the meeting of the Senate. The Standing Orders at present provide that certain preliminary business must be disposed of before such a motion can be proposed. They specify exactly the time, the place and the procedure. Certainly, I believe that, if members of the Standing Orders Committee had had the benefit of hearing this debate, they would not have made the recommendation for the alteration of Standing Order 64 that is contained in its report which will later be considered by the Senate </para>

                    <para>The reason given by the  President  for ruling the motion of the Leader of the Opposition out of order, is not sound. To those who are inclined to rely solely on precedent, I point out that in institutions which##'## follow this practice, such as our law courts, precedents give way to fresh rulings from time to  time. As a matter of fact the present Attorney-General came into prominence largely because of his advocacy of a case which destroyed a judgment that had stood in this country for very many years. The High Court had given a judgment which denied to employees in a State instrumentality the right to approach the Federal Arbitration Court, but through the advocacy of the present Attorney-General that decision was upset by the Privy Council. One could cite many other instances of precedents being upset in our courts. Even though judgments may be long established and musty with age they are upset by new ideas and interpretations. Therefore, I ask those honorable senators who feel inclined to vote against the motion before the Chair, and rely solely on precedent, not to do so, but to adhere to the strict wording of the Standing Order. The day may not be far distant when a Labour Government or some other government of a political colour different from that of the present Government will assume office iu this Parliament, and those in opposition may find it very necessary - and indeed a privilege - to adopt the procedure for which the Leader of the Opposition is contending this afternoon. For that reason and also because I value and appreciate the impartiality which should distinguish the pos: tion of  president  of this chamber, I should be loath to see this Senate come to a decision which will, in effect, make the  President  a messenger of the Government. I hope that this motion will be carried, in which event, I feel sure, neither the  President  nor any other honorable senator will feel hurt. This difficulty must be cleared up and now is the time to do it. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition complied with that provision. I can find no provision anywhere in the Standing Orders  that such statement must be handed to the  President  fifteen minutes or any other specified lime prior to the meeting of the Senate. Why should we not adhere to the plain English of the Standing Orders in preference to relying on rulings given by presidents in the early days of the Senate? If we are to be governed by such precedents, we should be allowed access to the secret source from which these precedents appear to be drawn. The Standing Orders Committee amended Standing Order 64 on the 1st October, 1937. Was that committee enabled to give full consideration to the rulings by previous presidents? We must conclude that that opportunity was not afforded to the committee. It is quite reasonable to rely on precedents, if they are up to date. Mention has been made of procedure in the House of Commons. If we are to rely on precedents on this occasion, we should pay attention to the invariable practice in English-speaking countries operating the bicameral parliamentary system, . namely, that the upper chamber shall not continue to conduct business while the fate of the Government is in the balance in the other branch of the legislature. I suggest that honorable senators should be consistent in their reliance on precedents. </para>
                    <para>In reading the Standing Orders one cannot but realize the difficulty caused by the legal jargon employed therein. On one occasion I took part in a discussion on the meaning of the word ##"##notwithstanding##"##, and an array of legal talent held up the business for three days in endeavouring to decide the meaning of the word. I suggest that honorable senators should adhere to the strict wording of the Standing Orders rather than rely on precedent. We should get down to common sense, ensure that our Standing Orders are set out in plain English, and adhere to them rather than be governed by what has been decided in the dead past. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not propose to discuss the motion at any length, but I should like to refer to some remarks made by Senators Sheehan and Arthur regarding procedure in this chamber so far as it relates to Standing Order 64, which, I understand, the Standing Orders Committee proposes to amend. First, I remind honorable senators that the Standing Orders Committee owes no allegiance to the Government. As far as possible, its personnel is representative of all parties, and no member of it is obliged, or expected, to allow allegiance to any particular party to influence him in the committee##'##s deliberations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> said that the proposed standing order would make the presiding officer of this chamber a kind of messenger boy, in that after he has received a notice from an honorable senator that he intends to move a certain motion, it will be necessary for him to act as an intermediary between that senator and the Minister concerned. I point out to the honorable senator that the proposed standing order will merely sanction what has been the practice of the Senate since its inception. The proposal is made not with the idea of using the  President  of the Senate in the manner suggested, but in order that the government of the day, which is responsible for the conduct of the business of the Senate, may know how its programme may be affected. In spite of the fact that their political differences may be great, it is the invariable practice for the leaders of parties in this chamber to notify . one another of their intentions in regard to each day##'##s programme. If, for instance, the Leader of the Senate proposes to make some alteration of the order of business, or desires to introduce new business, he invariably notifies the Leader of the Opposition of his intention. </para>

                            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays pointed out, when the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives gave notice of his intention to move a motion of no confidence in the Government, he handed a copy of his motion to the Prime Minister before it was tabled. That was done not only as an act of courtesy, but also in order to facilitate the arrangement of Parliamentary business. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan,</inline> as a member of the Standing Orders Committee, has given his approval to a recommendation, I hope that he will not decide to alter it. I have been a member of this chamber for over twenty  years, but I have never known of a previous instance of an honorable senator moving the adjournment of the Senate to discuss what he considered to be a matter of urgency without giving the government of the day notice of hisintention to do so. I point out that it is not the Government, but the Senate itself, which decides whether or not a matter is urgent. A motion which is supported by four honorable senators rising in their places automatically becomes one of urgency. I emphasize that the practice which it is proposed to apply in the Senate, is in the interests of the member who proposes to move the motion, because it enables the Minister concerned to obtain and supply the information desired. That procedure is more necessary in this chamber than in the other branch of the legislature, for the reason that in the Senate there areonly two Ministers in charge of departments. Each of the three Ministers here represents a number of other Ministers, and consequently it is impossible for him to be acquainted with the details of departments of which he is not in control. I hope that the Senate will not depart from the established practice - a practice which I believe has been of benefit to every section of the Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - It is not my intention to anticipate the debate which will take place when the next item on the business-paper comes before us; I shall confine my remarks to reasons why the Senate should support my motion that the ruling of the  President  be dissented from. I do not think that you require it of me, sir, but I feelimpelled to say again that I sincerely regret haying to take exception to your rulings. I do so only because of ray firm conviction that I am right and you are wrong - not that I am fair and you unfair. I claim that my interpretation of Standing Order 64 is unassailable. In passing, I may say that the Opposition will not be satisfied with the position when this matter has been dealt with in this chamber, but will have it raised in the other branch of the legislature, in order that a procedure which agrees with common sense may be adopted, and that##"## honorable senators shall not be at the mercy of the vagaries of legal minds and the tyranny of precedents. You, sir, said that Standing Order 64 is not very definite, and that it should be clarified. I am in the position that I must not - it is not a case of will not - retreat one fraction of an inch from the stand that I have taken, otherwise I shall be undone. Standing Order 64, far from being indefinite, is most definite; it lays down exactly what must be done in certain circumstances. I claim to have complied with that standing order in every particular. The Leader of the Senate referred to rulings given by Presidents Baker and Givens. If we are to be guided by their rulings, there is nothing more certain than that these Standing Orders are useless; indeed, in that event, they are worse than useless, because they are misleading to honorable senators who make a practice of studying them. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The honorable senator##'##s interjection reminds me that the Leader of the Senate made a misstatement when he said that I quoted from <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> yesterday. On the earlier occasion, however, the issue was not one of precedent. I was astounded when the Leader of the Senate referred to rulings given by Presidents Baker and Givens; I had thought that if he quoted a previous ruling at all, it would have been one more up to date. I emphasize that these Standing Orders are useless if they can be over-ridden by rulings given years ago. I am reminded that  President  Lynch emphasized the necessity for every honorable senator to become acquainted with the Standing Orders. Unless they are to be cur guide it is merely a delusion and a snare to hand a copy of them to newly elected senators with the admonition to study them. The Leader of the Senate said that to agree to my motion would be to establish a dangerous precedent. He urged me to read Standing Order 429. If it be correct that I am endeavouring to establish a dangerous precedent, why does Standing Order 429 exist at all? It reads - </para>

                            <para>- I made a note of the Minister##'##s words at the time. He could have said that to dissent from the President##'##s ruling, if it were based on past rulings, would be to establish a dangerous precedent, but he did not say that. Standing Order 429 not only allows for dissent from the President##'##s ruling, but also lays down the procedure to be followed. Unless that standing order serves some useful purpose it should be wiped out, for while it stands it merely encourages honorable senators to do things which the Minister describes as dangerous. The special pleading .of the Minister might serve its purpose in a common police court, but it will not avail in a decent deliberative assembly. I have studied the -Standing Orders and I believe that I understand them. Without egotism, I think that I can say that I am as quick of comprehension as is any other honorable senator, at least, I can see a hole in a ladder as quickly as most other men can. I have searched this book of Standing Orders from cover to cover, but I find nothing in it to say that if a standing order is in question some precedent shall be called in to buttress it. Why is it that yesterday, as on the 1st July last, I was confronted by precedents rather than Standing Orders? I ask the Leader of the Senate to deny, if ho dares, my statement that there is not in this book of Standing Orders one suggestion that any standing order may be abrogated by some ruling of a previous  President.  The thing is preposterous. It was interesting to hear the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll),</inline> in a dignified and gentlemanly way which I am sure he cannot help, quarrel with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays. From the look of amazement on the Minister##'##s face it would appear that he is not aware that he quarrelled with his colleague from Tasmania, but I assure him that he did. He said that the handing of a notice of motion to the  President  would not necessarily mean that he would pass on to the Government something which should not be passed on. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays said that the value of the ruling was that it enabled the Government to know what was going on. </para>

                            <para>-That is not so. I made a note of the honorable senator##'##s remarks at the time. It records the honorable gentleman as having said that it would be of advantage to the Government to know that a motion of want of confidence was being moved ; that my motion was tantamount to a vote of want of confidence in the Government. In its terms my motion is not one of want of confidence. It was deliberately framed to preclude the possibility of the creation of an atmosphere of want of confidence. That was decided after a party consideration of the whole business. I had drafted a motion of a very different colour and character, but realizing that we did not want in this chamber a discussion of the nature of a motion of want of confidence - we wished this matter to be taken seriously and dealt with in a proper manner in the House of Representatives - it was so redrafted that no honorable senator would have any justification whatever for regarding it as a motion of want of confidence. I invite honorable senators to read it again. It questions the-  . . propriety of the action of the Government in proceeding with the business of this chamber while a motion is  beings  debated in the House of Representatives to determine whether the Government enjoys the confidence of the said House. </para>

In the course of his remarks the honorable gentleman also frequently used the phrase, ##"## a matter of urgent public importance ##"##. I know that honorable senators get into the habit of using those words when they submit a motion for the adjournment of the Senate, because that is in keeping with the corresponding standing order of the House of Representatives. But I point out that the Senate Standing Order 64 does not say anything about a matter of ##"## urgent public importance ##"##. It mentions only the word ##"##urgent##"##, and leaves it entirely to the discretion of the senator submitting the motion- to decide whether the matter which he wishes to discuss is urgent or not. It is not necessary that the matter raised should be one of public importance. </para>

I should also like a definition of ##"##speech##"##. One of the speeches made after I moved my motion of dissent from the President##'##s ruling, occupied eleven lines in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and another occupied six lines. Such lengthy utterances cannot be regarded as interjections, because they were not made while the honorable senator speaking was sitting down. It is difficult to know just where an interjection ends and a speech begins; I contend that if a Minister orany other senator gets up, and while standing, makes a contribution to the debate, that is a speech and he should not be entitled to make another. If honorable senators are to be permitted to say as much as eleven lines by way of interjection then I promise to keep this Senate occupied for a long time by interjections. </para>

                        was particularly apt in his remarks on the question of precedents. That honorable senator asked that a vote should not be taken on the question of precedents because the Standing Orders Committee had suggested a way out of the difficulty in which we now find ourselves. As a matter of fact, the Standing Orders Committee has not proposed a way out, as I shall show when the debate on that matter takes place.. The action proposed by that committee, if adopted, will only result in a worse mess than exists at present. All our Standing Orders will be absolutely valueless unless they are interpreted with common sense, and not in accordance with rulings given a long way in the past. I was amused by

                        story of the nine legal gentlemen who debated for days the interpretation of the word ##"## notwithstanding ##"##. I was reminded of the story of a lady school teacher who wrote the word ##"##notwithstanding##"## on the blackboard and asked the children to give her a sentence containing that word. One bright lad, who no doubt had the makings of the leader of a government, said - ##"## Father has a hole in his pants, but not with standing ##"##. If legal quibbles about the interpretation of our Standing Orders are to be indulged in, and if rulings by presidents long since dead are to be cited as precedents, it will be impossibleto carry on the work of this Senate in an orderly fashion. It is useless, for instance, to cite as a precedent a ruling by  President  Baker simply because that gentleman was regarded nearly 40 years ago, as an authority on constitutional matters. We on this side refuse to bow down and worship him in 1938.

                    <para>SenatorCOLLINGS. - Moses laid down standing orders which nearly every one in this Christian civilization has been breaking ever since. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> was really amusing, and, as usual, even in his most amusing moments, he did not lose his eloquence or earnestness. That is something which unfortunately cannot bo said of some Ministers. I was glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> pointed out that in order to carry on the work of the Senate in an orderly fashion, leaders of the two parties should confer. It is only proper that we should confer on matters of procedure, but there must be no resurrection of rulings given in years gone by. While it is the hope of honorable senators on this side that negotiations can be carried on in a pleasant manner, we are not prepared to have doubtful rulings foisted upon us and declared to be sacrosanct, merely because of precedent. It is remarkable that until this afternoon, advantage had never been taken of precedents. With all respect to the  President  I hope that honorable senators will support my motion of dissent. I wish the President##'##s future course to be clearly defined so that he may be saved from pitfalls such as this. Instead of relying on precedent for guidance, the  President  should have adequate safeguard in the common intelligence of honorable senators on both sides of this chamber, and their ability to construe the ordinary everyday language in which our Standing Orders are couched. It should be left to the  President  to decide on their merits all points raised, and we on this side would be in an infinitely safer position than we occupy at this moment. </para>

It wouldbring the language of Standing Order 64 into line with the practice adopted inthis chamber hitherto, having regard to those precedents to which I alluded this afternoon as having been accepted from time to time by this chamber.

                        <para>. - I express my thanks to the Standing Orders Committee for the effort it has obviously made to overcome the difficulty in which we find ourselves; but, if ever there was failure to clarify an issue, we find it in the recommendation now before us. Instead of clarifying the issue, the standing order, if amended as now proposed, will be so confusing that we shall never be able to get out of this mess. I ask this committee to reject the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee. I have never seen such a foolish recommendation. It is supposed to be a solution of the problem with which we are confronted ; but it is nothing of the kind. The Leader of the Senate sees the difficulty, and attempted in the most clumsy manner imaginable to explain how it could be overcome. If the amendment be adopted, what will happen? If I am the offending senator, I must, at least fifteen minutes prior to the meeting of the Senate hand to the  President  the substance of the motion I propose to move. That means that the  President  will have to be present from the time I arrive at this chamber, which is usually 9 a.m., until the Senate meets, because I will be entitled to serve a notice upon him at 9.5 a.m., which##'## will be ##"## at least ##"## fifteen minutes before the meeting of the Senate. If some other honorable senator wishes to serve a similar notice ahead of mine, he will have to hand in his notice before I do so. In these circumstances I shall have to insist upon the  President  giving me a receipt for the motion, and certifying on the envelope, or on the document itself, that I delivered it to him at, say, five and three-quarter minutes past nine. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> or some other senator who may submit his notice a quarter of a minute later, will also have to obtain a receipt that he handed in his notice at that later time. That is actually the mess into which the Standing Orders Committee will get us. The Leader of the Senate has said that such notification could be handed in to the  Clerk  of the Senate; but I am not going to hand in any such notification to that official until the standing order finally adopted authorizes the clerk to receive it and to issue a receipt showing the  precise time at which it was delivered. The amendments recommended by o the committee to Standing Order 64 serve to give effect to the -President##'##s recent interpretation of that standing order. If this recommendation be adopted, there will be no doubt that a statement of a matter of urgency, which, according to Standing Order 64, must be made in writing, shall be handed in before the time fixed for the meeting of the Senate. The difficulty of fixing the time at which such statements have been handed to the  President  could be overcome by making the amendment read - </para>

                    <para>The amendments recommended by the Standing Orders Committee make it essential for the  President  to be available to receive such statements within the time prescribed. It is ridiculous that this committee should be asked to consider amendments such as those proposed by the Standing Orders- Committee. The effect of the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee is that if the Senate is to meet at 3 p.m., an honorable senator wishing to move the adjournment of the Senate must, before 2.45 p.m. hand in a notification to that effect to the  President.  That is supposed to over- nome the difficulty; but it does not do anything of the kind. The period is not limited to one quarter of an hour before the meeting of the Senate, as some honorable senators may think. An honorable senator aware of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition proposed to move the adjournment of the Senate could ##"## steal his thunder ##"## by manoeuvring  for position. The alleged Leader of the Country party, for instance, might endeavour to score a point. </para>

                            <para>- I shall do so at the proper time. Standing Order No. 64 is as clear and definite as it can be, and there is actually no need to clarify it. This afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> directed attention to the words ##"## a motion without notice ##"##. The first portion of the standing order reads - </para>

                    <para>Is it suggested that those words mean that the Senate shall adjourn until, say, 7.30 p.m., or some other time that may be specified? If that is what the standing order means the words should be in quotation marks, but nothing of the kind is intended. All the standing order provides is that if I wish to move a motion in order to debate a matter of urgency, I must do so - after Petitions have been presented and Notices of Questions and Motions given, and before the Business of the Day is proceeded with. </para>
                    <para class="block">Honorable. senators will notice that there is no full stop in the portion of the standing order which I have cited. All that the standing order provides is that a motion without notice must be made after petitions have been presented and notices of questions and motions given, and before the business of the day is proceeded with. The standing order also provides - and such Motion can be made notwithstanding there be on the paper a motion for adjournment to a time other than that of the next##'## ordinary meeting. </para>
                    <para class="block">Then there is a full stop. The standing order is so worded in order to enable an. honorable senator wishing to move a motion .to submit it at a proper stage in the proceedings. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> endeavoured to prove that it meant something else, and another honorable senator said, ##"## Of course it does, and the honorable senator would have been ruled out on that account if not for any other reason My motion was ruled out of order for an entirely different reason. The Government should realize that the Standing Orders cannot be punctuated to suit its purposes, that the Opposition is not endeavouring to employ ##"## snide ##"## tricks, and it is always prepared to fight fairly. T have asked eight or nine honorable senators, some of whom are supporters of the Government, to show me where I am wrong, and the unanimous opinion of those whom I have consulted is that I am right.

                    <para>That is a privilege I claimed on a previous occasion. The honorable senator first rising should have precedence. I am sure that the  President  will be able to detect the first honorable senator to rise. It must be remembered that after a Minister has spoken the Leader of the Opposition is entitled to the call. My amendment will have an effect opposite##"## to that recommended by the Standing Orders Committee, and should clarify the position. We should leave Standing Order No. 64 in its present form, because it is perfectly clear, but if an amendment is considered necessary, that which I have moved should be adopted. </para>

                        <para>. - I ask the committee to oppose both the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee and the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. The proposal recommended by the committee, if adopted, would not tend in any way to clarify the present position. On the contrary it would give  rise to a feeling among honorable senators that whenever a motion for adjournment to debate a matter of urgency was proposed in competition with another similar motion everything was not aboveboard. I have no doubt that, in the race to get in first, the interests of the Government would always be well looked after. My objection to the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition is that in any call from the Chair honorable senators opposite would undoubtedly fare better than honorable senators on this side. </para>

                            <para>- But he has not precedence over the Leader of the Government. I am reminded, too, that he did not receive the call before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> at the first meeting of this Senate when a skirmish arose over this very procedure. I do not propose to dwell upon that incident, except to say that I hope that we shall never witness a repetition of it in this chamber. I submit that as the result of recent discussions the interpretation of Standing Order 64, as it stands, is quite clear to every honorable senator and, therefore, it should be retained in its present form. Whilst I suspect that in respect of other Standing Orders also we may, on some future occasion, have a decision from the Chair based on precedent rather than on their text, the fact remains that we have now gone thoroughly into the interpretation of Standing Order 64 and every honorable senator must surely be conversant with its provisions. The main virtue of Standing Order 64 as it stands is that it requires that any honorable senator wishing to move a motion for adjournment in order to deal with a matter of urgency shall take action which will be entirely aboveboard and free from all suspicion of preference from any quarter. If the committee##'##s recommendation be adopted, however, honorable senators wishing to move such motions will bc obliged to hang around the President##'##s doorstep in order to get in first. Such procedure, I suggest, is not only undesirable but also unnecessary.. If the provisions of Standing Order 64 as it stands are adhered to in the light of the ruling of the  President,  a better feeling will  be  maintained among all honorable senators. Therefore I urge the committee to reject both the recommendation of the committee and the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>

The  President  has ruled that in order to comply with Standing Order 64 notice of such a motion must be handed in to him before the Senate assembles. As that is a simple procedure, I cannot support the amendment. We are aware that the ruling of the  President  was based on parliamentary practice. By its vote the Senate has confirmed that ruling, and now that the position has been made quite clear I can see no reason why the standing order should be altered. </para>

                    <para class="block">The report of the committee was circulated among honorable senators some time ago. Briefly, it is an historical record of the work done by the committee since it ##"##was appointed on the 17th March, 1932. The committee is not opposed to the making of regulations, but it is of the opinion that a close watch should be kept on them, in order to avoid any abuse of the regulation-making power. This subject has been discussed in many parliaments, a fact which prompted Lord Hewart to write his much discussed book <inline font-style="italic">The New Despotism.</inline> I have noted during the last twelve months that some judges, when giving decisions based on regulations, have referred to the autocracy of the bureaucracy. In South Australia a standing committee on the lines of the committee functioning in the Commonwealth sphere has been appointed, and I understand that similar action is being taken in New South Wales.

                                On the 22nd May, .1930, just before the adjournment of both Houses for the winter recess, the Government announced a policy for controlling the importation of certain goods, which has come to be known as the ##"## Trade Diversion Policy ##"##. The committee is very much concerned at the method which was followed on this occasion.

                            <para>By way of explanation, honorable senators arc reminded that prior to 1934 the Government had power to prohibit the importation of goods by proclamation. Such  procla-  nation was laid before Parliament for its information, but there existed no power for disallowing it. The House of Representatives could of course exercise a certain amount of control over the Government##'##s use of this power, but the Senate could not, except indirectly. In October, 1931, the senator who subsequently became the first  Chairman  of the Committee, introduced a bill providing for the substitution of the word ##"## regulation ##"## for the former word ##"## proclamation ##"## in section 52 (.&lt;/) of the Customs Act. The bill lapsed at the end of the session, but in the following session it was introduced as a Government measure and passed into law. It was under this power that the Government acted in its trade diversion policy. </para>

                                    <para>.Normally, the regulation giving effect to such an important item of policy would have been laid on the table of both Houses immediately, and would have been subject to disallowance. But on this occasion, owing to the adjournment of the Parliament, the regulation (Statutory Rules 1936, No. 69) was not tabled until the##'## Houses re-assembled on the following 10th September - nearly four months afterwards. Even if the Regulations Committee had met during the recess (as it has power to do), it could not have dealt with this important regulation because it had not at that time been tabled in the Senate. However, the regulation was laid before the committee on the 10th September, 1936, and was fully considered. In view of the previous decision of the committee in 1933 that questions involving government policy in regulations or ordinances fell outside its scope, no proposal was made to recommend the disallowance of the regulation because of the policy contained therein. Under the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act it is open to any individual member of the Senate or House of Representatives to move in this direction, but it was agreed that action by the committee, as a committee, was not called for. At the same time the committee held the view that an important matter of policy such as trade diversion should have been the subject of parliamentary enactment, and it is this view which the committee desires to emphasize in this report. The regulations in question were subsequently challenged in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> High Court and upheld in a majority judgment, two judges dissenting. </para>

The Regulations and Ordinances Committee, which consists of representatives of all parties in this chamber, has an onerous task in scrutinizing the great volume of regulations which come before the Senate from time to time. This report contains an account of the activities of the committee since it was appointed in  1932.  All honorable senators, irrespective of party, will agree that government by regulation is not in the best interests of the country. The committee endeavoured to be unbiased, but it was hampered in that it could not of itself disallow any regulation. The committee can only decide whether or not a regulation is in conformity with the provisions of the act under which it is made. Since the  chairman  of the committee <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has adequately dealt with all the salient features of the report, I shall not detain the Senate further than to say that the committee has at all times done its best to ensure that regulations are strictly in accordance with the statutes under which they purport to have been made. I have pleasure in seconding the motion. </para>

                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I do not propose to deal with all of the matters mentioned by the committee. Some are of an historical nature, and a careful reading of the report will well repay honorable senators who are not familiar with the constitution and working of the committee. </para>
                    <para>I have selected four matters which appear to call for comment on the part of the Government. They are  - (1)  The lack of substantive legislation in connexion with censorship of imported films;  (2)  The assurance as to the examination of regulations by the Attorney-General##'##s Department;  (3)  The method adopted to implement the trade diversion policy of the Government; and  (4)  The lack of bound volumes of ordinances for the Australian Capital Territory. </para>
                    <para>The censorship of cinematograph films is dealt with in paragraph 6 of the committee##'##s report. This paragraph was brought to the notice of the Trade and Customs Department, and advice has been received from that department that the experience of the Censorship Board and the department shows that the control of censorship by the present regulations is working smoothly and there does not appear to be any necessity for the bringing down of substantive legislation for this purpose. The department states, however, that should any difficulties arise in future, which would appear to make desirable the action suggested by the Standing Committee, full consideration will be given to the matter. </para>
                    <para>As is stated by the committee in paragraph  9,  the Minister representing the Attorney-General in this chamber assured the Senate that arrangements would be made for all draft regulations to be examined minutely and according to definite legal principles, both as to the matter and form of the regulations. The committee has drawn special attention to this promise, and states that it accepts the assurance given by the Minister. I am happy to be able to inform honorable senators that that assurance has been given effect to in its entirety. Soon after it was given the various departments were circularized and requested to forward to the Attorney-General##'##s Department all regulations in draft form. Arrangements have been made in that department whereby all regulations are closely scrutinized both with regard to their matter and form, and I doubt very much whether the members of the committee have any cause for criticism as to the form in which regulations are now made. </para>
                    <para>The committee has referred in paragraphs  11  to  13  to the means adopted by the Government to implement its trade  diversion policy in 1936. The representations of the committee in this connexion will be kept in mind should legislation of the character in question be again under consideration. </para>
                    <para>I note with pleasure the remarks of the committee with regard to the issue of bound volumes of statutory rules each year. The committee expressed its appreciation of the speed and efficiency with which such volumes are issued. The committee commented, however, on the lack of bound volumes of ordinances for the Australian Capital Territory. It is noted that the committee has recommended that in future the legislation of the Territory should be issued in bound volumes at regular intervals in the same way as statutory rules are now issued. This practice was adopted formerly, but owing to shortage of funds during the depression, and other circumstances, it became impracticable for some time to re-issue up-to-date copies of this legislation. </para>
                    <para>During the debate on the Seat of Government (Administration) Bill in 1935, the question of publishing up-to-date volumes of the ordinances and regulations of the Territory was reviewed and was referred to the Attorney-General by the Minister for the Interior. In November of that year the Attorney-General##'##s Department was asked to undertake the revision and rearrangement of the ordinances and regulations of the Territory in order to enable them to be reprinted in volume form under the provisions of the Amendments Incorporation Ordinance. One circumstance that effected the completion of the work of revision is the great extent to which ordinances and regulations of the Territory have been amended during the last few years. For this reason, it is necessary, for convenience of reference, that consolidations of the individual laws be made prior to their preparation for issue in bound volumes. </para>
                    <para>As a result of the committee##'##s report this matter has been discussed again with the Attorney-General##'##s Department, which advises that the publication was prepared with a view to its issue during the current year; but, in view of the </para>

This ordinance made the alterations in the various ordinances that were necessitated by the adoption of the designation as ##"##Australian Capital Territory ##"##. The new volumes will be issued as early as possible in 1939.

Because of what has happened in this chamber during the last 48 hours, I have some conception of the task which confronts this committee in unravelling complications which arise from time <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> time. The committee is to be complimented on the way in which it has performed its work. I say this even though I may not always agree with its conclusions. I concur in the recommendation that the power to govern by regulation should be used only in connexion with more or less routine matters. It should never be employed in connexion with matters involving fundamental principles of policy. Such matters should be dealt with by legislation. I agree also with the committee##'##s respectful and restrained, comments with regard to the Government##'##s trade diversion policy, which we had no opportunity to discuss until the time was much too late. The Opposition approves of the report and will support the motion for its adoption. </para>

                    <para>Before considering the amendments proposed to be made in the principal act by the bill now before the Senate, it may be helpful to honorable senators if I give a brief account of the establishment and work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. The work of this organization is generally appreciated by members on both sides in this chamber, especially by those who have made a close study of such activities. </para>
                    <para>The council is really the successor to the Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry, which was established in 1920. In 1926, the Science and Industry Research Act constituted the present council, which consists of three members nominated by the Commonwealth Government, the  chairman  of each of the State committees constituted under the act, and such other members as the council, with the consent of the Minister, co-opts by reason of their scientific knowledge. The members nominated by the Commonwealth Government form an executive committee which has, when the council is not in session, all the powers and functions of the council. </para>
                    <para>The powers and functions of the committee are set out in the act and include the following: - </para>

                    <para>One branch of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has been engaged on the standardization of scientific instruments and generally improving the standardization of various kinds of machinery and tools used in industrial undertakings throughout Australia. This work, which has been of immense value, is revenue-producing, because the services of experts made available by the council are paid for by those industries which are receiving the benefit from this policy. </para>
                    <para>The council also acts as a means of liaison between the Commonwealth and other countries in matters of scientific research. Provision is made for the council to co-operate,as far as possible, with existing State organizations in the co-ordination of scientific investigation, with a view to the prevention of unnecessary overlapping and the utilization of facilities and staffs available in the States. State committees have also been appointed in each State. The function of these committees is to advise the council with regard to the general business of the council and any particular matter of investigation and research. </para>
                    <para>Such, briefly, is an outline of the organization and functions of the council, the executive committee of the council, and the State committees. The amendments provided for by the bill are largely of a machinery character, and do not impinge upon the main structure of the Science and Industry Research Act 1926, except in so far as provision is made for vice-chairmen, in addition to the  chairman,  of State committees of the council to be members of the council. </para>
                    <para>The purpose of the measure is to amend the principal act in four respects, namely :  - </para>

                    </list>
                    <para>The extension of the scope of the council to cover research into the problems of secondary industries renders it essential that there shall be a widening of representation on the council to provide for the interests which it will serve in the future. </para>
                    <para>With regard to the proposal to give the council power to acquire property by purchase, I may explain that under the present act the council has power to acquire property by gift, grant or bequest, subject to the approval of the Minister, but not by purchase. This omission is entirely the result of an oversight; in fact, the council has exercised this authority since it came into being. Property, equipment, stores, ##&amp;##c., have been purchased by the council to enable it to discharge its functions. Its power to make purchases of equipment, stores, ##&amp;##c., has not been disputed by the Auditor-General; but the purchase of fixed property, such as land, buildings, ##&amp;##c., has been questioned. The purpose of the amendment is. therefore, to place the matter on a proper statutory basis. </para>
                    <para>In respect of the appointment of permanent officers, the act provides that they shall be engaged for such periods, and shall be subject to such conditions, as are prescribed. This bill renders optional the prescription of conditions, the words ##"## or as the council, with the approval of the Minister, determines ##"## being added to the original provision. Regulations already issued under the act provide that officers employed thereunder shall be engaged for such periods, and shall be paid such salaries and allowances, and shall be subject to such conditions as the council, with the approval of the Minister, determines. These regulations are inconsistent with the act, and the purpose of the amendment now proposed is to regularize the matter. There is another object to bo served in rendering optional the prescription of conditions of employment. By reason of the diversity of conditions and the character of the work upon which officers of the council are employed, a certain amount of flexibility is very desirable. There are entomologists following the course of varied problems, in respect of which it is difficult, if not impossible, to lay down any definite conditions of employment; similarly, there are research workers on animal health problems, on plant problems, on cool storage problems, and so on, in respect of which conditions of employment must be regulated in accordance with the progress of experiments. </para>
                    <para>In some cases it is necessary to send officers overseas to search for predators for pests in Australia; to investigate problems common to other countries; to conduct research where special facilities are available for the purpose, and generally to maintain contact with world scientific works. It is quite impossible to prescribe conditions which would be applicable to all the varied circumstances connected with the employment of these officers. Salaries of officers have, however, been prescribed by regulation, and it is proposed shortly to submit to Parliament regulations covering other main conditions of employment such as recreation leave, sick leave, furlough, travelling allowances, ##&amp;##c., which will be similar to, or will closely correspond with, regulations under the Commonwealth Public Service Act. The council actually adopts very closely Public Service conditions; it deviates from Public Service practice only in exceptional circumstances. That is an added reason why all the rather voluminous regulations now in force  under the Public Service Act should not be duplicated to meet the needs of the council. </para>
                    <para>The council has not hitherto had power to employ temporary or casual employees without the prior approval of the Minister. It frequently becomes necessary to engage employees of this kind when dealing with different investigations. ##'##Such matters as the handling of fruit in connexion with cold storage, fruit picking at the dried fruits station at Merbein, the planting out of tobacco seedlings or other kinds of seedlings in connexion with plant investigations, all call for temporary and casual labour. In addition, it is often necessary to cmploy at short notice for brief periods such persons as typists, telephonists, messengers, caretakers, watchmen, office cleaners, ##&amp;##c. The present arrangement whereby the approval of the Minister is necessary is cumbersome, and it is now sought to give the council slightly wider powers in this regard. This, briefly, is the scope of the bill, which I now commend to the Senate. </para>

                        <para>. - T do not propose to offer any opposition to the measure, for I regard the explanatory speech by the Minister as satisfactory. In view of what happened in the earlier part of the sitting, it is a pleasant balm to wounded feelings to be able to return- to a calm atmosphere, and find something on which one can congratulate the Government. I believe that this bill i##'##s necessary. I have always appreciated the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and I concur in the introductory remarks of the Minister in which he gave, for the benefit of all senators, particularly those who have recently come amongst us, a brief <inline font-style="italic">resume</inline> of the history of the council. I was pleased when the functions of this body were recently widened to bring within its purview problems of concern to secondary as well as primary industries. The journal- which the council issues is an exceedingly valuable one, and, although it contains much matter which is necessarily of a highly scientific nature, it is couched in such language##'## and contains such illustrations that even a layman can follow the trend of##'## the investigations being conducted, and appreciate the results that have been achieved. In some instances, the results have proved very valuable to Australia, and particularly to the industries concerned. </para>

                        ARTHUR  (New South Wales) ##[##8.40 |  . -  I understood the Minister to say that one of the functions of the council is to make grants for the purpose of encouraging scientific and industrial research. He outlined some of the activities of the council, but I did not hear him refer to investigations concerning industrial conditions which affect the health of the employees. On a previous occasion I brought under the notice of the Senate the plight of a large section of the working people who contractdiseases in the course of their employment. The council might well be directed by the Government to use its scientific knowledge for the purpose of alleviating distress known to be suffered on account of occupational diseases. On a former occasion I referred to the condition of some of the men engaged in the coal-mining industry. There is also occupational disease among those employed in the metalliferous section- of the mining industry, and in sewer excavation work. In the baking and other trades occupational disease has reached such alarming proportions that the Government should ask the council to consider means of protecting the health of the employees. Wo are well aware of the evil effects of white lead, yet thousands of pounds are being spent in introducing scientific appliances in industry which may tend to increase the- trouble. We should consider the plight of the invalid pensioners who have been thrown on the industrial scrap-heap. Many discarded employees are forced to accept the pension, because nothing has been done to eliminate occupational diseases; yet a system##'## of national insurance has been introduced to enable the Government to recover from, the pensioners the payments made to them. Some time ago I submitted almost a complete scheme for the investigation of the health of the coalminers. I suggested the establishment of a laboratory in- Sydney, arid it seems to me that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research could establish a laboratory in each State to discover means  of combating industrial diseases which cause employees to be discarded. If the matter is left where it is at the present time, the Government will hear more about it from me at a future date.

                            <para>- He gave a lecture in Melbourne some time ago under the auspices of the Australian and New Zealand Economic Society, of which I am a member. The council carried on its operations throughout the recent depression, and obtained fine scientific results which showed how production of certain cereals could be increased; but it offered no suggestions as to how the purchase of the increased quantities of products could be assured. A person who can make two blades of grass grow where only one grew previously is said to be a public benefactor. When the council showed how to grow more wheat the price of wheat was only 2s. a bushel; it would have been better if the council had been able, to show how to raise the money to purchase increased quantities of products. I recall <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Herbert</inline> Gepp delivering a lecture on industrial planning, and also hearing at a meeting of the ##'##Economic Committee in Hobart an interesting discourse on the same subject by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson,</inline> a graduate of the University of Melbourne. At that gathering a bank manager said that when we were faced with a financial and economic depression certain persons began to plan for everything but the means by which money could be obtained to purchase the product of our industries. I informed the committee that it is easy to talk about increased production, but that we live under a money economy, and that if our financial system will not provide the money with which to purchase goods, increased production is of no advantage. What is the use of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research suggesting means by which production can be increased unless the people have the money to purchase the goods produced? The members of the council have not made any suggestions in that direction. It is useless to pay scientific or any other officers thousands of pounds annually to show how production can be increased if sufficient money is not available to purchase what is being produced. I have brought these facts under the notice of some members of this Parliament, including some members of the House of Representatives holding conservative views. Several have asked me the way in which I think that the purchasing power of the people can be increased and my views on finance generally. Some have come to me and said, ##"## I want to know more about your system ##"##. I listened this morning to a most interesting speech by a member of the House of Representatives, and when he had concluded his remarks and had left the chamber I informed him that he had spoken of the manner in which money should be expended on defence but had not said how it could be obtained. I suggested the provision of national credit. I also informed him that, when certain legislation was brought before this chamber, honorable senators in Opposition proposed to fight it to the last ditch. </para>

                            <para>- I have already this week had an honorable senator called to order for associating me with that system. I have never mentioned the name of Douglas; I base my arguments solely on the community control of credit, which is a part of the policy of the Labour party. Honorable senators will recall that I asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister whether the Government proposed to adopt a recommendation of the Royal Commission on the Monetary and Banking System that the Commonwealth Bank Board should be asked to issue credit-free loans for war expenditure. The reply was a complete evasion of the question. The Prime Minister said that he was not prepared to ask the Manager of the Commonwealth Bank to issue free credit. The information I desired to obtain was deliberately suppressed. I maintain that, if we do not tackle this subject in a.  proper way we shall again he faced with the problem of handling national finance in what has been termed the orthodox way. The Government has recently increased the sales tax by 20 per cent. and the income tax by 15 per cent. in order to provide money to meet defence expenditure, but we shall be recreant to our trust as representatives of the taxpayers if we allow this swindle to continue. When I asked what commission the trading banks received for floating Commonwealth loans I was informed that they obtained 5s. per cent. That does not represent their profit. If a client purchases Government bonds up to a value of ##£##1,000 for cash, the bank can purchase bonds to the value of ##£##7,000 or ##£##8,000 by sending its cheque for that amount, and that is how Government loans are raised. I would have to pass the cash for my purchase, while the bank creates credit to the amount of its purchase; that credit costs it nothing. The Royal Commission on the Banking and Monetary System informed the Government that it can obtain money through the Commonwealth Bank free of interest. </para>

If the Government is to adhere to ##"## orthodox methods of finance ##"## we shall find ourselves in the position in which Great Britain was placed a few weeks ago, when the Prime Minister of the greatest Empire the world has ever known had, in effect, to go down onhis knees to Herr Hitler, and ask him not to fight, because, owing to the orthodox method under which finance is handled, money would not be available to enable Great Britain to engage in war. I have informed the members of the House of Representatives that they should avail themselves of the opportunity now afforded to obtain the necessary credit to provide for national defence. </para>

Some of the officers of the council could occupy their time on the northern rivers of New South Wales, where a large number of dairy farmers, particularly on the southern side of##'## the Lower Clarence River, are concerned with the activities of the New South Wales Tick Board. I understand that the Commonwealth Government has subsidized . this board to the extent of ##£##44,500 over a period of three years, and that a grant of ##£##25,000 has been made for the construction of dips for dairy cattle. I understand that dipping affects the milk production of the cows, and possibly some officials of the council could ascertain whether it is necessary to spend such a large sum of money in a district which is particularly free of tick. Over the border in Queensland dips are going to ruin, while tick- infested kangaroos and wallabies are carrying the pest into New South Wales. If the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is to be continued it should be in tie interests of the whole community. Some members of the House of Representatives who have particularly large holdings on the Clarence River believe that action should be taken in the direction I have suggested. </para>

In its last annual report the council dealt at length with the work it is doing in connexion with the cattle industry. The success of this work, of course, depends upon co-operation between the council and the Commonwealth and State Governments, and I might add that each of the State governments has given that co-operation to the fullest possible extent. For instance,, tick areas can .be defined only by the State governments. The Council has done tremendous work in connexion with tick eradication involving the discovery of the habits of the pest. It has also advised State governments and owners of properties in connexion with the quarantining of certain areas. I assure the honorable senator that the council regards this work as an important part of its activities, and I suggest that he study a copy of its last annual report. However, I shall see that his remarks are brought under the notice of the  chairman  of the council. </para>

I impress upon the Minister the absolute urgency of this work. Graziers and pastoralists throughout the Commonwealth have received progress reports of the most satisfactory nature. They have been told by officers of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research that whilst the virus is at least 50 per cent, successful in the destruction of rabbits, all other animals and humans are immune from it.  Surely something can be done to expedite this investigation in order that the virus may be released. In every country district which I have visited I have been asked why, even on the results already achieved, it cannot be released. Settlers say that if the virus could destroy even 50 per cent, of the rabbits - the experiments at Wardang Island reveal better results - the council would be justified in releasing it immediately. I know that this is a serious matter and that nothing should be done in this direction without the approval of officers of the council and public health services. At the same time, however, I suggest that the Government might indicate when these experiments are likely to reach a stage when the release of this virus will be warranted. 1 am sure that every honorable senator would be pleased to have that information. </para>

In that direction we must proceed with the greatest possible caution. If the balance of nature be upset in one respect a fresh problem will be created. In the destruction of rabbits with this virus we should hasten##'## slowly. There are hundreds of facets to the problem. We must be sure that infected rabbits will not carry the infection to other animals besides rabbits. Some doubt still exists on that point. The honorable senator will appreciate the difficulties of the position. I have had considerable experience in rabbit country in Queensland, and I know that the farmers in those parts are not only interested in getting rid of the rabbits, but also are curious as ##'##to whether the experts are absolutely sure that it will not do more harm than the rabbit has ever been able to do. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> more fully on that point than I am able to do, but I assure the honorable senator that the rabbit problem cannot he settled until the scientists engaged in  this work know a great deal more about the problem than they do at present. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the .representations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arthur</inline> that the council should extend its investigations into diseases peculiar to certain industries. Excellent progress is being made by the laboratory established under the control of the Commonwealth Government at Kalgoorlie in connexion with miners##'## diseases. I see no reason why diseases peculiar to other industries could not be investigated in a similar way. Such action would be in. the interests, not * only of the industries concerned, but also of humanity. </para>

                        <para>. I am##"## familiar with the investigation being made  in  connexion with rabbit virus, -because that work was commenced when I was administering this important department. Two points have definitely been established : First, that the virus will not attack any other living organism ; and secondly, that it is . contagious among rabbits. I understand that some difficulty arose in the experiments at Wardang owing to the fact that the vi rus was released in- only one part of the island. Results were confined to that part, apparently, because the rabbit, uses the one warren and the one means of egress and ingress. That, of course, would account to some extent for what might be regarded as a partial failure of these experiments. </para>

                    <para>I assure the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> that it has been demonstrated beyond doubt that this virus is a carrier. The balance of nature to which he referred can, to that extent, be upset. The progeny of most animals, as is the case with human beings, do not inherit certain diseases, but the disease caused by this virus is hereditary in rabbits. We can regard this virus as satisfactory in two respects : First, it does not breed immunity; and secondly, it will not attack any living organism except  rabbits. It has taken years to establish the.se two facts. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> I point out that the tests so far conducted have not been sufficiently wide to warrant a recommendation that the virus be released to the public. I understand that the experiments are proceeding. However, as we know, the scientist is very cautions and will not pronounce judgment on any experiments until he has exhausted every test. </para>

The Commonwealth Department of Health is working in conjunction with the State health departments in investigating phthisis, and as an illustration of its readiness to extend its operations, I point out that it is establishing, in the various capital cities, clinics for the conduct of experiments and demonstrations with regard to the nutrition of children. I assure the honorable senator that his remarks will be brought under the notice of the Department of Health. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to validate until the 4th May of next year the collections of duties imposed under a customs tariff resolution introduced into the House of Representatives on the 4th May of this year. Honorable senators will recollect that under the Government##'##s trade diversion policy a licensing system was applied to the importation of a number of classes of goods from certain foreign sources. Towards the end of 1937 the Government reviewed its policy on trade diversion, and on the 7th December, 1937, 1 informed the Senate of the intention of the Government to alter the licensing system and to substitute a system of adequate duties where such action was necessary for the protection of Australian industry. Ultimately, the licensing system was terminated, except in respect of motor chassis. In the meantime, inquiries had been instituted with the object of ascertaining to what extent Australian manufacturers had incurred additional capital expenditure in the production of the goods covered by the trade diversion policy, and the need for further tariff protection to safeguard that capital expenditure, pending reports of the Tariff Board after public inquiry as to the amount of the protection necessary. As a result of those inquiries, the Government came to the conclusion that, pending a public inquiry by the Tariff Board, there was##'## need for additional duties under the general tariff on a number of items in order to safeguard either the new capital which had been employed, or the extensions which had taken place. Accordingly, in May last the Government introduced tariff proposals increasing the general tariff rates on a number of lines, including lawnmowers of certain types, refrigerators, fractional horsepower motors, electric fans, spring hinges, advertising posters, pencils of wood, motor vehicle springs, and shock absorbers. It was made clear that these duties were of a temporary nature, and would remain in force only until the Tariff Board had reported upon the various items. Up to the present, the Tariff Board has not completed its reports upon the subjects covered by the tariff proposals of May, 1938, and in order that the capital expenditure incurred may be safeguarded in the meantime, the Government desires to validate the duties from the time of their imposition until the 4th May next. I may mention that it is necessary to have this bill passed by to-morrow as the period of six months from the time of the imposition of the duties will expire on Saturday. When an embargo was placed on the importation of certain goods, a number of industries sprang up in different parts of Australia, ##'##and, in addition, some existing industries extended their establishments to manufacture items covered by the embargo. When the licensing system came to an end, these new industries would have been left entirely without protection had not the Government, after careful inquiry, formulated a set of duties to meet the situation. At the same time it asked the Tariff Board to report on every industry which had been affected by the trade diversion policy. </para>

                <para>On the notice-paper of the House of Representatives to-day I find a question by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Lawson, making inquiries as to the companies of which I am a director, and furthermore asking ifthe department of which I am at present in control enters into contracts with some of theme companies. </para>
                <para>I have made no secret of the fact that I am a director and chairman of directors of the Hume Pipe Company of Australia Limited. thesupply of materials for post office requirements is arranged by inviting public tenders, which, in addition to beingadvertised in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette,</inline> are brought under the notice of the firms from whom it has been customary to receive tenders. On receipt of tenders, the details are scheduled and analysed from the point of view of determining those which will provide the most economical supply of the material needed to meet the department##'##s requirements. </para>
                <para>They are then examined by a tender board consisting of three of the most highly-placed officers of the department, who submit a recommendation with the necessary details supporting their views, to the Director-General. </para>
                <para>The Director-General reviews the basis of the recommendations and the extent of the orders to be placed and issues the necessary instructions to the Chief Inspector of Stores, who then executes the contract with the successful tenderer. </para>
                <para>It is not the practice to bring these matters under the notice of the Postmaster-General excepting in unusual circumstances, such as, for instance, the placing of substantial orders with foreign firms.I have never been consulted in regard to the placing of contracts for pipes or ducts with firms with whom I may be associated or with any others, nor haveI any departmental or personal knowledge of such contracts. </para>
                <para>Having regard to the suggestion underlying the question that I may in some obscure way have influenced the department,I feel that one course only is open to me, and that is to tender my resignation as Postmaster-General. </para>
                <para>ThisI do with some reluctance at such a time, but the protection of my honour and the honour of the Government against any insinuation that underlies the question on the notice-paper leave no other course open to me, andappears to be the one I should adopt under the circumstances. </para>
