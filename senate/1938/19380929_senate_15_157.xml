If so, what will be the position of racing tipsters using the Canberra radio station to broadcast racing information, and thus evade the State Act?

When the representatives of the press interviewed me and submitted a similar question, I told them that I jumped my hurdles whenI reached them and not before.

            <para>. - The Opposition does not intend to oppose the passage of this measure, but there are one or two comments which I should like to make concerning it. The remarks I made yesterday on the Sales </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Tax Bills with respect to direct and indirect taxation apply particularly to the bill now under consideration, and the figures I then cited need not be repeated. The bill imposes a flat rate tax  of 15  per cent. on incomes, I am aware  of  the fact that federal income tax is not levied on salaries below a certain amount, and in justification of our attitude towards direct and indirect taxation, I now suggest that a flat rate is not the best method of levying this additional impost which is required to provide revenue for a specific purpose. It is mere sophistry to say that a 15 per cent. levy will be made on all incomes over a certain amount. I repeat the statement I made yesterday, that the amount which a man pays as tax is not of such importance as the amount that he has left after he has paid it. No one is likely to shed any tears if a man with an income of &#163;10,000 a. year is called upon to pay income tax at the rate of 15 per cent., but the position is entirely different in respect of a man whose incomeis only &#163; 1,000 a year. It is entirely incorrect to say. that there is equality of sacrifice. However, I shall not pursue that argument this morning. I pass on to point out that, whereas in 1921-22 the revenue derived from income tax was &#163;16,800,000, and in 1931-32, when times can scarcely be said to have &#39;been good, it was &#163;13,400,000, the estimate for the current year is only &#163;12,100,000. I submit that if an increase of the taxon incomes be necessary, it should be a graded tax, and that a much higher rate should apply to the immense incomes of wealthy persons than to the smaller incomes of less fortunate members of the community. We have a right to ask that that be done. </para>

              <para>- The Minister need not think that he can side-track me with a statement of that kind. I know how the ordinary tax on incomes, is graded. I am, however, not dealing with that practice, but am suggesting that this additional tax also should be graded, and made heavier on the higher incomes. The man who has the most to protect in a time of emergency should pay for the protection given to him. I do not wish to become over-enthusiastic on this subject, for I know that the Government&#39;s proposals, which I believe to be well justified, will receive the endorsement of the Senate. Because the Labour party agrees with direct taxation it has no objection to this additional impost so long as it does not add to the burden of theunder-dog. At every possible opportunity, the Oppositionwill urge that in all times of national emergency - whether resulting from depression, or from the shadow of war - the rate of the tax on higher incomes should be greater than on smaller incomes. As I have said, the Opposition will not oppose the bill, which is simple and easily understood. </para>

            <para>. -  One can only regret the necessity for this measure. It is well known that taxpayers generally regard the tax collector in a certain light, and also that that feeling is reciprocated, in that the tax-collector views the taxpayer as a person who must be watched carefully. Complaints have been made to me that, in the correspondence addressed bythe Taxation Department to taxpayers, there is a certain abruptness of language which is embarrassing to nervous taxpayers. I suggest that a little more care in the wording of letters would be an advantage. I am also informed that taxpayers in Western Australia who wish to obtain information about their assessments have to speak to a junior officer in a public room. That is undesirable. I suggest that arrangements be made whereby taxpayers may have their cases dealt with by senior officers under conditions providing some privacy. </para>

            <para>. -  I take this opportunity to protest against the method adopted in answering questions submitted by honorable senators. Generally, I agree with the refusal of Ministers to answer questions involving government policy, and, in my opinion, they are right in taking exception to accusations of evasion of questions. Yesterday I asked the following questions :  - </para>

          <para>I point out that these two instruments - the treaty and the Immigration Act - are matters of international law and, as such, public matters, administered by Ministers of the Grown. Their terms are interpreted by the Attorney-General. They are not matters of private law. If honorable senators cannot secure information from official sources as to how the public laws of Australia are interpreted we occupy a very anomalous position. I suggest that the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has treated my questions very lightly, to say the least. The answers he has given are not only unworthy of a Minister, but alsocast a reflection on this chamber. </para>

              <para>- Yes. This matter has been the subject of considerable debate in legal circles ever since I have been associated with any government in this country, and it. involves a highly complex question of law. The honorable senator referred to international law. One wonders at times, whether there has been any international law since 1914. I assure the honorable senator, however, that no discourtesy was intended towards him, nor was there any desire on the part of the Minister for External Affairs to evade the issue. The questions raise a very thorny and tricky problem indeed, one which I have run up against on previous occasions. It has given rise to considerable doubts in the minds of legal men. </para>

              <para>- That is so, but we must be careful as to how far we go in answering questions concerning so thorny a problem as this. I shall bring the matter under the notice of the Minister for External Affairs with the object of having it considered by Cabinet in order that the position may be clarified - that is, if it be deemed wise to have it clarified at this particular stage. </para>
