Public buildings were opened to a greater extentthan usual.The Canberra Tourist Bureau placed visitors to the limit of the accommodation available, and it was open for their convenience from 8.30 a.m. until 10p.m. Despite warnings in the press and to other tourist agents for a period of several weeks, many persons arrived without making any arrangements for accommodation. Between 60 and 70 of these cases were accommodated through the Tourist Bureau in the homes of Canberra residents, who generously co-operated. </para>

                            <para>.- The defence of this nation should be by a policy of self-preservation rather than by becoming embroiled in European wars. Such a policy is in conformity with the declared defence policy of the Australian Labour party. A few days ago Senator Brown quoted from a book by Captain Liddell Harte, which contained a statement by Commander Russell Grenville that Australia and New Zealand cannot depend to any extent Upon assistance from the British fleet, and that Australia must make rapid arrangements for its own defence. The present position is such that Australia is compelled to do more than it has done in the past. We have just passed through an acute international crisis, and it is -satisfactory to every one to realize that Australia was not asked to show what it can do. In the past we have been able to display our strength, and we may again be called upon to show the power of Australia&#39;s manhood. I know that we can acquit ourselves satisfactorily in the eyes of the world. The Labour party believes that the best way in which to defend this continent is by strengthening the Air Force, and establishing a system whereby we can bring into commission a sufficient number of submarines and cruisers to repel any attack. I have stated previously that it is necessary for Australia to establish a citizen air force throughout the Commonwealth, and that there should be a branch of such a force in Tasmania. When such suggestions are made we are told that sufficient funds are not available; but I should like to bring under the notice of honorable senators what is being done in Great Britain to provide funds for defence purposes. The defence of Australia is inadequate, and thos? who have wealth and property to defend should be compelled to contribute an amount over and above ordinary taxes. As the Government says that it follows Britain, it should adopt the policy of that country for the financing of defence. In Great Britain there is a national defence contribution fund, and the law governing it provides - </para>

There is a direct tax of 5 per cent, on the profits of any corporate body or individual, and those who have wealth and who amass profits are compelled to meet the cost of protecting .their assets. The tax which is assessed and collected annually for the accounting periods of trading concerns is . bo remain in force for five years from the 1st April, 1937, to the 31st March, 1942, after which it will be reviewed. A similar tax should be imposed in Australia. There . are some millionaires and other wealthy persons in this country who should he compelled to contribute towards its defence. I have no complaint to make concerning the way in which they secured their wealth, because if we had lie opportunity we would do the same.

                    <para>I have been &#39;asked to bring the proposals of the Tasmanian Aero Club before this chamber. They are set out in the following statement: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Representations have been made to the Commonwealth Government for the provision of a suitable aeroplane and its maintenance, to train advanced pilots of the Aero Club or otherwise in co-operation with the Reserve Defence Forces of the Military District of Hobart, in the defence of Tasmania. </para>
                        <para>When the formation and establishment of light aeroplane clubs was conceived by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sefton</inline> Bracker  in 1923, he had in mind, we are told, the creation of an air consciousness among the British people, analogous to the sca consciousness for which they have been famous through history. A reserve of air pilots was also to be created, for service iii the event of war. </para>
                        <para>As far as the Tasmanian Aero Club is concerned, the last-mentioned object has not been achieved, nor is it possible within the limited powers of that club, the pilots having no knowledge of flying of a military character, nor of the use of modern aircraft. Reserve pilots could not be used for active service until trained in the many branches of flying such as to include bombing, air fighting, photography, wireless, telegraphy, advanced navigation, meteorological observation, <inline font-style="italic">Sue.,</inline> practical&#39; manoeuvres with the Army Reserve Forces. These manoeuvres are not possible with the training machines of the Aero Club, and it seems in order to get the desired results as far as creating a reserve of air pilots is concerned, there is a necessity for the formation of an air reserve equipped with suitable modern aircraft. </para>
                        <para>In the larger States of the Commonwealth the objects of this advanced training are  effectively  carried out .by the Citizen Air Forces that are in existence. </para>
                        <para>It has been stated that to establish a unit of the Citizen Air Force in Hobart on a scale  comparable  with other capital cities it would require in the vicinity of &#163;T50,000. This amount would include the erection of buildings and supply of aircraft, and added to it would bc the cost of maintenance and personal staff. </para>
                        <para>Realizing that the provision of this amount would bo out of the question, the Aero Club feels that a modified scheme should be possible, viz.: the provision of a suitable aeroplane with a maintenance grant. </para>
                        <para>It is submitted that the &#39;Commonwealth Government be asked to provide an aeroplane, through the Defence Department, and a maintenance grant of &#163;1,000 per year to cover running costs, insurance, &#38;c. The aircraft to be under the control of the Commandant of the Military District of Hobart, or his direction. </para>
                        <para>Through the volunteer reserves (including the Aero Club instructor and volunteer engineers (in their private capacities) who would be responsible for the technical maintenance of the aircraft, and advanced pilots of the Aero Club with 25 hours or over), the nucleus of a Hying corps could be formed. </para>
                        <para>Provision could be made for all such volunteers to join the Citizen Military Forces &#34;Air </para>
                        <para class="block">Force Branch &#34;, who would attend parades with the other branches of the Commonwealth Military Forces in their technical capacity, and engage in practical exercises with them, such as co-operation between the infantry, artillery, and signals branches, and carry out photographic surveys of forests, fires, 4c, and to act in case of emergency relief if the occasion demanded. This would greatly assist in providing a familiarity with aircraft amongst all ranks of our Volunteer Reserves - a factor that should be most valuable in future military operations. </para>
                        <para>Infantry, artillery, and signals officers can be shown how military ground force dispositions appear from the air, and pilots would get training in picking up troop dispositions, spotting for artillery, contact patrol work with infantry, and constant practical work with the wireless, &#38;c, under military conditions which would be of great mutual benefit to all divisions. </para>
                        <para>Further, the aircraft could bo used for communication flights between military districts, preliminary photographic surveys for  geological,  topographical, forestry and ordnance surveys, searches for lost ships, land parties, aircraft, &#38;c. (if the occasion should arise), all of which exercises&#34; would give a very wide and useful experience of the usefulness and limitations of aircraft under such conditions, thus providing a wider experience for both pilots and military forces. </para>
                        <para>Co-operation with the Aero Club instructors for refresher courses to instruct or arrangements for tuition by an officer of the Royal Australian Air Force for a short period, and the periodical visits of Air Force machines could bc combined with the annual training camps of the corps. </para>
                        <para>In order to make the widest use of the aircraft during training, and in order to have a unit of a type which would be of undoubted military value in emergency, it is necessary to have a machine similar to that in use in the Royal Australian Air Force. &#39; </para>
                        <para>To  be sufficiently economical in operation, and simple in maintenance, a machine of medium powered category must be sought. Within this category and similar to the communication types in use in the Royal Australian Air Force (that is the Gannet and Rapide) is the D.H. &#34;Dragon Fly&#34;. This machine has simple maintenance (Gipsy <inline font-weight="bold">Major engines)</inline> and modern flying training equipment such as flaps, wheel brakes, instrument flying and wireless, and can be used for photography and will carry sufficient personnel for communication. The manufacturers aTe  supplying to the Royal Australian Air Force and the price would be under &#163;3,500 erected and flying at Hobart. </para>
                        <para>It is considered necessary to have a twinengined machine in Tasmania, owing to ite mountainous nature, and this machine would carry out the requirements of those larger aircraft of a similar type in use in Australia. </para>
                        <para>Hangar accommodation would have to  he  provided,, but temporary arrangements could be made with Australian National  Airways  at Cambridge. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Honorable senators will realize that the Aero Club of Tasmania has presented a sound case for consideration by the CommonwealthGovernment. Should the Government not <inline font-style="italic">see</inline> its way clear to establish a citizen air force in Tasmania, I hope that it will do the next best thing, and supply the aero club of that State with a machine which can be used for the training of air pilots. </para>
                    <para>I have been requested to bring before the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> the desirability of providing sentry-type telephone boxes in Tasmania to replace the existing boxes which are attached to either walls or posts. I have in mind a telephone outside Paton and Baldwin&#39;s mill at Launceston, which is used extensively during lunch hour by the 1,000 girl employees in the building. The noise of the street traffic makes it almost impossible to converse satisfactorily. That telephone is typical of the public telephones in Launceston, most of which have been installed along tram routes. Tasmania is entitled to the same telephonic facilities as have been provided in other cities of the Commonwealth, and I urge the Government to hasten the installation of suitable telephone booths in that State. </para>

                            <para>. -  As this is the first opportunity I have had to address the newly-constituted Senate, I desire to extend the right hand of comradeship to my fellow workers on the other side of the chamber, and in particular to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colllings</inline> on his reappointment as Leader of the Opposition,  I  take with the proverbial grain of salt the honorable senator&#39;s statements of what the Opposition will do during the life of this Parliament. Knowing him as  I  do, I cannot believe that he will carry out his threats. On the contrary, I am sure that he will show mercy. The atmosphere of this chamber is conducive to thoughtful discussion, particularly when we reflect that the decisions reached will have legislative sanction. I believe in the honesty of purpose of every honorable senator, and that our common desire is that the people of Australia shall be happy, contented and prosperous. To that end, we in this chamber may do much, but we must remember that we have our limitations, in that we have to consider ways and means. In attempting to confer the greatest good on the greatest number, we must take care that we do not interfere with the sources of our national wealth. The day may come - I hope that it is far distant - when the Labour party will be in power in the Commonwealth, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> will have an opportunity to put into practice his advanced views on the creation of unbounded wealth, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> as Minister in Charge of Employment, will have the task of setting things right in the industrial sphere. Whether or not I am a member of this chamber at the time I shall watch such developments with interest. Perhaps when that time arrives this country will experience again those halycon years, 1910 to 1913, so glowingly portrayed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan.</inline></para>

                        <para>Provision is made in this budget to meet our share of the upkeep of the League of Nations. Events of the last few weeks, I suggest, invest this item with more than usual interest. Many people in Australia claim that such expenditure is sheer waste of money, and if they had their way they would abolish the League, because they contend that it is useless. I admit that up to the present it has failed to live up to the expectations of its founders and supporters; nevertheless, we must remember that it represents the first concerted effort made by the nations of the world with the object of preserving world peace. The success of the Munich Conference at which the representatives of four great European powers solved the difficult problem arising out of tension between Germany and Czechoslovakia illustrates the fundamental principle on which the League of Nations is founded, and, I believe, will encourage every supporter of the League to do all in his power to keep it alive. The League at least represents a start in the right direction. We must always remember that up to the present it has had to overcome the doctrine, inculcated during 1,000 years of international strife, that might is right. All honorable senators, I feel sure, sincerely hope that in  the future international disputes will be settled by negotiation rather than by resort to force. </para>
                        <para>The budget of any country is simply a balance-sheet covering the transactions of one year, together with an estimate of income in respect of the following year. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> that budgets were based on this principle even in those halcyon days of which he spoke when Labour governments were in power. The Leader of the Opposition criticized the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> for having budgeted for a surplus of &#163;26,000, and stated that the Treasurer knew full well that on hi3 estimates he would end the year with a much greater credit &#39;balance. Every honorable senator hopes that the actual credit balance will be more than the Treasurer&#39;s estimate, but I fail to understand why the Leader of the Opposition should claim that the Treasurer made his estimate with his tongue in his check. It is an impossibility for the Treasurer of any country to make a correct estimate of the result of the year&#39;s transactions. </para>

                                <para>- I can quite understand how the estimate could be out by even that amount. I remind the honorable senator that the bulk of our overseas wealth is derived from the sale of our primary products, whereby we secure funds to meet our liabilities and to pay for our imports. Naturally if we enjoy bountiful seasons we are enabled to secure extended credits overseas, and this fact provides an incentive to overseas buyers to increase their purchases of our products. The honorable senator suggests that there is no excuse for the Treasurer under-estimating his surplus by the amount of &#39;&#163;3,000,000. On the first page of the budget he will note that Australia&#39;s wool cheque alone last year declined by&#39; &#163;11,000,000. If so great a fluctuation is possible in respect of the receipts from one of our primary industries, a corresponding decline will naturally be reflected on the expenditure side of our budget. The matter of tariffs, about which the honorable senator spoke at som; length, enters into this subject to a great extent. He suggests that we should stabilize our tariffs as protective tariffs rather than view them as revenue tariffs, but that would be very difficult. Although honorable senators object to the tariff being made a medium of raising revenue, they are nevertheless the most fervent advocates of increased taxes. </para>

                        <para>Criticism has also been levelled against the expenditure of the sum of &#163;20,000 in respect of overseas delegations. Our newspapers have been more than usually busy in criticizing the last ministerial delegation which left these shores. It was claimed that those gentlemen had accomplished nothing on the other aide of the world. Whilst they certainly did not return with any signed agreement, they established personal contact with the leaders of commerce overseas, and when similar negotiations are undertaken in the future, this country will reap the full benefit of that contact. </para>

                                <para>- If they are not re-elected I hope their successors will prove to be better men. The value of personal contact between leaders of different countries was brought home to us very forcibly through the Munich conference. I do not think that any honorable senator will deny that but for the personal contact made between the representatives of the four great nations who met at the conference the vital negotiations between Germany and Czechoslovakia would have ended without war. Undoubtedly the success of that conference was due to the fact that these men came face to face, and were thus enabled to understand each other better. Coming nearer to home to illustrate, I might mention that in South Australia I have met political students who have described the Leader of -the Opposition in this chamber as a wild man. As the result of&#39; my personal contact with the honorable senator I was able to disabuse their minds of that impression. I replied, &#34; That is all nonsense ; I have found nothing wrong with him. He is full of the milk of human kindness &#34;. These gentlemen had formed their, impression of the honorable senator on what they read of him and his statements in the press, but  I knew  him better because I had made personal contact with him. </para>

                        <para>Honorable senators opposite have criticized the proposed expenditure on defence. Every item of that expenditure is absolutely justified. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> however, that it has not been spread so widely throughout Australia as it might have been. South Australians, in fact, feel that they are entitled to more consideration in that respect than they have received, but we were told that of all the States, South Australia was the least vulnerable, and therefore did not need heavy expenditure on huge fortifications. If this is true, I should like to know why the Government does not make provision for expenditure in that State on munition factories, which, of all government establishments, should be in the safest location. </para>

He went on to say that friendly societies had done more for the people of Australia than the National Insurance Commission is ever likely to do. I entirely disagree with him on that point. Every one knows that members of friendly societies cannot get out of their various funds more than they put into them. That is to say, if a member&#39;s contribution is1s. or1s. 3d. a week,he cannot expect to got in return benefits having a greater value than1s. or1s. 3d. weekly. </para>

                        <para>The Government&#39;s proposals in respect of State grants this year are not so generous as we in South Australia could wish them to be. I realize, however, that they are based on the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission and as I hold that a man is a poor sport who does not accept the decision of the umpire I am prepared to support the Government&#39;s proposals. </para>
                        <para>We have heard a good deal in this debate about the proposed grant of &#163;200,000 for the training of unemployed youths, and about unemployment generally. In this connexion 1 was surprised at the criticism by the Loader of the Opposition. He declared that the Statistician&#39;s estimate of 8.5 per cent. of persons unemployed was far from being accurate. I do not understand whythe honorable gentleman should question the figures. No one challenged their accuracy some years ago, when unemployment reached its peak at 30.5 per cent. of the population. If official figures were accepted then they should be accepted now. As regards unemployment generally, I would  say that, having regard to the criticism offered by several honorable senators during the last few days, the sooner arrangements are made for another census of the people, the better. The Leader  of  the Opposition spoke about thousands  of  people in Queensland being out of work; Senators from New South Wales told us of the thousands unemployed in that State; Western Australian senators also spoke of similar numbers in the same unfortunate plight in that &#39;State; our Tasmanian friends added their quota; and one senator from Victoria spoke of the &#34; thousands upon &#39;thousands &#34; who were out of work there. </para>

                                <para>- I repeat that if there are so many thousands  of  people without employment when, as  I  have shown, the official estimate is 8.5 per cent., it is highly desirable that we should have another census of the people without delay. When the National Insurance legislation was under discussion in the Senate a few months ago, it was estimated that when the scheme was launched  on  the 1st January next, no fewer than 1,800,000 employees throughout the Commonwealth would be covered by insurance. If we take into account their dependants who will be catered for by approved societies and the numbers of self-employed persons who will benefit from the project in some form, I fail to  see  how any one can argue logically that &#34; thousands upon thousands &#34; are out of work in Australia. I could not help feeling, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> was speaking yesterday, that a stranger listening to the debate, would have gathered the impression that there was a great deal of unemployment in this country, and would have thought it peculiar tha,t the Government had not done something about it. I admit there is unemployment, but not to the extent alleged by the honorable gentleman. </para>

                            McLACHLAN.From what the three Labour senators from that State have said so often in this chamber, one would gather that Queensland is the Eldorado of the Commonwealth, and that there is nothing wrong there,, although, as I have said, the Leader of the Opposition told us yesterday that there are thousands of unemployed persons in that State. The reduction of unemployment  i3  primarily the care of the State Parliaments. I do not object to this Parliament assisting in any way it can to cure this evil, but I object to the Government of the Commonwealth being blamed for its existence.

I invite the honorable senator, when next he visits Adelaide by train, to view the city as he approaches it from the Mount Lofty Ranges. He will see thousands of workers&#39; homes that are a credit to any State. This sight is a good introduction to Adelaide, and I am proud of it. The probability is that the unemployed are not nearly so numerous as some people imagine. </para>

                        <para>Reference was made by the Leader of the Opposition to the insufficiency of accommodation for visitors to Canberra during the last week-end. In my opinion, the Canberra Tourist Bureau and the residents of this city did well to find quarters for the huge crowd of visitors, many of whom had not made prior arrangements for accommodation. </para>
                        <para>Complaint has also been made by the Leader of the Opposition regarding the deduction of certain amounts from the pensions of superannuated members of the Commonwealth Public Service.

                        <para>I desire to make clear my attitude to the subsidy on fertilizers, which was referred to yesterday by my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson.</inline> I differ from him in this matter. The first time the subsidy was introduced a somewhat higher payment than that of to-day wasmade. When a reduction of the subsidy was suggested, &#91; urged that, instead of cutting down the amount, a reduction should be made of the quantity of fertilizers upon which individual applicants could claim the subsidy. I was alone in that proposal, but a year later, after the amount of the subsidy had been cut down, the quantity also was reduced. This year a further reduction of the quantity has been made. It is regrettable that a quantity below 20 tons has been fixed, yet ten tons of fertilizer the reduced price will prove quite beneficial to the average farmer. This subsidy was not introduced for the encouragement of farmers in occupation of very large holdings. The idea was to help small farmers to practice topdressing with fertilizers, but the subsidy was grasped with both hands by the big men, some of whom were top-dressing areas of from 800 to 1000 acres. When fertilizers were first used for the improvement of wheat lands, many people realized that they should be applied over very large areas, but most of the farmers could not afford to do that. Had similar assistance been granted to the wheat farmers when superphosphates were first used, great benefit would have resulted. Although ten tons of fertilizers is a limited quantity for one farmer, it will enable the small man with 100 acres to give his land a good top-dressing. </para>
                        <para>The wheat-farmer is in difficulty thoughout Australia, and legislation is required to tide him over his present troubles. The worker&#39;s have the benefit of the Arbitration Court, and the manufacturers are protected through the tariff ; therefore we must now protect the wheat farmers who feed them all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cunningham</inline> remarked that the demand for wheat is still as great as it has been in the past. Prior to 1914 Germany, Italy and France imported annually about 900,000,000 bushels of wheat, but, after the Great War, each of those countries set itself the task of becoming as self-supporting as possible. Their production has so increased that to-day they are importing only 400,000,000 bushels of wheat. Therefore, 500,000,000 bushels of wheat is being produced in Europe to-day that formerly was obtained from overseas, and that quantity is almost equal to four Australian harvests. Consequently, I cannot agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cunningham</inline> that the demand for wheat is as great to-day as in the past. Everything possible should bo done to assist the wheat-growers. </para>

Reference has been made to deductions from the pensions of superannuated members of the Commonwealth Public Service. Some time ago, Senators Sheehan, Cameron and I met representatives of certain organizations in Melbourne, who informed us that they had asked the Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey,</inline> for an interview to enable them to discuss this matter with him, but, although months have elapsed, an interview, has not been granted. I hope that the very fair claim of these men will receive early consideration. It has been stated by honorable senators opposite that the deduction was made by the Scullin Government. That is true, but the promise was given that, as 60011 as the finances warranted it, full restoration of the pension would be made. In respect of all other pensions aud-salaries this course had been followed. I urge the Government to make provision for the payment to these men of the comparatively small sums that are duc. </para>

                        <para>I suggest that the reply to my second and third questions was an impudent one. Whatever practice may have been adopted in recent years, when the Opposition in this chamber was small in numbers, we are now sufficiently numerous to be entitled to full and courteous replies to questions.

One of my correspondents- asks &#34; Can you tell me why free Australians are subjected to treatment of this kind?&#34; I have a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Radio Times,</inline> and it impels me to refer to a group of newspapers in Australia controlled by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Keith</inline> Murdoch, who hae probably done more than any other man in this country to distort the policy of the Labour party. The facts are these: The following cablegram was received from the British Broadcasting Corporation by the Australian Federation of Broadcasting Stations, which includes&#39; practically every commercial broadcasting station in Australia : - </para>

                        <para>That was a magnificent gesture by the British Broadcasting Corporation, but certain vested interests, who, during the Great War, profiteered at the expense of the people, intervened. We recall that during the Great War certain newspaper proprietors, including those controlling the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> actually sold casualty lists to relatives of deceased or injured soldiers. These people realized that an appalling crisis was almost upon us, and that if certain news was broadcast by wireless the sale of their newspapers would be affected. Since the Great War radio has entered the field, and ie used largely in disseminating the news of the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Keith</inline> Murdoch was reminded that news can be given to the people by means of wireless broadcasts before newspapers can be sold m the streets.

                                <para>- That may be so. When a member of the House of Representatives I specialized in obtaining information by asking questions, and I always found that departmental officers supplied complete and accurate answers. I regret that that policy is not now being pursued. Every holder of a wireless licence in Australia is entitled to obtain wireless broadcasts, particularly on matters of such vital importance as the recent European crisis. Some of the newspapers distorted news to such an extent that it would appear that hostilities actually broke out five weeks before the crisis was reached; casualties were even reported. I know the tactics adopted by some of these newspapers. When I was contesting the Bendigo seat with Colonel Harrison, one of these newspapers depicted that gentleman as a fine upstanding military man, as he is, but showed me, the Labour candidate, a neurotic, decrepit and broken down individual. I cannot recall any of these newspapers giving to the members of the Labour party a fair deal. </para>

I shall not be silent until this matter has been cleared up, particularly when we know that this newspaper combine, merely in order to help the sale of its journals, endeavoured to prevent wireless listeners from obtaining broadcasts.

                        <para>I notice that the grant of &#163;150,000 previously made to assist gold-mining hae been, eliminated from the budget this year; because, I suppose, the search for gold last year did not produce the results anticipated. Approximately &#163;500,000 was expended to assist gold-mining during the last four years. The Commonwealth Government, working in conjunction with the States, should provide an amount to assist mining parties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan,</inline> who represents a State in which mining is carried on, knows that gold has been discovered in Australia largely by men whose only equipment has been a dish and a pick. &#34; Pickologists  &#34; are superior to geologists in locating gold. In Victoria men working gold leases have located finds in spots where geologists have said that it would not be found. The cost of obtaining a lease in most of the States is approximately &#163;30, which is too much. If the Government desires further to encourage gold-mining, through the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, it should, I suggest, arrange that prospectors and working miners be allowed to hold leases for twelve months, the survey and other charges being recouped to the States by the Commonwealth Government. </para>

                                <para>- All State departments are short of money. Most of the money appropriated for mining purposes is used by field staffs. Good miners can carry out prospecting operations at a very small cost. I notice also that the Government proposes to appropriate &#163;40,000 this year, and eventually &#163;120,000 for surveying our iron ore resources. That amount seems unnecessarily large, particularly as iron ore is likely to be found in only three States. Some time ago I conducted a party from Melbourne 600 miles beyond Alice Springs, and the cost of our keep, freight and fares over a period of six weeks was under &#163;500. It would appear that an appropriation of &#163;120,000 for the survey of our ore resources is quite unnecessary, especially as no drilling will be required. </para>

In some of the States the right to tax the people has been exercised to the full. Taxation is high in South Australia; in Victoria it is low. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> will probably ask what the Labour party in Victoria is doing to allow that state of affairs to exist, but I remind the honorable senator that the Labour party has only 21 of 65 members in the Legislative Assembly of that State, and only five of 36 members in the Legislative Council. The best that the Labour party can do is to support a government which, while not ideal, is certainly better than one consisting of members of the United Australia party - Labour&#39;s traditional enemy. </para>

                            <para>. - In the preparation of its budget, the Government was faced with the fact that, whereas its estimated revenue for the year was about &#163;90,000,000, the contemplated expenditure exceeded &#163;93,000,000, leaving a gap of about &#163;3,184,000 to be bridged. During this discussion, honorable senators opposite have submitted proposals the granting of which would increase the expenditure for the year, but they have not given any indication that they have considered how the extra money can be found. I know that it is simple to submit demands to the Commonwealth on behalf of the States, for I have- done it myself; but I suggest that more thought should be given to the means of obtaining the money. I listened in vain for any suggestion by honorable senators opposite as to how extra revenue should be collected. It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> submitted what he thought was a fool-proof scheme for raising money, but I suggest that if his own tutors will not listen to him, it is unlikely that the Commonwealth Treasurer will do so. </para>

                        <para class="block">In the  cold  world of finance, cold facts are of greater value than mere theories. If extra expenditure is to be incurred, extra money must be found. I assure Opposition senators that no government, irrespective of party, likes to increase taxes, especially when the tendency is in the opposite direction. For several years, the Lyons Government has pursued a policy of lowering the  ! burden  on the taxpayer, thereby helping the community to attain financial stability. This year, however, owing chiefly to the public demand for increased defence expenditure, the Government is confronted with the necessity to raise an additional &#163;3,000,000. It realizes that there is a limit to the burden that should be imposed on the people, for once a reasonable limit is exceeded, there are economic and industrial repercussions, and the first people to feel the effects are the workers. Unduly high taxes increase unemployment. Under the financial agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, the Commonwealth Government is entitled to only one-fifth of the  loan  moneys made available. During the last two or three years, almost the  whole  of the loan money allocated to the Commonwealth has been absorbed by advances for the rehabilitation of Australia&#39;s primary industries. Only a small proportion of loan money has been available to meet the increasing defence expenditure demanded by the people of Australia. The effect has been that, to a greater extent than hitherto, revenue has been drawn upon to finance defence measures. In this connexion, I point out that the buildings erected and works undertaken in giving effect to Australia&#39;s defence policy will remain sound assets for a great number of years, and that it is good business as well as sound politics to provide that the present generation shall not be called upon to bear the total cost. Unfortunately, the  loan  pool has definite limits : it is not that inexhaustible well which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> would have us believe. If we continue to expend loan money indiscriminately, the effect on the people will be serious indeed. The Commonwealth Government has taken steps to raise the extra revenue required to balance its budget, and I suggest that no one will seriously contend  that  its proposals exceed safe limits. The taxpayers themselves are prepared for  a  heavier drain on their purses in order to finance this country&#39;s defence programme. I tried hard to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline> when he dealt with the taxes paid by persons with high incomes.  His  figures were so incorrect that I propose to give the facts to the Senate. I do not know y. where the honorable senator obtained his v information, but I suggest that he would do well to study the latest report of the Commissioner of Taxation. I have yet to meet the man who believes that Robert Ewing, the Chief Commissioner of Taxation in Australia, cannot sniff out a big income, and tax it. </para>

                                <para>-  A resident of New South Wales without dependants who has an income of &#163;1,500, pays in taxes to the Commonwealth and the State, &#163;181 16s. 9d., if his income be derived from personal exertion, or &#163;270 if it be received from property. The tax on higher incomes is so heavy that a resident  of Tasmania with an income of &#163;5,000 derived from personal exertion pays &#163;1,220 in taxes, or &#163;2,077 if his income be. derived from property. It will be seen that, in the latter instance, nearly one-half of the income is paid out in taxes. Income tax in most of the States, as well as in the Commonwealth, is graded steeply where incomes exceed &#163;2,000 per annum. </para>

                                <para>- It is not quite so high, but we must bear in mind that, in addition to income tax as such, taxpayers in Australia are called upon to contribute to hospitals and to pay rates to shire councils, &#38;c. When all these demands on their incomes are added together, it will be seen that taxpayers in Australia are not much better off than are the taxpayers in England. I repeat that there is a limit to the ability of the people to meet taxes. It would be very unwise to overstep that limit. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator should be more accurate. On page 32 of the last annual report of the Commissioner of Taxation the honorable senator will see that out of the total number of taxpayers in the Commonwealth only986 had incomes exceeding &#163;5,000 last year . The total taxable income of all taxpayers was &#163;66,000,000, and of that amount these individuals who constituted only 4 per cent. of the total number of taxpayers, paid 25 per cent. of the total tax. The honorable senator, therefore, is slightly in error. I recommend that he study this report. </para>

                        <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> referred to the subsidy of &#163;20,000 paid to the Australian National Travel Association, whose work, I was pleased to note, he commended. This association is doing wonderful work in advertising Australia, not only internally, but also in other parts of the world. It is publicizing, not only the commercial and economic possibilities of this country, but also its attractions for the tourist. The honorable senator&#39;s doubts as to the control of the expenditure of this money will be set at rest by the knowledge that it is supervised by the board of the association, of which the Secretary of the Department of Commerce is a member. </para>

                            MacDONALD.Yes, and when the Estimates are under consideration I shall endeavour to supply details on that point. In its publicity activities the Department of Commerce also utilizes the cinematograph, and, in conjunction with the Australian National Travel Association, has distributed 16 millimetre films from which a profit has actually been made. These films are placed on most of the large ocean-going liners and in. tourist bureaux in Japan, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and on the Continent of Europe.

                        <para>Dealing with accommodation on Tasmanian steamers, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline> suggested that occasionally passengers who bought first-class tickets were obliged to accept second-class accommodation. I have made inquiries from the shipping company concerned, and have been advised that overcrowding on these steamers is liable to happen only during the Christmas season, or at the beginning of the apple season, when there is an extraordinary demand on their space. At such times it may happen that holders of first-class tickets have to be accommodated in second-class quarters. They receive their meals, however, in the first-class saloon. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp&#39;s</inline> remark that the meals have to be given in two sittings to first-class passengers supports the explanation which I have just given. </para>

                            suggested that lime should be included among the commodities on which the fertilizer subsidy is paid. I point out that when this subsidy was first introduced careful considerationwas given to this matter. Regard had to be paid to the fact, however, that lime is not a fertilizer, but a soil improver. The Government decided to limit the subsidy to manurial dressings and, therefore, lime, with a number of other commodities was excluded. It is not possible to reverse this decision which has operated for a number of years. The matter of including lime among these commodities was also considered in May, 1936, by the Australian Agricultural Council, which, after full discussion, decided against its inclusion.

                        <para>Dealing with operations at the Flemington Abattoirs <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> hinted that the Commonwealth inspectors and State inspectors were acting in collusion in respect of the treatment of carcass veal for export. I point out that the Commonwealth has no jurisdiction in respect of the abattoirs. They are controlled by the State governments, and it would be impertinent for the&#39; Commonwealth to intrude in that sphere. The Commonwealth inspectors attend at the abattoirs solely in order to examine meat for export. The calves in question are those from which boneless veal is taken for export. In this connexion a boneless side of veal, i.e., a side of veal with the bone removed, must not weigh less than 11 lb. to be accepted for export, except that in respect of  sides from J ersey or Ayrshire breeds the minimum weight acceptable is 10 lb. per side. In all cases, the sides, in the opinion of an inspector, must be full flesh, firm and mature and otherwise sound, and suitable for human consumption,  before  they are passed for export. Weight is not a reliable guide in regard to age  or  maturity, because the dairy breeds such as Ayrshire and Jerseys are not only smaller in frame, but alsoare lighter in weight than, say, Shorthorns, which may be only two or three days old. The department would not necessarily accept calves for boning for export of aweight of 45 lb. or over because such calves, if coming from the larger breeds, Shorthorns or Holsteins, may be only a. few days old, soft fleshed, flabby, discoloured, and generally bearing evidence of immaturity, and would not be accepted for export. I take it that these are the calves to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> referred. I suggest that the honorable senator should take up his complaint with the State authority controlling the abattoirs. </para>
                        <para>SenatorKeane and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> spoke of the survey of the iron-ore deposits at Yampi Sound. The former suggested that the amount of money to be made available for the survey was excessive. He mentioned, and rightly so, that boring on these deposits was not possible, but I remind him that in order to carry out a proper survey of our ironore resources tunnelling must be resorted to. No matter how competent geologists may be in making surveys of other metalliferous outcrops, the fact remains that iron is so important to many of our key  industries that we cannot afford to be satisfied with any survey of such resources which is in the slightest degree incomplete. We are obliged, therefore, to get down to hard facts. I am not now speaking of manganese iron, but of hematite iron. In view  of  the fact that, tunnelling has to be resorted to, I suggest that the amount allocated for the survey is not excessive. At present there is a survey gang of experts and 50 workmen engaged at Koolan Island, the cost of which is being borne by the Commonwealth Government at the rate of &#163;31,000 per annum. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Eraser</inline> has read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holmes&#39;</inline> remarks I should think he has little to complain about, having regard to the fact that, as I have said, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holmes</inline> is not given to extravagant statements. </para>

                            <para>. - I regard the complaint which I made in connexion with the Flemington Abattoirs last week as a subject of vital importance. When I inspected the abattoirs I was concerned to discover, as I  3tated  previously, that there was in operation a system which, to my mind, is a definite swindle, and I regret that the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Allan McDonald)</inline> has apparently not taken a note of my previous representations in this matter. My complaint is that carcasses of calves rejected by State inspectors because of under-weight, are being sold to the carcass butchers to be boned for export. In some cases Jersey calves are rejected because they do not come up to the standard weight of 45 lb. The owners are thencompelled to sell these calves for l1/2d. per lb., irrespective of their age, to an export carcass butcher, who sends them to London as boned veal. As I pointed out in a previous debate, calves of not less than 30 lb. killed at country abattoirs can be exported. If a wholesale butcher is unable to supply his retailers with veal, he is permitted to go downstairs and buy from the exporter calves which had been bought for l1/2d. per lb.; these he sells to the retailers at 4d. per lb. If this is , not a swindle I should like to know what is. I now ask the Minister to note my representations and have a reply supplied by his Department. I emphasized the gravity of this practice in my speech last week, but so farI have not received a satisfactory explanation. The Minister said that it would be impertinent for the Commonwealth Government to interfere in this matter. Surely it would not be impertinent for the Minister, whose department controls the export side of this industry, to suggest to the State authorities that in no circumstances should the sale of rejected calves by export butchers be permitted. Carcasses purchased at 11/2d. per lb. because they weigh less than the standard prescribed for export are fit only to be boned, yet they are being sold to retail butchers at 4d. per lb. This is a matter which should be investigated by the department which controls the inspection of meat for export. Holstein calves, three days old, will weigh 45 or 48 lb. These are permitted to be sold; but Jersey calves at three weeks weigh only 35 lb. and are rejected. That is the basis of the complaint, and I hope that in future the Minister will be a little more exact when replying to representations from this side of the chamber. </para>

                        <para>I am concerned with the proposed expenditure on defence forecast in the  budget speech, and wish to deal particularly with the manufacture and importation of aeroplanes. Although much has been said on this subject, I do not know exactly what is the policy of the Government. If, when Parliament met at eleven o&#39;clock on Wednesday of last week; we had been informed that the British Empire was at war, what would have been the position in this country with regard to the supply of oil for our military aircraft? Surely that was something to which the Government should have given some attention? </para>

I know that certain action has been taken in connexion with the development of the Newnes shale deposits. I have read that it is proposed not to operate at Newnes, but at Capertee, and that the company does not propose to install retorts at Capertee, but intends to construct a pipe line to Blacktown, where the refining will be done. Discussions are also proceeding regarding the type of plant to be ordered from England for the extraction of oil from the shale. </para>

                                <para>- I should like to deal also with the dispute in the coal industry. I trust that that unfortunate trouble will soon be ended, but I am afraid that with increased mechanization of this industry unemployment on the coal-fields will- be even more rife than it is to-day. It is also true that owing to the increasing use of electricity in factories, the demand for coal will be reduced and hundreds of coal-miners will be thrown out of work. The Government should consider at the earliest possible moment, the introduction of a programme of national works of a reproductive character to absorb the men who lose their employment, but no such scheme is forecast in the budget proposals. On account of the national importance of providing adequate supplies of fuel oil, the Government should consider, side by side- with the extraction of oil from shale, the setting up of the necessary plant to obtain oil from coal also. This would provide employment for the men who are being thrown on the industrial scrap-heap because of the mechanization of industry and the change-over from coal to electricity in the production of power. It must have been, known to the Government that fewer men than formerly would be required in the coal-mining industry, &#39;because ships are rapidly becoming oilburners instead of coal-burners. Oil will certainly become the life blood of the nation. Every country requires a supply of oil sufficient for the use of the aeroplanes which are essential for its defence. 1 am not aware of the nature of the oil reserves which the Government has at its command, but I am not foolish enough to believe that Australia has more than a three months&#39; supply on hand. Nor do I believe that in the event of war it would he practicable for oil tankers to trade to this country. If I am not correct in my assumption, what was the reason for the fear expressed last week regarding the international situation? I have devoted some time to the study of the problem of oil supplies and defence, and, having served overseas during the Great War, I realize that Australia&#39;s experiences, in the event of another war, would be very different from those on the last occasion. </para>

I recall the attitude of the Labour party when the Lyons Government, at the behest of a delegation from Manchester, entered into a trade agreement by which it offended its second best customer for wool. Without discussing the matter with the wool-growers, the Government proceeded to satisfy the Manchester delegation. The people of Australia were asked to believe that certain goods were being made in Manchester, although they were actually manufactured in India and Egypt by employees receiving a lower  wage than that paid in Japan. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister cannot deny that a decision was reached which prevented the poorer classes in Australia from purchasing certain cheap Japanese piece goods. If the Manchester delegation did not actually suggest the trade diversion policy, its presence in Australia just prior to that policybeing brought into operation was a strange coincidence. These cheap goods were net being manufactured in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- I shall deal with that matter later. The textile industry was removed from Manchester, and this threw thousands of good British workers out of employment. Factories were established in India and Egypt, and the textiles manufactured there have been exported to Australia, although the workers in the industry, as I have said, receive a lower wage than that paid to similar workers in Japan. The Labour party declared at the time that the Government&#39;s trade diversion policy was one of the greatest blunders ever made in Australia, and, on account of it, the people were afraid to give to this Parliament the increased powers sought by referendum. The gerrymandering of the electorates was responsible for the return of the present Government to office, but a scrutiny of the Senate voting shows that, had the election for the House of Representatives been held on the same basis as that for the Senate, the custodianship of the affairs of the nation would not have continued in the hands of the present Government. </para>

                                <para>- But patriotic resentment of Australia&#39;s policy fomented by organized propaganda, gave an impetus to the manufacture and use in Japan of fabrics made from wood fibre. The wearing of synthetic wool is detrimental to the interests of Australia, and members of the Opposition do not fail to realize that this country depends largely for its wealth on the success of its export trade. I am surprised at the attitude of honorable senators who represent the Country party. </para>

                                <para>- I am not an advocate of that country. The bungling trade policy of this Government has been responsible for Australia&#39;s wool cheque being reduced by &#163;11,000,000, and destroying our relations with a friendly nation. At the outbreak of the Great War members of this chamber and of the House of Representatives informed me that had the Japanese not provided a convoy for our transports there would have been great difficulty in sending Australian troops abroad on active service. It was also said that our supplies of fuel oil were low, and that unless the trade routes were kept open importations could not be made from other countries. The Government contended that adequate stocks were available, and that as a result of the operations then being carried out flow oil would soon be discovered in Australia. Flow oil has not yet been discovered in Australia. The bungling trade policy of this. Government has antagonized a friendly nation. </para>

                        <para>During the debate a good deal has been said concerning unemployment in Australia. Honorable senators opposite cite the figures published by the Commonwealth Statistician which show that, until recently, there had been a marked decrease of unemployment, but we know that such figures are based on the returns supplied by trade unions, and relate only to unionists. I believe that there are over 100,000 unemployed in Australia to-day, most of whom are not members of any trade union. Large numbers have never . had a job, and consequently have not become members of a union; others when out of work have .been unable to retain membership of a trade union. If the Minister obtained the total number of unemployed registered under the various State relief schemes, we would have a better idea of the actual number out of work. If honorable senators opposite would co-operate with the members of the Labour party, a united effort could be made to assist those who are compelled to remain on the lowest rung of the social ladder. </para>
                        <para>In speaking on the Supply Bill a few days ago I directed the attention of the Government to a matter of vital importance to the Defence Department, and of direct interest to the municipality of Bankstown. I suggested that the Government should construct the Milperra-road leading to the bridge over George&#39;s River in order to facilitate defence activities, but after I had left the chamber <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> said that I was associated with land &#34; boodleiers &#34;. At the request of the  President  that remark was withdrawn, and later the honorable senator said that he did not intend to make an unfair accusation, hut that I was apparently doing something which I would not do were I fully acquainted with the facts. Nevertheless, he inferred that I am associated with land &#34; boodleiers &#34;. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> thinks that he can do such things with impunity, he should think again. I pay &#171; tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> for the honorable manner in which he apologized for a statement that he had made. I appreciate the honorable senator&#39;s action. I say, further, that if at any time, when speaking in this chamber, I reflect upon the credit of another honorable senator and I am proved to have been wrong, I shall apologize with the same frankness as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> has shown. I take this opportunity to correct <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand&#39;s</inline> statement. The Milperra Bridge was opened on the 18th April, 1931, and it cost &#163;6,000, which was allocated as follows: - New South Wales Government, &#163;2,000; A.

                            <para>. - I was rather surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> say that the present low price of wheat was due to world over-production. I point out that at present between 10,000,000 and 12,000,000 persons are unemployed in the United States of America, whilst only a couple of years ago the International Labour Office estimated that 14,000,000 persons throughout the world had lost positions in skilled trades, and, because of the mechanization of industry, would never regain employment in those trades. In Aus-  tralia are many part-time workers as well as persons totally unemployed. All of those people have to be fed. It is riot their fault that they have- not got the credit to purchase the necessaries of life. The real problem is not overproduction, but the lack of purchasing power. Although this Government expended &#163;23,000 on the Royal Commission on the Monetary and Banking System and that commission produced its report eighteen months ago, no action has yet been taken to implement any of its recommendations. Had the Commonwealth Bank been allowed to function from 1924 onwards on the same basis as it had operated from 1910 up to that year, .the </para>

From 1910 to 1927 the profits of the Commonwealth Bank from the Note Account alone amounted to &#163;5,703,89.1, and the bank saved Australia the sum of &#163;6,000,000 in floating &#163;250,000,000 worth of loans overseas. It floated those loans at a cost of 5s. 7d. per cent, and still showed a profit of 2s. per cent., whereas previously the cost of floating similar loans had been about &#163;3 per cent. From 1920 to 1923 the bank showed a profit on the Note Issue of &#163;3,097,000, and in respect of other business, a profit of about &#163;4,500,000. I hope that the Government will bear these figures in mind should it ever decide again to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act. </para>
                        <para>As the result of the very severe depression which took place in the United States of America in 1907, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Woodrow</inline> Wilson, when he became  President  in 1912, ordered an investigation to discover the cause of financial stringency&#39; in that country. In those days it was claimed that American finance was run on sound lines. A similar claim is made to-day in respect of Australian finances.  President  Wilson appointed a committee to undertake this investigation into the banking system, and that committee reported that fi vo banking houses controlled no less than 112 banks and industrial companies, which between them possessed resources, capital and reserves of the colossal total value of &#163;4,449,000,000. Those five banks represented an inner ring, and had they operated on similar lines in. another sphere they would have been called gangsters.  President  Wilson induced Congress to enact the Federal Reserve Bank legislation, one of the objects of which was to relieve the economic distress which was being caused by the activities of this inner ring of financial bushrangers. It was also designed to stabilize commerce and industry and to rectify financial stringency. Some time after that legislation was enacted, however, it was found that the interests which had been behind the money trust were behind the Reserve Bank, having secured the appointment of their representative as the  President  of the Board of Control of that institution. Thus the five banks which controlled the money trust also controlled the Reserve Bank, and all the finances of the United States of America were in the hands of an inner group, which managed them as it thought fit. The result was that when prices rose during the wai- these controllers of big finance had an  opportunity to sell their stocks, and holdings at high prices for cash, and in furtherance of their well planned ramp, decided that it would be good policy to induce a depression. As all the financial machinery was in their hands, this was not a difficult task. Their first movement, as in 1929-30, was to call in all overdrafts and place a strict limit on Joans to farmers and other producers. The immediate result was a sharp decline of prices, following a glut of primary products on the home market. Farmers, being unable to carry on, were forced to dismiss employees. The large industrialists were in a similar plight and were compelled to follow suit. When the depression became universal and prices for stocks had fallen, to their lowest level, these financiers seized the opportunity to buy them back at half, ,or less than half, the price for which they had sold them. That is how America&#39;s finances were controlled in 1920, and during the later depression in 1929. The influence of this inner group also extended to European countries, even to Great Britain, and through the mother country, to Australia. It may interest honorable senators to learn that in 1920 the Australian, associated banks had, simultaneously with these American financiers, decided on a policy of deflation. Fortunately for Australia, the Commonwealth Bank was not then so hampered in its policy as it hae since become, and realizing what was about to happen, the Governor of the bank, between June and December of -that year, suddenly released an additional &#163;23,000,000 of credit, much to the surprise of the associated banks. The additional credit staved off, for the time being, a depression which would have hit Australia at the same time as it hit America. I cite this significant action to show what the Commonwealth </para>
                        <para class="block">Bank did on that occasion to assist Australia, and I suggest that it could take similar action again if the Government had the courage to stand, by the people&#39;s bank. I hope that the Government will so amend the Commonwealth Bank Act, that that institution will have restored to it the power which it possessed prior to 1924. The first amendment to the act was the first blow to be struck at the Commonwealth Bank. As the result of that amendment of the act, the bank was placed under the control of a board of directors who immediately began to function in the interests of the associated banks which, in fact, they represented, and not the interests of the people of Australia. The personnel of the board at that time lends support to this statement. One of the members of the board was a pastoralist, ofRochdale Station, Queensland, and managing director of the Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance Company; another member was vice-president of the Associated Chamber of Manufacturers, Victorian representative of the Central Coal Board, director of the Austral Manufacturing Company, the LuxFoundry, National Mutual Life Insurance Company, Union Trustee Company,Robert. Harper and Company Limited, merchants and manufacturers and the Chamber of. Manufacturers Insurance Company; a third member was a director of Anthony Hordern and Sons, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, and the Royal Insurance Company; a fourth was  president  of various wool-buyers&#39; associations and proprietor of William Haughton and Company, wool brokers; another member was aFellow of the Institute of Bankers, London, and formerly  chairman  of Associated Banks in Queensland, and general manager of the Bank of Queensland and the Bank of No rth Queensland. It is obvious where the interests of these gentlemen would lie, connected as they were with insurance companies, private banks and similar institutions. </para>

The gentlemen whose names I have given were appointed to act in the interests of the country, which obviously clashed with their own interests. Is it any wonder that the Commonwealth Bank, -as now constituted, functions only as a clearing house for the private banks, instead of as a bank for the people as was originally intended ? </para>

                                <para>- If the Commonwealth Bank had not been strangledby the amendments made to the act in 1929, it would have been in a position when the depression came upon us to render to the people service similar to that which it gave during the Great War. The bank played a most important part in providing the necessary money to &#39;finance Australian operations in connexion with the war and also the wheat, wool, meat and other pools. Up to 1924, it had made available for the building of workers&#39; homes the sum of &#163;4,000,000. During the depression, it could have saved the workers of this country from the misery and starvation which they suffered. If credit can be issued for the destructive purposes of war, it is possible to raise money in a similar way for reproductive purposes. I am puzzled to know why the present Government has waited for about eighteen months, since receiving the report of the Banking and Monetary Commission, without acting upon its recommendations. The members of that body were hand-picked by the Government, and, if the report is not to its liking, it cannot attribute that fact to the personnel of the commission.

                        <para>A decrease in the supply of money results in some people having less ability to buy goods and services than they had before. They are forced to spend less, which results in a reduction of the incomes of the people from whom they usually purchase. This lessened demand is thus transmitted through the community, and results in some restriction of the total volume of production, and in some unemployment of men and resources. </para>
                        <para class="block">The commission came to the same conclusion as that reachedby me. If there is a reduction of the supply of money, the repercussions in primary and secondary industries adversely affect the general public. When a policy of deflation is put into operation, the trading banks call in overdrafts and refuse to grant loans, as happened in 1929. By amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act, the Treasurer could be given the power, referred to by the commission, to see that the necessary credit was put into circulation to maintain the stability of commerce and industry. If the Commonwealth Bank were given the powers exercised from 1912 to 1924, our defence programme could be financed through the bank, homes could be built for the workers, and the problem of unemployment, which has been worrying Commonwealth and State governments for many years, could be solved. The associated banks create credit at the present times out of practically nothing, because they can issue credit to an amount three times that of the currency in their possession. I do not say that the Commonwealth Bank should give credit for nothing. I suggest that a charge of 21/2 per cent, interest be made, with another 21/2 per cent, to provide a redemption fund. That would mean the redemption of loans in 40 years. If it be logical for the private banks to issue credit on nothing, surely it is logical for the Commonwealth Bank, backed by the nation, to issue credit on the basis that I have mentioned. </para>
                        <para>In the near future the sum of &#163;90,000 is to be expended in connexion with national insurance. I do not complain of that sum being put into, circulation, for the more money that is circulated the better it is for the wage-earner, but 1 cannot understand why the Government should pay to approved societies1s. for each new member when the scheme is compulsory. That &#163;90,000 could be expended in ways which would confer greater benefits on the community generally. We were* told that the scheme would come into operation on the 1st January next, but insured persons will not derive any benefit from it before the following April. That means that during the intervening three months the Government will rob the employees in industry of1s 6d. a week out of their earnings. But that is not all; the employers also will have to pay1s. 6d. a week in respect of each employee. The amounts so paid by them will be added to the prices of the goods or services that they sell. The result will be that the employees will really pay both contributions, and something in addition, because manufacturers and storekeepers always make a little extra profit on the increased outlay. Manufacturers and storekeepers have told me that they will pass on their contributions to the purchasers of their goods. </para>

                                <para>- The Labour party would not force such a scheme on the public. Before introducing a scheme of national insurance it would discuss the proposal thoroughly with all the members of the party. I do not know whether the supporters of the Government agreed to the present scheme, but if they did, I do not think much of their judgment. Let me show the effect of this scheme on a small farmer with three sons between the ages of sixteen and twenty years. As the boys are working for their father, he will be calledupon to pay their contributions, amounting to 4s. 6d. a week. In addition, as their employer, he will have  to pay a similar amount, making a total of 9s. a week. He will be fortunate indeed if the increased prices of commodities do not represent a further outlay of 3s. a week. That will make a total of 12s. a week. The position is seen to be worse when we reflect that farmers will never derive any benefit from the scheme. As. however, the national insurance legislation is not specifically before us, 1 shall pass on to other matters. </para>

                        <para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> was speaking. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hays</inline> interjected that the Lyons Government had remitted taxes each year for a number of years. That is true, but I shall direct attention .to the nature of the remissions. Four years prior to the last election, property-owners were relieved of the necessity to pay taxes amounting to &#163;4,860,000. Remissions granted to companies during the three years preceding the election totalled &#163;1.755,000. During the same three years, life insurance societies were granted remissions totalling &#163;2,130,000, and shipping companies were given concessions amounting to &#163;75,000. Now that the Government is forced to increase taxes, one would expect some of the remitted &#34; taxes to he reinstated, rather than that small wage-earners and old-age pensions should have to bear an additional burden. Honorable senators opposite appear to lose sight of these  inconsistencies on the part of the Government. </para>

                            said also that Australia could, with advantage, introduce 500 domestic workers from overseas immediately. I ask him to reflect on the effect of throwing 500 more such workers on the open market. If decent wages and conditions  were offered by employers there would be no shortage of domestic workers in this country; but under existing conditions it is ridiculous to bring immigrants to Australia to swell an already over-crowded market. If decent conditions were provided for domestic servants in Australia, householders would experience no difficulty in procuring domestic help.

                                <para>- When the honorable senator next has an opportunity to address himself to this subject, I should like him to describe the conditions under which domestic servants work in other parts of the world. Dealing with the proposed expenditure on defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> declared that South Australia was safe. Although he mentioned Tasmania in this connexion he did not say that Tasmania was safe. In fact, Tasmania is not regarded as one of the safe States of the Commonwealth, and for this reason, if for no other, the amount allocated to that State is deplorably insufficient, particularly when one realizes the extent of the Tasmanian coast which is totally undefended. I should like very much to be able to say that Tasmania is as safe as South Australia. </para>

                        <para>The Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Allan MacDonald)</inline> has replied to my representations that lime should be included among the commodities in respect of which the fertilizer subsidy is payable, but I should like the Government to give further consideration to my request. Lime is a neutralizer which sweetens and nourishes the soil, especially in areas which are water-logged. On this subject I speak as one who has had twelve years of experience as a farmer. I conducted considerable experiments with lime as a fertilizer, and I found it to be most effective. One dressing of superphosphate will stand for two years, and it may, perhaps, give some slight result in the third year, but a good dressing of lime will give results for as long as 20 years. Furthermore, the majority of people who would require lime would not, at the same time, require superphosphate, for the simple reason that their ground would be starving for lime but may have had dressings of superphosphate for many years. In those circumstances the change to lime would be most beneficial. </para>

He stated that, honorable senators on this side rose to their feet merely to look for a wrangle; that we were always out for a scrap. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator said that we never advanced constructive criticism, but were always indulging in destructive criticism. I suggest that everyspeaker on this side has invariably advanced constructive criticism. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie&#39;s</inline> speech was nothing but sarcasm; it certainly contained no constructive suggestions. He stated that the Communist tail was wagging the Labour party dog, suggesting that the Labour party was controlled by the Communists. If the honorable senator took the trouble to visit Yarra Bank on any Sunday afternoon, he would find the Communist speakers, without exception, abusing the Labour party, and he would never hear any of them uttering one word against the United Australia party. During the last election campaign the Communists were my greatest enemies. Invariably I found them working in the interests of the United Australia party. It would appear, therefore, to be a ease of the Communist tail wagging the United Australia party dog. </para>

                            also contended that in existing circumstances, sales tax was a just form of taxation. I have already said that this tax should be paid by the wealthy section of the community and should not be levied on the workers at all. The honorable senator emphasized that it was just to collect sales tax on motor cars because motor cars were luxuries.

                                <para>- The honorable senator declared that in most cases the motor car could be regarded as a luxury, and . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> supported that statement. Does the honorable senator hold the view that a motor car is a luxury to a farmer who lives in an isolated area and relies on it as his only means of securing the services of a doctor in a time of emergency? Does he think that motor cars are luxuries to the pioneers in the outback districts? Many small farmers deny themselves proper clothing in order to purchase a motor car, so that they may overcome their isolation in a time of emergency. I remind honorable senators that many small farmers are no better off economically than the lowest paid industrial workers. </para>

                                <para>- That is so, because the small farmers are crucified by what honorable senators opposite describe as a sound system of finance. The sales tax, which honorable senators opposite describe as aluxury tax, is levied on small farmers who find it essential to own a car. In no such case can the motor car be regarded as a luxury. Not 20 per cent, of the cars privately owned in Australia can be said to be luxuries. Thousands of young men, single and married, who find it impossible to secure a job, endeavour to earn a living by driving a motor lorry so soon as they can get together a few pounds with which to make a deposit on the vehicle. Yet, honorable senators opposite declare that it is fair and just to impose a luxury tax on these people simply because they own a motor vehicle. Many of these lorry drivers are not earning the equivalent of the basic wage. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Extension of time granted.&#93;</inline></para>

                        <para>Another matter to which I would direct attention is the housing problem in our capital cities and larger country centres where development is taking place. I well remember the promises of a housing programme made by Government supporters during the last election campaign, and I regret that the budget contains no provision to honour the pledges then given. Lack of accommodation is forcing many married people to live under most undesirable conditions, some even in tents. Although Ministers and their supporters admit that housing is a national problem which should be handled by the Commonwealth Government, no action has been taken by the centralGovernment, with the exception of its building programme in Canberra, since the sum of &#163;4,000,000 was made available by the Commonwealth Bank very many years ago. If the Government has any serious intention to honour its promises in this matter no further time should be lost. Homes should be provided for the workers in Tasmania and the other States. This is definitely a Commonwealth responsibility. If the State  governments could obtain the necessary money they would be only too willing to launch a home building programme; but because of the existing financial relations with the. the Commonwealth, they have not the ways and means to carry out this very important work. If the Commonwealth Bank Board comprised members whose personal interests were not also identical with those of private banking institutions, it would not be quite so difficult for State governments to obtain finance for this purpose through the Loan Council. I can assure the Senate that if the Government of Tasmania could obtain the necessary money, it would be only too willing to tackle the housing problem in that State. The position being as I have stated, full responsibility in this matter rests on the Commonwealth Government. </para>

                        <para>. - I protest against the action of the Government in adjourning the Senate so early this evening when there is so much useful legislation to be considered. Why were we not allowed to deal with other matters on the notice-paper? Until the end of last week honorable senators and members of the House of Representatives were gravely concerned with events overseas. Now that the international situation has been cleared up to some extent, important matters affecting the people of Australia should be dealt with by this Parliament.- </para>

                    <para class="block">Parliament, there is -serious work for Ministers to perform. I assure the honorable senator that if he gives to all matters the attention which his utterances to-night indicate that he will give before this session has expired, he will have ample opportunity to do all the work he desires. I also remind those honorable gentlemen who are not yet familiar, with parliamentary procedure that the Government has ready a number of measures which cannot yet be introduced in this chamber owing to certain provisions of the Constitution. If honorable senators are anxious to settle down to business, I can assure them that the Government has in hand measures which will keep them fully occupied until the Christmas recess. </para>
