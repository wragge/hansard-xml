                    <para>As a somewhat similar measure received the endorsement of this chamber so recently as June last, it seems unnecessary for me to go into any great detail in submitting this bill for the consideration of honorable senators. I propose, however, to make such observations as will enable them to refresh their memories as to the reasons for the introduction of the measure, and also as to the object of some of its principal provisions. </para>
                    <para>The appointment of an Inter-State Commission is contemplated by the Constitution. A similar body had been functioning in the United States of America for several years prior to the federation of Australia, and it was to be expected that the representatives of- the various Australian States who helped to frame the Constitution would be conversant with the work of that commission and would, accordingly, suggest the creation of such a body as part of the machinery of government in the federation then about to be established. Some independent body was considered to be necessary to adjust the varying interests of the different States, to preserve the balance between them, and to ensure that constitutional guarantees and requirements would be fulfilled. And so itcame about that section 101, which began - ##"## There shall be an Inter-State Commission ##"## was included in the Constitution. The creation of such a body is, therefore, in the words of the Royal Commission on the Finances of Western Australia, ##"## one of the terms of the federal partnership agreement. It is in the bond ##"##. </para>
                    <para>Although the section creating the commission is mandatory, the powers to be conferred on it  are  in the discretion of  the  Parliament. Section  101  of the Constitution did, in fact, give some indication of the nature of these powers, but just what they will, in fact, be, this Parliamenthas to decide. The commission is to have ##"##such powers of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and  ##'##Commerce,  and. of laws made thereunder ##"##. </para>
                    <para>Other provisions of the Constitution which relate to the commission are sections 73, 102, 103 and 104. Under section 73, appeals lie to the High Court from the commission, but as to questions of law only. . Section 103 deals with the appointment and tenure of members of the commission; whilst sections 102 and 104 are concerned with preferences on State railways. These provisions in the Constitution contemplate the existence of an interstate commission, and some go so far as to show that the commission is an essential instrument for the proper working of the Constitution.On the latter ground alone there is sufficient reason for making proper provision to enable the commission to function. </para>
                    <para>There is, as honorable senators are no doubt aware, already an act onthe statute-book dealing with the Inter-State Commission, and a commission did function for several years. Certain provisions of that act, the Inter-State Commission Act 1912, which purported to confer judicial powers on the commission, were declared by a majority decision of the High Court to be beyond the power of the </para>
                    <para class="block">Commonwealth Parliament. As a consequence, the original commission was deprived of a considerable part of its power in relation to the control, regulation, execution or maintenance of the commerce provisions of the Constitution. The original commission went out of existence on the expiration of the term of appointment of the members, and no further appointments have since been made. The work that could have been entrusted to the commission has not, however, been allowed to remain undone. Several bodies such as royal commissions, the Tariff Board, and the Commonwealth Grants Commission, have been performing some of the functions that would have been assigned to an interstate commission had it been functioning. Without minimizing the good work already performed by the bodies mentioned, the Government believes that the time has arrived when it is desirable that some phases at least of the investigating work entrusted to special bodies should be assigned to a permanent body. By this means, investigations will be co-ordinated and, with the passage of the years, the members of the investigating body will acquire a valuable knowledge of the scope and purpose of the##'## Constitution and, more especially, of those provisions relating to interstate trade and commerce. </para>
                    <para>The proposed interstate commission will have, among its functions, the important responsibility of investigating matters referred to it by the Governor-General. The investigating functions of the commission will prove a valuable aid to this Parliament in coming to decisions on the momentous questions put before it from time to time. Is there any member of this chamber who thinks it possible for honorable senators to investigate the factual basis for the provisions of all measures put before them? The mass of detail is well-nigh overwhelming, and it is proper that Parliament should pass on to other bodies the function of gathering in, sifting, and weighing information which may be useful in dealing with measures submitted to Parliament. Parliament has the duty of directing policy, and of indicating, so far as legislative action is necessary, the path of social and economic development in the light of ascertained knowledge. I shall not en- large further on the importance of the proposed powers of investigation. The necessity for being well-informed on the material side in order to give effect to ideals has long been recognized. In commending the original measure in 1911, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom referred to the necessity for investigating bodies as adjuncts to legislative bodies. The highly complex state of modern civilization in which there is so much specialization of function necessitates the creation of one or more organs of government, as adjuncts to legislative bodies, capable of conducting the investigation work so necessary for the proper discharge of parliamentary duties. Members must have the guidance of experts and others who have made a special study of the matters on which they are called to deliberate. </para>
                    <para>For purposes of discussion, the bill may be regarded as dealing with four matters; first, the constitution of the commission ; secondly, investigations by the commission; thirdly, interstate traffic; and, fourthly, several machinery provisions which will facilitate the work of the commission. The commission will consist of five members instead of three as was proposed in the measure before the Senate in June. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that aspect on the proper occasion. These members will be appointed by the Governor-General. One of the members must have been a justice of the High Court, a State Supreme Court judge, or a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than five years standing. Such member will not necessarily be the  chairman  of the commission. The term of appointment of members, as required by section 103 of the Constitution, is to be seven years. The provisions as to removal from office also follow the terms of that section, which also requires the salaries of the commissioners to be fixed by Parliament, and the salaries so fixed are not to be diminished during their continuance in office. Accordingly, the bill provides for a salary of ##£##2,000 per annum for the  chairman,  and ##£##1,500 for each of the other commissioners. These amounts were ##£##2,500 and ##£##2,000, respectively, in the 1937 hill. The salaries of members are, of course, to be exclusive of travelling expenses incurred by them in the discharge of the duties of their office. It is proposed that such sums shall be paid for travelling expenses as the Governor- General may consider reasonable. </para>

                    <para>The commission will be authorized to hold sittings in any part of the Commonwealth. This authority will, however, be subjected to any regulations made by the Governor-General as to the sittings of the commission. Three commissioners are to form a quorum for the conduct of the business of the commis sion, and at least three commissioners must concur in every determination of the commission. It may happen that the commission is required to conduct an inquiry, or other business, which does not warrant the presence of all five commissioners at the one time. It is proposed, therefore, that the commission shall have the power to appoint a committee consisting of two or more of its members to conduct the inquiry or other business. The committee so appointed will furnish to the commission a report on the inquiry or other business conducted or performed. The commissioners are to devote the whole of their time to the performance of their duties, and they are expressly required not to exercise any power or function conferred on them under the act in any matter in which they are directly or indirectly interested. </para>

                    <para>Seven classes of matters are set out in this sub-clause. The first two, namely, those set out in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> directly relate to interstate trade and commerce. These paragraphs contemplate inquiries on a number of aspects of interstate commerce. Inquiries on these matters may be initiated either on reference by the Governor-General or on the complaint of any State. Paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">c, d</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> are taken from the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act, and comprise the functions at present entrusted to the Grants Commission. </para>
                    <para>Reports of the Inter-State Commission on applications for financial assistance to the States may be laid before Parliament. Where it is proposed to introduce legislation relating to the subject of a report on any such application, it is essential that the report be laid before each House of Parliament before the proposed law is introduced. </para>
                    <para>The terms of paragraphf are probably sufficiently wide to cover the subjects referred to in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">c, d</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">e.</inline> However, it goes further and enables the Governor-General to require the commission to report on any matter affecting the financial relations of the Commonwealth and any State, whether a question of financial assistance is or is not involved. </para>
                    <para>The final paragraph - paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> - is a residuary provision, which, in effect, will constitute the commission a standing Royal Commission. It authorizes inquiries on such other matters, whether related or not to any of the matters specified in clause 18, which the Governor-General refers to the commission. </para>
                    <para>Part IV. of the bill is directly connected with sections 102 and 104 of the Constitution, which are designed to prevent undue preferences and discriminations on State railways with respect to interstate commerce. Shortly, the Constitution empowers Parliament to prohibit undue preferences or discriminations. It is a question of fact, however, whether a particular railway rate or difference of treatment is a preference or ##'## discrimination, and the Constitution has assigned to the commission the function of deciding such matters: In the event of the commission adjudging that there is undue preference or discrimination, the Attorney-General may institute proceedings in the High Court for restraining any State from continuing such preference or discrimination. The commission may commence investigations as to alleged contraventions of the provisions of Part IV., either on its own motion or on the complaint of certain authorities specified in the bill. Included in these authorities are the Commonwealth, the States, local governing bodies and certain commercial, industrial and agricultural bodies. Any of these authorities may appear at an investigation if the commission believes that the authority is or may beaffected by the inquiry. </para>
                    <para>It is hardly necessary for me to elaborate at this stage on the machinery provisions of the measure. Among the more important are those relating to the annual report of the commission, the taking of evidence, and the tendering oftrade secrets in evidence. The commission will submit an annual report of its work to the Governor-General. Such report will be in addition to the reports of any special investigations it makes during any particular year. Ordinarily, evidence will be given in public, but in cases where the commission considers it desirable in the public interest that evidence be takenin private, the commission will be obliged to do so. Closely associated with the taking of evidence in private is the tendering of trade secrets or information concerning the profits or financial position of particular interests. Interested parties may object to evidence being given as to trade secrets or their profits or financial position.When this objection is made, evidence may not sub sequently be given on these matters except in pursuance of a direction from the commission. A similar provision already appears in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </para>
                    <para>I have given a brief explanation of the principal provisions of the bill which should, I think, give a sufficiently comprehensive idea of its scope and purpose. </para>
                    <para>The re-constitution of the commission will complete the machinery contemplated by the Constitution to ensure its smooth working.It has been stated by that eminent constitutionalist, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick, that ##"## One of the main arguments for Australian Federation was the desirability of establishing a system of free trade and commerce between the Australian communities.##"## It is obvious, therefore, that there should be some means of maintaining interstate free trade, and the proposed commission will perform a most useful function in keeping an oversight of such trade. With the re-constitution of the commission, all parts of the Constitution will be functioning, and there will be in existence a body which will be in a position to do much good in investigating State grievances, more especially in the matter of trade and commerce. The knowledge that there is such a body as the commission will probably be sufficient to deter any action likely to contravene the constitutional provisions in relation to trade and commerce. 1##'## stress, too, the value of the commission as an adjunct to Parliament and the Executive. </para>
                    <para>The underlying principles of this measure have already been assented to by this chamber, and I feel confident that the same support will be afforded to this bill. As a representative in thischamber of one of the less populous States, which has always advocated an observance of the terms of the Constitution, it affords me great pleasure to submit his measure to the Senate. </para>

                        <para>Australia is &lt;a party to an International Convention for the amelioration of the condition of the wounded and sick in armies -in the field, signed at Geneva on the 27th July, 1929. This convention, which is popularly referred to as the Geneva Convention, came into force, so far as Australia is concerned, on the 23rd December, 1931, or six months after the deposit of the instrument of ratification. The convention is concerned with the treatment of the wounded and sick of combatants in time of war. The protection, of medical staffs and buildings and equipment is also provided for. In order to assist in the protection of the medical services of armed forces, the convention makes provision for a distinctive emblem by which those engaged in such services In,i J##'## be readily distinguished from combatants. The emblem of a red cross ou a white ground may, with the permission of the competent military authorities, figure on flags, armlets and material belonging to the medical services. Under article 24 of the convention, the emblem of the red cross on a white ground and the words ##"##Red Cross##"## or ##"##Geneva Cross##"## are not to be used, either in time of peace or in time of war, except to protect or to indicate the medical formations and establishments and the personnel and material protected by the convention. Certain voluntary aid societies may, in accordance with local law, use the red cross in connexion with their humanitarian activities in time of peace. With a view to protecting the red cross from being used in##'## circumstances other than those permitted under the convention, article 2S requires the governments of the high contracting parties whose legislation is not at present adequate for the purpose, to take the necessary legislative measures to prohibit, in certain, circumstances, the use of the red cross and the Arms of the Swiss Confederation and imitations thereof. Clause 4 sets out the circumstances in which the Red Cross and those arms are not to be used. It provides that a person shall not, without Hie authority of the Minister, use for the purposes of his trade or business or for any other purpose whatsoever the Red Cross, the words ##"## Red  Cross  ##"## or ##"## Geneva Cross ##"## or the federal colours of Switzerland. </para>

                    <para>The convention referred to is not the first one dealing with the protection of the Red Cross and the words ##"## Red Cross ##"## or ##"## Geneva Cross.##"## A convention dated the 6th June, 1906, also dealt with this matter, and legislation to ensure this protection was enacted in the United Kingdom in 1911. The Geneva Convention Act of 19.11 applied throughout  His  Majesty##'##s dominions. That act and the convention of 1906 do not, however, cover the protection of the .arms of the Swiss Confederation nor imitations of the Red Cross, which matter is dealt with in Article 28 of the new convention. The Parliament of the United Kingdom recently passed an act to enable effect to be given to Article 2S. This act is limited in scope because of the existing legislation of 1911 which covers several of the matters dealt with in Article 28. It is not proposed that thi3 measure should be extended to the Commonwealth, and in order to make it quite clear that the Commonwealth has the necessary power to enact legislation to give effect to Article 28 a special provision - section 2 - was inserted in the British act. This section also enables the Commonwealth Parliament to enact that the act of 1911 shall cease to extend to the Commonwealth and its territories. Accordingly, the present bill deals with all the matters referred to in Article 28 of the Convention and provides for the termination of the extension of the 1911 act to the Commonwealth and the Territories of Papua and Norfolk Island. Such, briefly, is the purport of the measure and I confidently commend it to the favorable consideration of honorable senators. </para>

The reservation reads - ##"## I declare that my signature of this Convention in respect of the Commonwealth of Australia is subject to the understanding that the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia will interpret Article 28 of the Convention in the sense that the legislative measures contemplated by that Article may provide that private individuals, associations, firms or companies who have used the Arms of the Swiss Confederation or marks constituting an imitation thereof, for any lawful purpose before the coming into force of the present Convention shall not be prevented from continuing to use such Arms or marks for the same purpose.##"##

Certain firms have used that trade mark for some time and to compel them to cease using it would, appear to be rather unfair. At the same time the perpetuation of the use of the Red Cross as a trade mark by a particular firm would afford that undertaking an unfair advantage over its competitors. </para>

                    <para>On the 20th April, 1929, an International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency was signed at Geneva. The Convention was signed in respect of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and was subsequently ratified in respect of those parts of His Majesty##'##s dominions. </para>
                    <para>Provision is made in the Convention for other countries to accede, but before accession can be notified it is necessary that the legislative and administrative organization of the country proposing to accede shall be in conformity with the rules contained in the Convention. </para>
                    <para>Briefly, the object of the Convention is the establishment of effective means for ensuring the prevention and punishment of offences with respect to the counterfeiting of currency. In order to carry out this object, the contracting parties agree to punish certain offences. These offences . are set out in- Article 3 of the Convention and include the fraudulent making! or altering of currency, the fraudulent uttering of counterfeit currency, the introduction into a country of counterfeit currency, and the fraudulent making, receiving or obtaining of instruments for counterfeiting or altering currency. In the punishment of these offences, no distinction is to be made .between offences in relation to domestic currency and foreign currency. Consideration has been given to the terms of the Convention and the Government feels that it is most desirable that the Commonwealth should be a party to it. Legislative and administrative action is, however, necessary before accession can be notified in respect of the Commonwealth. The bill contains some of the provisions necessary to enable effect to be given to the Convention in the Commonwealth. Other amendments of the law will he necessary. These will be the subject of other measures, including an extradition bill which will come before the Senate later. The bill is limited to enacting that certain offences in relation to the forgery of foreign bank notes  are to be indictable offences. Offences in relation to the metallic currency of foreign countries are already dealt with in the Crimes Act. The object of this measure is to extend the provisions of that act to deal with foreign bank notes, including currency notes. The making of instruments for forging such notes is also to be an indictable offence. </para>

                    <para>This measure is complementary to the Crimes Bill which I have just explained to honorable senators. Under Article 10 of the Counterfeiting Currency Convention, offences relating to currency are to be deemed to be included as extradition crimes in any extradition treaty which has been or may subsequently be concluded, between any of the parties to the Convention. These offences include attempts to commit offences in connexion with counterfeit currency. </para>
                    <para>Australia is already a party to extradition treaties with several of the parties to the Convention and it is desirable that extradition legislation in force in the Commonwealth should include within its scope the offences mentioned in the Convention. Existing legislation covers all the offences contemplated in the Convention except attempts to commit offences. </para>
                    <para>Legislation with respect to extradition is partly imperial and partly Commonwealth. The imperial legislation has already been amended by the Counterfeit Currency (Convention) Act 1935, to bring within its scope attempts to forge bank notes and attempts to counterfeit money, and these amendments are to a certain extent already in force in the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>The machinery provisions of the Commonwealth act operate, however, in respect only of the offences specified in the imperial extradition acts referred to in the Commonwealth act. The acts prior to 1935 are referred to, and the purpose of the present bill is to extend the references to include the amendments made by the imperial act of 1935. </para>

                    <para>. - At the outset of my remarks  I  deprecate very strongly the practice which is becoming all too common in this chamber of introducing important debates by means of ministerial statements. The opinion of the Opposition is that any information which Ministers may wish to impart to honorable senators concerning the problems covered by such statements may more decorously be given on the motion for the second reading  of  the measures dealing with them,  or  while the bills are in committee. In recent years ministerial statements have been read to us, followed by motions for the printing of the papers. The subject-matter of a statement may or may not be discussed further. It may appear on the Senate notice-paper but not be proceeded with - I am not suggesting that this will happen in this case - and it may be used as a stop-gap subject  for  debate if proceedings in another place are  not  sufficiently advanced to enable business to be sent to this chamber. I register the opinion of the Opposition that this is not the proper way to conduct Senate business. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The paper now under discussion deals with three items of business so closely inter-related that it is very difficult to model one##'##s speeches on any one of them without trespassing on the other; this leads to considerable overlapping of debate. For example, we have already had a ministerial statement on foreign policy, and a similar declaration on defence, and later we shall have before us a loan bill which we shall be expected to debate fully, and which we should debate fully, if we are to do our job in the way it should be done. </para>
                <para>I was interested to learn, during the week-end adjournment of the Senate, that some authorities, apart from those who support Labour##'##s policy, approve of my declaration with regard to the way in which the business of this Parliament is being conducted.

An Australian Associated Press cablegram received from London on Monday last states - ##"## The first step has been taken towards a healthier and saner state of things in Europe,##"## said the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chamberlain)</inline> in moving in the House of Commons to-night approval of the Anglo-Italian Agreement. </para>
                <para class="block">The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> now tells us definitely that nothing of the sort has occurred. He says that the position in Europe has become definitely worse because of recent happenings, and that something exceptional in the way of defence expenditure must be submitted to this Parliament. </para>
                <para>Addressing members of the Summer School of Political Science, in Canberra, on the 29th January the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> is reported to have said that it would be very difficult to expand the defence forces at any greater rate than was being done at present. Since that statement was made <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> has declared that the position has become easier. Yet the Leader of the Senate now says that things have become worse. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> went on to say that the Defence Department had been the only federal , department in recent years that had been able to write its own ticket, and he gave the assurance that this arrangement would continue. That is a shameful public statement by a responsible Minister. </para>

                        <para>- I should not have to make these statements if honorable senators were more continuously informed of what is going on. We cannot be so informed when the Senate does not meet for long periods. We have just assembled after an adjournment extending from the 12th December, 1937, to the 27th April, 1938. If I am, as it were, casting into the darkness, I should be excused. Perhaps I may be permitted to ask whether everything in the nature of social services and developmental work is to be starved during the term covered by the Government##'##s defence programme, while at the same time the Defence Department continues to write its own ticket. If so, the Opposition, though small in numbers, will, to the full extent of its capacity, block every proposal as it comes along, and, later, when its numbers are augmented, the Government will experience the utmost difficulty in getting its proposals through this chamber. We are not willing to accept money from the taxpayers of this country unless we earn it; and we cannot do our duty to them if essential information is withheld from us. </para>

The statement which has been presented to us does not contain details of the expenditure outlined in it. Before we go a step further, we should take steps to ensure that the Australian nation gets the best possible value for every penny expended. Our most important duty is to undertake developmental \v0rk3 within the Commonwealth which will be of value from a defence point of view. We do not know how much, if any, of this money is to be expended on the making of new military roads, the improvement of existing roads, the strengthening of existing bridges or the construction of new ones. We do not know whether the standardization of the railway gauges is to be proceeded with. </para>

                        <para>- No ; but I and other members of the Opposition are just as trustworthy as is the Minister who interjected. Every member of this chamber should be told the basic principle underlying the statement which has been submitted to the Senate. The press has been told those things which the Minister suggests should be kept secret. Its representatives at home and abroad know the number and the calibre of the guns which are to constitute our shore batteries. Does the Minister think that other nations do not know these things? They have their own secret services, as has the British Empire. The attitude of the Labour party is that it will not, without protest, allow Australia to be involved in complications resulting from secret agreements and diplomatic machinations of which the people are told nothing. Information which is given to the press is withheld from members of the Opposition, who nevertheless are expected to discuss intelligently the Government##'##s proposals. </para>

                        <para>- It is deplorable that so much money should be provided for assets which, immediately they are acquired, begin to become obsolescent, and long before they are paid for will be entirely useless. That would be bacl enough of itself, but the position is much worse when we reflect that some of the money required to procure these things is to be borrowed abroad. I hope that honorable senators do not think that I am giving expression to these sentiments merely for the sake of criticizing the measure as Leader of the Opposition. I am voicing what I believe to be constructive Australian criticism against the proposals now before us. which are entirely anti-Australian from start to finish, and were never intended to be anything else. </para>

                <para>The Government has offered no evidence whatever that it intends to spend any money on anything which does not come within the term, ##"## wasting assets.##"## Not one word has been said about new roads, or the strengthening of roads already in existence, or about the standardization of railway gauges. Only a few days ago a New South Wales railway system broke down because a few thousand people wanted to travel on it to see the Air Force pageant at Richmond.  In  another place, the Government has given the reply that the breaks of gauge are not really a bad thing because the transfer of troops at. such points would give them a chance to rest. What a futile and wonderful statement to  come  from a Government which, six years ago, declared that in the interests of defence and with the object of providing employment for thousands of Australians unable to secure work, it intended to go right ahead with the standardization of railway gauges. To-day, we find this national Parliament with a row on its hands with the Government of .##"##New South Wales, which is not a Labour government - if it were, the row would not have arisen - because some genius has devised a means of overcoming the##'## break of gauge and the conservative Premier of that State says that the Commonwealth Government cannot have the device. This nationalminded . gentleman - and he is one of those who call themselves Nationalists and allege that the country,##]##s in danger of being confronted with a national emergency - will not yield up a device designed to facilitate the transfer of troops from one part of Australia to another. Such conditions make one feel that it is hopeless to say anything; rather is one inclined to let the Government go ahead and destroy itself. </para>

                <para>Such statements explain this war hysteria. Every member of this Government knows very well that Australia is not in any danger from a foreign aggressor; they know that our only danger is that if we talk along the lines of the statement made to this chamber by the Minister a few days ago we might talk ourselves into a war. That is the only chance we have of becoming involved  in  war. If wc decided that our best contribution to the defence of the Empire is by defending against foreign aggression Australia with its enormous coastline, its 7,000,000 people, and the millions of British capital invested here, we would be m  Eking  the greatest and most serviceable contribution to imperial defence ##'##that  could be made. An honorable senator opposite referred to Singapore, but one of the first things to do in the defence of Australia is to provide docks in which ships disabled in defending our coastline could be efficiently and rapidly repaired. Even to-day overseas vessels visiting Australian ports which become damaged below the waterline have to be taken thousands of miles before they reach a graving dock where they can be properly repaired. Some speak of defending Australia from Singapore. Apparently the Government is seeing things. </para>

                        <para>- There is no evidence of that in the statement, and especially in connexion with the loan proposals there is no evidence that the Government is prepared to conscript every penny of the privately owned wealth of the nation. The Government ought to be prepared to commandeer those great resources to which it has access should this country be attacked. The Government and those supporting it must now have a definite idea of the attitude of the Opposition in this chamber towards defence. We believe that this country should be adequately defended against foreign aggression, and that in no other circumstances whatever should it become involved in war. We believe that if we declared to the world a sane policy of friendly co-operation- with other nations our peace would not be threatened ; if we also set about developing our resources in the way we should, so giving employment to tens of thousands of men now. una bie to get it and enabling them to become physically and mentally fit, then, if, unfortunately war should come, they would be capable of defending Australia. We are averse from borrowing abroad or purchasing or constructing cruisers in any other country but Australia. If cruisers required for the defence of Australia were constructed in this country, we would have the vessels immediately they were completed and the wages paid to the men engaged in construction would be circulated in this country, thus adding to the stability of the nation. I am tired of hearing this Singapore rubbish that has been fired across the chamber. </para>

The British Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> said that Britain would be unable to protect our trade, routes should war occur. If war does occur, directly affecting us, no country will suffer less than Australia, because we have sufficient to provide for our own needs. We can continue to live comfortably in this country and adequately protect it against foreign aggressors. We know that the war. mongers are thundering at our doors, but if we take adequate precautions of the nature suggested, by the Labour party, the whole outlook will be altered. At, any rate on occasions like this we have a glorious opportunity to declare that within the confines of Australia, there are hundreds of thousands of persons, represented in this chamber and in the House of Representatives by the Opposition, who are opposed to war, who definitely declare their faith in a policy of friendly co-operation with other nations, and who at the same time indicate quite definitely that they are prepared to defend this country if unfortunately it should be attacked. </para>

                    <para>The question arises now, what is the policy for which these programmes are designed? I will try to put that in the form of a general statement. The corner Stone of our defence policy must bc the security of the United Kingdom. Our main strength lies in the resources of man power, productive capacity, and endurance in this country, and unless these can be maintained not only in peace but in the early stages of war, when they will be the subject of continuous attack, our defeat would be certain whatever might be the fate of secondary spheres elsewhere. Therefore, our first main efforts must have two main objectives: we must protect this country and wc must preserve the trade routes upon which we depend for our food and raw materials. </para>

                    commenced his speech this afternoon by complaining against the action of the Leader of the Government in making a further statement to the Senate instead of introducing the bill forecast by him last week. He apparently objected to the adoption of that course on the ground that it afforded the Government two opportunities of placing its policy before the country.

                    <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline>
                    a journal for which he has so much admiration. But the complaint of that newspaper is that the Government is denying to Parliament the opportunity to discuss these matters. The honorable senator cannot have ##'##it both ways. On the one hand he complains against the Government giving to the Senate two opportunities for the discussion of this subject, while on the other hand he supports the complaint of the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>
                    that such opportunities are denied to honorable senators.

What <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> was endeavouring to explain on that occasion was that if there were any limitations upon defence proposals, such limitations were not imposed by the Treasurer, but by the capacity of the country to produce the necessary materials. In his statement to-day the Leader of the Government has clearly shown that a considerable proportion of the proposed expenditure is to be devoted, not so much to the purchase of arms, as to the provision of means of producing arms and munitions in this country. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that a bridge has not yet been constructed across the Brisbane river, but I do not know whether that would come within the category of a developmental undertaking, even in the opinion of the honorable senator, who also criticized the proposed capital expenditure because it is to be used upon wasting assets. He has made to-day certain statements and allegations which cause me seriously to doubt whether the Labour party has a defence policy at all. It must be remembered that warships, aeroplanes and field guns are all wasting assets. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think we could achieve much success with a navy without a warship. We might perhaps present a resolution to the enemy. The honorable senator referred at length to developmental works. I favour works of that character wherever they are justified, but self-preservation is the first law of nature, not only for individuals, but also for nations, and it would he useless to undertake an extensive policy of developmental works <inline font-style="italic">unless</inline> we were able to defend this country. The fact that certain countries have developed at a very rapid rate in recent years has not protected them from war or invasion. The last ten years have, I suppose, seen greater development in China than occurred in any century during the last 1,000 years, but that has not saved that country from invasion. The Chinese people to-day, I venture to say, feel the need not only of t he development that should have been carried on continuously during the last 50 years, but also the lack of armaments. As the honorable senator has concluded his speech, one of his colleagues could, perhaps, inform the Senate of the Labour party##'##s idea of developmental works. I have had occasion to study the loan programmes submitted by various State governments, and to apply the term ##"##developmental works ##"## to certain of the proposals, would require a great deal of imagination. The standarization of railway gauges is, I agree, very desirable, but not one penny has been provided under any State loan programme during the last ten years for that purpose. </para>

                    PEARCE.At one moment members of the Labour party say that they recognize the necessity for adequate defence, while the next moment they allege that the proposed expenditure upon defence is based on war hysteria. I should like to know how members of the party reconcile those two statements. This again would appear to indicate uncertainty on the part of the party on the question of providing for the effective defence of this country. The honorable senator delivered a long harangue based upon an extraordinary statement in an extraordinary newspaper, which indicted certain companies, such as Dalgety ##&amp;## Co., Goldsbrough Mort ##&amp;## Co., and two of the leading Australian banks. To these companies the honorable senator apparently attributed the existence of the war hysteria to which he has referred.

We should indeed be fools if we did not recognize the fact that throughout the world there is a dread of war. The fear of war in Australia is, I venture to say, not to be compared with that existing to-day in Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland, France, and Poland, or even Switzerland. With the exception of the men who participated in the last war, Australians do not know the meaning of war. But the countries to which I have referred are surrounded by millions of armed men and at any time the sky may be darkened by squadrons of death-dealing aeroplanes. The fear of the inhabitants of those countries is not hysteria; it is a real and well founded fear of war, and it is that fear that has caused Great Britain, which visualizes the possibility of London being laid in ruins, to make provision for theaerial defence of that great capital. </para>

Surely the Leader of the Opposition and his friends realize that a policy of isolation would be fraught with the gravest danger to this country.

                    <para>. - I resent the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the defence policy of the Australian Labour party is isolationist in character. I do not remember reading or listening to any speech made by a responsible member of our party in favour of Australia isolating itself from the rest of the Empire in regard to defence. During the last election campaign I emphasized the salient points of Labour##'##s defence policy, and declared that any one who said that we desired to cut ourselves adrift from the rest of the Empire was ii liar. We have a defence policy, and I. think it is well known to honorable senators. We have in the past voted for the spending of many millions of pounds for the development of Australian defence. There is,- however, a difference between our policy and that put forward by the Government. We believe first in home defence. We realize the need for self reliance because of the 12,000 miles which separates Australia from Great Britain, and we recognize that in time of great danger to the Mother Country the special needs of Australia might be overlooked by British naval and military authorities. For this reason we believe in the development, to the fullest extent, of proposals for home defence, and we attach much importance to the expansion of the air arm, the minimum air force, in our view, being 300 machines. We do not believe in relying solely on a navy which comprises vessels of varying degrees of obsolescence. It is gratifying to know that the Government has made some concessions to our view because considerable expenditure is now contemplated on the expansion of the Australian Air Force. It is essential that we should be equipped with the most modern machines. I say this, because some of the machines now being used are not up-to-date. Only a few months ago when a squadron of Air Force planes set out from Melbourne for New South Wales and Queensland, seven or eight, machines had to make forced landings and one young man lost his life. I am not -sure that the proposed expenditure on the cruisers <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Canberra</inline> will bring those vessels up to date and put them in a fit condition to meet any emergency of war. In this view I have the support of certain naval authorities, having regard also to the geographical position of the Commonwealth. It is stated that the function of these vessels, when they are refitted, will be to keep open our trade routes. I would remind the Senate, however, that if another war occurs our position will be entirely different from what it was in 1914. If, because of economic and national antagonisms,  out  enemy is a power in the Pacific, can we expect our cruiser strength to be able to defend our trade -routes? And can we pretend that the financial resources of Australia are sufficient to support a navy large enough to ensure the adequate defence of our commerce lanes, if a certain power, whose name has been mentioned, should be Oil T enemy ? </para>

We do not believe in isolation. We do believe that bur first duty is to develop our home defences to the greatest extent possible. Even the Prime Minister of Great Britain <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chamberlain)</inline> . in a recent speech declared that Britain##'##s primary consideration in war must be naval strength in British waters for home defence, and added that afterwards it might be possible for Britain to recover losses sustained elsewhere. We contend that if the portents are read aright we should be misleading the people of this country if we gave them to understand that the expenditure outlined in the Government##'##s programme would safeguard Australia in the way that it should be protected. Our view is that the first duty of the Commonwealth Government is to make secure our home defences, without relying upon any other part of the Empire. </para>

                <para>Great Britain is expending millions oi pounds in strengthening its naval forces for the purpose of defending trade routes, upon which the Mother Country depends. The annual drain on the Australian national income, for the payment of interest on British investments, public and private, in this country amounts, to approximately ##£##50,000,000. Therefore it is merely common sense on the part of Britain, which##'## imports enormous quantities of foodstuffs and other primary products from Australia in return for capital invested in this country, to protect the trade routes. </para>

                        <para>- My Leader mentioned the profits made out  of  defence expenditure. It is amazing that nations should bc willing to tolerate a system whereby, millions of pounds are wrung from the community to  pay  interest on war loans which were issued  for  the prosecution of the last war.  The  people have become so used to  the  modern economic system of profit-making and interest-taking that they do not object to thousands laying down their lives  and  thousands more being injured and wrecked for the course  of their lives,  whilst the investments  of capitalists  remain sacrosanct. When  future generations  look back upon the  present period of economic development, they will be staggered to realize that lives were offered willingly, but money only grudgingly. </para>

                <para>The contemplated loan for defence purposes will be interest-bearing. The Labour party is of the opinion that the people of this generation should provide that money and not ask their descendants to pay interest on it for 10, 20, 50 or even 100 years. The position is accepted because the people have been , reared. in an atmosphere in which life and security are regarded as of less importance than interest and capitalistic system. We say definitely that if money is to be raised for the defence of Australia, it should be taken by taxation from those who have it, and not by loan on which interest will be payable year after year. Honorable senators opposite remain silent. They accept without question a system which enables intereston war loans to be paid in perpetuity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> spoke dramatically of the situation in Europe - of the fear in the hearts of the people, especially those on or near national borders. He spoke of the possibility of aeroplanes dropping bombs on them at any moment. Any one who has thought about the subject must be appalled by what takes place when nations are at war under modern conditions. If we in Australia could do something which would prevent war, there is scarcely a person##'## in the country who would refuse to act. Honorable members opposite should not attempt to disparage those on this side of the chamber who have a hatred of war. In the party to which I owe allegiance there are men and women who, all their lives, have fought vigorously for world peace and yet some of them are being vilified because of their efforts in that direction. </para>

                        <para>- In every community there are some people who gloat inwardly over the misery of their fellows and take delight in the destruction of other people and their possessions. We saw the result of their activities during the struggle for control in Germanyand Italy. The sadist element was let loose in the community. In the streets of Rome and throughout Germany men and women were persecuted and tortured by their fellow men. The lowest dregs of humanity were at liberty to exercise their sadistic instincts, and they took full advantage of the opportunity. Although such persons are to be found in every community, fortunately they are in the minority. The great mass of the people are not of that nature; and in saying that I refer to the supporters of all political parties. On the other side of this chamber are men who are just as anxious for peace as are members of the Opposition. Nevertheless, one of the greatest factors in the community is the power of the capitalistic system, which, unhappily is often greater than the forces in favour of peace. Truly the greed for money is the root of all evil. Those who are obsessed by a desire to increase their bank balances do not see things in their true perspective. Some people are only too ready to forget the struggle for peace, so long as they receive interest on their investmentsregularly. and see their bank balances steadily grow larger. Those associated with the armaments ring are the racketeers of death. Even as I speak, giant bombers in China, Spain and elsewhere are destroying innocent men, women and children, because of the desire of some people to accumulate wealth. A committee of the League of Nations which was set up to investigate the ramifications of the armament firms of the world, found, among other things, that such firms had been active in fomenting war scares, persuading various countries to adopt war-like policies, and attempting to bribe government officials. The committee found, further, that that they had disseminated false reports concerning the programmes of other countries ; had sought to mould public opinion by obtain- ing control of newspapers in their own and foreign countries; had organized international armament rings; had organized trusts to increase the prices of armaments and had sought to increase their sales by playing off one country against another. 1 emphasize that these are the conclusions, not of Labour organizations, Communists or Quakers, but of a com,mittee of the League of Nations. I do not. know to what extent the financial institutions in this country arc connected with similar institutions overseas. But, we do know that within Australia, there is a link between the banks and the big industrial and mortgage companies; that directors of banks are directors of mortgage companies and other big firms. We know also that there is a link between many firms in Australia and armament firms and trusts in the Old Country. During the last two years, the prices of shares of armament companies have soared sky-high, and the dividends paid by them have increased enormously. That is why we on this side of the chamber are fearful that, as the result of the Government##'##s policy in respect of defence expenditure, what is happening in older countries may happen here. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator apparently suggests that we are isolated in this respect; that we are not contaminated by what occurs in older countries. If that were true, I would be very pleased, but any one who has studied##'## the subject knows that the financial powers of the old world have their ramifications right throughout the world. Honorable senators opposite should know that. Although some honorable senators may think it amusing, we on this side believe that it is wrong for the Government to encourage the production of necessary equipment for defence, or for offence, in a way that allows private enterprise to profit. Every effort should be made to retain within the control and power of the Government, the production of munitions. That principle is sound. Honorable senators opposite say that we cannot follow. that policy; yet I am informed by the parliamentary representa tive of the district in which the Government munitions factories are established, that within the last few weeks 40 or 50 employees of these establishments have lost their jobs. Has this Government done everything within its power to develop governmental production of war equipment? It now proposes to encourage the participation of private enterprise in this business on lines similar to those adopted in the Old Country. Although the shadow factories in the United Kingdom have been in operation for two years, it was reported in the press only the other, day, that this scheme had not borne fruit, whilst Lord Nuffield, who said at the commencement of the scheme that it .would be a failure, stated publicly that not one engine had been assembled from parts manufactured in the shadow factories. In following its present policy this Government will- have to face not only the dangerous factors involved in the operations of private enterprise, and private profiteering, but also the failure, of a similar scheme in the Old Country,- where industry is much more highly developed. In those circumstances it is questionable whether its efforts will succeed. At any rate, we on this side oppose the Government##'##s proposals if only on the principle that there should be no profiteering in the production of armaments. </para>

We know that the first consideration of private enterprise in every form is the making of profit; that is part of its being, and the leopard could as easily change its spots as could our industrial leaders change their first aim in life - increased interest and increased profit. We have seen evidence of that in other parts of the world, and we say that it will happen here. I rose simply to refute a statement made by an honorable senator opposite, and have tried logically and reasonably, I hope, to express the view of the Labour party. </para>

                    <para>.- 1.  commend the Government for its bold defence policy, which involves the expenditure of an exceptionally large sum of money. No doubt the items of expenditure will be detailed later. One cannot conceive any national government adding to the already heavy burden of the Australian taxpayer, unless such additional expenditure is warranted. I have closely followed the speeches- and utterances of prominent members of the Opposition, inside and outside this Parliament. In their hearts they must know that the Government##'##s policy, considered on broad principles, is sound. Pacts must be faced. The British Government has intimated in no uncertain terms that Britain cannot do more for Australian protection than police our important trade routes. The Anglo- Japanese alliance, which was so valuable to Australia during the Great War, no longer exists. The world##'##s disinclination to follow the path of peace leaves us with no alternative but to take such measures as will make Australia self-contained in its home defence requirements. One, would expect the Opposition to support wholeheartedly this policy, because it will enable Australia to stand on its own feet, and in a sense, to become independent. In framing its defence plan extending over a period of years, the Government has had the expert advice of the service members of the Defence Council. If the Opposition were on the treasury benches, to whom would it look for advice? To the self -same members, I presume. These senior officers have no axe to grind. Each might lean towards the particular service of which  lie  has expert knowledge, but, collectively, they must agree eventually to a- well balanced scheme for the effective protection of the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>One political critic wants to know why the 9.2 inch fortress guns now mounted, or about to be mounted, should not be replaced by  15  inch guns. In the first place, the cost would be enormous; secondly, the 9.2 inch gun is the standard coast defence weapon throughout the British Empire ; thirdly, no hostile battleship would venture within the range of such guns. In keeping out of range no battleship would waste its valuable and limited supply of ammunition at extreme range in the doubtful prospect of destroying some military or key industry objective. Big guns wear out just as quickly as those of lesser calibre. Another critic pins his faith almost entirely to the air service. Nobody is stupid enough to under-estimate the value of aeroplanes in modern warfare. The a##&gt;##r service has, to some extent, taken up the role hitherto carried out by the cavalry. But it has its limitations; the replacement of personnel and machines in the Great War taxed the resources of the Allies. Aeroplanes did not stop the landing of troops in Spain and China. </para>
                <para>Many people are wondering why so much money is required for war equipment. The answer is simple - because we have practically no reserves. Australia supplied soldiers equal to the Empire##'##s best in the Great War, but little or no war equipment. Britain supplied us with weapons and material with which to fight. We are merely making good our lack of supplies which, for home defence, must be immediately available and capable of replenishment locally. </para>
                <para>Anticipating that the Government munition establishment will not, in time of national emergency, be able to meet requirements, trial  orders have  been -placed with a number of private manufacturing firms to ascertain their capabilities. Known as shadow factories, these establishments may, when the necessity arises, receive extensive orders. Unless some action is taken beforehand these firms will make considerable profits. It is of no use leaving the matter to their integrity and patriotism; now is the time to legislate against the possibility of profit-making. The Government factories know to a penny the production costs of every item of defence equipment. </para>
                <para class="block">That should be the basis of outside production, and  I,  for one, would support  a  bill imposing the most searching audit supervision of the manufacture of munitions by private firms, no matter how small or extensive their orders might be. </para>
                <para>Another matter te which.  I  wish to refer is the reported intention of the Government to appoint a British General as Inspector-General of the Australian Army. If such an officer were merely invited to look over our land services and make a report after three or four months##'## observation for the Government##'##s own satisfaction, very few would challenge the suggestion, but an appointment for a term of two years, giving him full powers of executive command, would be an insult to the capable Australian generals still on the active list and the retired generals of the Australian Imperial Forces, although the latter may, perhaps, be temporarily out of touch with the more recent development in modern warfare. The mere suggestion that a British general should be given such an appointment has given the Australian public an idea that there is something wrong with our Army. Any observant general of the Australian Imperial Forces can tell the Government that the. main weakness of our land forces is the paucity and low physical standard of the .personnel. What facts would such an Inspector-General be in possession of or obtain that are not already available to army headquarters in Melbourne? Since the Great War the Defence Department has##'## been in the closest touch with developments in military technique and training through highly qualified liaison staff corps officers sent to England for that purpose. An imported British general is hardly likely at the outset to assimilate Australian conditions and understand the psychology of young Australian soldiers. I trust that the Government will reconsider its decision. It might be an advantage to obtain the services of a selected general of the British Army to report on our young Army, but we should not belittle the present and past generals of the Australian Imperial Force by appointing for two years an overseas officer to such a high position as that of Inspector-General. </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> referred to the position which civil aviation would occupy during war but I remind the honorable senator that civil aviation would be to the Royal Australian Air Force what the mercantile.marine is to the Navy. In an emergency it would immediately be brought under the control of the Air Board. </para>
                <para>There has been some concern because a number of men engaged in rolling brass and copper plates at the munitions factory at Maribyrnong have been dismissed. These plates, which were being rolled for private firms were making canisters and containers, are now to be produced by private firms. Some of these men asked me what could be done, and I understand that as a result of representations to the authorities work was found for many in other branches of the munitions factory. In this connexion I trust that preference to returned soldiers will always be the policy followed. </para>

The party has made the pronouncement through its responsible representatives that if a Labour government were in power it would provide for the adequate defence of Australia in keeping with the capacity of the people.

The British Prime Minister, in outlining the Britishdefence policy, had already made the pronouncement that that is Britain##'##s responsibility, because he realized that Australia would be unable to provide sufficient naval strength for the purpose. This is a matter that should be dealt with calmly and dispassionately. Let us face the facts. By realizing our responsibility as a nation we can best serve the interests of the Empire.

I sometimes think that this has a very important bearing upon the desire of the Government to indulge in borrowing outside Australia at the present time. Approximately ##£##50,000,000 per annum is required to meet interest commitments on overseas loans; and we are required to provide that sum by the production and export of wheat, wool, meat and other products. British investors have, of course, a great deal of money invested in foreign countries, including Argentina, and honorable members are aware that, for the purpose of ensuring payment of interest on those investments, contracts for the supply of wheat and other products are entered into with such countries. Are we to believe that a reduction of the amount borrowed from Great Britain by Australia would mean a reduction of the quantity of produce purchased from Australia? Is the question of what would become of Australian primary products influencing the Government in connexion with the flotation of loans required to carry out its defence programme? I am afraid the Government has not been sufficiently frank. We should, I think, get along very much better if the Government took the representatives of the people in this chamber more into its confidence and disclosed to them the true position. Must we borrow more money on the London market for the purpose of finding a market for our surplus products? The </para>

He should be more frank and take us into his confidence. If that course were adopted, not only the members of this chamber but the people of Australia as a whole would have a greater appreciation of the work performedby the Government. </para>

That is a subject in which I  have taken considerable interest. My view is that up to the present time the Statute of Westminster has not in any way affected the position of Australia in the British Commonwealth of Nations, and I hope sincerely that it will not be adopted by the Commonwealth. This course has not been found necessary during the last seven years, and, so far as I can see, that section of the people which affirms the desirability of its adoption is in the section which is most in favour of isolation and separation from Great Britain. </para>

I do not think anybody does. Two or three years ago, at Adelaide, there was a conference of the most eminent lawyers in Australia to discuss this troublesome statute, and it is significant that many divergent opinions were voiced. Some of the most experienced constitutional authorities were in doubt as to what would be the actual effect of the adoption of the statute. We do know, however, that in the case of the Irish Free State, it has had results that were not anticipated when it was passed. </para>

I do not doubt that the honorable senator would do that. But there are many people who think that when they have said that they are in favour of defence they have done all that could be expected of them; I fear that they do not really appreciate the critical condition of the world at the present time. Therefore it is the duty of those among us in Parliament who have an opportunity to know the trend of world events to give a lead in order that if war does come to this country our defence will be adequate. </para>

                <para>I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> that the next war, if unhappily there should be one, will be fought under conditions totally different from those obtaining in 1914. Then we had a large body of soldiers relatively well trained. The next war might quite conceivably be much nearer home and we should not only be prepared to act quickly, but, so far as possible, we should provide against the possibility of undue panic. Psychology plays an extraordinary part in times of national crisis. Men who are relatively well trained are not so easily perturbed as are men unacquainted with all aspects of war.

I thought he spoke with two voices. At one stage he said that the situation seemed to be much better than it had been; later he admitted that the outlook was not at all good. How any one can say that, at the present time, there is hysteria in this country or in many other countries is beyond my understanding. Let us consider the case of the United States of America, which is an enormous country, free from any possibility of effective attack, and with no enemy in the least likely to assail its shores. Is that country strengthening its forces in every direction merely because it is suffering from some form of hysteria? Of course it is not. </para>

                        <para>-HUGHES.- N ot at all. I do not doubt that in the past some people have made money out of the manufacture of armaments##'##. It is even conceivable, that similar profits may be made in the future, but to an everlessening degree. But it is incredible that any men would advocate the taking of a course that would lead to a war that might easily involve the universe and lead to the destruction of themselves and of our civilization. I refuseto believe that the majority of men, be they munition makers or armament manufacturers, have not some bowels of compassion. I do not believe, that they, having in mind the experience of twenty years ago, would deliberately approve a plan of war. </para>

                <para>If war comes again it will be the outcome not of action by a relatively small section, but of a surging movement of great nations against one another. Already we have some evidence of this trend in foreign policies to-day, clue, in my opinion to an entirely false conception of the purpose of life. Why is Canada going ahead with the strengthening of its defences? That dominion has certainly not committed itself by stating against what nation its armaments might be used. No country could be in a. safer position than Canada, with the Pacific ocean on one side, the Atlantic on the other side, and thefriendly United States of America on its southern border. Is Canada imbued with hysteria? It docs not seem to me that that is probable. Last year, I travelled a good deal in Europe. I passed through a great many of the countries to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> referred this afternoon, in his admirable and salutary speech. I was in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria and Holland. What the right honorable gentleman said is perfectly true. Several of those countries were filled with the direst forebodings as to what might happen; and, indeed some of their fears have been realized since I was there. Their people know that they are small in number, that their equipment is inadequate, and that they exist alongside powerful countries which are armed to the teeth, and are relentless in pursuing their objective. There are two or three countries of that kind in Europe to-day. 1 hope that I have not been unreasonably long in making in first point, namely, that the necessity for defence, if it is possible of proof, has been abundantly proved, and that, even if wc have slept  for years, we should now be alive to the fact that, whatever our hopes and ambitions may be - whether or not we think that the League of Nations is the hope of the world - we must he able to defend ourselves should the occasion arise. </para>
                <para>As to Australia##'##s provision for defence during recent years, I must say that I cannot give high testimonials to the Labour party. For fifteen years, I have listened to speeches by Labour members, both in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, but I have not heard one speech which left me with the impression that the members of that par are prepared to defend the country as it should be defended. As I do not believe in speaking on these matters without chapter and verse, I have here a few quotations from speeches made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings.</inline> I am sorry that the honorable   senator is not here to hear them. </para>

                        <para>- It is generally agreed that an attack on Australia might, in the first instance, appear to be successful, but that, if the Australian people were at all adequately prepared to continue the contest, the result eventually would be satisfactory to them. On that point I do not wish to be either unduly optimistic or too pessimistic. The fact remains, however, that, in the event of an attack being made on Australia, those who would suffer most would be the people living in the great centres of population. It would be upon them that the bombs, to whichSenator Brown referred this afternoon, would drop. Moreover, women and children would be among the victims, as has happened in China during recent months. One would have thought that it would not be from those members who represent country constituencies, where the risk is relatively small, that the cry for defence would come. By all the laws of logic, the cry should come from those who know that, in the event of Australia being attacked, the people living in the closelypopulated areas would suffer most. </para>

                <para>I pass now from the Labour party, and in doing so I express the hope that I have not done it any substantial injustice by what I have said. It has always seemed to me - and I said this many years ago in another branch of the legislature - that the Labour party advocates air defence largely because the manufacture and maintenance of aircraft would provide the maximum of work for artisans, but a minimum personnel on which discipline might be exercised. The same is true of submarines, although we do not hear so much about them as formerly. This is not a question of disagreement between various sections of the community. Should war come, it will, as it did 24 years ago, affect all sections of the community. The sooner we face that fact, and together prepare to do what we can to meet the emergency, the better. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that I cannot say that the Government has done what it might have done in this connexion. I have already shown how the defence vote gradually fell by about ##£##1,000,000 per annum from ##£##8,000,000 to ##£##3,000,000. For 1932-1933, the defence votewas just over ##£##3,000,000. It increased to over ##£##4,000,000 in the following year, and to ##£##5,500,000 in 1934-1935. In 1935-1936, it was ##£##7,000,000, and in 1936-1937, ##£##8,800,000. Those figures do not indicate that the Government has faced up to this problem as it ought to have done. I have said that frequently, and, therefore, I do not want to over-emphasize the point now. It does not appear to me that even now the Government realizes the true position. For instance, universal military training is provided for by an act of Parliament. For many years it gave to us men who were relatively well trained, at least to the extent that they hadsome idea of discipline. No one withany knowledge of the subject will deny that, both as to officers and other personnel, that system served us in good stead in the GreatWar. But in a day the Scullin Government, by a stroke of the pen, suspended the operation of that system. Universal training ceased, not because of ##'##the passing of an act of Parliament or the issue of a proclamation, but merely by an executive act. The whole of the system of training which we owed to the old Labour party and to the support and influence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and his supporters was wiped out of existence in a moment. For that I cannot give a good mark to the Scullin Government. No sensible man could do so. I have never ceased to deplore that decision, for the system had completely justified itself. At least it can be said that it was in the fullest sense democratic. Surely the country which supplies its people with a multitude of good things - in a variety of degrees, I am prepared to admit - is, by every rule of life, entitled to call upon its people, one and all, to fight for it in a life emergency. To me, that is a basic principle of democracy; so that when the Scullin Government wiped out such a system, I regarded its action as undemocratic. </para>

                        <para>- I say emphatically that universal training should have been restored ; that the Lyons Governments, of varying personnel and hues, should have at once restored that system. Even though the Nationalist government did not take that action immediately, surely, as the years passed and the international situation became more and more acute, it was the natural and inevitable thing to do. We have had not one incident, but a series of incidents, spread over many years. I need not detail them, but we all recall the ItaloAbyssinian dispute, the Spanish conflict and the Sino-Japanese war, whilst, recently, we have had the confiscation of Austria by Germany. Some people get over the latter incident by saying ##"## Oh, well, Austria really is German ##"##. Austria, of course, is a far older empire, if I may use the phrase, than Germany, But in any case, we had the spectacle of one country which had promised, only a year previously, that it would keep the constitution of Austria intact, walking straight into Austria with armed forces and seizing and imprisoning the head of the Austrian Government. There was no bloodshed, certainly, but the incident appears to me to be quite inconsistent with the claim that Germany respected the constitution of Austria. </para>

On the following day I found myself described in a newspaper as a Hitlerite. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator does not listen very carefully to my speeches; I am certain that he does not road them, but should he do so he would be enlightened on that point. To-night I am speaking in generalities; we have not had previous opportunity to discuss these matters. I tried to learn from the Leader of the Senate why this Parliament was not called together for so long a period. I point out that while all these incidents were happening in the international sphere the House of Commons was constantly in session. Members of Parliament, whether in this or the other chamber, are elected as the representatives of the people. It is through them that a ministry comes into existence. It is by them that a ministry survives, and ministers, as such, have no greater authority from their constituents than have private members of Parliament. </para>

                    <para>Che fifth phase, the suspension of all compulsory obligations in time of peace (under PartXII of the Defence Act) and the reconstitution of the forces on a basis of voluntary enlistment, was brought intooperation as from 1st November,1929. The divisional organization was retained,but the peace nucleus was reduced from 48,000 Citizen Forces and 16,000 Senior Cadets to 35,000 Militia Forces and 7,000 Senior Cadets, by reductions in the training establishments of units and by ceasing to maintain certain light horse regiments and infantry battalions. The peace nucleus of the militia forces was further reduced to 30,000 in 1931. </para>

                <para>There in a very brief compass it is made clear that the militia figure as it stands at present is identical with that which was brought into effect by the Scullin Government in 1929. Does that represent in any sense the change that should have taken place in the Government##'##s defence policy in the last six or seven years? I have no doubt that our present defence preparations are more adequate, and in every way better ordered than they were, but the strength of our military forces is the same as was laid -down in 1929. It represents one soldier to every 200 of the population. Can any one regard that as being an adequate defence force? However, some members in both Houses have not shirked their responsibility in this matter. Whatever might have been, and still remain, their hopes for ultimate peace, these men have said constantly that Australia is most likely to achieve security, first, by adhering to Great Britain, and, second, by seeing that our defence preparations in Australia are adequate. Several years ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> made a notable speech in this chamber on defence, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett</inline> has spoken several times on this subject. In the House of Representatives also several members have not failed in their duty to the country in making it clear that we must be prepared to defend ourselves. Both in and out of Parliament we have had to address men who are thoroughly sick of war, urging the necessity for preparing our defences, and emphasizing that that is the fundamental condition under which we can exist, particularly in the present circumstances. To-day public opinion is rising; it is dissatisfied. One has felt it for months past; it is apparent in the newspapers, and in contact with the man in the street. Various organizations are asking the Government why it is not getting ready to defend the country and why it has not done more. The answer is that up to the present the Government has not brought itself to the point of restoring universal training in Australia in spite of the fact that it is threatened by half the world. I cannot forgive that attitude; to me it seems inexcusable and indefensible in view of world conditions to-day. For instance, does any one imagine that our returned soldier organizations want Avar? They are practically the only people in Australia who realize what war is. Yet various branches of their organization have passed motion after motion urging the Government to reintroduce a system of universal training. The Government has not done so. Is it going to pin its faith any longer to the League of Nations? I notice that whenever some major international incident, or coup, occurs, a senior Minister comes forward and speaks of Australia##'##s allegiance to the League of Nations. What can the League of Nations do for us? </para>

But for the purposes of defence, it is by now abundantly clear that it is of no more use to rely on the League of Nations in order to keep this country intact, or to save ourselves, than it is to speak of a Pacific regional pact immediately after adopting a trade diversion policy which hits chiefly the people of the Pacific. </para>

                <para>We are all aware that the provision of war equipment and material affects the interests of a great many people; the manufacture##'## of such material promotes employment. To my mind, we have done quite sufficient in that direction for the moment. Of course, I speak as a layman, and I may be wrong; there are people who hold a different view. But I know personally of people possessing a thousandfold my military knowledge who hold the opinion that we are deplorably lacking in man-power, and that it is of jio use having intricate machinery, such as anti-aircraft guns, and even machine guns, unless, we have sufficient personnel, and reserves of personnel, trained and able to use such weapons. A few days ago the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings),</inline> said ##"## the Labour party holds that every penny expended on defence should be expended in Australia.##"## Supposing that policy had been adopted and continued, how would we have obtained materials for aeroplanes, guns, anti-aircraft guns, machine guns, tanks, or any equipment which Ave  had not in Australia or were not likely to have in the future? These things have not ##'##been made locally, or at most , production is only in the initial stages. They have had to be imported. If, as the honorable senator said we should, we had expended all our money in Australia, the Government would have been expending money on equipment unsuitable for defence purposes, and would not have promoted our defence system at all. A man with a broomstick can do something, but he would not have much effect against foreign shells of big calibre. A man untrained and armed only with the weapons devised and manufactured in Australia, would have a very poor time indeed. , </para>
                <para>I now wish to mention an important factor, and one which we cannot avoid.), I refer to the relative amounts of money to be expended on the Navy, Army and Air Force. We must be guided by the opinions of experts, who know the best way to apportion the money available, our most essential requirements, and the order in which they are needed, Whilst the political power must synchronize these things I should not be satisfied if I felt that that power was over-riding military advice. 1 read in a South Australian newspaper the other day the following paragraph about . the appointment from overseas of an Inspector-General of our military forces - </para>

                        heads of the Defence Department, not only the military officers, but also the civilian officers, to keep pace with and do justice to their work. For years we have failed to enable them to get on with their work, and with increasing momentum. I do not say that this was due to the former Minister for Defence

                        because I am certain that the country never had a Defence Minister more imbued with the necessity for the effective defence of this country than he was. It has been due to Cabinet decision. I do not criticize the appointment of an overseas officer, but if such an appointment is to be made, it is not being done in a reasonable way. I suppose that it is true, because I cannot imagine a newspaper publishing the statement unless it thought it was true. I cannot imagine the Cabinet considering such a sweeping step without referring  Lt  to the Defence Council, because the decision really means that our whole defence system is to be placed in the melting pot. It may mean that some necessary preparations and proposed alterations will be held up for some time. Surely if the Defence Council is an effective and useful body it deserves the courtesy of being asked for an expression of opinion on such an important subject or of being told of what had been decided.

                        <para>- If the Minister suggests that because there is power in the Defence Act, it is reasonable and proper to exercise it at this time to make a major appointment from overseas without even consulting or informing  the Defence Council, I disagree with him. The Government##'##s action, in -this respect reminds me that the Duke of Cambridge, who was a cousin of Queen Victoria, first learned from a daily newspaper of his dismissal from the office of Commander-in-Chief. I think that a little more tact should be shown in dealing with our senior officers. Generally speaking, the whole of the officers of the Defence Department deserve our sympathy and support; during the depression their salaries were most severely cut and they have been kept back for years. Now they have this immense load thrust upon them. I express my sincere sympathy with them. The Government has a heavy responsibility in this matter. I do not .speak of .those members who have recently joined the Government because they have had little time to achieve very much. Nor do I speak of those who have come in half way, so to speak, through the course of the Lyons Government##'##s various changes; those I have in mind are Ministers who have sat on the treasury bench for several years. Although the Postmaster-General . <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> smiles, I am not speaking particularly of him, but of such Ministers collectively. They carry a great responsibility. They have, it appears to me - I say it without personal animus - gambled with the safety of the country. If that gamble comes off they may be given some credit for having avoided certain expen diture, but if their gamble fails there will be no occasion for smiles. </para>

                    <para>.  -  As a new member of the Senate, I am disappointed at the meagreness of the information with which we have been supplied concerning the defence policy of the Commonwealth. The only details we have received have been through the press, and some of these appear to be contradictory and misleading. . I read in the newspaper a few days ago of the- manner in which the expenditure was to be allocated between the States. For instance, we were informed that ##£##320,000 was to be expended on an explosives factory at Maribyrnong, ##£##300,000 .on an ordnance factory at Maribyrnong, ##£##200,000 on a munitions factory at Footscray, and ##£##150,000##"## on a small arms factory at Lithgow. The amounts for Victoria total ##£##820,000. According to a paragraph in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> the allocation between the State##'##s and territories of the Commonwealth is to be as follows : - New South Wales, ##£##507,150; Victoria, ##£##438,300; Northern Territory, ##£##316,500; Western Australia, ##£##2S9,500; Federal Capital Territory, ##£##174,200; Queensland. ##£##8S,000; .South Australia, ##£##31,000, and Tasmania, ##£##32,630. An extra ##£##75,000 has yet to be allocated. I cannot understand why a curtain of silence has been drawn over this expenditure. The only information honorable senators can get is by lifting a corner of the curtain or peeping through a hole in it. I suppose that the figures I have quoted are correct, as they have ##'##already appeared in the press and have been used by a Minister in a broadcast speech, which ##'##appears to be a new method of enlightening, the taxpayers. A statement also appeared in the press outlining the policy of the Federal Government in regard to ##'## the taxation that would be imposed to meet some of the cost in this respect. ##'####'##It was stated that the expenditure of this money would be a means of relieving unemployment. If the figures I have quoted are accurate, it would appear that there has not been a fair allocation of work between the ##'##States. I should -like to know why so much work, is to be undertaken in Victoria, when the Government is pledged to a policy of decentralization. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with New South Wales presently, and  probably  Tasmania. The work undertaken at the Woolwich Arsenal in England, which is probably, the most important arsenal in the world, is now .being distributed between two establishments in Scotland and one each in the north and west of England. If that policy is being followed in the United Kingdom, why should not a similar policy be adopted in Australia, particularly as each State contributes towards the revenues of the Commonwealth? There is a small arms factory at Lithgow operating on a peacetime basis. Reference has been made to war hysteria., but I do not know if hysteria is the correct word to use in connexion with defence, because I should define hysteria as a nervous complaint involving a fit of laughing or crying. 1 do not know why there should be such feverish haste in defence matters. Apparently the Government wishes the assistance of the Opposition in this matter, but at the same time it does not place sufficient confidence in us to supply us with details of the proposed expenditure. The small arms factory at Lithgow employs at present a peace-time staff of 370 men and boys as compared with from 1,500 to <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> ,700 during the last war, and it has been proved that the factory is capable of turning out almost anything of a mechanical nature. Not only does it manufacture rifles, machine guns and anti-aircraft guns, but also various types of machinery, crown wheels, motor car parts, charger clips and other things. Before private enterprise is called upon to manufacture munitions, all governmentfactories should be employed to the fullest extent. . Further, instead of establishing more munitions factories in Victoria, these undertakings should be distributed amongst the various States, on the principle of decentralization. </para>

                        <para>- An explosives factory and an ordnance factory at Maribyrnong, a munitions factory at Footscray, and, I think, two other under takings elsewhere. It is of interest to. note that the small arms factory at. Lithgow has constructed machinery for the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited, one of the companies that will probably besubsidized by the Government for theproduction of armaments. Dyring theGreat War it was found desirable, to seek the assistance of engineers to operate that factory, and that is the policy I would! recommend at present in preference toobtaining munitions from private manufacturers. I do not think that there isadequate supervision of the various munition works. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brodribb,</inline> an explosiveschemist, has been appointed Controllerof Munitions Supply, but in my opinion! a highly-qualified engineer should beplaced in charge of these undertakings.. </para>

                <para>The word ##"## hysteria ##"## has been used a great deal to-day, but it cannot beapplied to the erection of a building at Lithgow which was planned in 1920, but the excavations for which are now being, made. Another building is being erected., the excavations for which were made twoyears ago. The former job is beingcarried out by the unemployed as theresult of what I may term a Christmascheer grant of ##£##2,000 made by the Commonwealth Government, and I suggest: that as an indication of its earnest desire to provide for the defence of the country,. the Government should proceed at once with the building to be erected there. At the present time there are 30 or 40 mein working overtime at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory, while skilled men whowere  trained -there are walking thestreets. That state of ##"##affairs should heremedied. </para>
                <para>During the debate reference has been made to the closing of trade routes in the event of war, and the position that would then arise with respect to the disposal of surplus products which are now sent toEngland. But there is another importantfactor to be considered - the supply of oil1 to meet the needs of this country. It has been said that Australia could withstand##"## a blockade longer than any other nation because it is self-contained; but Australia can never be self-contained until it has an independent oil supply. The Leader of the Senate will probably reply that the Government is financing a company to the amount, of ##£##500,000, while the-  company itself provides  ##£##166,000,  to undertake the production of oil from shale at Newnes, but so far nothing has been done beyond inserting in the newspapers a few advertisements. I understand however that a survey has been made of the possibility of constructing a pipe line from Newnes toWindsor, a distance of  120  miles, for the purpose of conveying crude oil to that point for treatment and that it is proposed to transport coal from Lithgow to Windsor. </para>

                        <para>- The Government  is  to provide  15s.  out of every  ##£##1  to be expended by the company and it should supervise the undertaking. It is essential that there should be at least a supply of oil for defence requirements, if not for commer- cial use. Honorable senators will realize what would happen in the event of a blockade of our shores. It was stated by a Commonwealth authority during the investigation into the possibilities of the Newnes oil shale deposits, that in the event of war occurring and a blockade being enforced, there would be only two months##'## supply of oil in Australia. If war occurred, a state of emergency would at once be declared, and no motor car or motor lorry would be permitted to leave a garage. Industry would be plunged into chaos. It behoves the Government, therefore, to ascertain the exact position with respect to the Newnes field and to endeavour to hasten the production of oil from shale there. </para>

This matter has been frequently discussed both here and in another place, and no one should be more conversant with the position than the Leader of the Government. At Lithgow twelve months  ago  he said that within a few weeks men would be engaged upon the re-conditioning of the Newnes railway line, but  so  far not a pick has been used upon it. </para>

                    in rather satirical vein, said that we could not win wars by means of roads, but if war occurred and the cities had to be evacuated, good roads would be very desirable. There should be a long range policy of road construction which would provide employment for many people. Provision has been made for the carrying out of certain defence works at Darwin and a road has been suggested from the Western road in New South Wales, through Longreach, Queensland, to Darwin. The provision of such a road would give access to the latter place and would permit of the extensive use of motor transport.

In view of the recent decision of the Loan Council to limit, the amounts to be made available to State governments for public works, it is not unreasonable to ask for a fair allocation of the money to be expended under this bill. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government##'##s defence programme is not a subject upon which speakers of  either side of the chamber should seek to make debating points. I am one of those who believe that if ever Australia is in danger, the hackles of Opposition senators and their supporters would rise just as sharply as would the hackles of government supporters and the people they represent in this Parliament, against a government if it had neglected to take the necessary precautions to safeguard this country. </para>

                <para>I congratulate the Government upon having at. last realized the seriousness of the position of Australia, but I should have been much ##'##better pleased if action had been taken earlier. ##'##The defence programme outlined by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> is ample evidence that the Government appreciates to the full the need for a sound scheme of national defence. It is gratifying also to know that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> is discharging his responsibilities in a manner that reflects the greatest credit on the Ministry. </para>

It is possible, of course, that some things are still wanting. That is inevitable. If the Government, is not in a position to train fresh men, and if, because of the rush of work in Great Britain due to re-armament in the Mother Country, some of the essential equipment. is not readily available in Australia, we cannot blame the Government; but I believe that a little later, when the necessary instructional men have been trained and further equipment is to hand, our position will he much more satisfactory. </para>

                <para>T rose particularly to remove some misconceptions that have arisen during the debate. The first is in connexion with the manufacture in time of war of munitions and equipment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> dealt very fairly with ##"##this aspect of the Government defence programme. Manufacturers in Australia have, for some years, been advocating what the Government now contemplates doing, namely, having a proper survey of Australia##'##s resources in order that manufacturers, when the time comes, may be in a position to produce without undue delay, equipment and munitions as required. I ma.yi add that they have no wish to make one penny of profit out of the manufacture of war material in either peace or war. Their one desire is to be in a position to help the nation in time of need. </para>

                        <para>- Some defence authorities are of the opinion that the break of gauge, at places like- Albury, might be an advantage, because large bodies of troops being transported over long distances must be rested at some point. Apart ##'##altogether from this aspect of the proposal, I am sure that there are sufficient motor cars in Melbourne and Sydney to transport 1,000,000 troops from one city to another within three or .four days, so I do not attach much importance to the argument that the standardization of railway gauges is essential. From a business point of view, it would be uneconomical, and from a defence point of view, unnecessary. </para>

                <para>I come now to the consideration of the personnel of the militia forces and the much discussed subject of universal military training. I believe in universal training as inaugurated by a Labour government, and still advocated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ogilvie,</inline> the present Labour Premier of Tasmania. I do so because I think that the young men of Australia owe a duty to their country. In any case, the training would do them good. But they are not the only persons in the community who have a duty in this connexion. If they make sacrifices in the interests of the defence of the country, they should be properly remunerated. Trained men are more necessary to-day than formerly, because the new weapons of warfare are intricate and have to be thoroughly understood if they are to he effectively used. A trained man is worth more (than is a man without training, and therefore I suggest that trained men should have something added to their wages every week. There has been some outcry about preference to returned soldiers, but I would go further, and give preference to those who are willing to fight for their country and to be trained to that end. </para>

                <para class="block">That letter contains no encouragement to those young men who, at their own expense, have qualified as advanced A class pilots. All that was asked was that they be enabled to keep their certificates in force by being granted the cost of flying for one hour each month, but the request was refused by the Government. ., Minister##'##s answer in this instance is in keeping with what happens only too frequently. It would appear that, at times, Ministers sign papers without realizing what they are signing. I cannot believe that the Minister for Defence himself would write such a letter. Another matter to which I would like to direct the attention of the Government is that it is the failure to give sufficient encouragement to the manufacture of light metals which have to be used in the construction of aircraft. Obstacles are being placed in the way of those who wish to continue work in this respect. One of the most important of these metals has already been manufactured in a small way in Tasmania, and I am confident that it can be produced economically and profitably on a larger scale without difficulty, if more encouragement is given by the Federal Government. I urge the Government to :give consideration immediately to this matter. </para>

                    <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said, ##"## Of course that was another Labour party.##"## For many years I have been a student of Australian politics and public affairs and I emphasize that the Labour party has invariably stood solidly for the defence of this country. I point out that it was only during the regime of a Labour government that concrete steps were taken to defend Australia adequately, taking into account our small population. I appreciate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie##'##s</inline> remark that he believed that all honorable senators recognized that if a crisis arose in this country every Australian would be prepared to do his duty. Statements such i.s those  made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> are heard all too frequently and if they are persisted in repercussions are bound to occur. Such statements do a disservice .to Australia and 1 sincerely hope that we have heard the last of them. I reiterate that the Labour party stands for the adequate defence of Australia. Simply because we cannot see eye to eye with honorable senators opposite we are accused of being disloyal and unmanly. I resent such charges and feel sure that the people oi Australia do not believe them. As a matter of fact the people clearly Shower al the last election that they had confidence in the Labour party, and I have no doubt that at the next general election; they will decide that the Government of this country will be more secure in the. hands of the Labour party. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>As. I am not a military expert I feel at a great disadvantage in discussing the subject of defence. I fail to understand why honorable senators opposite do not feel the same way. Perhaps they are not so modest as I. Some honorable senators opposite believe that the;-##'## are experts on defence, and that they alone know the best methods by which this country can be defended. I have not much confidence in the experts on which the Government relies, and I am very perturbed by the prospect that the defence of Australia is to be handed over to a board of military gentlemen who have no true conception of our economic conditions. My life has been spent in an endeavour to##'## raise industrial efficiency of this country. I believe that, ultimately, it will be found that the best way to protect Australia is to develop its resources to the utmost. In connexion with the controversy which arose many years ago over the White Australia policy, I recall that at that time the political ancestors of honorable senators opposite endeavoured to perpetuate a system which would have confined employment on the sugar-fields to Kanakas. As a result of the policy then adopted by the Labour party there are to-day employed on the sugar belt in Queensland 20,000 white Australians, who are equal to any body of workmen in the world, and every one of those men would be prepared to defend this country should the need arise. That is the kind of defence we need. </para>
                <para>This Government has not made adequate provision for defence. Let us consider, for instance, its attitude in respect of the development of our oil supplier. Only a short while ago it was asked for support for a proposal to manufacture power alcohol, and its only reply was that such a proposition was uneconomic. I contend that such an industry could be economically established in Australia. If recent anti-Labour governments had possessed the foresight of men like Deakin and Kingston, Australia to-day would be supporting a far greater population than its mere 7,000,000 people. If our oil supplies were cut off in a time of emergency, how would this Government act? Yet it persists in the contention that it would be uneconomic to establish the power alcohol industry which would be the means of settling thousands of acres, and giving employment to hundreds of people. If this country is to grow up, its national government must abandon such an outlook. This Government has no constructive ideas in this regard, and similar criticism can be levelled against it in respect of the establishment of many other industries. Fortunately, on occasions in the past every political party has produced at least some big men who were prepared to put their country before party. </para>

One would not be human if he did not realize the present serious state of affairs so far as our defence is concerned, and one would be foolish, and both un-British and unAustralian, if he did not realize the great part that Great Britain and the British Commonwealth of Nations have played in conserving the liberties we enjoy today. I feel sure that should a crisis arise the people of Australia could be relied upon to do their part in defending our liberties. The Labour party represents a very large section of the people of Australia, and no honorable senator has any grounds for suggesting that we are not prepared to defend Australia. </para>

I believe that Great Britain##'##s past endeavours to preserve peace will strengthen its hand when it is obliged to act in a time of crisis. To-day it has been compelled to change its former attitude, and to take steps to preserve the liberty of its people by the use of force.

                <para>I repeat the hope that, in this National Parliament we shall hear no more suggestions that the Labour party is disloyal and unwilling to defend this country. I recall that in the days of an earlier crisis similar charges were hurled at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and, at a later date, at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald, when he was Prime Minister of England. Because men in the Labour movement are prepared to stand up for what they believe is right in the face of opposition from vested interests, which are represented by this Government, they are dubbed disloyal. I do not believe that there is any justification for the unusual activity being displayed in this country because of the alleged possibility of a European war. However, we have to use every endeavour to ensure the safety of this country, and to place it in a position to compete with other countries, but this cannot be done until we have a larger population than we have to-day. There must be greater development of our primary and secondary industries in order that they will be able to absorb the large number of unemployed in our midst. If given a fair chance, the young men and women of to-day will .be good citizens as are their mothers and fathers. But the youngmen of to-day who have not constant employment hesitate to marry and even if they marry, do not feel justified in facing the responsibility of rearing a family, and we cannot blame them. The policy of the Labour party provides for greater security in employment, and the Government in framing its defence policy should have endeavoured to give them greater security in that direction. At the last meeting of the Australian Loan Council the State Premiers were informed that a reduced amount of loan money would be made available with which to carry out their works programmes; that restriction must necessarily have a detrimental effect upon employment. If this Government were wise, it would see that there was greater co-operation with the States, particularly in the matter of providing employment for those who will eventually bc called upon to defend this country. To-day there are many unemployed young men who cannot get work, and in framing a defence policy consideration should bc given to their claims. I am totally opposed to the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncans-Hughes,</inline> that the policy of Germany in placing unemployed men in military camps where they are drilled, fed and clothed, should be adopted in Australia, because I do not think for a moment that such a scheme would be acceptable to our people. It: would be infinitely better to place them in industry and enable them to become responsible citizens. What can we expect of men who have no prospects in life ? We cannot expect them to be enthusiastic about anything. We cannot reasonably look to them to assist in the defence of a country which cannot provide them with work. I shall not attempt to discuss this subject from a technical standpoint. I sympathize with the Government and Ministers generally because I know that they are being stampeded from all angles. I realize that the Government is doing its best to establish the nucleus of an effective defence force, although I regret that such action is necessary. Every effort should be made by the Government to improve the physical and mental capacity of the people by placing men in industry. Australia would be a better country if there were a complete absence of militarism; I hate militarism in any shape or form. The establishments of unemployment concentration camps on military lines as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> would not be in the interests of the Australian people. Our men should be provided with work in industry, and when that is done Australia will have nothing to fear from the workers who I know are prepared to play their part in defending their country. </para>

                    <para>. -  I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> that Parliament should have been called together earlier to enable the important proposals that were to come before it, to be considered in an intelligent and constructive manner. It would also be an advantage if the Government remembered that the -members of this chamber and of the House of Repre-##'## sentatives are elected by the people not only to pass legislation but also to help in framing it. We have heard a great deal about war hysteria, and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> stated quite definitely that those who are to be engaged in the manufacture of armaments and munitions are encouraging a. state of hysteria so that they may have the opportunity to make huge profits. I do not think that there is much in such statements, because we have only to consider the position in Europe and in Asia to realize that there is every necessity for the nations to be prepared for war. If we are prepared war may be avoided. All political parties in this Parliament appear to be agreed that a  defence policy is necessary, and whatever party is in power must depend to a large extent upon the advice given by the members of the Defence Council and other experts. I believe that if a Labour government had been in power at this juncture it would have sought advice from the same source, and in all probability would have acted in the same way as this Government is acting. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cunningham</inline> said that there was no reason why the different political parties should not get together in order to frame a defence policy for Australia. That is what the Government wishes. It would welcome the co-operation and assistance of the Opposition, and is anxious to frame a defence policy acceptable to all political parties. There appears to be a great fear in the minds of many persons that in the event of private companies being permitted to engage in the manufacture of munitions they will <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> allowed to amass huge profits. At present the manufacture of munitions is being undertaken only by the Government, and the intention is to arrange for private manufacturers to engage in the business should the necessity arise. The Government is merely assessing the capabilities of certain manufacturing concerns, and that is a policy which has been adopted in other parts of the world. A gentleman who travelled through Germany a few years ago said that the German Government measured up the capabilities of certain industrial undertakings and actually purchased the machines utilized for commercial work, but left them in the factories until they were required for war purposes. I maintain, without fear of contradiction, that many of the big manufacturing undertakings in Australia are making twice as much money out of commercial manufacture as they could possibly make from producing war materials. In these circumstances, they will not be too anxious to engage in any work which the Government may ask them to do. Employment in industry should receive first consideration, and that is being given at t he present juncture. Although it has been said that the State governments did not receive fair treatment at a recent meeting of the Australian Loan Council, I maintain that no government which has occupied the treasury bench in the national Parliament has done more to assist the States than has the Lyons Government. In South Australia we have a good roads policy and the Government has treated that State very fairly out of the proceeds of the petrol tax, a proportion of which is given to the States to assist in the construction and maintenance of main roads. Larger sums are expended on roads in other countries, but the probabilities are that those thoroughfares are constructed through mountainous country, have to cross numerous rivers, and also carry a greater volume of traffic. I agree with the last two speakers on the Opposition side of the chamber that provision should be made for reserve stocks of petrol that are so essential to the defence of any country. It is also the responsibility of the Government to consider seriously the production of power alcohol on an extensive scale. One of the most vigorous speeches I heard from the Leader of the Opposition was when he was opposing the Government##'##s proposals in connexion with the development of the Newnes shale deposits. </para>

I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who was a Minister in the Labour Government of that time, piloted the bill through the Senate. But I direct the attention of honorable senators in Opposition to the fact that although the Australian Navy was established in 1909, it was decided at an imperial conference held in London in 1911, at which Australia was represented, that the Australian Navy should be placed at the disposal of the British Empire whenever its services were required. That is not the policy of the Labour party to-day. </para>

                        <para>- I give the Labour party credit for having established the Australian Navy, but I am afraid that if it were in power to-day it would not placethe vessels of the Australian Fleet at the disposal of the British Admiralty. </para>

                        <para>- I am not talking of conditions but stating facts. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> said that the cruisers of the Australian Navy would be incapable of protecting our trade routes, and as we owed Great Britain a great deal of money it was the responsibility of Britain to protect the carriage of our exports across the water. There are always plenty of sellers, but in order to do business it is necessary to find buyers. Great Britain is the best customer that this country has ever had for its exportable products. It is up to us to do our share to keep the trade routes open so that in time of war our produce may continue to be sent to England. At a later stage we shall have a further opportunity to discuss these matters, but I feel that the Government is working on right lines and that it is supported by public opinion. The country must be defended, and even if complete agreement regarding the cost or the location or the nature of the steps to be ##'## taken cannot be achieved, the majority of the people are of the opinion that the Government is acting wisely and should proceed with its programme. It has been suggested that no indication has been given of how the necessary money will be raised. I have been in politics a good many years and have never yet known a Government that obtained money from any sources other than taxation or loans. </para>
