                            <para>Experiments in connexion with the rabbit virus, myxomatosis, have not yet been completed. Before a virus of this kind is released it must first be determined that it is entirely specific to rabbits and is not harmful to human beings, domestic animals, or to our own native animals. Having carried these tests to a successful conclusion the next step is to ascertain whether the virus is really effective when applied to rabbits. The first part of the work has been completed. Human beings and animals, other than rabbits, even including the hare, which is so closely related to the rabbit, are quits immune from the effects of the virus. Experiments are now being conducted on Wardang Island, Yorke Peninsula, South Australia, to determine the efficacy of the virus. In the tests carried out not a single case of recovery from the disease has been observed in infected rabbits, but difficulty has been experienced in spreading the disease from one rabbit -colony to others, the result being that the disease has now disappeared from the rabbits in the enclosure. Further field trials will, however, shortly be undertaken with a view to studying other methods of introducing thevirus. </para>

State authorities are responsible for the control of the rabbit pest within their territories. Although the work carried out to date shows some promise, there is at present no indication that the virus would prove successful in the field. </para>

                <para>Honorable John Barnes at East Melbourne, on the 31st January last. The late gentleman had a very long period of service as a senator, having entered the Senate in 1913 as a. representative of the State of Victoria. He continued, with an intermission of three years, to represent that State until 1935. At the last general elections he was re-elected to the Senate, and in the normal course would have taken his place in this chamber on the 1st July next. </para>
                <para>In 1916-17, he was a member of the Commonwealth Prices Regulation Board, and from 1923 to 1929 he served on the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works. In October, 1929, he became Assistant Minister for Works and Railways, holding that office until his appointment as Vice-President of the Executive Council in March, 1931. During his occupancy of the latter office, which lasted until January, 1932, he was Leader of the Government in this chamber. </para>
                <para>The passing of John Barnes leaves a void in the hearts of all of us who were so fortunate as to be associated with him in the work of this Senate. He was the soul of honour; his word was his bond. Although a forceful speaker and an ardent champion of the cause he espoused, his speeches breathed the spirit of sweet reasonableness that was so characteristic of him. His kindliness and consideration will long be remembered. He will be missed, too, in the councils of that great industrial organization, the Australian Workers Union, over which he presided for so many years. </para>
                <para>What I have already said represents, more or less, official recognition of the work performed by our former associate, but I feel that on this occasion one should express the concern which one feels at the frequent passing of colleagues from this chamber and from other spheres of public activity. John Barnes was of the rugged type, but nevertheless was reliable in his every relation with his fellows. As a Minister, notwithstanding his forcefulness and his desire to ensure the despatch of business as expeditiously as possible, he always acted with a sense of fair play and temperateness which commended his character to all. The rugged types of </para>
                <para class="block">Australians, of whom he was one, are passing all too frequently from our midst. [Withal, he was a man of sentiment. I understand that he, and two other gentlemen who with him were regarded, as one might say, as " the three musketeers " of a certain wing of tie Labour movement, agreed among themselves that the only monument to , their memory should be the Australian wattle, and as I stood beside tile grave of John Barnes I could not but feel that his chosen monument would be a fitting one, for he was a true son of Australia. </para>
                <para>Whilst mourning the death of the late senator-elect, we must not be unmindful of his widow and family. To them, on behalf of honorable senators, I express our very deep sympathy in the great loss they have sustained. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline>
                    and subscribe to those kind things which he said about the late Honorable JohnBarnes. One of the sad experiences of members of this Parliament is that, whenever we reassemble after an adjournment of the length of that which we have just experienced, we have to consider a motion relating to the passing of one or more of our number. Having known the late John Barnes before he entered Parliament - that, of course, means that I knew him long before I myself entered Parliament - I know that all the things that have been said regarding him this afternoon are true. That side to his character to which the Leader of the Senate referred was particularly manifest in his work in connexion with the great Labour movement. Probably no man in the public life of this country has had quite the same political record as that of John Barnes; certainly no other person has had such a unique record in the industrial life of this nation.* I refer particularly to his association with that great industrial organization known as the Australian Workers Union, of which for many years the deceased gentleman was general  president.  In that office he wielded a far greater influence on the workers of this nation than he did in any position to which he ever attained in the Parliament of the country. He never abused that power; on the contrary he discharged his responsibilities faithfully. He always took an intelligent view of things, and was careful to avoid actions which might ultimately have reacted to the discredit of those whom he represented.  His  advice on matters of great industrial . concern was always wor,th taking. At times when the peace and good order of this nation depended on the word of John Barnes, that word was always forthcoming from him; invariably he spoke in the interests of peace, order and good government. Those of us who were  closely .associated with him, particularly the members of the Opposition, have every reason to mourn his passing, not only because of the sense of personal loss which his death brings to us, but also because his demise leaves a gap in the industrial and political movement which it will be exceedingly difficult to fill. It will be filled, of course, as these gaps always are. Because we on this side hold these views regarding our late comrade, I desire to associate the Opposition very closely with the motion.

                    <para>- Because, for many years, the late Honorable John Barnes and I occupied opposite positions of leadership in this chamber, I desire to say a few words in testimony of my personal appreciation of him. He was, as the speakers who have preceded me have said, a genial soul, but underneath that geniality there was both shrewdness and ability, as well as great strength of character.  The tribute that I want .to pay to the memory of John Barnes to-day is that he was one of those who, very many years ago, stood for the ideal of the introduction of law and order into indus- . trial affairs. In his early .days he advocated, and, indeed, fought for, the principle of industrial arbitration. Inlater life, as a politician, he took part in the shaping of measures which were placed upon the statute-book providing for conciliation and arbitration in industrial matters. The great union which he helped to create, and of which for many years he was  president,  had in its ranks men who, whilst they appreciated the benefits which arbitration . had conferred upon them and their fellowworkers, were sometimes persuaded to act against the principles of arbitration, and to resort to direct action. It was no easy thing for John Barnes, because of his association with the labour organizations, to stand up and tell those men that they were wrong; yet he had the moral courage to do so.  His  influence in the Australian Workers Union, as many in this country can testify, was always in the direction of having industrial disputes settled by the court which had been created by the legislation which the industrial unions of this country helped to place on the statute-book. It says a great deal for the moral character of the man whose memory we honour to-day that he took that stand regardless of whether it was popular or unpopular. Those of us who were associated with him here learned to appreciate his strength of character, as well as that brightness and geniality which endeared him to us all. </para>

                <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">PRESIDENT (Senator the Hon. P.</inline><inline font-style="italic">J.</inline> lynch). - -I wish to add a few words to what has been said about our former fellow legislator, the late Honorable John Barnes. It seems but yesterday that he was with us alive and well, full of health and vigour - a force to be reckoned with in the spheres in which he moved. To-day he lies cold and lifeless, of no account in the affairs of this country.  His  passing reminds us in a very striking way of the oft-quoted words of Edmund Burke - " What shadows we are, and what shadows we pursue." John Barnes has gone from among us, but he has left behind him a worth-while memory. Those of us who arc old enough to recall his early association with public affairs know that he started life with none of those things which ordinarily are accounted as making for success. John Barnes was born an heir to poverty, but by virtue of those rare qualities which he possessed, he compelled his fellow citizens to advance him step by step, until, when they elected him to represent them in the legislature of this country, he reached the highest pinnacle of popular favour to which they could elevate him. No greater compliment could be paid to any Australian. The lesson tq be extracted from this is that we live in a wonderful country - a fact which I hope will be more appreciated as time goes on. When we realize that a fellow citizen, without any influence whatsoever, has been raised from the humblest station in life to one of the highest positions in the land, we must admit that Australia is a land of golden opportunity with which few, if any, other countries can compare. He has left us and now no doubt knows the secret of the hereafter. Honorable senators who have already spoken have pointed out that in his dealings with his fellow mcn he always extended to them, the utmost toleration and good will, and the hope and prayer of the deceased gentleman's wide circle of friends, both inside and outside this House, is that the Most High who directs our destinies will remember the kindnessof J ohn Barnes to his fellow men - and, on that account, he merciful to him. </para>
