Stanley. Hu was a distinguished politician, and he had a brilliant career in England, but it is in respect of his occupancy of the office of Secretary of State for the Dominions that we, iri Australia, will remember him best. He succeeded to that office on the reconstitution of the British Cabinet early this year.  His  experience as Secretary of State for India and Burma fitted him to assume control of the Secretaryship of State concerned with the other dominions of the British Commonwealth. Commonwealth Ministers who came in contact with the late Lord Stanley refer in terms of high commendation to the tact and courtesy displayed by him in the discharge of the duties of his high office. We remember him, too, as a gallant soldier, who served with distinction  and was  wounded during  the  Great &#34;War. As  the  result of those wounds we have to-day to regret  his  early demise. Whilst mourning  his  untimely death, we must  not  be unmindful of  his  widow  and  children. I am sure  that  I  may  speak  for  all honorable senators in expressing profound sympathy with his widow  and  family in their great bereavement. I move - </para>

Earlier in the debate the honorable senator made representations with reference to the Lithgow Small Arms Factory, and I spoke to my colleague, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> in order that he might give consideration to the matter.If at a later stage of the present sitting I am supplied with the information I shall pass it on to the honorable gentleman. I may add that of the amount of &#163;189,950 provided under this item, &#163;188,300 is to be paid to the credit of the defence Small Arms Ammunition Trust Account, so it is apparent that a considerable sum will be spent on the small arms factory at Lithgow. </para>

                    <para>. - Last year* the allocation under this head was &#163;588,470 and the expenditure &#163;468,3S9. The people of Australia look to the Royal Australian Air Force as one of the main arms of defence, and are very concerned about the serious accidents that have occurred lately. The amount to be provided this year is only &#163;260,000 - less than half of the allocation last year. In the present state of world affairs, I feel sure that the people would gladly give the Government practically a blank cheque in connexion with expenditure on air defence, so long as it was assured that the money would be wisely expended. I understood that there was to be considerable expansion in all arms of defence this year. Yet the figures now before us indicate that for this most important arm of our defence, the allocation under this vote is to be less than half what it was last year. This reduction is amazing and disconcerting, and calls for some explanation. </para>

With that _ I agree, but there is need for a better check on such expenditure in order that we may be sure of getting value for the money. Representations were made some time ago with regard to the cost of officers&#39; flats at the Pearce aerodrome which, incidentally, I consider will, when the premises are occupied, cause more social unrest than exists at present. I have been informed that these flats are costing 50 per cent, more than similar accommodation in the cities. I submitted the matter to the Minister, and I obtained a perfectly good reply, but the following paragraph from it is rather ingenuous : - </para>

                <para>There was a plan for providing a water supply for the aerodrome, although the main government scheme was in the vicinity. The plan for a private water supply was developed to a considerable extent, and at no small cost, but it was subsequently abandoned. Later, a tender was accepted, I am told, for the provision of quarters for the commanding officer at a cost of &#163;9,000. Tenders have also been accepted for the provision of single officers&#34; quarters at a- cost of &#163;23,000. I would like it to be understood that I think that it is  essential to  provide this accommodation in every detail, but, in my opinion, the cost is far too high. </para>

I take it that that vote is now cancelled, and that, as the new vote for 1938-39 is &#163;87,195, the expenditure even in the two years, will not equal last year&#39;s vote.

                    <para>. - No provision is made in this bill for a subsidy to gliding clubs, or for the provision of hangars for such clubs. A few days ago, in the course of my reply to a series of questions by an honorable senator opposite, I enumerated the sums to be made available to the various clubs. Queensland is to receive a substantial proportion of that money. I shall bring the matter of a hangar for the Brisbane club under the notice of the Minister for Defence. </para>

I point out that &#163;87,195 is to be expended during 1938-39 from revenue, &#163;305,205 from the trust fund, and &#163;440,800 from the loan fund, making a total of &#163;833,200. The reason why the whole of the money voted was not expended last year is that it was impossible for the Defence Department to prepare its plans and obtain the services of skilled tradesmen to the extent desired during the financial year. Under the present system of finance, votes not expended up to the 30th June revert to the Treasury for re-allocation, and are shown on the Estimates as &#34;not expended &#34;. </para>

The total expenditure proposed for this year, added to that of last year, amounts to &#163;101,000, which is much less than last year&#39;s vote.

                    <para>. - Provision is made for the expenditure of &#163;49,936 on buildings, works and sites, for the Empire air-mail service. Is appropriation being made in this bill for the erection of proper landing facilities at Darwin? The existing equipment is not only primitive, but also very dangerous. At present the landing stage, over which passengers have to walk from the launch to the shore, is only 2 feet 8 inches wide, and consists of slats. As there is a tidal rise and fall of 28 feet at Darwin, the landing stage is sometimes extremely steep and slippery, and liable to cause serious accidents. When the monsoon season commences about two months hence, the danger will be accentuated. The Government should erect a floating pontoon similar to those provided for flying-boat passengers in other parts of the world. As Darwin is the first port of call for passengers travelling by air to Australia, it is essential that the landing facilities there shall be at least equal to those in other countries visited by flying boats. </para>

Will the Minister say why there has been so much delay in constructing the buildings for which provision was made -in the last financial year ? Although excavations have been completed at the small arms factory at Lithgow with money provided two years ago from Christmas relief funds the erection of the buildings is only now being commenced. It appears that defence works are being erected on the layby system, and that two years must elapse from the time when the money is appropriated until the work is commenced. I believe that some of these works are under the control of the Department of the Interior and others under the control of the Defence Department. I should like an assurance from the Minister that the construction of the buildings Will be expedited. </para>

                        <para>- Some explanation should be given, because the Government may again be asking for a larger amount than it can expend. If that is so, these items should be scrutinized with great care. When measures such as this are placed before the committee, we naturally assume that the amounts for which appropriation is sought are necessary, but it appears that last year the Government was given authority to spend a much larger sum than it needed. </para>

                    <para>. -  As was stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett,</inline> the Government does not receive authority to expend the money until a portion of the financial year has passed. So far as defence expenditure was concerned it was necessary to purchase equipment of many kinds, some of which was not obtainable in Australia. In those circumstances it was found preferable to proceed with more urgent work for which the equipment was available. I emphasize that at present the Defence Department is coping with an unusual rush of work. So far as the iron and steel industry, particularly, is concerned, we have been unable to secure prompt delivery of some material. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> who watches the activities of the Government very closely in order to see that no wasteful expenditure occurs, will agree that rather than incur expenditure, irrespective of whether the work can be done economically or not, it is preferable to carry over to the following financial year a certain amount of the money already voted. The Government is following that policy. It does not spend merely for the sake of spending, but endeavours in all cases to get an adequate return for expenditure. Honorable senators would be astounded to learn of the amount of work that is now being carried out by the Works and Services Branch. The drafting staff has been trebled during the last twelve months. The preparation of plans for proposed new buildings, the purchasing of material, and thesecuring of skilled artisans have been a formidable task. In these circumstances it is not surprising that portions of the amounts voted in respect of certain items remained unexpended at the end of the financial year. I assure honorable senators, and particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> that no work has been held up merely for the sake of saving money. For the reasons I have already given, it has been found impossible to carry out all the authorized works simultaneously. Now that the staff of the Works and Services Branch has been increased, all of the works covered in this section of the Estimates will be expedited. </para>

                    <para>. -  Recently I visited the Rosemount Hospital and had an opportunity to realize the necessity for providing an improved operating theatre at that institution. Provision is made in this vote for a new operating theatre. The remainder of the amount of &#163;78,000 is in respect of general  improvements at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, and the Caul- o field Military Hospital, and work at various military hospitals and institutions under the control of the Repatriation Department, including additions to wards, provision of lavatory accommodation, and improvements for the handling and cooking of food. The vote also includes an amount of &#163;2,359 for the erection of an X-ray plant, and. an amount of &#163;2,235 for the installation of an ironing machine at the Caulfield Military Hospital. Both of those plants, I might add, have been manufactured entirely in Australia. Provision is made also for the installation of a sprinkler system at the Repatriation offices, Melbourne, whilst an amount of &#163;4,946 is provided for the erection of a tuberculosis ward at the McLeod Sanatorium in Victoria, and an amount of &#163;9,100 for the erection of nursing staff quarters at the same institution. Honorable senators for Victoria will admit that that work is long overdue. An amount of &#163;11,500 is allocated for the provision of additional accommodation  for the nursing staff at Keswick Hospital, South Australia. This building is already well under construction. The remaining items under this head, include amounts for the reconstruction of the kitchen at t)he McLeod Sanatorium and various minor works at other institutions. </para>

                        <para>- That estimate refers to a certain amount of work which cannot be carried out during the current financial year. A suggestion now under consideration is that the Prince of Wales Hospital at Randwick shall be rebuilt. So far as this institution is concerned, the Commonwealth is under a very great obligation to the State Government of New South Wales, which placed this hospital at our disposal. Our period&#39; of occupancy has now expired, and I am negotiating with the Premier of New South Wales with a view to ascertaining whether his government is prepared to make an exchange of that property for a portion of Commonwealth land at the old Randwick rifle range, which the Government of New South Wales might find suitable for development under its housing scheme. If this exchange be brought about, this Government will secure absolute ownership of the Prince of Wales Military Hospital. If rebuilding is undertaken the new hospital will be erected on the site of the existing hospital. A start will be made on a spare allotment at the rear of the present staff building, and when that section is completed the demolition of the front section of the existing building will be commenced. This proposal, however, is still the subject of negotiation between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of New South Wales. </para>

Some years ago a controversy on this matter arose in England, and one doctor, in giving evidence, stated that the health of his children had declined a3 the result of the use of aluminium cooking utensils. A close inspection revealed that the stomachs of his children had been irritated by aluminium. Recently, I went through a factory in Victoria which specializes in stainless steel cooking utensils. This material costs a little more than aluminium, but it is certainly much more healthy for cooking purposes. </para>

                    <para>.- The sum of &#163;300 is set down for the Australian Capital Territory railway. It is time that this capital city had  a  better advertisement than the wretched railway station which now serves it. The present station is a blot on an otherwise beautiful landscape. I trust that my suggestion will be passed on to the proper authorities, and that something will soon be done. </para>

                    <para>. - I can assure the honorable senator that  it  is not possible to give a wireless licence to the organization that he has mentioned, and that there are many other bodies in a similar position. Australia has only a limited number of wave channels, and in some instances the same channel is shared by two commercial stations. I frequently wish that the department had never agreed to the sharing of wave channels. With the exception of a few wave channels which are being reserved for regional or national stations, all the wave channels allotted to Australia have been taken up. Unless we agree to a greater amount of sharing - and on that subject I hold strong views - it is impossible, with our present scientific knowledge, to grant additional licences. I personally have no scientific knowledge of the subject, and cannot hold out any great hope that things will improve ; the only crumb of comfort that I can give to the Senate is that new discoveries are constantly being made in radio science. Honorable senators can rest assured that the pressure brought on the department to grant new licences is sufficient to keep all concerned on the <inline font-style="italic">qui vive.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> that these Estimates have been cut to the bone in order to make available for defence works every shilling that can be spared. It would, however, be most uneconomical to carry on under the conditions which exist in certain centres; in the long run, delay would mean added expense. Before the improved telephonic service between Melbourne and Geelong was provided, the cost of propping up the posts along that route, and of maintenance generally was tremendous. Honorable senators would be astounded to know the cost of replacing even one post. The department cannot allow services to be interrupted by causes within its control, and unless some of these cables are placed underground the service will not  be  satisfactory. </para>

                        <para>- For years the department has been propping up posts uneconomically. These matters have been considered in the light of the whole national economy. Honorable senators would be amazed at the difficulties associated with the central telephone exchange at Sydney. Only by the constant care of highly skilled men has it been possible to maintain the service,  in  order to give satisfactory service, a new exchange must be provided, and the post office accommodation will have to be extended. </para>

                    <para>. -  Some of the expenditure for which the bill makes provision is quite unjustified. For instance telephone poles were erected less than five years ago at Hazlewood Park, a new suburb of Adelaide. These poles, being at the rear of residences, are out of sight, yet the department intends to remove them and place the wires underground. Residents of the district have protested against this extravagance. The people of Australia are quite ready to meet additional expenditure on defence, but they object strongly to the waste of money on such works as underground telephone lines. This expenditure will not increase the productivity of the country, nor will it provide any additional worth while employment. Such works could easily be postponed in a time of emergency such as the present. </para>

Believing that that was the only possible way to get the licence, the applicants intimated their willingness to do what was asked, and were then met with a demand by the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mer~cury</inline> for  51  per cent, of the shares. When the promoters refused to accept these terms they were informed that the newspaper interest would accept  50  per cent, of the shares if permitted to have full control over the news broadcast through the station. </para>

                    <para>. - It is almost like calling spirits from the vasty deep to urge the Government once more to do something in connexion with the Brisbane Post Office. For about  58  years the citizens have been agitating for a new building, and they are beginning to wonder whether it will ever be erected. Lately some people have suggested that instead of being called Postmaster-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan should be named the &#34; Minister for Postponement General &#34;. I do not know whether the honorable gentleman has been postponing the work of the Postal Department generally, but he has certainly been postponing activity in connexion with the proposed new post office at Brisbane. It is time some definite undertaking was given regarding this building. If I were discourteous I should refer to the Minister as a political humbug; but not being discourteous I shall not do that. I maintain, however, that there has been a considerable amount of humbug in the Postal Department over this matter. Time after time a new post office has been promised, but nothing has been done. In  1925 <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Donald</inline> Cameron, then a member of the House of Representatives. stressed the urgent need for a new building because of the bad working conditions and inefficient service provided in the existing office. Ministers visited Brisbane in  1936  and had a nice talk to the people. Among them was the present Postmaster-General, of genial manner &#39;and jovial spirit. He treated the citizens of Brisbane to a speech in which he displayed his best form. The Minister&#39;s remarks induced the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> to offer this comment in an editorial - </para>

                        <para>- That is so. We have been discussing a proposal to build a new general post  office  at Brisbane since federation, and, if God is good to us, we shall probably still be discussing it 50 years hence. We have been informed, on more than one occasion, that the plans for a new building have been prepared and that the work will be proceeded with. In January of this year, the Postmaster-General gave an assurance to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Lawson, the member for Brisbane in the House of Representatives, that the work would be commenced before June. Unfortunately, he omitted to state which June he meant. I realize, of course, that defence is all-important at present and that much money which will have been spent in other directions will now have to be diverted to defence, which has been so grossly &#39; neglected by the Lyons Government. At last, Ministers have seen the light, and they now intend to do what is possible to ensure the safety of this country. In the circumstances one feels almost ashamed to discuss this matter, but the people of Queensland are complaining that the only States which can obtain anything from the Commonwealth are Victoria and New South Wales. Queensland is a Cinderella so far as the Postal Department is concerned. </para>

Lyons), and the Government has been trying to find out how best to embark on this vast undertaking. Plans have been prepared and have been approved for the commencement of the rear portion of the new structure, without which it would be impossible to carry out the re-building scheme. The parcels office is already in course of construction. I agree that the Brisbane office is one of the bad spots in post office administration, but the sum of &#163;50,000 is provided on the Estimates to make a start with this work.

                    <para>. -  From time to time I have brought under the notice of the department the need for reducing the cost of telephonic services in country districts. Every honorable senator will agree that the time has come when the residents in out-back areas should enjoy these facilities. One of the chief items in the provision of a new service is the cost of the necessary poles, and I suggest that poles much shorter than the standard height would meet the needs in the country districts, and would simplify the work of effecting temporary repairs in the event of breakdowns. By reducing the costof the poles the department could lower the cost of bringing telephonic facilities within the reach of thousands of persons who, in my opinion, should enjoy them. In the event of medical assistance being required, a telephone is of great assistance in an outlying district. I see no reason why the benefit of the telephone should be enjoyed exclusively by those who probably have other means of summoning medical assistance in the event of accident or illness. Poor people who are pioneering the outback districts should not be called upon to pay for a telephone service on the mileage basis. The present charges are prohibitive unless a number of settlers obtain a party service, and even then the cost to each individual is greater than it is in a capital city. The necessity for the subscribers to guarantee a return on the cost of construction is an irritating condition. It is not easy for a number of settlers to furnish a lump sum of &#163;20 or &#163;30 as a guarantee that they will continue as subscribers. It should be taken for granted that once they become subscribers they will continue to require the service. </para>

We have no guarantee that the Postmaster-General will give effectto this works programme. We are led to believe that the Postmaster-General is in earnest, and intends to give effect to a programme providing for the expenditure of &#163;600,000, despite the fact that last year only about 50 per cent, of the vote was expended. The Minister occupies a unique position, for he is liberally supplied with revenue. He has an enormous surplus from year to year, which he smilingly and generously hands over to the Treasury. </para>

He added that he thought that this important town had a post office adequate to meet the needs of the district. No doubt the Minister overlooked the fact that this part of Western Australia is drought-stricken this year. The residents are experiencing hard times, and apparently the officer of the department who made a report on the request for this post office, stressed the hardship now experienced in the district. But this town is the stock centre of the Murchison district. Situated 65 miles due east of Geraldton, it is the centre on which the stock routes of the north country and an extensive railway system converge. For some years the residents have suffered the disabilities associated with the old wooden post office, and in view of- the lavish manner in which the Postmaster-General is supplied with revenue, one would expect him to put up a fight in the interests of the department instead of appearing before the committee with inflated estimates which raise hopes that are doomed to be disappointed. The estimated expenditure of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department is always inflated. The Minister presents a striking picture of what he proposes to do, particularly in country centres; but only 50 per cent, of the money voted for his department last year was expended. If we did not know the Postmaster-General so well we might say that his action in this respect is not altogether honest. He should submit estimates which are more accurate, and not make the people believe that he intends to provide needed facilities which, in fact, he will not provide. I trust that in future we shall not find that only 50 per cent, of the money appropriated has been actually expended. The promises which the Postmaster-General makes to the people should be redeemed. I know that he will toll us that he appealed to the Treasurer for funds to give effect to his works programme, but that the Treasurer could not provide sufficient money. That is not very satisfactory to those who are looking for some response to their representations. Will the Minister say why he has not expended the amount which Parliament authorized him to expend? </para>

                    <para>. - If the position were as stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cunningham,</inline> his criticism would be sound. The honorable senator said that the department submitted inflated estimates which led people to believe that they would get greater benefits than they actually received. Provision was made last year for the expenditure of &#163;2,913,100 and of that amount only &#163;12,585 remained unexpended. The department obtained from the Treasury a further &#163;150,000 which is included in the Supplementary Estimates, yet to come before this chamber. The honorable senator directed attention to the fact that last year &#163;500,000 was appropriated for buildings, works, sites, fittings and furnishings, and that only &#163;246,000 was expended. The honorable senator also said that, willingly or unwillingly, I handed to the Treasurer all revenue received by my department. If he will refer to section SI of the Constitution he will see that the revenue received by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, in common with that received by other departments, has to be paid into Consolidated Revenue. That impedes the working of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department to a considerable extent, but under the &#39;Constitution we have no alternative. Only on one occasion - I think it was when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> was Postmaster-General - was advance provision made to finance a programme of development over a period of years&#34;. Of the total amount appropriated last year under the Works and Buildings Estimates and under the Supplementary Estimates, &#163;93,000 could not be expended because of the delay which occurred in connexion with the acquisition of a site for postal purposes in Sydney. </para>

Honorable senators wb{  have been in this chamber for some years have realized that it is the desire of the Government to provide additional country services wherever practicable. During the three years ended the 30th June, 1937, the Postal Department has lost over &#163;1,000,000 on country services.

                        <para>- It is the basis upon which we have to calculate, and, when he was Postmaster-General, it was used by the honorable senator.From whatever angle the subject is studied, it must be admitted that there is a considerable loss on some country services. The department endeavours to deal as fairly as possible with country residents, because it realizes that they are entitled to the best facilities that can be provided with the money available. We endeavour to reduce the cost of country telephone services by allowing applicants for telephonic connexions to cut the telephone posts and to dig post holes, but the technical work has to be undertaken by experienced officers. </para>

                    <para>. - The Postmaster-General, who said that he cut his estimates last year to the bone, expended only &#163;246,023 of the &#163;500,000 appropriated for buildings, works, sites, fittings, and furniture. This curtailment of expenditure has been to the detriment of those in rural districts. I presume that &#34; fittings &#34; covers the installation of telephones, and I ask the Postmaster-General whether he does not consider that a reduction of telephone rentals should be made. A person who has had a telephone installed in his home or business place for a long period must have paid in rent an amount sufficient to purchase several instruments. I do not suppose that a telephone instrument costs the department more than &#163;5 or &#163;6. </para>

                    <para>. - During the debate on the budget papers the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> pointed out that the department was losing about &#163;400,000 annually on country telephonic services, and he stated that each department must be treated on its merits. That is not in conformity with the statement just made when he, to suit himself, treated the department as a whole. I have received letters from residents at Lakeside and Mount Monger, which are remote towns in Western Australia, requesting that post offices and telephone exchanges be provided at each of those places. This matter has already been considered by the department, and I understand that it was because of the Lakeside Woodline  company not being linked up with the telephone system that the position of Mount Monger was not considered at the time. As the population at Lakeside has been stationary for many years, that centre is entitled to these facilities. At present residents at Lakeside and Mount Monger get their letters delivered by ore carters or grocers from Kalgoorlie. I agree with Sena to Herbert Hays that as the department as a whole is making a large annual profit, the claims of isolated communities for postal and telephonic facilities should be considered irrespective of the revenue estimated to be received therefrom. Under federation it was never intended that the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department should be a revenue-producing department. It was conceived mainly as a. means of providing facilities for the people as a whole. I do not suggest that it should not make some profit, but if any semi-governmental authority used its powers in the same manner as the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, either this Government, or the State Government concerned, would very soon enact legislation to curtail its profitmaking. As the department shows a handsome profit in the aggregate, I again appeal to the Postmaster-General to give more sympathetic consideration to the claims of remote communities for postal mid telephonic facilities. In judging such claims, the department should consider, not prospective profits, but whether the size of the community warrants such facilities. Lakeside is so isolated that possibly the only means available to residents to secure medical aid is by motor lorry. </para>

I understand that at present, when a call is made on a party line, all of the people on that line hear the ring and can listen-in to a call. In other countries selective ringing ha3 been adopted to overcome this disadvantage, and under that system an individual can answer a call in strict privacy. </para>

Tho Postmaster-General, I suggest, might take this opportunity to refresh our minds as to the Government&#39;s connexion with this company. I do not remember exactly the whole of the circumstances of its formation. 1 understand that the Government owns half of the stock, yet it has very little say in the management of the company. To illustrate that point, I doubt whether the Postmaster-General could tell me what salary is paid to its general manager. </para>

                        <para>- Is it fair that the Government should hold half of the shares in a company of this kind, which is competing with other companies? Recently a company was established in Australia to engage in the manufacture of wireless valves, and it does not seem to be on so favorable a footing as is Amalgamated &#34;Wireless (Australasia) Limited. In fact, it was penalized through the imposition of an excise duty. -For what purpose is this &#163;75,000 required ? Does it represent fresh capital ? Is the Government buying more than 50 per cent, of the stock? Or, is this amount necessary for the expansion of the activities of the company in order to enable it to compete more effectively with other companies? Some explanation of the item as it appears here, is certainly called for. I should have thought that in view of the monopoly which this company practically enjoys in respect of wireless valves and wireless cabinets, it is making sufficient profits to enable it to provide for new plant and the expansion of its business without further assistance from this Government which, apparently, is quite willing to grant such aid irrespective of whether it receives dividends or not. </para>

It seems to me that the Government, in fostering this sort of thing, is contradicting its political profession that it should not compete with private enterprise. Perhaps the Postmaster-General will accept this opportunity to refresh the minds of honorable senators as to where we stand in respect of this company. </para>

                    <para>. - This amount of &#163;75,000 represents calls on the 500,001 shares which the Commonwealth Government holds in Amalgamated &#34;Wireless (Australasia) Limited. The Commonwealth has a controlling interest in the company. Our shares were paid up to only 14s., hut a call of 4s. a share was recently made, of which ls. was paid last financial year. Originally, I think, they were paid up to only 14s., but calls have been made from time to time as required. Last year representations were made that owing to expansion of business further capital should be called up, and, on my recommendation, the Government decided that this was justified. The Government held the view that it was better to put in the cash rather than pay perhaps as much as 5-&#163; per cent, or 6 per cent, interest on overdrafts. Judging by the past returns of this company, this further investment should prove profitable. The company, as honorable senators are aware, has practically complete control of wireless communication outside Australia, including communication with ships at sea. Its concessions were provided for under the Wireless Agreement made in 1922 and amended in 1927. The Beam Wireless branch has been very successful. Lately it has come into competition with reduced cable rates. Nevertheless, this &#163;75,000, to be paid out of the revenue of my department for this year, is expected to yield to the Treasury a return of approximately ll&#163; per cent. Although the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> is outside the ambit of this discussion, I point out that the original agreement under which Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited was constituted provided that it could engage in manufacture. I agree that there is substance in the honorable senator&#39;s contention that this company may have an advantage over its competitors in that the Commonwealth Government is practically a partner. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to know whether the proposed vote for the Northern Territory includes any sum for the resumption of land in the town of Darwin for naval purposes. For over eighteen months, the business people of Darwin have been greatly perturbed by rumours that a large portion of the townis likely to be resumed. Some of them have deferred extension of their business premises pending the receipt of definite information on this subject. It seems most unfair that valuable business sites should be taken for naval purposes, especially when there is other land available. The people of Darwin would like some authoritative information on the subject. </para>

                <para>I call attention to the great waste of money involved in building a new aboriginal compound at Darwin. This compound is being built within four miles of Darwin and within one mile and a half of Parap, which will become the centre of Darwin if the &#34; brass hats &#34; get their way. Thus the present site will be within about half a mile of this compound. Not only is money being wasted, but also the ideal of preserv ing the aboriginal race in its native state will not be achieved. The natives are degenerating through being placed in compounds. Some time ago, Judge Wells, in sentencing an aboriginal boy, expressed the opinion that the boy should be. given a good flogging, sent back to Bathurst Island and made to stay there. I do not agree with his remarks about flogging, but I believe that he was right when he said that whilst others had sown the wind, women of Darwin and their children are reaping the whirlwind. Judge Wells said recently - </para>

I claim that my remarks are connected with the proposed vote now under discussion. Money is being wasted. I am trying to convince the Senate that it should not authorize the expenditure of money in the direction proposed, and arn giving reasons in support of my contention. If I am to be limited, as the  Chairman  suggests, why is this item here? I am giving not only my own opinion, but also that of Judge Wells when I say that this money will be expended wrongly if the Government&#39;s proposals be agreed to. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> has lived in close association with the aborigines for many years. He has provided me with material which shows that a grave mistake is being made by the Commonwealth in spending money on this proposed compound. I have been to Darwin, and have seen the building, and I know the condition of the natives. I contend that as the committee is now considering the Government&#39;s proposal to spend money on the Northern Territory generally, and, in particular, on the proposed new compound for aborigines, you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> should not rule my remarks out of order. </para>

                <para class="block">My second objection is that money should not be spent on n compound of this par ticular description, because it will not achieve the object that many friends of the aborigines desire should be achieved. The scheme proposed by the Government might provide cheap labour, but the result will be to exploit the aborigines economically &#34;and ruin them morally. Certainly it will not save the native race. The aborigines should be housed further from Darwin. The camp could be established on Cox&#39;s Peninsula, which is <inline font-style="italic">4</inline> miles from Darwin by water and 100 miles by land. A native settlement there could be effectively patrolled, the blacks could build their own gunyahs and preserve their tribal rites, and they could be supervised by men who sympathize with and understand them. Apparently, under the Standing Orders I am not permitted to discuss this very interesting position, but I shall be pleased to supply to the Government and to honorable senators, the suggestions made to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> who was for a time in charge of the Darwin compound. This gentleman spent several years amongst the native races and thoroughly under.stands them.

He pooh-poohed it, saying first that he would not travel anywhere in a launch, and that he had enough trouble already in travelling to the leper station in that way. Then he said that such a scheme would rob the people of Darwin of their cheap black labour and that therefore it would not be done. He would not discuss it further, except to say that I ought to bo a missionary. </para>

Ho thought it was a good one and put it before Canberra - that is, the Department of the Interior. The Department of thu Interior submitted it to Darwin and nothing more was heard of it. Now the Government is well on the way with its &#163;80,000 stupidity, which is doomed to failure from the start. &#91; am sorry that, because of the ruling from the Chair, I cannot deal with this question at greater length. I hope that the Government will pause, and try to evolve some scheme which will have for its object the preservation, and not the exploitation, of the aborigines. </para>

Three weeks ago, upon notice, I asked if the Minister&#39;s attention had been drawn to the statement by Judge Wells, and the reply given was that the matter was under consideration. I should like the Minister to advise the Senate whether or not, in view of the opinion expressed by Judge Wells; the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> who recently visited the Northern Territory, is satisfied that this sum should be expended. L&#34; agree with the anthropologists that the building of a compound such as that proposed, will attract more natives to Darwin. It has been proved beyond doubt that once they make contact with white people they degenerate. If the Government has confidence in Judge Wells in his official capacity at Darwin, his statement that the money to be voted for this purpose is a scandalous waste, should have very serious consideration. </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad to note that the sum of &#163;14,000 is proposed to be voted for mining batteries in the Northern Territory, but I regret that the vote is not larger. I have had an opportunity to inspect some of the mining areas in Central and Northern Australia. The field at Tennant Creek, which is 60 miles long and 40 miles wide, is one of the largest mining areas in Australia, and up to the present time the surface has been merely scratched. It is gratifying to find that the Government is now prepared to prove this most promising locality. Some of the prospectors engaged there gave up good positions in the Department of the Postmaster-General. Most members of the committee are aware, no doubt, that the Tennant Creek mining district is a geological contradiction. </para>

Until gold was struck at Tennant Creek, geologists declared that it would never be won from ironstone reefs. This area is suitable for working miners, but not for large companies. Small parties are taking up mining leases and making a good living. I am told that, in many instances, after the prospectors have followed a reef and Have been successful in obtaining a certain quantity of gold, the lode has suddenly given out, but that, after fossicking about, they have picked it up again. Several government batteries are now in operation in the Northern Territory. They are used to a far greater extent than private batteries, and give far better returns. Apart from Tennant </para>

                    <para>.- 1 also am anxious to know the proposed location of the new batteries. The pre. sent Government is to be commended for its work in promoting the search for gold throughout Australia. In the Bendigo field, within five miles of the post office, gold to the value of &#163;20,000,000 was recovered between 1855 and 1932. The average return over the whole field was 9 dwt. to the ton, and- this was considered the richest field, on the average, in the world. From the Maldon field, a return of 19 dwt. to the ton was obtained. At Tennant Creek, with almost every possible disadvantage, including a lack of water and private batteries charging up to &#163;3 a ton for the crushing and saud treatment of ore, the average recovery has been nearly 30 dwt. to the ton, or three times that from the Bendigo field. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> that Tennant Creek is a small man&#39;s field. Any companies that have operated there have not been successful, although the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of to-day states that 200 tons of ore from the mother lode had been crushed for 165 oz. of gold. Remembering that the cost of freight from Alice Springs to Tennant Creek is &#163;9 a ton, and considering the difficulty experienced in obtaining water on the field, one realizes how great are the drawbacks to be encountered. The Government has done good work in its search for water. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The extent of the Tennant Creek field, including Tanami, is about 1,100 square miles. Promising prospects are also found at Arltunga and Winnecke. The Government should give serious consideration to the renewal of the grant of &#163;500,000 previously made to assist the mining industry. Miners are self-reliant and courageous, and they deserve every encouragement. The temperature at Tennant Creek in October is 116 degrees in the shade, and the miners work in open cuts on the hardest stone in the world. But the work gives most gratifying results, ordinary  cappings.  from reefs nearly half as high as this Senate chamber returning 6 and 8 oz. of gold to the ton. Boring operations for water reveal that the gold extends to a depth of 412 feet. The length and width of the lodes are obvious, and as we now know how deep the gold is to be found we realize that enormous yields are possible in this area. I look forward to the day when the water problem will be solved, and when it will be possible &#34;for the miners to work under healthy conditions, without the danger of their lungs being dusted. At Bendigo the miners carry on their operations thousands of feet below the surface, but at Tennant Creek the workers have blue skies overhead day and night. Ample drinking water is now available, and with Government batteries crushing the ore for small mining parties these men should obtain independence and a good standing in the community. I believe that, when the new batteries are erected, the operations&#39; will be rapidly extended, and that much attention will bo drawn to the extraordinary possibilities of Central and Northern Australia. </para>

A considerable portion of the amount to be appropriated is to be expended in constructing cottages in Canberra for public servants who have yet to come here, and to meet the housing requirements of Canberra people generally. At present there is a waiting list of 367, made up as follows :  - Permanent officers, 26; other government employees, 105; persons in private employment, 82 ; persons engagedin the building trade, 49 ; relief workers, 98 ; and miscellaneous, 7. An amount of &#163;170,000 has been provided on the current year&#39;s Estimates towards a total cost of &#163;250,000 for cottage construction. Tenders have closed for the erection of 64 houses at Ainslie, and further tenders will be invited shortly. It is estimated that the &#163;250,000 will permit of the erection of a further 220 residences. In addition, 30 homes are in course of erection at Griffith, the cost of which will be met from last year&#39;s appropriation. It is estimated that about 200 additional cottages will bc completed or in course of erection by the end of the current financial year. </para>

                        <para>. - I am grateful to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> for the information he has given regarding the expenditure which the Government proposes to incur in order to solve a portion of the housing problem in Canberra; but it does not go far enough. At Molonglo, a condition of affairs exists which cannot be allowed to continue much longer. On numerous occasions I have raised this subject, but nothing has been done. Most of those who know Canberra are proud of this capital city; but the only features that detract from our pride are those horrible plague spots at Molonglo and the Causeway. I admit that conditions prevailing at the latter place are not quite so bad as those at Molonglo. I impress upon the Government that, in developing its housing scheme, it cannot dodge its responsibility much longer. People are at work in Canberra - I am not silent or inactive in the matter - who are determined that the Government shall take action immediately. The Government may, by speaking of its commitments in respect of defence, or by other subterfuges, seek to divert attention from this plague spot; its inactivity in this regard will not be countenanced much longer. There are people in this city who are prepared to take action to arouse public opinion to such an extent that the Government will be forced to do its job. The members of the Opposition and thousands of residents of Canberra, who have visited these places, are determined that action shall be taken to demolish these buildings. The Minister has informed the Committee of the thousands of pounds it proposes to spend to improve the housing conditions in Canberra. I know why that money is to be expended, and of the demand for additional accommodation ; but before one penny is expended to provide new homes for public servants the Government should get rid of these plague spots to which I have referred. I again ask the Minister to bring this matter under the notice of the Minister for the Interior. </para>

                    <para>. - I appreciate the sincerity of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> concerning the conditions under which certain persons are living at Molonglo and the Causeway, and I assure him that the Government is as anxious as he is that everyone living in the Australian Capital Territory shall be properly housed-. Unfortunately most of the buildings to which the honorable senator refers were intended originally for an entirely different purpose, but when the population of Canberra increased at a rate greater than that at which housing provision could be made, the Federal Capital Commission, which was then controlling the activities in this territory, had to permit certain persons to occupy these premises until additional cottages could be built. I understand that the occupants of cottages at Molonglo and the Causeway will be allowed to move into new homes as they are erected ; but one of the greatest difficulties with which the Government is faced is that it is almost impossible to build houses rapidly enough to meet the demand. It is not altogether a matter of finance, because great difficulty is experienced in securing the services of skilled tradesmen. Recently I had a conversation with  Colonel Evans,  of Brisbane, who is carrying out certain constructional work at Captain&#39;s Elat, and he told me that as fast as he obtained skilled men for work at Captain&#39;s Elat their services were secured by the Government, <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> assure the Leader of the Opposition that the building programme will be expedited as rapidly as finance and general working conditions will permit. </para>

                    <para>. -  I again direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that not one pound of the money to be appropriated under this bill has any relation whatever to those who are living in those hovels at Molonglo and the Causeway. It is easy for the Minister to say that these people will be able to occupy new cottages when they are built, but the rents of the houses which the Government is erecting will be too high. For years I have raised this subject, and up to the present have displayed a good deal of moderation, but my patience is becoming exhausted. I do not wish to be told that I have referred to this subject on numerous occasions; I want something to be done. These places are destroying not only the health, but also the character of the occupants. We cannot expect to produce decent citizens when people are compelled, to live under indecent conditions. In a territory such as this, the Government&#39;s first responsibility should be to provide proper housing accommodation. The Government&#39;s housing programme should be accelerated without further argument, not only in respect of those to whom I have referred, but also in the direction of providing accommodation for artisans and others. What is happening at .present? A great proportion of the wages the Government is paying to workers in this Territory is being spent in Queanbeyan merely because housing accommodation is not available here. The Government should be building up this Territory and not an adjoining township, which is doing nothing whatever to assist its development. Government expenditure in Canberra is entirely responsible for the recent expansion which is evident in Queanbeyan. In the past my voice has been the voice of one crying in the wilderness, but that day lias passed as there are thousands of others who intend to do more than talk on this subject. I again ask the Minister to bring this matter under the notice of the Government. Immediate action must be taken. </para>

                    <para>. -  It must be obvious that it would be quite impossible this financial year to complete the buildings, the erection of which is about to be commenced. They are part and parcel of the main building programme for the Capital Territory. Obviously, it will be impossible to carry out, by the end of the financial year, the whole of the work provided for in &#39; these Estimates, particularly the more important works. Consequently, along with the total amount required, is shown a deduction amounting to  &#163;126,800  which will revert to Consolidated Revenue and be re-voted in the next financial year. At the moment <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> cannot supply details of the estimated further liability of  &#163;444,800,  but I shall give a general outline of the work proposed to be carried out out this year for which provision is being made in these Estimates. Principally, it is proposed to erect cottages in various suburbs to meet the rapid expansion of Canberra. For uncompleted works authorized during the financial year  1937-38  an amount of  &#163;163,910  is provided, and for entirely new services for this financial year the following amounts are proposed: Cottages,  &#163;170,000;  patents office,  &#163;30,000;  additions and alterations to cottages,  &#163;15,000;  a city garbage destructor, &#163;9,750; Canberra Community Hospital, &#163;0,000; minor miscellaneous works, &#163;7,340. Provision is being made for cottages at Griffith, class-room at school at Braddon, work at the aerodrome, a fire station, an additional block at Ainslie school, cottages and garages at Forrest, and work on the new high school, for which an appropriation of &#163;75,156 is being made. Engineering services include &#163;20,000 for road and street construction in new subdivisions, &#163;6,000 in respect of work at the aerodrome, and &#163;2,000 for kerbing and guttering roads. Works outside the city area consist of additions to a cottage at Jervis Bay, a residence at Mount Stromlo, and garages and fuel stores. It would be quite impossible to complete all these works by the end of Juno next. Consequently, some of the money now being appropriated will be carried over as an unexpended balance. Generally speaking, it is proposed to spread the expenditure as far as possible over the city. I assure honorable senators that we are pushing on with the general development of the city as quickly as possible. </para>

                    <para>. -  Concerning the estimated further liability of &#163;444,800, it would appear from the footnote that these Estimates were prepared some months ago, and that subsequent to their being printed an additional survey was made of the possibilities, not only of the erection of buildings, but also of securing additional money. Otherwise one would have expected to have had the Estimates completed without the after-thought which this footnote suggests. That afterthought must have developed very rapidly and, &#91; suggest, some attention must have been paid to the planning of important engineering and structural works. I cannot understand why the Estimates are brought down for an expenditure of &#163;504,000, plus this further estimated liability of &#163;444,S00. Undoubtedly this item would have gone through without any explanation by the Minister, had I not raised the matter. In my opinion the Estimates have not been placed before the committee in a proper manner. We have not had an opportunity to discuss them as fully as we should like. I am content to let the matter pass on this occasion with this protest, but I hope that in future the Government will place the fullest possible information in respect of each item before honorable senators. We shall then be enabled to understand the proposals more fully and, what is. perhaps, just as important, to know what financial arrangements have been made in respect of them. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. Much of the work which will be started during this financial year may continue not only throughout the next financial year but also into the following year. In connexion with the Patent Office, for instance, the total estimated cost of which is &#163;130,000, an amount of only &#163;30,000 is provided in this year&#39;s Estimates. It would not be right, I suggest, merely to provide for &#163;30,000 without informing honorable senators of the total estimated cost of the project. As the honorable senator has had experience as Minister for &#34;Works in Western Australia, he must know that many public works have to be spread over years, and that it would be unsound to appropriate the total estimated expenditure if only from 25 per cent, to 30 per cent, of it could be expended during the year. <inline font-style="italic">For</inline> these reasons we are appropriating only one year&#39;s expenditure in respect of the bigger works which will be commenced, or continued, this year. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that ten cottages, to be  built  at Griffith, are to cost &#163;11,000. As that sum represents over &#163;1,000 each, obviously, the rents will be more than the ordinary working man or the average clerk can pay. I imagine that very few junior members of the Public Service can afford to pay 30s a week as rent for a home. I am astounded at the high cost of building in Canberra, as compared with South Australia, where workmen&#39;s cottages can be erected for a total cost of &#163;470, including the price of the land, and are let at 12s. 6d. aweek. Evidently, building costs in Canberra are higher than in South Australia. A house cost-&#39; ing &#163;1,100, without land, can scarcely be called a workman&#39;s cottage, nor can it be said to be suitable for a public servant on a low salary. I should like the Government to erect homes for the lower paid members of the Public Service, as well as for workmen. </para>

                    <para>. - Each house will be of five rooms including the kitchen. As to providing homes for lower-paid public servants, I draw attention to the fact that &#163;170,000 is to be provided for the construction of cottages which will average from &#163;750 to &#163;1,000 each, the rents of which will be correspondingly lower than for the more costly buildings. The Minister for the Interior has authorized an inquiry into the cost of living in Canberra, including rents, in order that this subject may be dealt with fairly. That inquiry is proceeding. </para>

                        <para>- I take it that the inquiry will cover such matters as the cost of building in South Australia to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> referred, and the homes which were built in Perth by the Government of Western Australia about 30 years ago and were mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> last week. The desire is to vary as much as possible the types of homes to be built because, obviously, a man on a small salary cannot pay as much for a dwelling as can a man with a bigger income. The sum of &#163;170,000 will be expended in building cheapertypes of houses. It is useless to disguise the fact that building construction costs in Canberra are high. </para>

The rents of government houses include ground rent, rates and water rates, some of which charges would be additional to the rents paid by householders in the other cities of Australia. The Government is not satisfied with the cost of buildings in Canberra: that is one of the reasons why the Minister for the Interior has taken such a personal interest in this matter, and has authorized the inquiry to which I have referred. </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators will remember that last year the Senate passed a Therapeutic Substances Bill which was designed to give control over the importation of that class of medical preparations commonly kuown as biological preparations. These preparations include antitoxins, sera, vaccines and such extracts as insulin, and similar glandular preparations which are used in the treatment of diseases, both human and animal. </para>
                    <para>The measure which was passed last year was based largely upon the similar act in force in Great Britain, and in view of the fact that some of these important remedies are imported, it is necessary to maintain a close association with the authorities controlling the manufacture of these substances in the United Kingdom, America and other countries. Subsequent to the passing of the act, the preparation of regulations was put in hand, but it was found that the necessary co-operation with the British authorities was defective by reason of certain minor details. of the act as then passed. The present bill is designed to rectify these defects, to make the co-operation between Australia and other countries effective, and to make possible a better system of administration than was provided for in the act last year. </para>
                    <para>The principal amendments are contained in clauses 3, 5 and 6 of the bill. </para>
                    <para>Clause 3 gives a more precise definition of what is included in the term &#34;therapeutic substances &#34;. This is to correct an uncertainty in section 7 of the principal act, which was revealed when the preparation of regulations was undertaken, and additionally, it provides for the inclusion of substances used in the diagnosis as well as in the treatment of humans and animals. </para>
                    <para>Clause 5 makes provision for the forfeiture of substances which are imported in contravention of the act. </para>
                    <para>The only other clause to which it seems necessary to call attention is clause 6. Section 11 of the principal act provided that samples should be taken of all substances imported or sought to be exported.- As a result of the co-operation with overseas authorities to which I have already referred, it becomes unnecessary to sample all consignments sent to Australia. Accordingly, it is proposed to amend section 11 so as to empower an officer to take samples, where considered necessary, instead of requiring him to take- samples for analysis as a matter of routine in all importations. This does not mean that some substances will not be examined at all. Examination in Australia will only be dispensed with if there is satisfactory evidence that the substances have been examined or passed by overseas authorities. </para>
                    <para>It may be mentioned that, in order that the act shall work efficiently, the draft regulations will be made known and principal importers and others consulted before they are brought into effect. A period sufficiently long to permit of adjustments by importers and others will be given before the legal provisions actually operate. </para>

                <para>The bill makes provision for the payment of grants to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania during the financial year 1938-39. The amounts of these grants are those recommended by the Commonwealth GrantsCommission. Honorable senators will find these recommendations in the fifth report of the commission, which was tabled on the 21st September. The proposed grants, compared with those paid during 1937-38, are as follows: - </para>

                    <graphic href="157332193810190_29_0.jpg" />
                </para>
                <para>In bringing forward legislation for the grants which were paid to these States during earlier years the general principles upon which the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission are based have been ex plained to honorable senators at some length. It is. not proposed, therefore, to give a lengthy disquisition on the principles involved in determining the amounts mentioned in this bill. An account of these is set out in the commission&#39;s fifth report, to which I have already referred. </para>
                <para>Some brief reference, however, seems necessary to a few important features which affect the recommendiations of the grants for this year. The attitude generally of the Commonwealth in the past with regard to grants to the States has been that there exists some degree of obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to render financial assistance to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania by way of compensation for disabilities due to the effects of federation or the operation of Commonwealth policy. It has, however, been found impracticable to measure the financial effects of federation or federal policy on the States. Moreover, it would be necessary to assess also the value of the advantages accruing from federation and federal policy. Whilst it is not possible to assess these factors, the Grants Commission has given very careful consideration to this aspect, and in earlier reports has expressed the opinion that the necessity for grants tothese States is in no case due to any appreciable extent to the operation of federal policy. </para>
                <para>As has been explained in earlier years, the commission has evolved aplan whereby theState grantsare arrived at on the basis of financial needs. The commission recommends grants to bring the claimant States up to what it considers to be a fair Australian standard, which the commission fixes in relation to the financial experience of the non-claimant States, viz., New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. </para>
                <para>The commission considers that the grant should be sufficient to enable a State in difficulties tofunction at a standard not appreciably below that of other States. The State is required to make some effort itself in this regard. It will be appreciated that the adoption of a basis such as this, which requires a careful comparison of the budgetary results of the claimant States with those of the non-claimant States, present considerable difficulty; but a perusal of the commission&#39;s fifth report will, I think, convince honorable senators that this comparison has been carried out carefully and equitably. </para>
                <para>One difficulty arises from  the  fact that the accounts of all States are not compiled on a uniform basis. It therefore became necessary for the commission, aa iu previous years, to make certain adjustments to the figures in order to place the budgetary results on a comparable basis. Having arrived at the amount required to raise the claimant States to the budgetary standards of the non-claimant States, the commission then proceeded to make certain adjustments which it considered necessary. </para>
                <para>In making these adjustments several factors are taken into account, including the relative severity of taxation in the various States, differences in the costs of social services, costs of administration, and other relevant matters. </para>
                <para>This year, the commission has introduced a new feature in its work. It considers that, in times of prosperity, a claimant State should take action to improve its financial position which it cannot take in less prosperous years, and it should not incur expenditure which is unjustified or uneconomic. The commission, therefore, examined the finances of the claimant States for the year 1936-37 in the light of the general improvement of economic and financial conditions. In the exercise of its general judgment, it has made a nominal adjustment in each case to draw the attention of the claimant States to their duty in this respect; the items particularly examined being, in the &#60;&#39;ase of South Australia, the failure to recover debts due to the Crown, and in the case of Western Australia, expenditure of loan moneys oh  unreproductive  projects. In the case of Tasmania, the commission took cognizance of the fact that the financial position of the railways of that State was steadily growing worse. As there was some evidence of unnecessary expenditure, the commission made a nominal adjustment to draw attention to the urgent necessity for a reduction of railway losses. </para>
                <para>The only comments which I desire to make upon these special adjustments are these: the commission was set up as an independent body to investigate the claims of the States for financial assistance. There is ample evidence that the commission has discharged its duty with thoroughness and in a wholly impartial manner. The Government, therefore, feels that it must accept these special adjustments as a bona fide attempt on the part of the commission to ensure that grants of financial assistance to the States shall be based on sound, principles. </para>
                <para>I now desire to refer very briefly to the variations in the grants proposed for the current year. Before doing so, however, I remind honorable senators that the basis adopted by the commission renders it necessary for the grants to be assessed by an examination of the budgetary results of the latest year for which complete data is available. In this case, the basic figures are those for the financial year 1936-37. </para>
                <para>The grant proposed for South Australia, namely, &#163;1,040,000, is a reduction of &#163;160,000 on the grant recommended and paid last year. This reduction is mainly accounted for by improvement of that State&#39;s finances for the year 1936-37 - the year of comparison, in that year, South Australia had a surplus of &#163;139,000. Regard has also been paid to the fact that the relative burden * of taxation in&#39; South Australia has decreased. </para>
                <para>Whilst the grant recommended for Western Australia, viz., &#163;570,000, is &#163;5,000 less than last year&#39;s grant, actually the normal grant now recommended is an increase on the normal grant paid last year. The normal grant paid in 1937-38 was &#163;439,000, plus a special advance of &#163;136,000 on account of drought, to be adjusted in 1939-40, bringing the total sum to &#163;575,000. The normal grant recommended for this year is &#163;614,000, from which is deducted a special advance of &#163;44,000, made in 1936-37. The normal grant recommended this year is, therefore, in fact, &#163;175,000 greater than the normal grant of last year. This increase is accounted for by the effect of a drought on the State finances in 1936-37, which showed a deficit of &#163;371,000 as compared with a surplus of &#163;S8,000 in 1935-36. </para>
                <para>The proposed grant to Tasmania, namely, &#163;410,000, represents a reduction of &#163;165,000 in comparison with the grant paid last year. The principal factor in bringing about this reduction is the lower burden of taxation in that State for the year 1936-37 in relation to the other States. The commission&#39;s report indicates that in 1935-36 and 1936-37 there was a considerable increase of Tasmania&#39;s community income, due to a great improvement in business activity generally. As a consequence, the relative taxable capacity of the State increased very appreciably, and Tasmania&#39;s index of severity of taxation has fallen from 107 to 93, owing mainly to increased taxable capacity, low rates of income tax, low motor taxation and low local government taxation. </para>
                <para>Whilst the facts that I have just stated broadly explain the variations of the grants now proposed from those which were paid last year, the fact that, in respect of two States, the grant is reduced to an extent which, perhaps, may not appear to be in accord with the present budgetary trend of those States, calls for further comment. As I have already said, the grants are arrived at by comparison of the results of all States. Consequently, the grants should normally be reduced when the relative budgetary results of the claimant States improve, and should be increased if the relative budgetary results of those. States show some retrogression. As already mentioned, the commission&#39;s calculations are based upon the financial results of the year 1936-37. There is thus what is now generally described as a &#34;time lag&#34; of two years, and, as the commission pointed out in one of its earlier reports, if conditions are changing rapidly in the States concerned, the grant recommended may prove to be in disharmony with the needs of the State for that particular year. However, the error, if any, is not cumulative, and the differences will balance out over a term of years. Some might argue that the conditions which the States are facing this year do not justify any reduction of the grant. The grants recommended, however, are the automatic effect of the application of the commission&#39;s principles based on the results of 1936-37, and it would not be possible to depart from the procedure which has now been followed for four years without to a large extent nullifying the principles which have been laid down by the commission *nd accepted by the Government. </para>
                <para>I remind honorable senators that the Government did not hesitate to accept the recommendations of the commission during the last four years. In the first two years of that period, the commission recommended an appreciable increase of the grants, notwithstanding that the States&#39; finances were then generally improving. Following the same policy, the Government now feels that it is quite reasonable to adopt the recommendations of the commission for reduced grants this year, even though in some quarters it may be felt that the present financial position of the States concerned does not appear to justify such a reduction. It is not reasonable, to form a judgment in regard to these grants on the. basis of one year only. A proper appreciation of the effect of the commission&#39;s recommendations can be obtained only by taking a long-range view. If the grants recommended by the commission over the last five years, including those now proposed, are examined in comparison with the State finances for the same period, it will be agreed that the grants are in accord with the general trend of those finances. </para>
                <para>Perhaps I should add&#39; that the commission&#39;s recommendations are based upon known facts. That is to say, the grants recommended are based upon the actual financial results of the States. The most serious objection to this method is, of course, that the effects of important changes in State finances are not reflected in the grants until two years after. I submit, however, that this objection is far less serious than the objections that would necessarily follow any attempt to assess grants in any year on the basis of the estimated results for that year. As honorable senators will agree, estimates are not always reliable. On the whole, it is much preferable to base grants on actual results. </para>
                <para>In conclusion, I refer honorable senators to a table appearing in the commission&#39;s report showing the effect of special grants and advances on the budgetarypositions of the claimant States. As hon-  orable  senators will see, these figures indicate that the grants have had the effect of restoring the finances of the States concerned to what may fairly be called budgetary equilibrium. This result, reveals, I submit, that the policy of the Commonwealth Government in accepting the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission has proved very satisfactory to the States concerned. I recommend the bill to the favorable consideration of honorable senators. </para>

                    <para class="block">On Thursday, the 13th October, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> asked me a question, without notice, in regard to the Commonwealth fisheries investigation vessel. I am- now in a position to inform the honorable senator that the vessel was commissioned in May last, and commenced its first experimental cruise during that month. The cruise ended on the 9th June. It covered the coastal waters of Victoria from Port Phillip Bay to Wilson&#39;s Pro*montory; eastern Bass Strait from </para>
                    <para class="block">Wilson&#39;s Promontory via the Kent Group to Flinders Island; the east coast of Tasmania; and the southern waters of Tasmania as far west as South West Cape. An important object was to test the boat and gear, and the vessel proved to be a good sea boat in the somewhat heavy seas experienced. It was found, however, that a little modification of some of the gear was required for maximum efficiency. During the cruise, fairly large quantities of tuna were encountered in various localities, and it was demonstrated that they could be caught - by means of comparatively inexpensive fishing outfits. </para>
                    <para>The second part of the first cruise began at Melbourne on the 22nd July, and ended at Sydney on the 19th August. It covered the coastal waters of Victoria from Port Phillip Bay to Wilson&#39;s Promontory; eastern Bass Strait from Wilson&#39;s Promontory via the Kent Group to Flinders Island; the coastal waters of the Furneaux Group; the coastal waters of Victoria from Wilson&#39;s Promontory to Gabo Island, and the coastal waters of New South Wales as far north as Sydney. Tuna were again encountered, and observations were made regarding other fish, such as barracouta, salmon, and anchovies. Some dredging -for shell fish - scallops - was also carried out at times. Once again the vessel provided further evidence of its sea-worthiness. Following the very successful first voyage of the <inline font-style="italic">Warreen,</inline> when large shoals of tuna were observed in the south-eastern area, it was found that the shoals had taken off. Pending their anticipated return in October a rapid survey of the waters north of Port Hacking, taking in the New South Wales and southern Queensland coasts as far as Hervey Bay, was made in September. This was largely a cruise designed to determine the presence or absence of tuna and pilchards at this season off this extensive section of the coast. Actually it was not anticipated that large shoals would be found, 3ince observations made from the air in July and August of last year indicated only local groups of pilchards. This may, in fact, be a season of migration, when few fish are to be caught. </para>
                    <para>The vessel travelled approximately 2,000 miles without sighting any shoals which might bc considered of commercial importance, this fact tending to confirm the theory that this is an &#34; off &#34; season. Only one fairly large shoal of pilchards was encountered off Coffs Harbour, but small lots of four different types of tuna were noticed all the- way north of Port Stephens, and samples were caught. It is almost certain that larger quantities are to be found at other seasons, and this is a point to be investigated. Meanwhile it is important to note that at least four kinds of tuna - bonito. little tunney, skipjack, and yellow-fin - occur off this coast. A particularly important find is the yellow-fin tuna, which is the backbone of the great Californian industry. Further investigations in the more tropical regions may show that commercially important quantities of this species arc present at certain seasons, and that off Queensland we have a counterpart to the large runs of blue-fin tuna already known to occur in the south-east. The vessel is at the present time engaged in investigations in the south-eastern waters of Tasmania. It is emphasized that the work being undertaken by the vessel is of a fairly long-range character. Movements and distribution of fish must he studied over a period in order to furnish reliable information upon which an industry could be based. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to refer to a statement which has appeared in the press concerning  which  certain remarks have been made in and about the precincts of this Parliament. These are to the effect that the Premier of Queensland, the  Hon.  &#34;William Forgan Smith, made statements concerning individuals in Queensland which, it was said, could not have been made unless the Premier had had access to the income tax returns of those persons. Comments were made regarding the undesirability - and that was not the strongest term used - of a Premier disclosing from confidential returns the condition  of anybody&#39;s income. Knowing the Premier of Queensland as I do, I was sure that ho had done nothing of the kind. I took the opportunity at once to make inquiries into the matter, and I found that the Premier had given a categorical denial in. the Queensland Parliament of the charges made. I propose to show how these canards are invented, circulated and emphasized in Parliament by those who have nothing against the Premier of Queensland except that he is a Labour man; they hate him because of that fact. In no State of the Commonwealth, except Queensland, and in no other country, as far as I am aware, could any Premier or any other individual have the right of access to the- income tax returns of individuals; but in Queensland it is possible to do that because of action taken by men who were previously in this National Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- That is true. A few years ago a desire was evinced to pull down a certain Minister in this Parliament when the treasury bench was occupied by the Labour party. Emissaries were sent to Queensland from this Parliament, and, because a tory government was then in office in Queensland, they had a fertile field in which to do their sowing. I shall indicate what was done between 1929 and 1931 when the Moore Government was in office in that State. The following amendment was made, bv regulation, to the Income Tax Act:-&#34; lt shall bc the duty of every officer and person appointed and employed under the act, or engaged in its &#39; administration, to make prompt, full and faithful answer to anr inquiry by the Treasurer, and when so required by the Treasurer, to furnish him promptly with all documents in thu possession and control of such  officer  or person relating to the affairs or income of or income tax payable or paid by any person or body, notwithstanding that that information in respect thereof has been in any way acquired by such officer or person or any such document lias come into his possession or control or has been made by him in connexion or in consequence of his employment on official duties under the act. </para>

No other parliament has ever made it possible for a. Treasurer or any person appointed by him to go to an income tax commissioner and demand the production of any individual&#39;s income tax return.Ido not wish to detain the Senate by citing the Premier&#39;s reply contained in the QueenslandHansard, and accepted by the House, that he did not get the information directly or through the Treasurer in the manner suggested, but that he obtained it in a legitimate way and without reference to the Income Tax Department or the Taxation Commissioner.

                            Both in the Federal and in the State spheres the private affairs of an individual, as disclosed in income tax returns, have always been regarded as confidential. Tho only statement I have heard was to the effect that the Premier of Queensland has been accused of violating some provision of the Income Tax Act. The honorable senator has explained the position; but I cannot overlook the fact that the party now in power in Queensland has not seen fit to repeal the obnoxious regulation. That seems most unfortunate.

                    <para>I had prepared some notes on the subject mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane,</inline> and I proposed to deal with it at some length ; but in order to save time, I may perhaps be permitted to give from memory an answer to the questions which hesubmitted. Two classes of news are broadcast from Daventryto Australia. That received throughReuters is copyright, having been bought and paid for by a group of newspapers in Australia. As it would be impracticable for Daventry to broadcast such news, we were informed to that effect. Daventry has no right to transmit such news to us, and we have no right to broadcast it. It is only fair, however, to inform honorable senators - I am now speaking from memory - that within a few days of being informed of the position that Daventry could not let us have news to broadcast to the Australian public, the organization which had purchased the broadcasting rights offered the contents of the messages to the Postal Department. I do not think that it is dignified for Australia to accept gifts from any organization, and as we were getting from other sources what, was required by the people, I informed the  Deputy  Director of Posts and Telegraphs that we had no desire to avail ourselves of the proferred service. The honorable senator was so rude as to say that I had given an impudent answer to his questions. </para>

                            <para>- If that is so, the honorable senator has been misreported. The information which he gave fairly demonstrates the fact that he knew that this copyright exists, and that he was having a &#34; go &#34; at the press. The news was offered voluntarily to the Government; but the Government, in declining the offer, said that it was able to make its own arrangements. There are other considerations which I am not at liberty to discuss, but which would answer the points raised by the honorable- senator. He may have noticed that at the recent Cairo Convention provision was made to send cable messages to broadcasting bodies at press rates, and the Australian Broadcasting Commission will see that full advantage is taken of that provision immediately it becomes effective so that we shall not be under any obligation in respect of nows. While Daventry was quite willing to broadcast everything that was available it was the duty of the Government, owingto the legal difficulty in respect of copyright, to act as it did. </para>

I said that the whole reply was impudent, and I reminded him that although there were once 33 Government supporters in this chamber and only three honorable senators in the Opposition, there are now only nineteen Government supporters and sixteen in Opposition. Had the Minister, following my remarks, given the information which he has now disclosed, it would have been decidedly helpful to me.
