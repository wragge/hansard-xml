                        <para>. - Owing to the way in which the items are set out it is extremely difficult to determine whether the duties under these items have been increased or decreased. The Minister may be in  a  position to answer that question offhand without reference to the officials. It is exceedingly hard for an ordinary person who refers to the item, or to the memorandum setting out details of the changes, to say whether the proposed alteration will mean an increase or a decrease at the outset, or whether there will eventually he an increase as the quantity increases. Will the Minister say whether this -alteration involves an increase or a decrease, and if so, will it be constant over the whole item? </para>

                        <para>. - Concurrent with the increase from 3s. 6d. to 5s. per !b. made in May, . 1.936, in the import duties on tobacco leaf used in the manufacture of tobacco in which the proportion of Australian leaf used was less than 13 per cent., corresponding increases were made in the duty on imported manufactured tobacco, in order that Australian manufacturers, who purchase practically the whole of the local tobacco crop, would be adequately safeguarded against importation of the manufactured product. The amendment now made is for a reduction on cut tobacco of United Kingdom manufacture containing 13 per cent. of Australian leaf to the level of the duties obtaining prior to May, 1936. The reduction is from 10s. 6d. to 9s. 3d. per lb. The amendment is made in order that United Kingdom manufacturers may incorporate the required percentage of Australian leaf in the tobacco which they export to Australia and receive the benefit of the lower tariff rate. That rate still provides adequate protection to Australian manufacturers who incorporate the required percentage of Australian leaf in their blends, as they, in turn, are granted the lower import rate of 3s. 6d. per lb. on their tobacco loaf. Moreover, satisfactory evidence that the imported manufactured product contains the required percentage of Australian leaf is demanded before entry at the lower rate of 9s. 3d. per lb. is permitted. While it is not expected that there will bc a substantial development in the immediate future in the use of Australian leaf by United Kingdom manufacturers, due in some measure to the necessity for acquiring matured stocks of better quality leaf, the Government##'##s proposal opens the way for the use of Aus-##"## tralian leaf by British manufacturers in their export tobaccoes and, if it achieves that end, there is the further possibility of its use in the domestic trade of the United Kingdom. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to know whether Great Britain is using any Australian tobacco leaf. It seems strange that we are importing more fine-grown tobacco every year. In 1933 imports amounted  to  11,600,000 lb. and grew to 17,000,000 lb. in 1935, and to 19,500,000 lb. in 1936-37. It is strange that while the Government claims that it is doing its best for the industry, there should be a constant growth of importations of foreign tobacco. Personally, I doubt whether the contemplated action will aid the Australian tobacco industry. The action taken by a Labour government some years ago gave a great impetus to the tobacco-growing industry. It then became possible for hundreds of additional men to go on the land to grow tobacco leaf. We know what action was  taken by the tobacco combine. Manufacturers refused to blend Australian tobacco, and the Australian consumer did not like it unblended. There was no demand for Australian leaf. The tobacco trust at that time did not wish to see the development in Australia of the tobacco-growing industry. I understand that, in Queensland, particularly in the Mareeba district, a light-leaf tobacco sought after by Australian consumers is being grown. Instead of playing with the business as it is doing, the Government, if it is really serious, should take other action to foster and develop the industry. There has been a tremendous increase in the profits of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company in recent years. ##"##While the grower of tobacco leaf is struggling to maintain himself in reasonable comfort, the profits of that company have developed extraordinarily. In 1935 they were ##£##585,000 ; in 1936, ##£##667,000 ; and in 1937, ##£##911,000. L am using only round figures. Also, in the last-mentioned year, ##£##307,000 was distributed on ordinary shares in the form of a special dividend .of 3$ .per cent. That should be of interest to the so-called representatives in this chamber of primary producers. Members of the Labour party represent the primary producers; but there are some honorable senators on the Government side who flatter themselves- that .they represent the man on the land better than we do. They contend that they are the true representatives of .the country. They should be deeply interested in this item. Tobacco-growers are primary producers, and every effort should be made by representatives of the Country party to develop the industry. Before <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page joined the Ministry he was an active supporter of our ideas, but he has since fallen from grace. Perhaps getting into the Ministry has a demoralizing effect on members of Parliament. </para>

Both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thompson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page may have carried on the fight in the Cabinet-room and been beaten. Carreras Limited have increased their dividends from 12f per cent, in 1935 to 33$ per cent, in 1937. The two companies I have mentioned manufacture about 90 per cent, of the tobacco grown in Australia. They are the sole buyers, and they dominate the market. They can give what price they like to the poor devil of a producer,, who is working hard on the land to make a bare living. If there were competition in the purchase of leaf, the grower would be likely to get a better price. Tho price will continue low if the buying is confined to one or two companies. I doubt very much, whether the action taken under this item will increase competition for Australian-grown leaf. I should like the Minister to demonstrate how the item will work, and prove to me that Great Britain will buy Australian tobacco leaf, manufacture it, and send it back to us. </para>

                        <para>. - Up to the present no British blend, including Australian leaf, has been sent to Australia. This alteration of duty has been decided upon because a tobacco manufacturing company in England is desirous of using a certain percentage of Australian leaf in its blends, and the Government considered that the proposition merited a concession of duty. At the moment it is impossible to say what the result of this duty will be, but it is well worth trying in the hope that a new market for Australian leaf will be opened up. The last report of the Tariff Board on the tobacco industry was published in January, 1932, but the Leader of the Opposition is aware that it is not necessary to refer to the Tariff Board excise duties, which are imposed wholly for revenue purposes. </para>

                            <para>- I assure the honorable senator that all of the light leaf, and all higher grades of leaf grown at Mareeba are being readily purchased. In 1927-2S the total usings of Australian leaf amounted to 1,331,871 lb., or 5.8 per cent. of the total of tobacco leaf used in manufacture in Australia. By 1930-31 that figure increased to 3,595,146 lb., and in 1936-37 to 5,308,886 lb., or 22.2 per cent. of the gross total. I do not think that any honorable senator need have any fear of the effect of the Government##'##s policy in regard to this industry. I do not know what has been the experience of other honorable senators from Queensland, but for many months past I have not had any representations made to me from tobacco-growers in that State. That is a valuable sign, because in the past growers lost no opportunity to ventilate any grievance as quickly as possible. Briefly reviewing the action taken by the Government in respect of this industry, I point out that in November, 1933, the protection to growers was increased by the imposition of an additional 6d. a lb. on imported |tobacco leaf, bringing the total duty up to 3s. 6d. a lb. In September, 1935, the excise duty on tobacco manufactured wholly from Australian leaf was reduced by 8d. from 4s. 6d. to 3s.10d. a lb. In May. 1936, a higher import duty was charged on tobacco leaf used in the manufacture of tobacco in which less than 13 per cent., by weight, of Australian leaf was used, and in the manufacture of cigarettes in which less than2##½## per cent. by weight, of Australian leaf was used. The effect of the 1936 measure was to force manufacturers to incorporate the required percentage of Australian leaf in their blends. The combined result of the legislation introduced by this Government with respect to tobacco has been the creation of a much wider demand for tobacco products containing Australian leaf. This fact is demonstrated by the figures which I .  have just cited. Presumably, one reason why import figures are higher is that there has been an increased demand for tobacco manufactures generally. </para>

                        <para>.- This item deals mainly with raw materials for confectionery, and, in some cases imports of confectionery. These two divisions represent totally different interests. Although some small relief has beengiven to the confectioners I do not think that the Government has been very generous to them. Some months ago I accompanied a deputation which waited upon the Minister on behalf of the confectionery interests; and it put up a very good case for relief. The confectioners##'## main complaint was that the raw materials which they had to import, such as cocoa beans, nuts, gum arabic, aluminium foil, tin plate, ginger, and liquorice, were subject also to primage duty. I do not know how honorable senators generally view primage duty, but we were given to understand that primage, particularly in respect of raw materials, would be removed at the earliest opportunity. A definite promise to that effect was given. There is no indication in this item, however, that primage duty, or for that matter any other duty, has been reduced on what are essential raw materials of the confectionery industry. For that reason the Government cannot claim that it has been generous to this important industry which employs a large number of people. I disagree with the view held by some people that confectionery is a luxury; it is a necessary food. At any rate, the industry is of sufficient importance to be well worth fostering, and I urge the Minister to see whether relief cannot be given to confectionery manufacturers in respect of the duties on the raw materials. Of course, sugar, which is the main article required by the trade, is grown in Australia, but the other raw materials of the trade are not grown in Australia, and imports of such cannot be said to compete with any home grown product. The only article in respect of which there might be a slight doubt in that regard is almonds, which alone of all the raw materials required by the trade, are grown in Australia. However, they are not grown here in anything like sufficient quantities to meet local requirements. I am aware that the almond growers of South Australia are experiencing a fairly bad time and need all the protection that they can get. I point out, however, that the Australian production of almonds is very small. Furthermore, the quality of the Australian almond leaves room for improvement and growers might well pay attention to that aspect of their industry. I again ask the Minister to see whether some further relief can be given to confectioners in respect of customs and primage duty on their raw materials. </para>

                        <para>. -  I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> that his request will receive careful consideration. However, the removal of primage duty is a matter of Government policy. I remind the honorable senator that in respect of quite a number of industries the Government has already removed primage duty. Unfortunately the confectionery manufacturing industry has not benefited in that direction. The Government, however, recognizes that this is not a luxury industry and is supported in that opinion by the report of the Tariff Board. This industry has an output of approximately ##£##5,000,000 per annum and is a large consumer of Australian products. It gives employment to about 7,000 people, whose wages total about ##£##1,000,000 annually. I assure the honorable senator that, when the finances permit, sympathetic consideration will be given to his representations for the removal of primage duty on raw materials required by this industry. I undertake to bring his remarks under the notice of the Minister. </para>

                        <para>. -  I should be glad to hearan explanation of this item, and also of item 89. I take it that item 88 relates mainly to table salt and item 89 to stock salt. What is the reason for the increased duties? Salt is a fairly weighty substance, and as it is found on the surface of the land and the winning of it does not require any elaborate mining process, it  seems improbable that foreigners could dump large quantities of salt into this country and undersell local producers. </para>

                            <para>- Salt is manufactured in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland, in each of which States there are large deposits. When the Tariff Board inquiry was held in 1936, it was claimed that Australian dairy salt was unsuitable, but the board expressed the opinion that Australian butter does not suffer from being mixed with the best Australian dairy salt. Australian companies are able to supply the whole of the local requirements. Five companies are operating in Victoria, eight in South Australia, five in Western Australia and one in Queensland. In addition, several individual propiietors are in the business. The Australian production totals about 100,000 tons a year. </para>

                        <para>. - In the memorandum which has been issued to honorable senators it will be seen that the duty under the British preferential tariff was previously 15 per cent. net. The exchange adjustment reduces the 20 per cent. to 15 per cent. As was stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> the Australian salt industry has grown considerably during recent years. For some time it was subjected to intense competition from the United States of America. Most of the work of salt production is associated, not with the gathering of the salt, but with processing, packing and distributing. The total quantity of very fine table salt produced in Australia is about 120 tons a year. Several firms in Australia are producing salt equal to that produced in any other country. </para>

                        <para>. - The previous duty of 20s. a ton was subject to exchange adjustment, so that the reduction is not from 20s. to 5s.; but rather from 15s. to 5s. Salt can be produced at little cost, and consequently only a low duty is necessary to protect the industry. The investigation of the Tariff Board revealed no necessity for high rates of duty, as overseas competitors found it practically impossible to compete with local producers. The Government accepted its recommendation, and the industry itself made no protest. </para>

                        <para>In view of the fact that it is only, in the higher grades of salt that protection is neces- sary, consideration has been given to  the question  of applying duties to those grades only, but in view of the great difficulties in administration which would arise  from the  necessity to distinguish between  the  various  grades, the  boardhas arrived at the conclusion that all salt imported  in  hulk or in packages over 14 lb. net should be accorded similar treatment for tariff purposes. </para>
                        <para>All the avenues of investigation followed by the hoard lead to the conclusion that a reduction in duty is desirable. The boardis satisfied that thelocal industry will continue to operate successfully under a duty of5s. per ton ( British preferential tariff) while exchange is at its present level. Owing to the wide variations in f.o.b. prices and the differences in packing, it is extremely difficult to arrive at a figure representing an average protection per ton afforded by exchange, but the board is satisfied that the local industry will be adequately protected if the duty under the British preferential tariff is brought up to its existing rate of 20s. per ton in the event of exchange r everting to par. </para>

                        <para>. - In sub-item (a) the proposed rates compare with the rates under the 1933-36 tariff as follows:In 120(a)(1) and (2) there is an increase of1##¼## per cent. in the British preferential tariff. In 120 (a) (1) there is a reduction of 5 per cent., and in (a) (2) a reduction of 7##½## per cent in the intermediate tariff. There is no change in the general tariff. The amendment now proposed is the result of a recommendation of the Tariff Board contained in its report of the 28th September, 1937. There was little evidence at the Tariff Board##'##s inquiry with respect to the general level of the duties under this item. Consequently, the board recommended no material alteration of the rates. In the main, the evidence tendered to the Tariff Board related to requests for special treatment of certain classes of goods included in the item. </para>

                    <para>The principal requests on which the Tariff Board made comment were, first, piece-goods for the manufacture of art needlework, and, secondly, printed cotton bedspreads and dimity quilts. The local manufacturers of art needlework requested . admission from the United Kingdom free of duty and primage of all textile piece-goods, except those of wool or containing wool, whether defined or not for cutting up, provided they were used in the manufacture of art needlework. The Tariff Board did not make a definite recommendation upon this request, but specially brought the request under notice. The Government gave very careful consideration to it, but in view of the importance of textiles from the revenue point of view, was unable to concede free admission.However, the </para>
                    <para class="block">Government recognized that the art needlework manufacturers were labouring under difficulties as regards defined piece-goods, such as coloured bordered materials, as such piece-goods .-were dutiable at the same rate of duty as the finished articles into which they were made. Accordingly, action was taken under the proposals now before the committee by an amendment of tariff items 105 (b) and 105 (m)(1), to admit at the ordinary piece-goods rates, defined cotton or linen piece-goods for the manufacture of cosies,  doyleys,  pillow-shams, tablecentres, table-covers, table-runner3 or tray-cloths. This action should enable the art needlework manufacturers profitably to extend their range of production. </para>
                    <para>At the time of the board##'##s inquiry, dimity quilts and printed cotton bedspreads were dutiable under the item now before the committee. Dimity quilts are similar to  marcella  quilts, provided for at the lower revenue rates under item 120 (f) and are principally used in hospitals. The board expressed the opinion that dimity quilts should be included with the other quilts under item 120 (f) and action was taken along these lines in the present proposals. Printed cotton bedspreads are used as a substitute for quilts by persons who cannot afford the higher-priced articles. Consequent upon the Tariff Board##'##s recommendation, action was taken under the present proposals to include them in item 120 (f), subject to departmental by-laws. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like some information about sub-item (n), which imposes the duties on cotton or linen handkerchiefs. It would seem that there has not been any alteration; but I remind the committee that the duties were reduced by 5 per cent, in 1932, subject to a further reduction of the British preferential tariff when the Exchange Adjustment Act came into operation. Apparently .the old duties were 30 per cent., whereas the duty now proposed in the British preferential tariff is 22##£## per cent., with exchange adjustment, which, I understand, will make the rates the same as formerly. Importations in 1934-35 amounted in value to ##£##128,000, and in 1936-37 to ##£##206,000, or an increase of nearly 70 per cent. As the Australian manufacturers in 1935-36 produced 1,278,000 dozen handkerchiefs, valued at a little over ##£##200,000, there appears to be no reason why they should not have the bulk of the trade in these goods.; but figures given to me show that in 1935-36 Ave imported 2,270,000 dozen. As the major costs are for labour and packing, this is an industry that might very well be encouraged. A lowering of the duty will not have that effect. 3 have not heard any one complain of the price of handkerchiefs; on the contrary, I think most people are rather surprised that they are so cheap. </para>

                        <para>. - The item to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has directed attention deserves more than passing attention. Australian manufacturers of cotton arid linen handkerchiefs are producing goods equal to those made in any other part of the world, with the possible exception of the finer kinds of embroidered handkerchiefs, which, I understand, are imported in considerable quantities from Switzerland. The fact remains that in the matter of output the Australian manufacturers of cotton and linen handkerchiefs are going backward instead, of forward, owing to the increased severity of the competition particularly from the United Kingdom. According to the information at my disposal the imports in 1932-33 were 527,000 dozen; in- 1935-36, S44,000 dozen, and in 1936-37, 882,000 dozen. The Australian manufacturers, who previously enjoyed 60 per cent, of the local market, have now only 50 per cent, of it. Moreover, a great deal of the excessive competition is coming from Japan, due, largely, to the . trade diversion policy adopted by this Parliament. The members of the Opposition would like the duties on cotton and linen handkerchiefs increased considerably, in order to reduce the severity of the competition from other countries, and. thus give to Australian manufacturers a better opportunity to capture more of the local market. Yesterday I referred to the fact that every reduction of duty threatens persons already in employment, or closes possible avenues to others who are unemployed. Can the Minister satisfy the committee - I do not see how he can, in view of the figures I have quoted - that efforts are being made to ensure that Australian manufacturers shall not he prevented from holding a reasonable portion of the local trade? </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to correct the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> that importations from Japan are increasing. The official figures show that the importations from that country have been as follow: 1934-35, 21,773 dozen, valued at ##£##1,180; 1835-36, 1S,514 dozen, valued at ##£##1,164; and 1936-37, 11,385 dozen, valued at ##£##599. For the first eight months of 1937-38, 4,058 dozen, valued at ##£##263, were imported. The proposed rates under the British preferential and intermediate tariff columns are those recommended by the Tariff Board, while the general tari g rates on both handkerchiefs and serviettes include a margin for the purposes of treaty negotiations. In respect of. both handkerchiefs and serviettes, local manufacturers import the cloth in the piece, and perform the hemming or hemstitching processes in Australia. Practically the whole of the cloth is of United Kingdom origin, and is admitted at the rates of id. a square yard or 5 per cent., whichever is the lower in the case of cotton; and 5 per cent.  :i.d  valorem in the case of linen. The proposed rates on the complete handkerchiefs and serviettes, therefore, provide a minimum net protection over the duties on the cloth of 17-^ per cent. British and 45 per cent, foreign, on handkerchiefs, and 15 per cent. British, and 40 per cent, general on serviettes. Figures supplied at the Tariff Board##'##s inquiry showed that there has been a steady increase since 1932 in the Australian production of handkerchiefs, and that local manufacturers are catering for about 60 per cent, in quantity and value of the requirements of all classes of handkerchiefs, and for the bulk of requirements of plain handkerchiefs. The figures in respect of Australian production are - </para>

I may repeat the assurance given by the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs that if a prima facie case for increased protection can be presented to the department the matter will be referred to the Tariff Board for further inquiry. If the position is as stated by the Leader of the Opposition those engaged in the industry can again bring the matter before the Tariff Board. </para>

It appears that it has at last realized the accuracy of the statements made in this chamber when the last tariff schedule was under discussion that undyed material was being imported into Australia, and; after being dyed, entered into competition with Australian-made denims and drills. After two years of agitation by the manufacturers the Government at last realized that we were right when we said that that practice was being adopted. </para>

                    <para>Protective duties were imposed because certain importers, in order to defeat the object of the duties recommended by the Tariff Board on cotton drills and similar cloths, had availed themselves of a loophole in the tariff and had been importingundyed cotton duck at the comparatively low revenue rates of duty prevailing, dyeing the cloth locally and using it in the manufacture of overalls in substitution for heavyweight cotton drills of Australian manufacture. Had the cotton duck been imported in the dyed state it would undoubtedly have been liable to the protective duties under tariff item 105(a)(1) (b), but, being imported in the undyed state, it could not be stated that upon importation the principal use of the undyed duck was for manufacture into male outer clothing as, in that state, the cloth was similar to that used mainly in the manufacture of tents and sails. The result was, as has already been stated, that the undyed cotton duck for overalls escaped the protective duties under tariff item 105(a) (1)(b) and was entered at the revenue rates under item 130(b)(1). </para>

In every capital city there are firms manufacturing materials for tents and sails, and some of them are supplying government  departments  extensively. It cannot be argued that the Australian industry is not efficient, or is not making the goods satisfactorily. The industry employs a large a mount of labour, and should, in my opinion, be protected up to the hilt. Can the Minister tell me what the position of the industry is? Are local manufacturers holding their own ? </para>

                        <para>.- My remarks on a previous item apply also to this one, which, I am inclined to think, provides another loophole in the tariff. Certain goods that should come under this heading, are imported as ##"## knitted lock-stitched piece-goods in tubular-form, or otherwise ##"##. This loophole needs to be stopped. Manufacturers of meat wraps  say  that tubular-form goods, knitted goods, and lock-stitched cotton goods imported  as meat wraps  at a cheap rate, compete with their products unfairly. I ask the Minister  to  investigate that statement and see whether there is any truth in it. </para>

Practically the whole of the wrappings  imported are used for the export of lamb and beef. I do not know whether the exporters receive a rebate of duty on the wrapping. I suggest that they ought to be placed on the same footing as importers of raw materials. The importations should be allowed on as cheap a basis as possible in order to assist the export of lamb and beef. </para>

If the shortage is still acute at that date, the duty will be reconsidered. </para>

                        <para>. - A large expansion of the iron and steel industry at Port Kembla is taking place, and it is thought that by the 28th February, 1939, the local industry will be able to supply all requirements. If it is found on that date that the local demand has so far increased that it cannot be met locally, the reduction of duty will be continued. I can see no reason why we should specify 1942 as the date for reverting to the higher duty. I want to say frankly to the honorable senator, and to the committee generally, that if there is one industry that should be encouraged it is the production of iron and steel. There is a world shortage of iron and steel, and if we do not develop the local industry, we may be faced with a serious shortage of supplies in Australia. That would hold up building construction, the rearmament programme, and country development. There is a danger of finding  ourselves in a serious plight. It is estimated by the Government that the developments at Port Kembla will enable local manufacturers to supply local requirements by the datementioned in the item. In view of the development now taking place at Port Kembla, it would be very unfair to postpone the operation of this duty until 1942. On behalf of the Government, I assure honorable senators that if the demand cannot be met by local suppliers, the higher duty will be further deferred. As this matter has been fully investigated by the Government, I ask the committee not to fix a date haphazardly, but to reject the request. </para>

                        <para>. -  The Minister has given an undertaking that if Australian manufacturers cannot meet local demands, the date on which the higher duty shall come into operation will be further extended. The question that arises is as to what the Minister, or the suppliers, would call an adequate supply to meet local demands. The supply apparently is equal to the demand in Australia, but we should not overlook the difficulties that arise through uneven distribution. In respect of galvanized iron, for instance, it is well known that, whilst supplies may be readily available in metropolitan areas, they are unobtainable in country districts, which are completely starved for certain periods. The supplies come practically from the one centre, and the manufacturers themselves have a great deal to do with the transport of these materials to their customers in different parts of the Commonwealth. Instances frequently occur in which builders in country districts are held up while awaiting supplies of both constructional steel and galvanized iron, whilst elsewhere merchants have large stocks which they are prone to hold for fear that they may be unable to supply the demand in their own localities. We desire that this industry shall expand and flourish, but, despite the assurance given by the Minister, due regard is not being paid to the interests of those requiring these materials, unless steps are taken to ensure that the distribution is made more equitable. </para>

                        <para>.- I commend the Government in respect of this item. It has reduced the duty for a short period for reasons known to all honorable senators. All of us are aware that for three or four months there was a serious strike at Lysaght##'##s works at Newcastle. Fortunately, the men have now returned to work. I do not know the merits of the strike, but the factis that the works were closed for a long period. Australian galvanized iron is cheaper than the overseas product, and, in normal times, just as much difficulty is experienced in getting supplies from overseas as in getting them locally. This applies to many other iron products. Any honorable senator who has seen the extensive alterations being made at the Port Kembla works, and the big factory being built there for the manufacture of steel sheets of all kinds, will realize that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and the Australian Iron and Steel Company are undertaking something of which Australians can be proud, and which will undoubtedly supply not only the Australian market, (but also markets overseas. The fact is well known that the Australian steel billets and other billets are cheaper than the overseas product. We have supplied New Zealand with all its requirements in this respect. If there is an industry which requires looking after, it is surely the iron and steel industry, because it is to a large extent the basis of our prosperity and. certainly, the basis of the successful defence of this country. I do not doubt that there is a shortage of galvanized iron, but the Government is taking steps to see that a certain quantity is imported in order to enable the present deficit to be made up. It is just as well to remember, however, that that deficit was caused in the first place through a strike as. the result of which our main factory was closed down for three or four months. The new factory now being erected at Port Kembla will undoubtedly be capable of supplying the whole of Australia##'##s requirements for some years to come. </para>

I point out that this proposed duty, which will come into operation on the 1st January, 1939, will affect our canners very severely. I am as anxious as any other honorable senator that fair consideration should be given to the producers of iron and steel. All of us are aware of the importance of that industry. In respect of tin plates, however, I submit that it is wrong for us to replace the present free British preferential tariff by this tremendous duty of 76s. a ton. with a duty of 115s. in. the intermediate and general tariffs. Our present imports are considerable. I oppose this great increase of duty which will come into operation as from the 1st January next. </para>

                        <para>. - I dealt with this matter in my second-reading speech, and I should now like an explanation from the Minister as to why a variation has been made in this item, in view of the report by the Tariff Board that there is no evidence that local manufacturers, have been taking undue advantage of the existing duties. The board ako stated that there was a good deal of internal competition between the local producers, in respect of not only cast iron pipes, but also other materials, such as  fibrolite  In the light of that commendation from the Tariff Board, I do not see any reason why the protection previously given to the industry should be reduced. The report of##"## the board shows that the wages of moulders and dressers in Australia are ##£##5 ls. lid. and ##£##4 3s., respectively, for a 44-hour week. In the United Kingdom, where the working week is 48 hours, the wages of moulders, expressed in sterling, are ##£##3 7s. Id. a week, and of dressers, ##£##2 16s. 6d. a week. I do not know whether the moulders were associated with the recent trouble with the Australian ironfounders, but, as the report says that the industry has not taken advantage of the higher duties, I do not understand why it has been exposed to danger. Some firms have reduced the wages of their employees, and, in the circumstances, we on this side are not so enthusiastic about granting them protection as we would be if they treated their employees fairly. I should like an explanation of the reduction of the duty when no request for it was made. It may be that some competitors in the industrial  field  engaged in subterranean tactics to bring about a reduction. </para>

                            <para>- The usual practice ##»##is for the Government to refer certain matters to the Tariff Board for investigation and report, but the act under which the board was constituted empowers that body to undertake investigations on its own initiative. That power strengthens rho effectiveness of the tribunal; should it consider that an industry is exploiting the public, it can set an inquiry in motion and reveal the facts. In February, 1937., the board investigated this industry, and later it gave reasons for recommending a reduction of the duty. In its report it pointed out that the situation could easily be met by local manufacturers reducing prices. The most important section of Australian industry which receives protection under this item is that which manufactures cast-iron pipes other than soil and rain-water pipes. There are two methods of production, namely, the sandcast method and the spun method. The value of Australian production is considerably in excess of ##£##1,000,000 yearly, of which about 40 per cent, is represented by pipes produced by the spun method. Under the existing duties, overseas competition has been practically eliminated, and importations are insignificant when compared with Australian requirements. The selling price in Sydney of the locally-made spun pipes, which are manufactured at Port Kembla, is lower than the c.i.f and e. price of imported spun pipes, but the margin in favour of the local manufacturer is not sufficient to cover the cost of freight to other States. The local manufacturer could not, therefore, compete with imported spun pipes in all States on a duty-free basis. Again., the locally-produced -spun pipes could not compete on a duty-free basis with imported sand-cast pipes. Although the existing duties are rather too high, there is no evidence that the local manufacturers have taken undue advantage of the position. There exists a good deal of  internal competition, not only between manufacturers of cast-iron pipes, but also between these manufacturers and the makers of fibrolite, steel, concrete and wood pipes. _ This competition has the effect of keeping prices at reasonable levels. In addition to providing employment in the foundries, the manufacture of cast-iron pipes absorbs a large tonnage of pig-iron annually, and thus indirectly provides further employment in Australia. </para>

                    <para>Soil and rain-water pipes of cast-iron are manufactured in all mainland States.  Al though at least thirteen manufacturers are engaged in this industry, only two gave evidence before the Tariff Board. Importations have been small, and even before the depreciation of Australian currency local manufacturers -had practical .y the whole of the market in Australia. The Tariff Board expressed the opinion that prices could well be reduced by local manufacturers of cast-iron soil and rain-water pipes. </para>
                    <para>The duties provided for soil and rainwater pipes are on ait ad valorem basis, while other cast-iron pipes are subjected to specific rates of duty. The Tariff Board stated that two separate branches of the iron and steel industry are involved. Soil and rain-water pipes are required in a variety of sizes, and the demand therefor is only about one-tenth of that for other cast iron pipes. That results in higher overhead and selling costs, and justifies a different basis of duty. Soil and rainwater pipes are sold on a unit basis - usually a length of six feet - while other cast iron pipes are sold on a. weight basis. On a tonnage basis, the price of locally made soil and rainwater pipes of the size in greatest demand is ##£##26 a ton, whilst other types of cast iron pipes sell at from ##£##9 to ##£##14 a ton. </para>
                    <para>As regards cast iron pipes produced by the spun method, tariff protection is needed only to offset the cost incurred in transferring the goods interstate. The proposed duties are sufficient for that purpose. </para>
                    <para>In respect of soil and rainwater pipes, the board is of the opinion that the prices charged for the local product are capable of reduction. Local manufacturers are in a position to offset any reduction of the landed cost of imported pipes by a reduction of their own selling prices. As Australian manufacturers have practically controlled the market for some years there is little likelihood that moderate reductions of duty will affect their sales to any extent, particularly if they follow the lead given by the Tariff Board and reduce the price of their product. </para>

                    <para>The wording of the proposed item has been amended in order to make it ##"##clear that malleable iron castings, when subsequently subjected to a process of machining, are covered by the item. This, however, does not involve any change of practice as such castings were previously classified under tariff item 209. This drafting amendment is proposed solely with a view to avoiding any misinterpretation of the item. </para>
                    <para>During the last few years the demand for malleable iron castings has increased considerably, owing to new uses having been found for this kind of material. The Tariff Board estimated the value of the Australian production at about ##£##150,000 per annum. Several Australian manufacturers are in production. Importations for a number of years have been small, and represent less than 5 per cent, of the local output. The production of malleable iron castings is sheltered to a large extent, as much of the business is to order. In this class of trade, that is, trade outside stock lines, the local manufacturer has a decided advantage over overseas firms. Australian manufacturers are maintaining a high standard of quality in respect of the loca.lly-m.ade castings. </para>
                    <para>This industry was established under rates of duty lower than those now existing. The Tariff Board had little information regarding the landed costs of imported lines competitive with Australian production. Taking into account the duties recommended for related industries, and the fact that high rates of  profit were being earned by Australian manufacturers of malleable castings, reduced duties were recommended. </para>
                    <para>Evidence given before the board suggested that a large percentage of importations of malleable castings, particularly those from the United States of America comprised special and highly machined automobile replacement parts. During the inquiry requests were made that a number of these parts, which are not commercially produced in Australia, should be excluded from tariff item 209, and made dutiable at the lower rates provided for motor vehicle chassis under tariff item 359d. </para>
                    <para>It was contended that, with respect to these parts, each make or type of chassis required a different design, and, as the parts were for replacement of worn parts only, the demand was so small that local manufacture was an uneconomic proposition. Notwithstanding the comparatively high general tariff these parts have been imported. It is, therefore, obvious that the duty under item 209 has added to the cost of these parts without resulting in any material proportion of the demand being supplied locally. The board, therefore, recommended that the following automobile replacement parts of malleable cast iron be excluded from tariff item 209, and be classified at the chassis rates provided under item 359(d)(4) : differential eases, differential carriers, gearbox covers, clutch and flywheel housings, propeller tube housings. </para>
                    <para>The board##'##s recommendation in this respect was put into operation by ministerial parts order as on and from the 10th June, 1937. These parts, when imported separately, are now dutiable under tariff item 359(d)(4). </para>
                    <para>This industry is sheltered to a certain extent. In the past it has supplied the bulk of Australian requirements with the exception, principally, of machined castings of special designs, the demand for which is too small to permit of economic local production. High rates of profit have been made by Australian manufacturers in the past, and it is evident that a moderate reduction of the duties as now proposed will not be harmful to the industry. </para>

                        <para>. - By this proposal the rates of duty from all countries have been reduced by 5 per cent. The estimated annual, Australian requirement of axe handles is 70,000 dozen, with a wholesale value of ##£##45,000, of which the local manufacturers supply about 30,000 dozen, valued at approximately ##£##12,000. Most of the Australian manufacturers of tool handles use local timbers, and they have secured most of the available trade in tool handles for which Australian timbers are suitable. There is, however, a large demand for hickory handles, particularly in axe handles. The Tariff Boardhas pointed out that those Australian manufacturers who produce handles from imported hickory are disadvantageously placed in comparison with Canadian manufacturers. Both Canadian and Australian manufacturers are dependent upon the United States of America for their supplies of hickory ; but, in addition to higher freight charges, the Australian manufacturer has to pay the present duty of 5 per cent. ad valorem on the hickory used by him. The removal of this duty will not seriously interfere with the production of handles from local timbers, but it will afford local manufacturers a better opportunity to compete with imported hickory handles. </para>

                        <para>. - By the proposal the present British preferential rate is reduced by 12##½## per cent. and the general tariff by16##¼## per cent. The rates recommended by the Tariff Board provide for a marginal preference of 20 per cent., which is 2##½## per cent. above the formula marginonthe proposed British preferential tariff rate. As the United Kingdom holds the bulk of the trade after importations under by-law have been deducted, there does not appear to be any necessity to adopt the board##'##s , margin ; consequently the formula margin of17##½## per cent. has been applied in the proposal. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In addition to the reductions of the rates, the following alterations in the wording of the item are proposed, namely: - (a) the words ##"##Sashes and frames for windows ##"## to be amended to read ##"## Wood sashes and wood frames for windows ##"##, and <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> the words ##"## principally of wood ##"## to be added after the word ##"##rakes##"## and also after the words ##"##grain shovels##"##. At present item 303(a) covers sashes and frames for windows irrespective of the material from which they are made. The Tariff Board has suggested that metal sashes and metal frames would be more appropriately placed under Division VI., which covers ##"## Metals, etc.##"##. This suggestion has been adopted and a new item, namely, item 208 (i) covering ##"## Metal sashes and metal frames, for windows ##"##, has been inserted in the schedule. All rakes and grain shovels are at present covered by tariff item 303(a), but the board has recommended that, as the item refers principally to articles made from wood, the rakes and grain shovels mentioned in the item should be limited to those made principally from wood. This recommendation has also been adopted in the proposal, and, therefore, rakes and grain shovels manufactured from metal will be excluded from the item, and will now come under tariff items 219(b), Hand tools wholly or principally of metal, and 219(d), Shovels n.e.i., respectively. The balance of the item covers a variety of goods, and it is not possible to arrive at any exact conclusions as to the variety and quantity produced in Australia. The bulk of the raw materials used in the manufacture of these classes of goods are of local origin. The general wood ware and furniture trade is closely allied to the manufacture of the goods covered by this item, and the rates recommended by the board are practically in line with those previously recommended and adopted for furniture under tariff item 305(a). The protection afforded is, I believe, adequate, but this item really represents a rearrangement of the articles which it covers. </para>

                <para class="block">I should like to make a further reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson##'##s</inline> question this afternoon regarding the importation of sheep from New Zealand. I find that prior to the despatch of my letter to the Acting Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> some weeks ago action had been taken by the Minister, who had noticed that sheep were likely to come into Australia. The honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline> had brought the subject under notice in the House of Representatives, and on the 3rd May, the Acting Minister for Health gave an assurance that every possible step would be taken to protect the flocks of Australia from the intrusion of the dreaded disease of eczema. It appears that the disease in New Zealand is, to some extent, localized. It is considered to be largely the result of the high fertilization of New Zealand soil. It is a blood disease, and, I understand, is contagious. Assurances have been received from New Zealand that no infected sheep will be exported. In addition, the sheep are examined on arrival in Australia by Commonwealth officers. I have taken special steps this afternoon to urge that the 150 sheep to be landed within the next day or two shall be subjected to rigid inspection. That will be done whether the sheep are certified by the New Zealand Government as free from disease or not. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> will look at <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the 3rd May, he will find a complete statement by the Acting Minister for Health regarding the steps that had been taken up to that date. The Acting Minister is conferring with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston</inline> this afternoon on the matter. The Government is fully alive to the danger, and is doing everything possible to meet it. </para>

                    J. McLACHLAN.The flock masters have made their contracts, which cannot very well be departed from. The New Zealand Government has given an assurance that no sheep will be allowed to be exported from New Zealand except from those districts that are free from disease. Exported sheep will be given a clean bill of health before they leave New Zealand and will be again examined when they arrive in Australia.

                    J. McLACHLAN.Quarantine, I understand, is of no use. If the sheep have been free from infection for a certain time the disease will not develop. If six sheep are grown to the acre, where nature only intended that there should be one or two, -the result is disease. The same thing happens to human beings in similar circumstances. That conclusion was reached as the result of an investigation in South Africa, where there was a similar outbreak, and it coincides with views expressed to me by

                    <para>. - As the Senate is about to adjourn for at least a week, and I shall have no opportunity to speak in the meantime, I wish to devote a few minutes now to asking the Leader of the Government what it is intended to do about the serious state of affairs in the Northern Territory. That territory has been a white elephant for many years. Recently the services of two gentlemen from Queensland were made available to the Commonwealth Government for the purpose of submitting once again a report. Very many reports have been called for over a period of years, and although they have cost a lot of money, nothing has been done to give effect to the recommendations in them. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Once again the Government has been supplied with an excellent report regarding the development of the </para>
                <para class="block">Northern Territory, and the danger again arises that recommendations contained in it will not be given effect. It has been furnished by two gentlemen, one a pastoralist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fletcher,</inline> and the other, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Payne,</inline> who has been a very faithful and efficient officer in the lauds administration of the Queensland Government. Apparently no action whatever is to be taken on this report until certain things have happened. The ex-Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson),</inline> also had a report before him on this matter, but delayed acting upon it until he had made a trek to the territory. The new Minister for the Interior, for whom I have the greatest respect, apparently intends to follow the example of his predecessor. He has said in effect that he can take no action on the Payne-Fletcher report until he has visited the Northern Territory and seen for himself the conditions there. I presume that this report has been made available to honorable senators. It is a somewhat voluminous document, but I have read every word of it, because as a senator for Queensland, and as an ##"##Australian, I am deeply interested in the development of that part of the Commonwealth. I refer to the subject now solely in order to impress upon the Government, and particularly upon the Minister for the Interior, the absolute necessity for acting on this report. Ho should not suspend action merely because he intends to make a trip to the territory. Such a trip will occupy .some weeks, and I suggest that in the meantime the department should make inquiries as to the feasibility of the different propositions made in the report so that when the Minister returns he will have available all the necessary data to enable him to act promptly. If this be not done I predict that what happened in similar instances before will be repeated and the report will be pigeonholed. For quite a long time the Queensland Government has recommended the construction of a railway from Dajarra in the direction of Camooweal, and this report supports that proposal on the ground that such a railway will not only aid in the development of the territory, but will also be invaluable for defence in time of national emergency. Departmental officials could be engaged in the absence of the Minister in collecting nil t lie information possible regarding that proposal. They should he able to say at a moment##'##s notice when and where such construction should ##'##be commenced. That is only one item contained in the report, and it is not ##'##by any means the most important. I should imagine it would bc- impossible to get a more comprehensive report dealing with the development of the territory. I repent my very fervent hope that this document will not ho pigeon-holed, but that the Government will got on with the job immediately. I make this suggestion, first, because I arn Fully acquainted with the history and difficulties of the territory; and secondly, because I know that certain: interests arc now willing to embark upon activities on the  ##]##inc3  recommended in the PayneFletcher report, and I suggest that those interests will not wait if the Government dilly-dallies any longer. </para>

                    <para>.- To-day I received from the Minister representing the Treasurer an answer to a question which I asked on notice yesterday. I a in not blaming the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. Mclachlan)</inline> in this respect, but I point out that the terms in which the reply was couched were not so courteous as a senator has a right to expect when he asks for information. The reply given to mo is on a par with the recent utterances made by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> regarding this chamber. If that is the way he intends to treat honorable senators he will n*o t receive any courtesy from mc. f had read in n Japanese journal that the Commonwealth Bank had granted certain credits to a company in Japan for the buying of wool on  00-day  terms, and I asked if that was a fact. The answer supplied to me was, ##"## The Government Isas no knowledge of such transaction.##"## At least an effort could have been made to find out if the statement to which I referred was true. I also asked whether rho Government could arrange with the Commonwealth Bank similar credits to enable Australian and British buyers to buy on the same extended terms. The answer seems to show a callous disregard for the welfare of the wool-growers. I was told, ##"##It is not the policy of the Government to take any part in the management of the Commonwealth Bank Board ##"##. I made my suggestion because  1  believe that if such credits were arranged our growers would get higher prices for their wool. The answer to my question is such  as  should not bo given to any honorable senator who is legitimately seeking information on a matter of public concern; I resent both the tone and the manner in which my inquiry was baulked. </para>

Thu9  the collection and collation of the necessary data as suggested by the honorable senator has already been commenced.
