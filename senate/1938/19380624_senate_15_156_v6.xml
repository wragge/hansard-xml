                        <para>The Government has ascertained that, if the prohibition of exports of iron one is rigidly enforced as from the 1st July, shipping companies and consumers, who may not, in the short time available, be able to make any alternative arrangements, may suffer hardship. Some boats arc already on the water to lift ore, and certain of these boats are expected to carry other commodities from Australia. In these circumstances it has been decided to permit the export, under licence, of quantities of ore which were arranged for prior to the Prime Minister##'##s announcement on the 19th May, and which will not have been shipped before the 1st July, provided that the shipments are made on or before the 31st December. The current contracts affected by this decision arc between Messrs. Brown and Dureaa of Melbourne and Japanese interests for 80,094 tons, and between the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limitedand United States of America interests for the shipment of from 55,000 to 60,000 tons. The whole of the ore will be taken from Whyalla, South Australia. </para>

                    <para>That, after the definition of ##"## employed contributors ##"##, the following definition be inserted :  - ##"## employer ##"## means any person whose taxable income within the meaning of section six of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1937 exceeds Two hundred and eight pounds for the year next preceding a contribution year. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>In my second-reading speech, I drew attention to the fact that I intended to submit this amendment, the main object of which is to give relief from contributions under this measure to about 260,000 primary producers, who have no taxable income at all, and also to othei##'##3 engaged, in the agricultural, pastoral and dairying industries, whose taxable income does not exceed ##£##4 a week. Official statistics supplied to me show that 110,450 farmers, who are classified as employers, are engaged in wheat-fanning, fruit, sugar and tobacco-growing, market gardening and other farming pursuits, including grazing, and dairy-farming. These employ outside labour regularly. There are a further 162,170 farmers who are classified as working on their own account, which means that they carry on their farms almost entirely with their own labour, and that of their wives and families, a family often including two or three sons. I find it hard to believe that many, even these 162,170 primary producers who are working their properties on their own account, do not employ some labour at seasonal periods. In addition, none of the 272,620 producers, many of whom are to be called upon to contribute ls. 6d. a week for each employee for the first five years, and after that 2s. a week, is to receive any insurance benefit under the scheme. There is also a large number of small employers throughout Australia who have very small incomes. I refer to such persons as small  country  and suburban shopkeepers, dressmakers who may employ one or two girls, and owners of small businesses who, owing to depressed conditions in the agricultural industries, often have very small or no taxable incomes. If they have not an income of ##£##4 a week, they should not be asked to pay the employer contribution, particularly when it is remembered that those who will receive the benefits of this bill as wage-earners earn up to ##£##7 a week. The figure which I have placed in my amendment, ##£##208 a year, is about the basic wage in most of the States, and that is a fair limit for the exemption of small employers. </para>
                <para>I think that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> said yesterday that this measure, in its present form, was undoubtedly unjust to small farmers and small employers. If that is so, my amendment would provide the only real relief that could be given to this section, which comprises 372,620 employer farmers and graziers, and others working on their own account. These are the very backbone of Australia, for this country depends chiefly on the export industries. What supports the big cities more than the small rural homesteads scattered throughout the length and. breadth of Australia, in which the farmers eke out a frugal existence by working long hours? Their employees work long hours, too. This exemption should be given to the whole of this worthy section, which is so largely responsible for the success of our economic structure, and on which, more than any other, the burden of meeting our overseas responsibilities rests. This section, comprising over a quarter of a million people, includes all the farmers and graziers and other land-holders who are engaged in the unsheltered export industries, and cannot pass on any of the costs which they will be compelled to bear in regard to the employer contributions under this measure. A great deal of those costs will, however, be passed on to their already overburdened shoulders by the people in the secondary and other sheltered industries, who cater for the Australian market under our protective tariff, and can pass the burden on to the consumers, generally, and to the workers and the producers, particularly. </para>
                <para>I have before me a return prepared by the Bureau of Census and Statistics showing the number of farmers and pastoralists assessed for Federal income tax purposes during 1934-35 on incomes earned in the financial year 1932-33. In that period the number of farmers who paid Federal income tax was 9,404, many of whom are receiving under ##£##208 per year, and the number of pastoralists was 3,573 or a total of 12,977 taxpayers. It will be seen that of the 272,000 engaged in the farming, grazing and agricultural industries only 12,977 pay any Federal . income tax at all. A great majority of them - conditions are better now than they were in 1933 - have no taxable income at all. Seeing that the primary producers are the main bulwark of the Commonwealth those receiving under ##£##4 a week should be relieved of the responsibility to contribute to this scheme as employers. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator is opposed to my amendment he is at liberty (to move that those who have no taxable income shall be exempt, and should my scheme fail T shall support him. Is it -fair to our primary producers to exempt city workers and others and, at the same time decline to grant a similar exemption to those who are carrying out rural work under most arduous conditions? If the Government does not accept this amendment it will be performing the ##"## cuckoo ##"## act on the Australian farmers. Honorable senators are aware that the cuckoo is a bird that selects the nest of a bird about one-half of its own size, casts out the eggs that may be in the nest, lays its own eggs in the nest and leaves upon the small bird the responsibility to hatch the eggs and feed the young. If the Government does not give this exemption to the small farmers of Australia it is acting as a political cuckoo by placing the responsibilities of others upon the 272,000 farmers, graziers and pastoralists. I ask the Government not to treat the farmers of Australia in the way in which the cuckoo treats other smaller birds by placing the responsibility of the strong upon the weak, that is, by placing a cuckoo##'##s insurance egg in the nest of the struggling farmers. Every farmer in Australia will understand the parable when he has to pay heavily for the insurance of others and receives no benefit for himself or his family from his payments. Many of the producers on whose behalf I am speaking are on the breadline, and the wheat industry alone has a debt of ##£##151,000,000. ##'## I confidently commend the amendment to honorable senators who in the past have always been sympathetic towards the under-dog. T claim that the 270,000 producers whose incomes are  le3S  than ##£##20S a year, and 260,000 of whom have no taxable incomes at all should be granted the exemption sought by this amendment.  </para>

                        <para>- I am pleased that such is the case. It is somewhat unusual for a member of the Country party. This amendment is worthy of the most serious consideration by the Government. The supporters of the Government in this chamber, as in the House of Representatives, have said that the exclusion of certain small. farmers and others is unjust, but they have not yet been exempted from paying the contributions for those whom they employ, or provided with any means by which they can benefit from this scheme. We have been informed that the Government intends to provide for them in some other  way, but no definite pronouncement in this respect, has been made; at least, it has not been made to the Opposition. The Government may have been able to satisfy the members of the United Australia party and of the Country party, but no definite assurance has been given to the Opposition; and I am, therefore, not prepared to accept the statement of the Minister that the primary producers will be relieved under some other scheme of the unjust burden it is proposed to place on them. Possibly the exclusion of small farmers may upset the actuarial basis, but it is unjust to ask persons earning only a small income, many of whom have been struggling along under adverse circumstances, to contribute towards benefits for others, many of whom are financially in a better position than they are. The adoption of a policy of economic nationalism in other countries results in the products of primary producers having to be sold on the markets of the world at unprofitable prices. It is unwise of the Government to inflict this additional burden on people who are quite unable to bear it. In the House of Representatives the Government gave sympathetic consideration to the request of its supporters, but when the test was applied the farmers, as usual, were left to ##"## stew in their own juice ##"##. </para>

                    <para>. - I fully appreciate the attitude which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> always adopts towards a very deserving section of the community, but as I informed the Senate yesterday, if we include other sections we must also increase the rate of contribution in order to have a stable scheme of national insurance. If we fail to keep that fundamental principle in view we shall be getting into serious trouble. I trust that this amendment, which is closely associated with certain economic problems, will be discussed calmly and dispassionately, and that we shall do the right thing in the interests of a very important section of the people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> cited the number of farmers who paid Federal income tax, but I remind the honorable senator that a married man with a dependent wife and two children, earning ##£##365 a year does not pay any Federal income tax, therefore, the number cited by the honorable senator who pay Federal income tax does not carry very much weight. One of the greatest problems which this Parliament has to face is the degree to which it can assist the primary producers who have to carry the burden of shorter hours in other industries and excessive taxation, and who are now being asked to carry the additional burden imposed under this measure. Generally speaking, farmers work 70 hours a week and not 40 or 44, as is the case of workers in sheltered secondary industries. The great problem confronting the man* on the land to-day is how to reduce his costs of production. The wheat-growers have, to sell their product in the markets of the world at world parity and are unable to make a profit while world parity remains low. They are handicapped not only by the added costs resulting from the reductions of working hours in some industries and by excessive tariff duties, but also by having to make contributions in respect of social services the cost of which will be greatly increased as the result of this bill. Their difficulties have been further increased as the result of the adoption of policies of intense nationalism by Germany, Italy and France, once good customer countries for Australian wheat, resulting in the placing of tariffs on imported wheat ranging -up to 7s. 6d. a bushel. The primary producers in this country are in a precarious position largely because of the absence of a home-consumption price for their products. I congratulate my honorable friends opposite from Queensland on their efforts to have placed on the statute-book legislation to fix a home consumption price for wheat. Owing to the failure of the marketing proposals submitted to a referendum of the people, however, the efforts of the National Parliament to provide for a home-consumption price for wheat have been negatived. Every honorable senator appreciates the difficulty of providing Commonwealth assistance for the wheat-growers this year except by the payment of a bounty out of general revenue. My honorable friends opposite do not favour the imposition of a flour tax. This year the total invalid and old-age pensions hill of the Commonwealth will reach the enormous sum of ##£##16,000,000. The total quantity of wheat produced in Australia in a normal year is 160,000,000 bushels. If we were to provide for the wheat-growers an amount similar to that provided for the invalid and old-age pensioners it would be possible to pay a bounty of 2s. in respect of each bushel of wheat produced in Australia ; but if it were announced that, in view of the depressing state of affairs in the wheat industry, the Government proposed to provide a bounty of 2s. a bushel on all wheat produced in Australia involving an expenditure of ##£##16,000,000 what would the taxpayers of this country say? Yet, in my opinion, the wheat growers are entitled to that measure of assistance. I have never been able to understand the attitude of the Labour party that additional costs can be passed on. I venture to say that this new-fangled idea of a 40-hour week will place upon the primary producers greater . burdens than any other innovation we have had in recent years. </para>

                        <para>- In . order to weigh properly the effect of the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> we must consider the economic position of that section of the community which he desires to assist. Though I favour the assistance of primary producers to compensate them for the added cost brought about by the introduction of the 40-hour week in certain industries, and by excessive tariff duties, I am unable to support the amendment moved by the honorable senator because, in my opinion, it will not place the primary producer on a sounder financial basis, and because it is not in keeping with the established policy of this country. The problem of the wheat-grower should be kept entirely separate from the question of national insurance. Let us for a moment analyse the effect of the amendment on this bill. In every scheme of national insurance in operation in other countries of the world it has been found impossible to include employers. If we follow the effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston##'##s</inline> amendment to its logical conclusion, what will be the position of the primary producer during the year in which he makes a profit of ##£##1,000? What would be the position of some of our great manufacturing industries whose operations result in a profit in one year and a loss in another? </para>

                        <para>- Ido not; but in my opinion the best way to assist the small farmer is by the fixing of a home consumption price for his product. That would put all farmers on the same basis, with the result that the efficient farmers would continue to make a profit and inefficient farmers would go out of business. Eollowing the passing of the legislation providing for a wheat bounty prior to last elections, an inspector of the Farmers##'## Assistance Board visited the farm of an efficient, hard-working farmer who worked from daylight till dark. The inspector said that, as the farmer had paid income tax in the preceding year, he was not entitled to assistance from the board. When the inspector visited the next farm he found the farmer in bed. Though the second farmer was inefficient and was unable to make a profit of ##£##208 a year, under the legislation passed by this Parliament he was entitled to the assistance of the wheat bounty at the expense of his efficient neighbour. </para>

                <para>In my opinion, unless this amendment is rejected, the administration of the national insurance fund will be very difficult. The amendment strikes at a fundamental principle of the scheme and should not commend itself to honorable senators generally. As I have already said, if a home-consumption price for wheat were fixed, justice would be done to all wheat farmers, efficient and inefficient alike. If that were done the inefficient farmer who could not make ##£##208 a year would be well advised to join the ranks of the employees. I can see in this amendment an attempt at vote-catching, because if it were carried, a large section of the community would benefit; but in view of its effect on the great masses of the people of this country and the injustice it would inflict on efficient farmers, I ask honorable senators to reject it. </para>

                        <para>- Before embarking on the discussion of the amendment itself, might I suggest that it should appear in a slightly different form. Although it proposes to exempt certain employers, it does not exempt the employees of those employers, and the contributions otherwise payable by employers in respect of those employees would therefore have to be made by the Commonwealth, which would impose an increased burden on the revenue of the Commonwealth. While it is competent for honorable senators to move amendments <inline font-style="italic">qua</inline> amendments, under the provisions of the Constitution some amendments will have to take the form of requests, and I ask the honorable senator to submit his proposal in the form of a request. </para>

                    <para>. - In my opinion the figures relating to the non-earning capacity of farmers, quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> do not provide a basis for useful comparison. I realize, of course, that they were taken from the census return of 1933, and were the only figures available to the honorable senator. I am, however, not concerned with farmers, butchers, bakers, apple-growers, or any other classes of persons <inline font-style="italic">qua</inline> their vocations. The honorable senator##'##s contention is that some employers are not earning as much as those whom they employ, and that consequently they will suffer an injustice under this legislation. The Prime Minister has already made certain statements on that point. The same difficulty has been encountered in the Mother Country, where the burden on small farmers is heavier. I think that in Great Britain the primary producer pays1s. 7d. a week. Only after a considerable lapse of time has a remedy been devised there. I realize, as well as any one else, that small employers sometimes will not get under this legislation what Australians call ##"## a fair go ##"##. I shall presently show that to attempt to provide a remedy in the bill would destroy the basis of the scheme. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice</inline> has intimated that he will not accept any assurance by the Government, but I venture to believe that many other honorable senators will accept an assurance by me that a measure of justice will be given to these people, irrespective of whether they are wheat-growers, other primary producers, or pastoralists. The Government intends, however, to meet the difficulty, apart from this legislation. </para>

                        <para>- It would be much more difficult to do it in the bill. I have no desire to discuss cuckoos,either as to where they lay their eggs or as to where they have them hatched. The most reliable figures available, which were taken out after an exhaustive examination, point to the conclusion that there are a little over 250,000 persons of this class, including primary producers, who will have to be considered. Experts have advised the Government that the only way in which justice can be done, while maintaining the scheme intact,is to allow these persons to come into a contributory scheme by themselves. They can then be covered just as their employees are covered. On behalf of the Government I give the assurance that that will be considered. The scheme will be purely voluntary. Notwithstanding the Doubting Thomas, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice,</inline> from Queensland, I can tell honorable senators that the Government has been so impressed by the facts as outlined, on one side of the question only, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> that it has already set in motion machinery for the preparation of a scheme. The scheme is now at a fairly advanced stage. It will cover two classes - those working on their own account, including small employers, and those on the same economic level as the compulsory contributors. In fixing contributions consideration will be given to employers whose financial circumstances are not much better than those workers who are on the basic wage. I think that is a very proper tiling to do. The problem is not so simple as perhaps I or some other senators may think. On the contrary it is very complex. The Taxation Department has no facts or figures on which a scheme can be based, so we are obtaining from overseas the assistance of a gentleman who is on his way to Australia. He will help to complete the scheme, which in bold outline has been prepared by Commonwealth officers. The suggested amendment strikes at the very root of the contributory system. Give us this scheme, I say, and Ipledge the word of the Government that what I have said shall be done. I appeal to the honorable senator who has moved the suggested amendment not to persist with it. I point out to him that five members of the Government belong to his political party, and are closely associated with and deeply interested in the welfare of men on the land. There are also others in the Government who are deeply interested in the welfare of men on the land. The Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> represents an electorate in which there are large numbers of fruit-growers and small farmers, and in which there are small employers of labour in remote centres of population. Is the Government accused of endeavouring to put a confidence trick over these people? That would be unworthy of any government, and no government that did such a thing could live. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is an expert at that game The first reaction to this proposal in the House of Representatives was an amendment by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> that all employees on the basic wage should be similarly exempted from payment of contributions. Obviously, if the principle is admitted, the demand for exemption will steadily grow until the Government will eventually be left to carry an estimated burden of ##£##30,000,000 a year with a gradually diminishing contribution income. No country in the world with a national contributory insurance scheme has done this sort of thing. Great Britain is endeavouring to overcome the difficulty in the way I have indicated, and Australia is preparing to legislate on similar lines. </para>

                <para>Special machinery would Lave to be created, and the check would have to be made annually. It would be rather invidious to have to check over the incomes of all small employers every year. In an endeavour to avoid these difficulties the Government proposes to deal with the problem by separate legislation. Exempted persons would have to furnish details of the names of employees throughout the year, and the number of weeks each employee was engaged. There would have to be rebates, and some differentiation would have to be made between the different stamps attached to the cards. I realized, when I first considered flic scheme, that there were classes of persons who would have to be considered specially. The Government is prepared to consider thom, and to deal with them generously. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have given an assurance, and I repeat that assurance now. I am as vitally interested in the welfare of persons in rural areas and small towns as is any Labour senator. </para>

                    <para>.- The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> has stated that the officers concerned would be placed in an invidious position if they had to check the incomes of persons referred to in the requested amendment. Will not the cocky farmers also find themselves in a most invidious position if they have to raise the money to pay the tax imposed by the scheme? They will probably have to approach financial institutions and obtain increased overdrafts. There will certainly be increases in overdrafts, and a consequent increase of interest charges against the farmer. It seems to me that the Government has not taken that aspect of the matter into consideration. The Government, and particularly Parliament, should take into consideration the incidence of any taxation it is proposed to levy. Does the Government consider the probable financial position of the taxpayer and his capacity to pay the tax when it is being levied? If so, it is not being  done in this case. The majority of the wheat-growers of Australia are maintaining their operations by means of overdrafts from banking or other financial institutions, or by monetary assistance from various governments. If we levy this additional tax, they will be forced to request their bankers, or their other financial agents, and, possibly, the branches of rural or agricultural banks with which they deal, to grant them extra assistance so that they may be able to meet this annual charge. This committee is well aware of that fact. </para>

                        <para>- I suggest to the honorable senator that he should do his best to recover from his nightmare of last night. He should try a lighter diet. It would make him feel better tomorrow. Farmers, as we all know, have to contend with droughts, bad seasons, insect pests, hail, fire and other adversities too numerous to mention. A farmer has so many obstacles to surmount that he is not able, at the beginning of the financial year, to estimate what his position will be at the end of it. If the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> is not endorsed, undoubtedly heavier burdens will be placed upon our farming community. I should like to see not only small farmers but all small employers as well in receipt of less than ##£##20S per annum, granted exemption from the obligation to contribute, as employers, under this scheme. </para>

                    <para>. - I must have a word to say about the small farmers to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> has so specifically referred. I strongly object to this section of our community being spoken of, as they have been this morning, as poor, weak, crawling individuals who are unable to do anything for themselves. It is all nonsense to speak of them in such a way. The majority of the farmers of Australia are active, reliable men who want not charity but justice. They do not ask for sympathy. They are quite prepared to take care of themselves and, as has been said frequently in this chamber, they are the backbone of the country. They pass through trying ordeals at times, but they are a self-denying and hard-working people. I object to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice,</inline> who said that only the members on his side of the chamber had sympathy with the farmers. </para>

                        <para>- So am I. I was about to say that I hope I shall be in the Senate when a Labour government introduces a measure to achieve that desirable end; but it will be so long before a. Labour government is in office that I shall probably be too old to occupy a seat here. The Government has given us an absolute assurance that consideration will be given, in the near future, to the position of small employers in relation to this measure, and I am prepared to accept its word on that point. I do not believe that the assurance was given merely as a gesture of goodwill. It will undoubtedly be followed by early and appropriate action. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston##'##s</inline> request is agreed to, a complicated administrative machine will have to be evolved to determine which employers are to be included in the scheme and which are to be excluded from it. I prefer to accept the Government##'##s promise to deal with the matter in a more effective way, and I expect that within a very few months a bill to achieve that end will be placed before us. In such circumstances, we should, if we accepted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston##'##s</inline> view at this moment, be called upon then to scrap a great amount of legislative machinery. I can quite appreciate that some small employers may be placed in a position of temporary difficulty; but a line of demarcation must always be placed in a measure of this description. We should remember that we are dealing with the 1938 model of national insurance. It has been devised by gentlemen who have expert knowledge, not only of the British national insurance scheme, but also of similar schemes in other countries. If we accept this model I expect that we shall need to make improvements to it in 1939, 1940 and 1941. But in due course we shall undoubtedly evolve the best national insurance scheme in the world. </para>

                    GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia) ##[##12.10##]##.  -  While I agree heartily with the principle of the requested amendment, I direct attention to the fact that not only small farmers, but also small employers of every description will be affected by this measure. In my opinion it is not possible to accomplish what
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline>
                    desires in the way he has chosen to bring it about. To accept his view will merely perpetuate other injustices. Take the building industry, for example. I was closely connected with it at one period of my life and I know, as other honorable senators  must  also know, that a building contractor may make only a very small taxable income one year, whereas in the preceding year, or in the following year, he may have had or may have a taxable income of as much as ##£##10,000. This is due to the fact that in one year he may complete a big contract while in the following year he may not obtain a contract of any great dimensions. Such contractors should not be granted exemption in respect of the years in which they make large incomes. This problem is of sufficient magnitude to justify consideration in a separate bill. It cannot be adequately considered in dealing with one clause of this measure. Farmers also may make a large income in one year and practically no income in the next year. This statement is, in fact, applicable to employers in all industries.

We have recognized the averaging system in our Income Tax Assessment Act and it may be that some regard will have to be paid to it in dealing with the problem which we are now considering. I have no doubt that the Government has given us an assurance that the subject will be dealt with at an early date because it realizes that it is impossible to deal with it adequately by simply amending this bill. </para>

                        <para>- We feel we should support the amendment, because small employers who come within this category are doing very useful work in the community. In this connexion I refer, not only to small farmers, but also to small shopkeepers and small manufacturers. I deplore the tendency on the part of some honorable senators constantly to pit the interests of the farming community against those of the city, and it is time that such a practice ceased. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> has given a definite promise in respect of what the Government proposes to do at a later date as regards small employers, but we do not know the details of the Government##'##s proposals in that respect. It may be that under the supplementary legislation the farmer may have to pay something additional to that which he is called upon to pay under this scheme, and thus will be placed in an even worse position. If the Government were really sincere in this matter, it could assure, not only honorable senators who merely sympathize with the farmers, but also those who really endeavour to help them, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston-</inline></para>

                        <para>- The whole object of the amendment is to afford small employers relief under this scheme as soon as possible; it is designed to avoid any waste of time in that respect.In my second-reading speech I pointed out the anomaly under this scheme whereby a small employer is obliged to pay a contribution of ##£##3 18s. annually in respect of each of his employees, whilst at the same time many people who do not employ any labour at all, but draw a considerable sum mainly in the form of interest on Government bonds, are exempt from paying such a tax. The owner of a block of flats in a city, for instance, may employ only one person, perhaps a janitor, yet he may draw a net income from such property of as much as ##£##1,000 a year. Under this scheme such a person will be called upon to pay only one contribution of1s. 6d. weekly, whereas a farmer, who may not himself be receiving as much as ##£##4 a week in return for actual labour throughout the year, and not in any shape or form as income from an investment, will be compelled to pay a similar contribution in respect of each of his employees. I shall not go so far as to say that supporters of the Government are hypocrites, but if they were really sincere in their desire to help small farmers and small employers and workers, who are doing really useful toil in the community, they would agree to embrace these persons within the scheme without unfair cost to themselves by  making the <inline font-style="italic">rentier</inline> class pay in that direction. It is a disgrace to this Government, and a sad commentary on our sense of justice, that the Government should inflict such hardship upon small men who are struggling for a livelihood, and, at the same time, allow the <inline font-style="italic">rentier</inline> class to go scot-free. In supporting the amendment, I take the opportunity also to urge that a greater measure of justice under the scheme should be meted out to the relief worker and the man whose income amounts to only ##£##1 a week. A person who draws ##£##1,000 in interest on bonds is exempted, whilst the poor devil whose income is no more than ##£##1 a week is obliged to pay contributions. </para>

But he would be entitled to that pension whether he contributed under this scheme or not. I support the amendment because it represents a sincere attempt to get justice for the small farmer. It has been proposed by an honorable senator who has always shown himself to be not only sympathetic with the farmers, but also active in their interests, and it will give honorable senators as a whole an opportunity to show that they alsoare prepared to translate their sympathy for the farmer into action. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to have more information as to what is actually involved in the amendment. I confess that I am still at a loss in that respect. I thought that the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan) would have given us some idea of the amount which would be lost to the fund were the amendment carried. I recognize, of course, that all the statistics we might desire on the point are not available. Both the Leader of the Senate and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> put the number of farmers affected by the amendment at 250,000. Obviously, some of those would not be employing anybody at all, whilst the incomes of many of them would vary considerably from year to year. Honorable senators who have so far spoken to the amendment have confined their remarks mainly to the position of the small farmer, but this amendment, I point out, embraces every class of small employer. So far as I can see it also embraces any man with a wife and two children although he may be earning an income of ##£##500 a year. </para>

                        <para>- For40 years I lived in a farming community, and made first-hand acquaintance with the circumstances of this section of our people. Some of them were hard up, but most of them made a fairly comfortable living. Certainly their experience was not that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cunningham</inline> pictured this morning. If their position is as bad as the honorable senator has stated, we may expect every small farmer to visit his bank manager each week to ask that his overdraft be increased by1s. 6d. so that he may be in a position to make his contribution to this fund. The argument has been carried to such an extreme as to become ridiculous; it has defeated its purpose. Such appeals leave me unmoved. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston##'##s</inline> amendment would exempt farmers who grow many of their requirements, including vegetables and fruit, and live comfortably on incomes of ##£##500 a year. </para>

                        <para>- I am not sure that that is so. In any case, rather than agree to the amendment, I should prefer that certain areas be exempted. Before I can agree to the risk of the fund losing huge sums of money, I should like to know approximately the amount involved. In a scheme of this kind, the first consideration should be the solvency of the fund. I am not prepared to support any amendment which might endanger its solvency. Probably the actuarial calculations have been made on a conservative basis. That would be wise; the reputation of the actuaries as well as the success of the scheme is involved. As the years pass, it may be found possible to revise the estimates, and to grant a measure of relief byeither reducing the contributions or increasing the benefits. Instead of rushing in now with amendments which, if carried, would reduce the fund, we should wait until the scheme has been given a fair trial. I realize that, after the pathetic appeals that have been made on behalf of small farmers, my remarks may be misunderstood, or even misconstrued. I know something of the problems confronting many farmers, but, whilst I yield to no man in my sympathy for those who are experiencing hard times, as a business man I cannot support any amendment without knowing something of its effect on the fund to be created. </para>

                    <para>. - Iregret that I am unable to inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> of the amount involved in the amendment. In rural districts, conditions would vary according to the seasons, and there would be variations also in the metropolitan areas. A fundamental principle underlying the scheme embodied in this legislationis that each employer shall collect the contributions of himself and his employees. If the employer were exempted, all sorts of difficulties of administration would arise, indeed, it would be almost impossible to administer the scheme. The advisers of the Government are unable to make a reliable estimate of the effect of exempting small employers. The Government##'##s intention is that each employer shall affix to cards a stamp, or stamps, covering the contributions of himself and his employees. The granting of the concession asked for in the amendment would undoubtedly lead to requests for other concessions, which, if granted, would result in only the shadow of a contributory scheme. As I have already said, the burden of collecting contributions will, in the first place, be placed on the employer. If, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston##'##s</inline> amendment be carried, certain persons who employ others will not ##"##come within the definition of ##"## employer ##"##, and consequently the machinery for collecting the contributions may break down completely. That is one of the reasons why the complementary scheme to which I have already referred will be introduced. </para>

                        <para>- Any departure from the contemplated procedure in this respect would lead to wholesale evasions. I ask honorable senators to accept the assurance of the Government that justice will be done to these small employers. At this juncture, it is impossible to estimate the cost of giving effect to the amendment to exclude them. Obviously, the carrying of the amendment would increase the burden on the Treasury. That cannot be contemplated with equanimity, because the actuarial solvency of a scheme must be beyond question. During the luncheon adjournment I shall again consult with the experts on this matter. At this stage I point out that the scheme is complete within itself. If relief is to be given in the direction desired, someother way of giving it will have to be devised. Any serious interference with the Government##'##s proposals might cause the breakdown of the whole scheme. At the inauguration of national insurance, both employer and employee must contribute. If relief is to be given, a separate measure will have to be introduced for that purpose.I am informed by the experts that the carrying of the amendment would necessitate an alteration of the machinery proposed to be set up to collect contributions, because if an empl oyer ceases to be an employer within the meaning of the bill, the obligation on him to collect contributions from his employees would disappear. The economical working of the scheme depends largely on the form of collection set out in the bill. An army of collectors would be required to gather collections from door to door. I regret that I am unable to give even an approximate estimate of the cost of acceding to the amendment. Various guesses have been made but none of them can be said to be reliable. Obviously, the cost to the Government would be considerable. </para>

That provocation has been emphasized by the remarks with which the Leader of the Senate has just concluded his speech. I do not wish to appear in the light of a mentor, and much less a tormentor, but I wish to correct both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and the Leader of the Senate in regard to what they have said concerning what happens in Queensland under the Workmen##'##s Compensation Act. Both of those gentlemen have had greater parliamentary experience than I have had, while the Leader of the Senate is also an experienced and learned lawyer. Surely they should know that there is a big difference between a health insurance act and a workmen##'##s compensation act. There is nothing whatever in this bill relative to the risks of unemployment or accident. That is one of the complaints that we make against it. </para>

                        <para>- We are asking for the exemption of needy employers, and because we happen to be labour men we are told that in Queensland the Workmen##'##s Compensation Act does not exempt employers.. That is perfectly true. Everybody is aware of the fact, and there is no need to ##"## make a song##"## about it. Employers are not exempted under a workmen##'##s compensation act because an employment risk has to be covered by it. Honorable senators are aware that the risk of damage by accident, and of death, in connexion with employment, is ever present. What is the amount which the farmers of Queensland are charged by the allegedly cruel Labour Government of that State? It is 30s. 6d. for each ##£##100 of wages paid. What would happen to the farmer if he were not covered by the Workmen##'##s Compensation Act? If one of his employees were killed or seriously injured as the result of an accident, or contracted sickness directly as the result of his employment, the responsibility would be on the employer. The Workmen##'##s Compensation Act is a benevolent measure, which assumes  the risk of the employer upon payment of a small . premium. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> sought to belittle our action in this connexion, because of the lightness of the impost .on the small employer, namely ##£##3 18s. </para>

                        <para>- I am coming to that. The honorable senator referred to his experience on the land. Another honorable senator on his own side interjected, ##"## How long ago was that ##"## ? I do not propose to inquire into that aspect; but I wish to tell the honorable senator something that occurred only last month and, therefore, is not ancient history. I can take him to a sheep selection,- the lessee of which is working on an overdraft from one of the pastoral investment companies. It is in outback country,  where road transport is extremely difficult and there are none of the ordinary amenities of life to which we are accustomed in the cities. The wife of the lessee is approaching confinement, but is afraid of the ordeal on account of the rough and ready methods of assistance available in the outback. It was suggested that she should be taken to the nearest town in which qualified doctors and nursing facilities are obtainable. Before her  husband  could incur the expense of transport, he had to consult the investment company and obtain its permission to sign a cheque, so that his loved one might have what he regarded as additional security when approaching motherhood, concerning which the <inline font-weight="bold">President (Senator Lynch)</inline> made such an impassioned address last night. Therefore, even an amount of ##£##3 18s. in the case of the man who is working on an overdraft, and has no other financial resources, lias to be considered. We propose to consider it, and to see how much truth there is in the frequently-uttered slander that we who sit on this side of the chamber are never available when the primary producer needs assistance. As a matter of fact, the exact opposite is the truth. Not once has the party which I lead in this chamber failed to take part in a division upon any proposal for the relief of the primary producer, even though it is twitted on such occasions with having supported the Government. Sympathyis of no use; action is wanted. Sympathy has been poured out by the bucketful during the discussion on clause 4. We intend to see how many honorable senators opposite will support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> and the Labour Opposition in this matter. </para>

                <para>I was astounded this, morning when the Leader of the Senate declared that it was his wish that this bill should leave the Senate exactly in the form in which it was introduced. What does that mean ? If it means anything at all, it means that the taxpayers of this country should demand the abolition of the##'## Senate. For what purpose are we here? Is it merely to criticize? If, as .we are sometimes told, we are here merely to obstruct, to register our opposition to Government measures and then allow them to be passed because the Government wishes to have them returned without alteration, we are merely a collection of ##"## yes men ##"##, and as such are being paid extravagantly by the taxpayers of this country; in those circumstances, the Senate is quite unnecessary. The Government has a majority in the House of Representatives; let it go ahead and abolish the Senate, I know that this is a painful subject, but I have no wish to shirk ##]##nv share of responsibility in the matter. </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Senate said this morning that the amendment, if carried, would place insuperable difficulties in the path of the administrators of this scheme. It will be their task to overcome those difficulties; they will he paid to do so. What is the stupid difficulty that is apprehended? We are asked, if an employer does not stamp a document on behalf of both himself and his employee, how are the contributions to be collected? The argument is that there will have to be an army of insurance collectors running around the country to see that the matter is properly policed, and that the insured employee is having his stamp affixed, or is himself affixing it. What nonsense that is! The farmer, who will be exempt if this amendment be carried, will have to affix one stamp in respect of his employee, instead of one for himself and another for his employee, or a stamp of the denomination of ls. 6d. to cover the employee instead of one of the denomination  of 3s. to cover himself and the employee, lt is silly to suggest that a man cannot be a collector of the necessary premium unless he is also a payer of it. </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Senate also said that this scheme must operate as a whole, or break down; that immediately wo interfere with the structure in any way it must crumble and fall. Such a suggestion is positively ridiculous, and in my opinion unworthy of the honorable gentleman who made it. If this were a  truly national health insurance bill, I should agree with him, but there is no reason whatever why the incidence of either the contributions or the benefits should not be altered. If the benefits were made greater &lt;than they are, of necessity the contributions from Consolidated Revenue would have to be greater. If they were made less, the result would be the reduction of the contribution from Consolidated Revenue. As my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cunningham,</inline> said yesterday, taxes are derived from, only one source, namely the industry of the people of this Commonwealth. If this were a truly national bill, the whole of the charge would be accepted by Consolidated Revenue. </para>

I believe that the Government realizes that. Even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> who has always been an advocate of the farmer, has raised this matter only for the sake of discussion, he has done good work. But I cannot get away from the fact that the Minister has promised that full justice shall be done in supplementary legislation, and has given substantial reasons why the matter cannot bc dealt with in this measure, which- embraces such a variety of persons that it would be almost impossible to make an actuarial calculation of the probable cost.

                    <para>. -  My sincerity in supporting the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> was challenged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and, in order to demonstrate, as he said, my insincerity, he referred to the * fact that the Collier Labour Government in Western Australia, of which I was a member, passed a Workers##'## Compensation Amendment Bill through the State Parliament. That is true. It was found that the old act contained anomalies and the Labour government introduced an amending bill for the purpose of remedying them. Another purpose of the bill was to increase compensation payments. Furthermore, for the first time in the history of the State, provision was made in that legislation for compensation to be paid in respect of occupational diseases such as silicosis in miners. I am proud of my connexion with the Ministry which introduced that bill to the State Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> forgot to tell the committee that, whereas the Labour party holds the reins of government in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia, it has only seven of the 30 seats in the Legislative Council. Most members of the Senate are aware that the Legislative Council of Western Australia is elected on one of the most restricted and privileged franchises in any part of the self-governing dominions. The bill referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> became law after a. majority of the Legislative Council had voted for it. Therefore, if there is to be any charge levelled by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> against myself, and any criticism of my sincerity, let him also remember that his political friends in the Legislative Council, with whom he has been associated for a number of years, must also carry a share of the responsibility for that legislation. The Labour government had the privilege to introduce the bill into the Legislative Assembly, but, before it became law, it had to receive the approval af the Legislative Council. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad that the right honorable senator mentioned that, although I had not forgotten it. The provisions of the act certainly apply to the small farmer and cover his employees. But for the purpose, of relieving the small farmer the Labour Government of Western Australia set up an industrial branch of the State Insurance Department. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but as the result of the creation of that department, insurance premiums were reduced considerably, not only by the industrial branch of the State Insurance Department itself, but also, for the first time in the history of the State, by privately owned and controlled insurance companies. The action of the State government, therefore, resulted in great benefit not only to the workers but also to those persons who were paying high premiums for other industrial insurance. It is just as well to tell the whole story. There is something to add. The Labour government went to the aid of the mining companies operating in the State. The Minister in charge of the bill (Senaton A. J. McLachlan) will remember that at one period gold-mining suffered a depression, and for the purpose of assisting those companies that were operating in Western Australia, the Collier Government paid for them the premiums on the insurance policies of their employees. </para>

The Labour Government of Western Australia was a true friend of the small farmers in times both of drought and of depressed prices. . It furnished them with the necessary financial assistance to enable  them  to carry on. So the right honorable senator  is  wrong again. I interjected during his speech that he did not know what he was talking about, meaning that he was not acquainted with the facts of the matter. I remind the right honorable senator, who has been for so long removed from the activities in Western Australia, that he should become more acquainted with what is going on in that State before venturing to speak on behalf of the small farmers. </para>

I remind the honorable senator that for some years the combined governments of Australia have  been  endeavouring to adjust the farmers##'## debts. To that end this Parliament passed legislation under which ##£##12,000,000 was appropriated for distribution to the various States in order that farmers##'## debts might be adjusted. Who got the relief from the amount expended to date on this account? Some of that money has been made available to poor farmers who have been struggling on overdrafts, being carried by the private financial institutions or the government instrumentalities.

                        <para>- That may be so. The point is. however, that if the Government, has to create organizations to deal with too many exemptions there will be not only further expense, but also the danger of the breakdown of the scheme. I rely on the promise that the Government has made to bring down legislation to give relief to the section of the community referred to in the amendment. I should have liked something more concrete than a promise, but the promise compels me to vote against the amendment. It would be better if we knew something more about the proposed new legislation, but it appears to be not worth while to grant a large number of exemptions, the policing of which- will involve considerable expense. </para>

                    <para>. - We must all agree that this bill envisages a huge undertaking which, generally speaking, it is most desirable that we should put in hand; but I must admit that I am disappointed to find so many anomalies in it. These seem to me to be so glaring as almost to justify us in saying that the bill is ##"## half baked ##"##. I was disappointed also that the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> was unable this morning to answer this, that and the other question about the bill or to indicate the probable result of various suggestions that were made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston##'##s</inline> request has much to commend it. We should endeavour to grant as much relief as possible to our small farmers, who are, in very truth, the backbone of the country. We have in Australia 60,000 wheat-growers, 95,000 small graziers and a/bout 5,000 graziers operating in a large, or comparatively large, way. The position of these people is, in many respects, unenviable. Australia has adopted a policy of high protection, which, while advantageous to our secondary industries, is detrimental to our primary industries in that everything that they need to buy is more expensive than it would be under a moderate policy of protection. Of course, no one is suggesting that we should adopt freetrade measures, but, as farmers cannot obtain protection through arbitration courts or other wage-fixing tribunals and have to sell most of their products in the open markets of the world, we should strive to help them as much as possible. The position of our wool-growers is far from satisfactory. The average price for the Australian clip this year will be not more than ls. per lb. gross, which is equivalent to lid. at rail. Possibly the official figures for the yea##]##- ending on the 30th June will show slightly more than ls. per lb., but this will be due to the comparatively good prices obtained in the first ten months of the statistical year. To-day##'##s market price is not more than lid.##'## per lb. gross, which means lOd. per lb. to the growers, an amount which is hardly- payable. Wheat is being sold at country sidings to-day at less than 3s. a bushel. Although our farmers and graziers cannot be said to be creating wealth during drought years, and are securing only low prices for themselves, they are in a very real sense, creating the only real national wealth, of Australia, for., official statistics reveal that 9T per cent, of the value of our exports consist of primary products. The farmers throughout this great continent are working, not 40 or 44 hours a week, as do the people in cities, but more like SO hours a week, and for their labours they receive, in many cases, a miserable pittance much below the basic wage. Moreover, their womenfolk and children have frequently to work for nothing, and are deprived of the amenities of city life. In all the circumstances, I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston##'##s</inline> request. </para>

                <para>It is obvious that the people outback will not benefit to any great extent by the medical services to be provided under this bill, for it cannot be expected that a medical practitioner will travel out into a country district 10, 20 or even 50 miles, often at night, to attend an insured person in respect of ##'##whom he is receiving a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment of only lis. In my opinion, the medical profession is not being given a fair deal, in that the proposed fee is a totally inadequate recompense to the doctors for the years of study that is necessary to qualify them to practice their profession. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall support the request. I have listened to the discussion to-day with much interest. I resent the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay</inline> that some farmers are efficient,, and others inefficient and consequently failures. The honorable senator suggested that it was because of inefficiency that farmers needed bounties and other forms of financial assistance. In my opinion, there are no inefficient farmers. The whole trouble with our agricultural industries is that the land is too dear. Land is never worth more than its productive value. We all know what happens in this country. During good seasons farmers buy land at high prices either to increase their own holdings or to provide farms for their sons. Almost always, .these transactions occur when commodity prices are high. Immediately prices fall to their normal level, those whose farms have been purchased at unduly high prices find that they are unable to make a living. In those circumstances . the farmers do not earn the basic wage. </para>

If my remarks are in conflict with the Standing Orders, I regret it. A few weeks ago, I asked a question of the Leader of the Senate concerning the position of small farmers, and I consider that an evasive reply was furnished to me. I travelled extensively through the back country of New South Wales during the last election campaign, and saw for myself the plightof many struggling farmers. The men engaged in small scale operations were trying to save the lives of their stock by hand-feeding, whereas, other persons engaged in large-scale operations did not seem to be unduly concerned, though many of their sheep were dying in corners of remote paddocks. It was for this reason that I asked the Leader of the Senate whether something could be done to assist the small farmers to save their stock.

                    <para>. - This request will certainly affect small farmers, but its effect will not be confined to them. However, as the discussion has concerned, mainly the farming community, I also shall deal principally with that aspect of the subject. I wish to make clear the real effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston##'##s</inline> request. When I first heard it, I did not realize that it was intended to affect only persons with an income of ##£##208 per annum after all deductions had been made. Under the Income Tax Act there is a statutory exemption of ##£##250 for the taxpayer, and a deduction of ##£##50 for his wife and ##£##50 for each child under the age of sixteen years. The Harvester award was based on the family unit of a husband, his wife and three children. That basis ought to be reviewed, because I understand now that the average family consists of only about 2.7 persons, instead of five. What I have said means that in addition to the statutory exemption of ##£##250, the taxpayer witu three children is granted exemption in respect of his wife and children to a total of about ##£##450, to which is to bc added the ##£##20S exemption now proposed under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston##'##s</inline> amendment. I am not quite clear if that is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> meant. I have been in this chamber for six and a half years, and I know that whenever the interests of the farmers have been under discussion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> has always been a strong advocate of granting assistance to them in some form. In this respect he has been more liberal than I have been, because I believe in going to the source of their troubles, instead of trying to get them out of difficulties by granting concessions. Members of the Labour party have also been ready to assist farmers by way of concessions, but they have never been disposed to vote for proposals to reduce the tariff which I regard as the most effective way to help the man on the land. On the contrary, they have always voted for the highest tariff possible though, as I have said, they have been willing to help with rebates and similar palliatives. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cunningham</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice,</inline> who apparently favour lower tariffs, will go a step further, and while they are in this Parliament- </para>

                        <para>- I think we can. I should add that one or two members on this side of the Senate also approve of the highest tariffs and rather grudgingly give assistance to farmers by way of rebates. I well remember, the long tariff debate which we had in 1933, and I recall that when we were discussing items imposing duties on agricultural implements, galvanized iron, wire netting, which especially concern the farmer, and items in which the general public were interested, such as boots, textiles, medicines,. ##&amp;##c, members of the Labour party and some of our own party always voted for the highest duties. </para>

                        <para>- I think the reference is most material. Some honorable members on this side are being accused of having no consideration at all for the small primary producers, and I say that we have always stood for the farmers in a way that Labour senators have never done, at all events since I have been in this chamber. I give to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> full credit for his sincerity and his desire to help our farmers, but I am afraid that this attempt to remedy their troubles as well as those of other self-employed persons whose incomes are limited by this bill, by including a provision that is quite foreign to it, will ham-string the scheme. There are many ways in which the small farmer may be assisted.  His  troubles will not be eased by the amendment. I intend to vote for the Government on this amendment, and I do so without the slightest hesitation, because I believe that the granting of exemptions is not the best way to do what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> has in mind. Suppose the exemption is fixed at ##£##208 a year. Why - should it not be increased next year to ##£##30S, or in the following year to ##£##408? Whilst I would not commit myself not to grant a few exemptions, as for instance in the- case of Christian Scientists, I am not prepared to remove from the scope of the scheme such a large section as will be affected by the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> I know, does stand for the man on the land; but his position is untenable. He has told us that he would grant exemptions not only to small farmers but also to small employers in secondary industries, the strength of which, as every one knows, has made them, in effect, our primary industries. They have impinged on our primary industries to their very great detriment. </para>

That is the principal ground of his objection. I invite him to tell the cane-cutters and industrialists in Queensland that he opposed the scheme on those grounds, and see how they take it.

                    enlarged upon the principle of exemptions and made some reference to the Worker##'##s Compensation Act in Western Australia, comparing the provisions in that measure with those contained in the bill. He said that there was a difference. That is not so. The Worker##'##s Compensation Act in Western Australia was introduced to protect the employees. That, too, is the underlying principle of this scheme.

Section 4 enacts that every employee in Queensland whose rate of wages, salary or allowance is fixed by the Industrial Commission, and every employer of such worker, shall be liable to pay a contribution to the fund at the prescribed rates. There is no exemption there, because the Government of Queensland realized that it was impossible to frame legislation of this nature on any other basis. </para>

There are about 3,000 manufacturers in Victoria, and as I was elected by the votes of nearly 400,000 electors, the influence of the manufacturers##'## vote was negligible. I object to being accused of representing the manufacturers only. I represent the whole of the people of Victoria. The suggestion that I have no sympathy for the small farmers is entirely unwarranted. I was amused to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes##'##s</inline> little jibe about the manufacturers and the tariff.

                    <para>. -  On the whole, I am pleased with the measure of verbal support given to my amendment by practically every speaker. It is generally agreed  that the small primary producers, numbering over a quarter of a million, most of whom had no taxable income during the year of the last census, should be relieved of the burden which this bill will impose, but the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. Mclachlan)</inline> and many of the members of his party say that they will be assisted at some other time and in another way. It is said that sympathy without relief is like mustard without beef, and I have found from experience that sympathy  without votes is very unsatisfying. If small farmers are to be freed from the employer contribution which the bill imposes, action should be taken now under this measure. I have read of a somewhat indefinite promise of assistance, which, I feel sure, will be honoured by the Government, and I thank the Minister for his endorsement of that promise to-day; but, as far as the details of the proposal have been published, it seems to rae that it will not meet the needs of the small farmers and other small employers to whom the amendment applies. I understand, ##'##from the published details, that persons over 45 years of age will not. be included in the scheme and that the voluntary contributions will be four shillings a week. </para>

                <para>The point was taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> that a taxable income of ##£##208 will mean a net income of that amount after the statutory exemption of ##£##250 and the deductions for wife and children are allowed. If the committee approves of the spirit of my amendment, but objects to the income limit of ##£##4 a week, I invite the Government, with the assistance of the learned senator, to suggest an alteration of the amendment which would qualify for relief from the payment of the employer contribution, those farmers and other small employers whose business ordinarily returns them an income under ##£##208 a year. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasury can bear it easier than can the producers. If the amount involved is large, it is essential that this section of the primary producers should not have this heavy burden thrown upon them. If, however, as I believe is  the  case, the total ##'##sum involved is comparatively small, there oan be no harm in the acceptance of the amendment. In either case it should be accepted. Acceptance of my proposal would have a good effect in regard to the employment of young people. In most of the States, the appeal has been made that employment should be given to young men and women who are now out of work. Small farmers and others, the majority of whom have no taxable incomes, are asked to give employment to an extra, boy or girl in their homes, and the contribution which the small employer is required to make under this scheme would undoubtedly reduce opportunities for employment of this kind. The almost universal practice in regard to all our taxation and social legislation is to protect the weak. </para>

We could deal with such cases by averaging their incomes; but the possibility of such variations of income in a few cases is no reason why relief should be refused to 272,000 primary producers, of whom only 13,000 had taxable incomes in the year of the last census. In 1935-36, of the farmers and pastoralists in the class with which I am particularly dealing, only 18,142 had taxable incomes.

                    <para>. -I regret that the Government cannot accept the requested amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice.</inline> The definition proposed would, in practice be used for short periods of incapacity from  which the insured person may be expected to recover full capacity for his ordinary occupation at a fairly early date. It would not be used ##'##to cover a long period of incapacity for a particular employment during which capacity for other remunerative employment had been restored or had been present throughout. Has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice</inline> seriously considered the implications of the requested amendment? Incapacity to continue employment sometimes arises from the result of an accident in that employment. Any loss of earning power in that respect is covered by workers##'## compensation acts. This scheme does not include the workers##'## compensation risk. The effect of the requested amendment would be that although ii man might turn to another occupation on account of his disability, and possibly earn equally good wages, he would, while so employed, be entitled to sickness or disablement benefit right up to the age of 65. It would be a direct incentive to malingering. A labourer might get an attack of rheumatism, which might render it unwise for bini to continue as a labourer, and he might be employed as a liftman at the basic wage - plus full sickness or disablement benefit. A sempstress might get cramp in the fingers, a telephone operator  might get dull of hearing, or a clerk might fall off his bicycle and injure his right arm. Are those persons not to work again, or, if they! are engaged on other work and receive the ordinary wage, are they to get full sickness and disablement benefit right up to pension age? Some friendly societies have the criterion proposed by the honorable senator in respect of inability to follow usual occupation, but they have an automatic check in the low rate of benefit, often 2s. 6d. a week, paid after prolonged incapacity.  This bill provides 15s. a week disablement benefit, however prolonged the incapacity, to which must be added 3s. 6d. allowance for each dependent child. </para>

                <para>The honorable senator will realize that it would be very unwise to amend the definition in the direction indicated. The administration will##'## be conducted by approved friendly societies, and care will be taken to see that contributors are adequately protected. To impose upon the scheme an undertaking so far reaching in its effects would be quite impracticable. 1 could, if necessary, cite instances which have occurred under the British scheme in order to show the possible effect if the requested amendment were adopted. Having regard to the facts which I have placed before the committee,, it is impossible for the Government to accept the requested amendment. </para>

Under the workmen##'##s compensation acts, the onus is on the employer to prove that the employee is capable of doing other work, other than that on which he was engaged when he became incapacitated, and also that such work is available. If the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice</inline> be rejected will a similar onus be on the commission? It is easy for the Minister to cite a clerk falling off a bicycle and breaking an arm, and saying that he could perform a liftman##'##s work, when every one knows that there are hundreds of men looking for a liftman##'##s job, and that such jobs cannot be found. We are accepting the challenge of honorable senators opposite to improve the bill, and we do not wish to be silenced by the mere statement that the adoption of this requested amendment would increase the cost of administration and weaken the whole structure. The recent division shows that our voices, somewhat lusty, I admit, are crying in the wilderness. If the requested amendment be not pressed, will the Minister give the committee an assurance that when the scheme becomes operative the onus will be upon the employer and the commission to prove that an incapacitated person is capable of doing other work and that such work is available? </para>

I think it will be understood by all honorable senators that matters of this sort will be determined strictly in accordance with the terms of this measure, and to ensure that the rights of insured persons are protected in this respect the bill should be amended as has been suggested. It is interesting to note that in the English workmen##'##s compensation laws, the onus of proof of ability to earn a livelihood is placed on the employer. Dealing with this matter W. Addington Willis, in his work <inline font-style="italic">The Workmen##'##s Compensation Acts</inline> 1925 <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> 1026, writes- </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>The workman##'##s ability to earn must be proved by the employer who alleges it. The extent of the onus of proof depends upon the circumstances in which the workman is loft as the result of the injury. On the one hand, his injury may have left his labour in such a condition as to be nondescript or ##"## odd lot ##"## in the labour market, so that hu had little or no prospect of obtaining employment in the special line of work within his capacity. On the other hand, his range of work may be so wide that his physical injury differentiates him but little from competitors in the field of ordinary labour. </para>
                    <para>Many border-line cases have resulted in decisions which arc difficult to reconcile, and it is conceivable that the legislature had those cases in mind when they have empowered the judge in certain circumstances to treat partial incapacity as total. The power is exercisable when the workman can show that he is unable to obtain employment in the work for which he is supposed to be fitted, and that such inability is wholly or mainly a consequence of his injury. The section, however, does not affect the principles stated in the following paragraph which justify the treatment of partial incapacity as total, although there may be no evidence of having attempted to obtain suitable work. </para>

                        <para>- If an insured person contracts a vocational illness which prevents him from returning to his former job, can the doctor or the society, in order to conserve the##'## funds, tell him that he can get no further disablement benefit because he is fit for work in some other occupation? I remember a case in. point under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. An old friend of mine was practically dying on his feet; it took him a quarter of an hour to get out of a tram and reach my office, a distance of only a few yards. He applied for the pension, but was refused on the ground that he could sit on his verandah and do light work. He asked what light work he could do. The doctor told him that, as he had the use of his hands and brain, and could walk about, he was not totally and permanently incapacitated. If ever anybody deserved a pension that man did. What we are trying to do by this amendment is to safeguard any individual who may suffer disablement from being the victim of circumstances in which his doctor might say, ##"## You can engage in some other occupation.##"## The doctor may know very well that work which the man is fit to do cannot be found. </para>

                    <para>. -  I have to admit that the remarks of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J.</inline> McLachlan) have removed some of my doubts. I was prompted to move my request because of my knowledge and experience of compensation cases. The Minister has indicated that the approved society will have a lot to do with determining the fitness of a sick or injured person, and that fact, to a large extent, overcomes my objections. I realize that there is a difficulty in clearly defining ##"## incapacity for work ##"##. I certainly object to a doctor solely deciding the extent of incapacity. That power has been abused in the past, and the possibility of abuse in the future should be guarded  against. I am glad to know that the provision will be sympathetically administered. It is of no use for a doctor to say to a navvy, ##"##You cannot do pick and shovel work, but you are fit enough for a clerical occupation.##"## Even if he was##'## fit for clerical work, such employment might not be obtainable. The sick or injured person should be protected to the greatest possible extent. A doctor alone should not be allowed to determine the claim of the injured or sick person. In cases that have gone to the courts, it has sometimes been disclosed that doctors have exceeded their responsibilities, and have not carried out their duties in accordance with the law. </para>

The man will first go to the arbitration tribunal of his own society - a society of which he is a member. If he is dissatisfied with the decision of the tribunal, he may appeal to the commission, and after that he has the further right to submit his case to a legal referee. When the case is before the referee, the society and the insured person will each submit medical evidence, and the legal referee will decide between them. It would not be fair to approved societies to open the door too widely. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice</inline> has been very reasonable in his attitude, and he will understand the views expressed in reports from Great Britain about the administration of the national health insurance scheme there. A memorandum I have received deals with certain aspects of great importance, including the potential effect of sickness and disablement on the benefit funds, and lays down when other conditions need to be taken into account.

                    <para>At varying stages in the course of different diseases, or after the occurrence of particular injuries, it will become clear that there is no reasonable prospect of the patient again becoming able to resume his ordinary occupation. This may be apparent in some cases almost from the outset, for example, where a person whose work requires some particular manipulation has sustained an injury which immediately renders him permanently incapable of carrying out that manipulation, or where a personhas become blind. When this condition of permanent incapacity to resume the ordinary occupation has supervened, a different criterion from that of fitness for that occupation must, it has been held, be applied, and the patient should not be certified as ##"## incapable of work ##"## unless in the practitioner##'##s opinion he is physically unable to perform any other suitable kind of remunerative work, whether at once or after a short course of training. </para>

                <para class="block">There are several reasons for moving that amendment. Under the present noncontributory old-age pension scheme, men are entitled to draw a pension at the age of 65, and women at the agc of 60. The national insurance scheme provides that contributors shall pay into the scheme from the age of sixteen to 65 in the case of males, yet they will receive in return, so far as pensions arc concerned, only the same as tire person who pays nothing, and who, at the age of 65, qualifies for the old-age pension. It has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> and others that a person may have been drawing an income of ##£##1000 up to the last few years before reaching the age of 65, and, then, because he goes ##"## broke ##"##, will become entitled to a pension of ##£##1 a week ; while the worker, who never received more than ##£##4 a week, and who had been paying into the insurance scheme from the age of sixteen to 65, will draw only the same amount of pension. We have frequently been told during the debate on this measure to follow the example of the law in Great Britain. Well, I point- out that in England there are two pension schemes, one contributory, and the other non-contributory. Under the former, the insured person may draw his pension at the age of 65, while, under the latter, which is analagous to our present old-age pension system, a person cannot qualify for a pension until he reaches the age of 70. Thus, a distinction is made between the two classes, the contributors enjoying an advantage of five years. That, I suppose, is an incentive to insured persons to keep up their payments. Under our scheme, women are entitled to draw their pension five years earlier, but no distinction has been made between those ##"##who contribute foi##'## a pension and those who do not. I understand that in Great Britain the wife of a contributor is entitled to a pension without having to submit to a means test. She receives her pension simply by virtue of being the wife of a contributor, but under our scheme, although the contributor is entitled to his pension of ##£##1 without a means test, his wife, if she desires to draw the old-age pension, will have to submit to an inquisition by the pensions authorities, and will have to prove that she is without means. </para>
                <para>We cannot overlook the fact that, under the present industrial system, there is a tendency for men to be forced out of employment once they pass the age of 50. Years ago, there existed a close association between employers and employees. When I first went to work as a boy, although I was one of 2,000 at the place where I was engaged, our employer knew every one of us, and many of us by our Christian names. That system has died out. To-day, the worker is only a cypher. When he gets a job he is given a number. He gets a check and he clocks in and clocks out. When business is bad, and the employer must shorten hands, the old men go first, and there will be a grave danger that a man, after paying his contributions regularly for perhaps 30 years will, beforehe can qualify for a pension, be dismissed from his employment. The bill states that a person, in order to qualify for an old age pension, must have been insured for at least five years, must have made a total of 208 contributions, 39 of which have been in respect of each of the three years immediately preceding the date upon which he attained the age of 65. Honorable senators can see how easy it would be, in those circumstances, for a man, after having paid his contributions regularly for years, to lose the benefit of them by becoming unemployed in his declining years. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that, but honorable senators who support the Government have been at great pains to point out that the present old-age pension is a charity. We, of course, deny that; we say that it is a right. Once the contributory scheme is in operation, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> and his colleagues will point the finger of scorn at the man who draws the ordinary old-age pension, because he will not have contributed for it. Honorable senators opposite have had much to say regarding##'## the virtue of thrift. Not long ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made an attack on old-age pensioners, accusing them of thriftlessness. The Tories have always urged the workers to practice thrift, but we are not encouraging thrift by making the pension conditions exactly the same for the contributor and the non-contributor. </para>

                        <para>- I am now discussing a measure which is the child of the present Commonwealth Government. We are trying to improve it. I am offering some constructive criticism, and I believe that, if the age limit for pensions were reduced, it would be an encouragement to insured persons to keep up their contributions. It would also be some safeguard for the old men who run the risk of being thrown on to the industrial scrap-heap before they are able to qualify for pensions under the scheme. It would be interesting to know the proportion of the population who attain the age of 65. </para>

Under the British scheme the husband and wife each receive a pension of 10s. at 65, with no children##'##s allowances, whereas under this scheme, the husband receives 20s. at 65, with children##'##s allowances in addition, and the wife has the right, if eligible, to receive a non-contributory pension at 60! In order to enable honorable senators to refresh their memory in this respect, I shall read paragraph 60 of the report furnished by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Kinnear, on the15th June, 1937, on which this scheme is based - </para>

The ages for the present  non-contributory  pension scheme in Australia are 05 for men and 00 for women, and it is suggested that these ages should be adopted for the new contributory scheme in Australia. As already pointed out, a striking change in the age distribution of ##'##the Australian population is taking place, with the result that the number of persons in the present old-age pension group will probably lie more than doubled during the next 30 to 40 years. A reduction in the pension age for mcn to 00 would involve a very serious increase in the cost of the scheme and, therefore, in the contributions, and in view of the continuous improvement in the health, and consequent working capacity of the people - in improvement which should be accelerated by the introduction of a health insurance scheme - n reduction in the present ages for old-age pensions is not recommended. </para>

                    <para>. -  We of the Opposition hare already emphasized that the purpose of the scheme, so far as pension benefit is concerned, is --purely to enable the Government to relieve the Treasury of future pension payments. We must remember that this is a contributory scheme, under which pensioners will be obliged to contribute during their lifetime to the fund from which they will receive their pensions. This represents a pronounced departure from our present system under which the pensions are paid solely out of Consolidated Revenue. In view of this change we should give consideration to the reduction of the present pension age. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> has pointed out that the mechanization of industry has resulted in the displacement of increased numbers of workers in industry, and he has also shown that the first to be retired from industry are the old employees. In the future, therefore, an increasing number of old persons will be . thrown out of employment. No provision is made under this scheme to meet that difficulty, but, I suggest, we should meet it by reducing the pension .age in respect of both men and women. That is only logical. In reply to the Leader of the Senate, who pointed to the rules and regulations governing the British pension scheme, I ask: What have these to do with us? As to the argument that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown##'##s</inline> proposal will cut across the actuarial basis of the scheme, I point out this basis was arrived at by the actuaries under the instruction from the Government, that it was not prepared to go beyond a certain limit. Again, I must protest that this legislation is being hurried through this Parliament. In view of the many faults found with the scheme by the Opposition in this chamber and in the House of Representatives, it should be postponed for fuller consideration. I repeat that, owing largely to the mechanization of industry, an increasing number of people will be thrown out of work. It is all very well for supporters of the Government to answer that objection by suggesting that the matter of unemployment insurance will be given due consideration at a later date.  We  have no assurance, however, that legislation for that purpose will be brought before this Parliament at all. We should, therefore, make provision in respect of unemployment under this scheme. I heartily support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown##'##s</inline> request. </para>

                    <para>. -  Although the request has everything to recommend it, I do not imagine for one moment that the Government will accept it. Already, the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> has contended that it would upset the actuarial basis of this scheme. Once again, I am impelled to state that the Government has failed to face the real problems of national health and unemployment. Consequently, we must make a choice between giving pensions to our aged people or doles to our youth.  It  would be far better to give a pension at 60 instead of at 65 if, by doing so,  we  could reduce the numbers of our young people who must pass their time in enforced idleness on street corners because they are unable to secure employment. This is a very real problem, and one of the most tragic of the economic difficulties confronting this country to-day. We of the Opposition contend that the problem of unemployment must necessarily be considered in any national scheme of health and pensions insurance. We might find it preferable to provide even a lower old-age pension than that fixed under this scheme, but at an earlier age. I do not, of course, mean that we should do anything to reduce the standard of living of our old people. We should,, however, deal frankly with this problem as best we can within the limits of our financial capacity. It is unreasonable to expect people of advanced age to continue to shoulder the burdens of industry while so many of our youth are unable to secure employment, particularly when extra taxation is being levied in order to provide a dole for the latter. Notwithstanding the cost involved, the time has arrived when . we must consider this problem. After all, costs can often be misleading. We should give our old people a pension at the age of 60 instead of 05 if, by so doing, we can provide more employment for our young people. From that aspect alone, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown##'##s</inline> request should be carefully considered by the Government, and for that reason, principally, I support it. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot understand the contentions of honorable senators opposite that this scheme will relieve the Government of some of its obligations in respect of the present invalid and old-age pensions system, because, as all honorable senators are aware, the pension scheme under this measure will involve the Government in additional cost, over and above its bill for invalid and old-age pensions, at the rate of ##£##1,000,000 annually for the next five years, and, thereafter, its grant will rise at the rate of ##£##500,000 a year until it reaches its maximum of ##£##10,000,000 a year in 1961. From these figures, it would not appear that any saving will be effected by the Government through this scheme as suggested by the Opposition. In fact, the reverse will be the position. </para>

I realize that in these days of the mechanization of industry the difficulties of aged workers are increasing, and I believe that in the near future this Parliament may be forced to do something to meet the situation. Whilst I realize that there is some unemployment in that class, and also among youths, the position is not so bad as the Opposition would have us believe. In New South Wales, at least, there is no problem of unemployed youths, unless young men between the ages of 20 and 25 can be termed youths. Owing to wise and sympathetic administration of the apprenticeship laws of the State by the Stevens Government, the problem has almost been solved. The talk of unemployment among youths is greatly exaggerated. </para>

                        <para>- The attitude of honorable senators opposite to this clause allows of only one possible interpretation, namely, that they wish to destroy the bill. I sympathize with aged workers, but I shall not let my sympathy induce me to accept an amendment which would ruin the bill. I am not prepared to do anything which I think will endanger  thi3  measure. We must be guided largely by t lie calculations of the actuaries, although I think that the time is fast approaching when steps will have to be taken, by either the Commonwealth or the States, along the lines suggested by the amendment. As, however, the amendment would endanger the whole scheme, I shall oppose it. </para>

                    <para>. - In moving his request, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> drew attention to the fact that, as industrialism proceeds with ever increasing intensity, men are being retired from active work at an earlier age than previously. It therefore seems to me that in this request the Opposition is offering to the Government something which it should accept, because its acceptance would improve the bill by widening its scope and contributing to the solution of some of the economic problems associated with a capitalistic state of society. In order to illustrate that point, I shall quote from the 1933 census. In that year only about 47S,000 mon over the age of 50 years, including many self-employed persons who would not come under this legislation, were in employment. The same returns show that in that year approximately 128,000 women above the age of 45 years were employed.  The number of persons who will remain in employment long enough to qualify for pensions under this bill - those who reach within three years of the maximum age - will be only a small proportion of the total of those who will contribute for years to the pension fund. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister suggests that I am proposing to- include in this bill a clause providing for compulsory retirement at certain ages. I am not. The .1933 census revealed that fewer than 500,000 men, including self employed persons, were in occupations at the age of 50, or over. Nothing is further from the truth than the argument, which has been repeated on many occasions during this debate, that if the actuarial basis of the scheme be upset the scheme itself will be destroyed. I say that the actuarial basis of the scheme can be upset and a better bill result. That can be done by drawing a little more on the Consolidated Revenue of the country in order to re-establish the actuarial basis. That would merely mean drawing a little more on the results of industry which are made possible only by the industry of the people. By providing a pension for men at the age of 60, and making it unnecessary for them to##'## travel backwards and forwards to work every day, we could turn to the other end of the scale and do something for the unemployed youth of this country. I do not believe that -the Stevens Government has got rid of the tragedy of youth unemployment in New South Wales, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> claims. That happy position has not been reached in other States which are better governed. Anything-  which we may do to improve the lot of the unemployed youths is worthy of consideration. So much has been said about the actuarial basis of the scheme that I have consulted a dictionary in order to ascertain the meaning of the word ##"## actuary ##"##. I find ##"## actuary ##"## defined as ##"## an officer of an insurancecompany whose duty it is to compile statistics, tables, etc. ##"##. I say, without meaning to be disrespectful, that actuaries earn their living by juggling with figures and compiling statistics. It has been said that ##"##figures cannot lie, but some liars can figure ##"##. That is not a dictionary definition. The dictionary defines ##"## actuarial ##"## as ##"## of, or pertaining to, the profession of an actuary ##"##. In these amendments, the Opposition asks the Government to forget, for the time being, all about actuarial calculations and statistics - those cold-blooded things which, at every stage of the world##'##s history, have been produced whenever a reformer or reform party has asked that social injustices shall be removed. It is time that we instilled into this bill fewer actuarial calculations and more of the milk of human kindness. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> would be a proud man if he could say to every aged person that he meets, ##"##We have taken five years off your term of penal servitude; here you are, old chap, a pension for you at 60 and one for the missus at 55 ##"##. How awful it is that such a possibility must not even be considered, because it might disturb the foundations of this measure! </para>

                <para class="block">I have already stated in my second-reading speech my reasons for submitting this proposal. It appears to me that the matter should be viewed having regard to the benefits to be received by insured persons. The contributions that would be received from persons other than natural born or naturalized British subjects might eventually make a very large sum, and, with the greatest friendliness towards people of foreign races, I do not think that this country can afford, or is called upon, to give the benefits contemplated in this bill to those who do not belong to our own race, and who do not choose to become naturalized citizens. There are bars of various kind in Australia to those who are not British. For instance, they are not entitled to vote at parliamentary or municipal elections, and, I understand that in no State, except Queensland, may a foreigner hold land. One of the strongest arguments in favour of restricting the benefits of this measure to British people is that that procedure has been adopted in connexion with the invalid and old-age pension. It is laid down clearly in the act that ##"## aliens ##"## are not to be entitled to the pension. Therefore, we shall be proceeding on similar lines if we provide in this bill that the benefits are to be for British people, but not for the world at large. Whilst it may not appear logical or fair, in. some respects, that the employee should, in every instance, take precedence over the employer, it would be a great deal more objectionable if an employee from overseas, who, perhaps, had never previously contemplated coming to Australia, should come and get a job in this country, and, without becoming naturalized, immediately be granted the benefits of the scheme. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I drew attention to that fact in my second-reading speech, but that is a relatively minor point. It does not seem reasonable to place foreign employees on a better footing under this bill than Australian-born self employed persons who have, perhaps, been here for several generations. Migrants are likely to come to Australia in large numbers, and probably this legislation will offer them a real inducement to do so. A number of them would be very glad at present to leave Europe and live in a country far removed from it, knowing that they could get employment here, perhaps, with members of their own race, and automatically become qualified to enjoy the privileges to be conferred by this bill, without becoming naturalized. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> pointed out that a number of them might almost have reached pensionable age on their arrival in Australia. They might draw sickness and disablement benefits, and then go back to their own country and become voluntary contributors, eventually drawing the pension for the rest of their lives, without having become naturalized. I shall bear no resentment against my fellow senators if my proposal is rejected, but I point out that, if it is, we shall be departing from the principle observed with regard to the old-age pension. </para>

                        <para>- I shall look into that point. It may be argued that this bill is on the same basis, in this respect, as the British scheme, under which aliens may obtain benefits. But the position of the two countries is not analogous. There is a much freer flow of people to and fro betweenGreat Britain and Europe than between Australia and Europe. A large influx of aliens from continental and other countries to Great Britain seldom occurs except in a time of emergency. It is possible, however, that very large numbers of alien people may, in the future, arrive in Australia. </para>

                <para>Let us look at the arguments on the other side. It may be said that the scheme of the bill is likely to do something to improve international relations. We all desire such improvement, but does this committee imagine that if an Australian were to go to Germany or France to work he would automatically become entitled to benefits under national insurance schemes there similar to those enjoyed by the native people? I cannot believe it! Nor do I believe that aliens coming to Australia expect to become entitled at once to social benefits of one kind and another without qualifying for them, seeing that qualification is so easy. </para>

                    at once thought of another objection to my proposal. He suggested, by interjection, that employers might engage foreigners to the detriment of local people, and thereby escape the responsibility to contribute to the fund. I cannot believe that the employers##'## contributions will, in a general way, be regarded as so heavy as to cause any serious situation of that nature.

                        <para>- I cannot regard that argument as very strong. After all, it is not a question of a man joining, or not joining a trade union. Many foreigners working in Australia are not members of trade unions, and. I think it may be truly said that, in numerous cases, they do not##'## receive award rates of wages. There is no power to make a common rule in Australia in that regard. I suggest, in all friendliness, that that argument i.s not worthy of serious consideration. The third point to be considered is that the aliens would pay some contribution to the fund. I do not think I need waste much time on that point. The main consideration is whether it is wise for us to depart from##'## a principle which has been in operation in this country for many years in relation to invalid and old-age pensions. 1 propose this new clause without any hostility whatever to people of foreign races. 1 believe that this country has not the means to make this provision ; nor do I think it should be expected to provide wide social benefits for people of other than British stock. </para>

                    J. McLACHLAN (South Australia - Postmaster-General) ##[##5:20 1. - I have listened with considerable interest to the remarks of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes,</inline>
                    and I appreciate his motive in moving this amendment. I suggest, however, that he, himself, has shown by casual remarks in the course of his speech that he appreciates that this scheme of insurance is entirely different from our existing invalid and old-age pensions scheme, the one being, a contributory measure, and the other a measure of bounty to which the recipient does, nor contribute in any way. Lf we. were to exclude aliens from this scheme we should be out of step with every other national health and pensions insurance scheme in the world. Aliens are not excluded under the British scheme.

                        <para>- Probably they will be included later on. Seeing that an alien employee will be obliged to pay his contribution and that he also has to pay his taxes and contribute indirectly under our tariff laws, it seems to me that there is good reason for permitting him to participate in this scheme. I can see  a safeguard against any dangers. Before a person may obtain any of these benefits he must join an approved society - a trades union, a friendly society, a provident society, or any one of numerous other approved societies which are likely to be formed under the provision of this munificent legislation. Only by joining an approved society may a person participate in these benefits. Arrangements will be made to keep a very close check upon all proceedings under this measure. The very point to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> has directed attention was considered when the bill was being drafted. If a large influx of aliens occurred and any attempt were made to manoeuvre Australian workers out of their jobs, the Government would take steps at once to deal with the situation. The adoption of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes##'##</inline> proposal would be ill-timed. </para>

                        <para>- But I have no doubt that the drafting was such as to suit the honorable senator##'##s own desires. If employers had to pay the contribution of1s. 6d. a week in respect of all aliens employed by them, and if the alien employees also had to pay a contribution of1s. 6d. a week each, even though they failed to bring themselves within the ambit of the scheme, all danger would be avoided. Aliens who found themselves in that position would be encouraged to take out naturalization papers. I do not think it is too much to ask that aliens should contribute on an equal basis with British workers, par- tic ularly as it would be easy forthem to qualify for the benefits specified. Every alien may become naturalized after he has been in Australia for six months. </para>

If alien employees are exempt from contributing to this fund, and if employers are not obliged, on their part, to make contributions in respect of such employees I am afraid alien employment will be encouraged. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to point out some of the anomalies that may arise if no provision such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> has proposed is made. An alien might arrive in Australia when 50 years of age. If he obtained work at once and contributed under this scheme until he was eligible to receive a pension at 65 years of age, he would have paid into the fund ##£##46 16s. If he lived ten years after reaching 65 years of age he would receive ##£##520 in old-age pension alone, and he would also be entitled to all the other benefits provided under the bill. An alien 58 years of age on his arrival in Australia who immediately obtained work and contributed to the fund until he was 65 years of age would pay in only ##£##20. He also would draw out ##£##520 in old-age pension if he lived for ten years after his retirement. He would even then be only 75 years of age. In addition, he would be entitled, during the whole period, to all the other benefits provided. If such an individual lived for only seven years after his retirement at the age of65, he would receive ##£##364 in old-age pension. I do not think it is fair to expect the Australian community to accept a provision which would have that effect in relation to aliens. The Government makes its contribution, so it is not fair that the taxpayer should foot the bill. Our position is entirely different from that of European countries which have adopted systems of national insurance. There is no likelihood of any influx of aliens to European countries. We cannot imagine Australians, for instance, endeavouring to settle in Italy or Germany, because there is no room for them there; but it is easy to envisage large numbers of aliens coming to Australia, becoming contributors; to this scheme, and  qualifying for pension and all other benefits which the bill gives to employees. The Leader of the Senate mentioned also that payments would be made only to contributors who are members of an approved society. </para>

                    <para>.- I am not satisfied with the explanation of the Leader of the Senate with regard to pensions schemes operating in different European countries. When I visited Europe some time ago I made careful inquiries about the position of aliens in national insurance schemes, and was informed that they were barred. Will the Minister give the source of his information to the contrary? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan##'##s suggested alteration of the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> is more to my liking. Some distinction should be made between a naturalized and a British-born subject. I can understand the desire of Queensland senators not to approve of any such proposal, because when last I was in Queensland I found large communities of aliens in different areas, and I have no doubt that they exert an important influence at elections. </para>

                    (Queensland; ##[##5.39##]##. - Since aliens are allowed to come to Australia, they have a right to participate in all the privileges as well as the responsibilities of citizenship. It would be unfair to exclude the wives and children of aliens from the so-called benefits of this scheme. As has been indicated by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Massy-Greene,</inline>
                    this exclusion would give rise to some difficulty in regard to employment; it might mean some saving in labour costs to employers who were not called upon to pay contributions in respect of their employees. No one##"## denies that, in the past, large numbers of foreigners have settled in Queensland; but it is true to say that recently there has been an increase of the number of British settlers in that State, and a decrease of the number of aliens employed in the sugar industry: I also remind
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline>
                    that many Italians are leaving northern Queensland for Tasmania. We have heard a good deal lately about the need for better relations between Australia and other countries. This seems to me an appropriate time to do something in that direction. I hope that foreigners who settle in this country will not be prevented from participating in the benefits of this scheme.

Apart from that, the whole of the discussion has concentrated on one only of the half-dozen arguments which I used in support of my amendment. It has been objected that the exclusion of unnaturalized aliens would free their employers from the payment of contributions and thus cheapen the cost of employing alien labour as compared with Australian labour. That does not seem to be of sufficient importance to overrule the principle involved. The further amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan would completely rule out that objection.  His  proposal is that the contributions shall be paid in respect of alien employees and shall go into the common fund, but that aliens will not get any benefit from the scheme unless they become naturalized citizens. </para>

It does not appear to me to be a matter of profound importance whether or not this scheme is so registered. In my view, it is far more important that we should have a sound -scheme than one which would involve us in commitments to people who are not, and who will not become, citizens of this country. </para>

                    <para>. - Australian citizen may contribute to national insurance for almost the whole of his working life, lose his employment for more than the free insurance period, and pass out of insurance very shortly before he would qualify for the old-age pension. Yet an alien who is approaching the pension age may come to this country, take employment, such as yard sweeping, from a friend or a relative who is willing to contribute1s. 6d. a week on his behalf to the fund, and for the outlay of a few pounds qualify for pension benefits which may be worth ##£##1,000. I know enough about human nature to know that if the new clause proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> is not inserted, aliens of advanced years will turn their steps to Australia because they will have a good home and a reasonable pension in their old age. That places in an invidious position the Australian who is thrown out of work, and consequently out of insurance, just before he reaches the retiring age. </para>

                    <para>. - I remind honorable senators that there are restrictions on the admission of aliens into this country. First, they must pass health tests, and, secondly, they must possess a certain sum of money; I am not sure that there is not an age limit. Consequently, it will not be easy for aliens to walk into Australia simply because it has an insurance scheme. I assure honorable senators that, after having studied one  of the forms to be filled in by applicants for admission to this country, they will realize that it is not so easy for aliens to leave their country and enter Australia as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> would make out. </para>

                <para>Another aspect, one which should interest <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes,</inline> is that frequently specialists in certain branches of industry are brought to Australia under contract for a specified time. Not long ago some experts from Czechoslovakia were brought to New South Wales to assist in the cut-glass industry. I impress that upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein.</inline> The wages that they are paid would not be at the rate of ##£##365 a year, and, consequently, they come within the ambit of this bill. The Australian Glass Company brings these men out to Australia first to assist in the efficient establishment of the industry, and, secondly, to teach Australians the finer points of the trade. Those men work side by side with Australians. Would honorable senators say to one man, ##"##You shall pay and be eligible for benefits ##"##, and to the other, ##"## You shall be deprived of the advantages of insurance ##"## ? I know of many cases in which men with specialized knowledge have been brought to this country to assist in industry. For instance, quite recently, men have been imported as shift bosses in the mining industry. They are under contract for terms of from three to five years. </para>

What would be the attitude of the United States of America if we decided to do that?

                <para>I support the argument advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> and I can endorse what he has said concerning the difficulties encountered  by alien migrants to Australia. The Minister for the Interior takes every precaution to ensure that only persons of the right type are admitted. Moreover, no matter how hard one might try to bring into this country a person from another country, if his entry will mean that an Australian will lose employment, he cannot come in. Restrictions a3 to health are rigorous, and a foreign migrant must have ##£##200 in his possession, or there must be a guarantee that he will not be a charge on the state##'## for five years. The skilled men from Germany and the United States of America are needed in South Australia to provide industry, and when they come they are often accompanied by families. If a migrant of that description were to die, say, as the result of an accident in industry, would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> be so harsh as to say that his sorrowing dependants should be denied the pensions for widows and orphans? To agree to the honorable senator##'##s proposed new clause would be a retrograde step. If it were agreed to, Australia would be viewed in other parts of the world <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> being narrow-minded and parochial. I remind the Senate that migrants of the class that I have mentioned contribute to the taxes of this country; so do those aliens who have established a profitable enterprise in Australia and employ men under good conditions, paying them the  basic wage <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> better. They will have to contribute to the National Insurance Fund in respect of their employees. If we debar Germans, Americans, or other nationals we shall not be acting in the best interests of Australia.- </para>

In these circumstances it is reasonable to assume that within the next 100 years Australia will go through a process of evolution as has the United States of America, and, consequently, a large influx of Europeans into Australia may be expected within the next few years. In framing social legislation we must insure that it has a sound foundation, and that there shall be no differentiation as is proposed in the new clause moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes.</inline> If that clause be adopted we shall be making undesirable class distinctions which are to be deplored. We should take a long range view, and recognize that we are legislating not for the present but for possibly a century ahead. I urge the committee not to agree to the proposed new clause. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. Our Immigration Restriction Act is sufficiently stringent to prevent other than . migrants of the right type settling in Australia, and should undesirables come to Australia we should impose rigid restrictions under our immigration laws and not under this bill. We have adopted a White Australia policy to keep out undesirable aliens, but when foreigners are once admitted they should receive reasonable treatment. During recent years, the departures of Britishers from Australia have exceeded the arrivals, and generally, Australia##'##s population is not increasing at a satisfactory rate. The Government should improve our industrial and social conditions, and, in that way, attract suitable persons to settle in Australia. Some of the German migrants who have settled in Queensland are of a fine type, but greater efforts should be made to attract members of the Nordic race who have proved most desirable settlers. Under improved social conditions, an increased number of persons would settle in Australia, and the authorities would then have a larger number from which to make a selection. It is true that in Queensland there has been some heart-burning owing to the heavy influx from certain European countries; but if conditions in Australia are improved we shall attract people who will become desirable citizens and be an asset to the country. </para>

                        <para>- I realize that. If I were working beside an unnaturalized person I should feel that he should bc subject to the same conditions as were imposed upon me. Persons allowed to settle in Australia should be on the same basis as other Australian citizens. If a  foreign employer is to be compelled to contribute, why should not foreign employees also contribute? I am opposed to the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan that benefits should be conferred upon foreigners only when they become naturalized, because there are many desirable foreigners in Australia who have found it exceedingly difficult to become naturalized. A friend of mine, who is a member of an organization with which I was closely associated in my revolutionary days 25 years ago, came to Australia when I did ; but he has been refused naturalization. All that he has done since his arrival in Australia, beyond living the life of a reputable citizen, has been to become a member of the Russian Association. Apparently for that heinous crime he cannot become naturalized. Membership of that body is the only charge which the authorities can lay against him, and although he has a wife and family and is in every way a desirable citizen, naturalization has been refused. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan believes that alien employees should contribute to this fund but should not receive anything in return. </para>

                    <para>. - This amendment breathes the same spirit as that just withdrawn by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes.</inline> Subclause 2 of the proposed new clause will saddle an employer with the burden of paying his own contribution but not that of an employee. If the employer himself were not a naturalized British subject, what then would be the position? Apart altogether from the more or less technical considerations, which can be got over, the main consideration is that this is a scheme of insurance which must be paid for by way of taxation. An insurance measure connotes that some one will receive benefits from the premiums paid. I have an idea that when a levy is imposed on a man to provide specific benefits for some other person - and that would be the effect of the honorable senator##'##s amendment - it is hot insurance at all. </para>

                        <para>- I ask honorable senators is not this amendment just a little paltry from an international viewpoint? I readily admit that the proposal had its attractions for me the other night because it looked as though it was an attempt to do something for our own people and them alone, but when aliens are admitted into Australia under the provisions of the Naturalization Act and the Immigration Act, surely it is our duty to place them as far as possible on an equal footing with our own people, giving to all the same rights and privileges. Do we not tax the aliens and make them amenable to our criminal and civil laws? </para>

                        <para>- I do not know how many of that number will come under this scheme because aliens have to wait about five years before they can apply for naturalization. If there is any abuse by these people coming in at the ages which the honorable senator  has  stressed, we can take steps to deal with them.  I  think it would be an unfortunate gesture on the part of this Parliament to say that we are doing this for our own people, and that, while we shall take the contribution from the employer, we shall provide no benefits for the employee or for his family, merely because he comes from another country. As a young man I held very strong views regarding the necessity for the preservation of racial purity, yet I was always hurt when I came across evidence of the restrictions that were placed upon aliens entering this country. There is another angle of the matter which should not escape consideration. This clause would have to be very closely policed, because if an alien employee were working under an award his employer would be1s. 6d. a week better off than he would be if employing an Australian-born or naturalized Australian worker. That would conduce to the employment of aliens as against Australian citizens. </para>

                    <para>.- The first thing which I wish to bring to the notice of honorable senators is the remarkable vein of similarity that runs through the converging arguments, that is, that there is something good in the bill after all, because, although it is hot said in words, the meaning is clearly evident, that the provisions of this bill will confer some boon, some benefit, some advantage, upon our people. Hardly anybody will dispute that, notwithstanding that only yesterday, during the second-reading debate, a. number of honorable senators in this chamber voted against the bill, and led us to believe that there is hardly a speck of virtue in it. I am glad to think that this bill will confer some benefit to contributors. The amendment proposes to shut out all except British subjects from the provisions of the bill ; that means that the  citizens of the United States of America will be excluded. What will be the result? The population of that country, numbering approximately 120,000,000, is equivalent to the combined populations of eight or ten European countries to-day. Et##"## aliens arc shut out, people of our own flesh and blood will be shut out, and this at a time when we arc endeavouring ro encourage closer relationships between r,his country and that great republic of##"## the West. The defeat of the amendment will be a very small price to pay for the friendship of that great nation. Although there may be advantages and disadvantages on one side and the other, wo should look at this matter from the point of view of foreign people; we should, as it were, look at this  country  from the other end of the telescope. If it be found that the residents of foreign countries can come into this country without hindrance so long as they are employers of labour, and so long as we are able to pile burdens on them, but that we impose embargoes and restrictions upon their fellow-nationals who are employees, they will be entitled to regard this as a very curious act on the part of the Australian Parliament. Naturally they will say that Australia is anxious to admit those aliens who will bring money into the country, but has no desire to admit those who have only their labour to sell. That policy would not be likely to engender friendship for Australia. I therefore urge that in view of what we may lose by the proposed embargo, and in order to encourage the. members of the Labour party in their new-found faith in immigration, the amendment should be rejected. </para>

                    <para>. - Those honorable senators who are opposed to the amendment should not lose sight of the fact that the Government will be committed under the scheme to make a substantial contribution towards the benefits which insured persons will receive. Aliens entering this country must have guarantors who will undertake that they will not be a burden on the State for a period of five years, and they must, in addition, possess a specified sum of money. It cannot be claimed, therefore, that they are encouraged to enter the country. Aliens are not allowed to enjoy the rights of citizenship, and they are not allowed to vote or to sit in parliament until they become naturalized. They are not even allowed to own their own homes, because they may not  hold a title to land. Yet, under the national insurance scheme as it is drawn, they are to be given all the benefits to which Australian citizens are entitled, even though such benefits are in part provided out of general revenue. Even a British subject entering this country does not become eligible to draw the old age pension until he has been resident here for 20 years, and if that degree of discrimination is exercised against British subjects, it is not too much, surely,, to discriminate against aliens in the manner proposed. The effect of the amendment would be to encourage aliens to become naturalized British subjects. There is nothing in it that is suggestive of international ill-will. Seeing that the benefits under .the scheme Will be so great, it is not too much to ask that aliens be required to qualify at least by a period of residence before they are allowed to participate. </para>

                    <para>.- Though I have a certain amount of sympathy with the opinions expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan, I feel that there would be practical difficulties in giving effect to what they propose to do. If an employer were approached by a. person who said that he was an unnaturalized alien, what ought the employer to do? The obligation is on the employer, not only to pay his own contribution to the scheme, but also to deduct the contributions of the employee from his wages. The obligation would be on the employer to find whether the employee was or was not what he claimed to be. It is well known that in certain trades, where competition is very keen, aliens are employing aliens, and in those trades it is extraordinarily difficult to police the awards, and to ensure that the prescribed rates of wages are being paid. Those employers come into direct competition with Australians employing Australians. A difference of ls. 6d. a week in the wages paid is sometimes sufficient to take the trade away from the Australian employers and give it to the.- aliens.. After all, our immigration laws are very well policed. Though a few aliens are coming in, the number is not great in comparison with the total population, and I do not think that it is worth while to run any risks with this scheme on their account. The only safety, as I see it, in the practical working out of this scheme, is in the universality of its application. So long as it is generally applied, everyone will be on the same level and all those competing in the country for business will be subject to exactly the same charges. But once we open a loophole of* this kind it will bc very difficult to police. For that reason, apart from anything else, I am not prepared to support the amendment. </para>

                    GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia) ##[##S.3S##]##. - The committee is under a disability in that this amendment, which is a very complicated and important one, has only now been circulated ; consequently the committee has not had time to study it. In my opinion, the amendment goes much further than the mover ever contemplated. For instance, sub-clause (1) reads: -  (1.) Notwithstanding anything contained in this act no person other than a natural-born or naturalized British subject shall bc required to pay contributions or be entitled to receive benefits under this act.
                </para>
                <para class="block">That is to say, a British subject who is an employer will be required to contribute under the scheme in regard to an alien whom he employs, although that alien will himself not contribute. But what about the alien employer? Under the proposed sub-section which I have quoted: he will not pay any contribution in respect of employees, even though they be British subjects. As I read the amendment, the alien who employs British subjects will be relieved of his obligation to contribute in respect of them. I know that the honorable senator who moved the amendment did not intend that, but as the amendment is drawn that scorns to be its clear meaning. I am certainly not going to vote for an amendment that will have that effect. What I have envisaged is by no means unlikely to occur. It is notorious that in the clothing trade, for instance, many aliens in our capital cities are employing British subjects, and in respect of those employees they would, if the amendment be agreed to, be freed from the obligations to pay any contributions under the scheme. I suggest that, if the honorable senator intends to .proceed with <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> amendment, he should have it re-drafted. </para>

I admit that the amendment is open to the interpretation placed upon it by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and I have suggested to the mover that it be re-drafted so as to place it beyond all doubt that the clear intention is that the employer shall not escape the obligation to contribute.

I am not approaching this matter in any spirit of antagonism towards any foreign country, but to anybody who has studied the subject, it is elementary knowledge, as I said in my second-reading speech, that the United </para>

                <para class="block">States of America has been most severe in its application of the quota system against foreigners. This was so much the case two years ago, that if an American citizen married an Australian woman she lost her British nationality and became an American by British law, but could not become an American by American law until she had been admitted to the United States of America - which was difficult under its restrictive quota system - and had resided in that country fortwo years. If the United States of America applies so restrictive a quota system as that, how can it be suggested that a proposal of this nature, which simply proposes that, in order to obtain certain definite benefits, an alien must become a British subject, is a hostile reply to that quota system? I was delighted to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Massy-Greene</inline> speak on this subject, but I cannot agree with his contention that, under the amendment, the employer would be obliged to pay both contributions. I take it that the employer would simply pay his own contribution and mark the card to show that it was in respect of an alien, who would not payany contribution at all, and that the contribution in respect of the latter would presumably be paid by the Government. In view of the Government##'##s desire to attract more migrants to this country, it would hardly worry about having to pay so small an amount in this respect. </para>

If we were to adopt that course we should have to reject this scheme immediately, because it is perfectly obvious that it bristles not only with difficulties, but also with inequities, and what the average man would call injustices. I hope that those honorable senators who feel that the amendment is substantially justified will take the opportunity to put their vote on record, not in any sense of hostility to any one, but out of the feeling that this country and the people who have made itseek under this scheme to provide certain tangible benefits for Australians as a whole, and if any one wishes to share in those benefits, they should first become members of the Australian family. </para>

If we wish to reciprocate with the Mother Country, we must adopt a scheme which does not differ fundamentally from the British scheme. If the amendment were adopted, it would create a fundamental distinction between this scheme and the British scheme, because the Mother Country allows to aliens all the benefits which it gives to its own people. </para>

                        <para>- We do not reciprocate with foreign countries except indirectly. The reciprocity we desire is between our own people, and it is doubtful whether we shall get that reciprocity if this proposal is carried, because it cuts right across one of the fundamental principles of the British scheme. In reply further to the honorable senator, I shall be only too pleased to give him all the information the Government possesses with respect to the current agreements between the friendly societies. Whether the honorable senator##'##s information, with regard to the income limit, is up to date I do not know, but I may be pardoned in the circumstances for mentioning that I am not in the habit of misleading honorable senators. The information which I gave last night was based upon proceedings which took place at a conference between representatives and officials of the Government, the friendly societies and the British Medical Association. I shall deal more fully with this matter, however, when the relevant clause comes up for consideration. In respect of this amendment, I take broadly the same objection which I have taken all along. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan that he amend his original proposal by applying it specifically to employed persons so that the question may go to a vote forthwith. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not desire to debar all persons who are not British subjects from the benefits of this scheme as suggested by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan).</inline> Indeed, I wish to attract as many people here as possible, but I contend that when they arrive in Australia they should become naturalized subjects as soon as possible, For that reason I should be prepared to reduce the residential qualification period under our naturalization laws from five years to one year, in respect of aliens who, we could rest assured, would make desirable Australian citizens. We require a guarantee from an Australian citizen that he will look after a migrant for a period of five years after his arrival, and at the expiration of that period, should he so desire, the migrant may become a naturalized subject; he would then qualify under my proposal to come under this scheme. To those honorable senators who contend that this would be unjust, I reply that the present residential qualification of 20 years in respect of the old-age pension is a far greater injustice, and it applies to British subjects. There are to-day 60,000 unnaturalized persons in Australia, and I feel sure that the benefits offered under this scheme will offer an effective inducement to them to become naturalized at the first opportunity. </para>

Therefore I think that we should hesitate to cut across the religious beliefs of any genuine religious society. I believe that it is possible to meet the request of the Christian Scientists, and I should like to hear the Leader of the Senate on this point. Perhaps he will be able to tell us that it is possible for the Christian Science Church to be registered as an approved society under the scheme, and apply the medical benefits to its members in its own way. If the Minister will give mo this assurance I shall not press my amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - A representative of the Christian Science Church interviewed me in the presence of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Kinnear, and we discussed the matter mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott.</inline> We pointed out to him that great administrative expense would be involved if wc were obliged to set up special machinery with separate contribution cards and special insurance stamps to meet the objections of the Christian Scientists to inclusion in the scheme. I was informed that the only objection which- they had to the proposal was in relation to the contribution, of approximately 2d. a week, for medical benefit. I asked him what was the membership o##'##f the church in the various States, and upon being told, I suggested that there were more than sufficient to form an approved society which could administer this portion of the scheme to its members, so obviating any expenditure on cash benefits for sickness and disablement. Some objection has been taken to the pooling of the surpluses in the various funds, but in this instance there will be definite relief to Christian Scientists because this approved society would be credited with 50 per cent, of the surplus in its own fund, so that actual payments by its members would be infinitesimal. I cannot accept the amendment, but I have indicated the way out of the difficulty. We levy taxes on other groups or sections of the people and use the money for purposes which they may not approve. For instance we levy taxes on Quakers and apply some portion of the proceeds to defence purposes. I may add that the gentleman with whom we discussed this matter left Canberra quite satisfied, I understand, that what we had suggested could be done. </para>

A gardener probably is employed for five and a-half or six days a week at one place and another, and the man employing him on Monday would strongly object to paying the extra amount. In England, a book of rotation is used, and the cost is allocated among the different employers. There is probably more of this sort of employment in England than in Australia. </para>

                <para class="block">I move this request purely on the ground of necessity. The logical course for the framers of this legislation to adopt was to determine what benefits were necessary, and then to fix the amount of contribution at a figure which would enable those benefits to be provided. The bill makes provision for medical benefit, sickness benefit, disablement benefit, additional benefits, old-age pension, widow##'##s pension, orphan##'##s pension, and dependant child##'##s allowance. One very important benefit has been omitted, and I am now seeking its inclusion. Perhaps the actuaries, and those who had to consider the framing of the bill, felt that it was unnecessary to provide a contributor with a funeral benefit. The contributor himself will not need such a benefit, but those who will be responsible for the disposal of his remains should be assisted in respect of this liability. That it is the widow##'##s responsibility in nearly all cases, no one will deny. What resources will she have with which to meet an expenditure ranging from ##£##15 to ##£##30 ? She will have a pension of 12s. 6d. a week, in addition to an allowance of 3s. 6d. a week in respect of each child. If she has two children, she will receive 19s. 6d. a week. What chance will she have of meeting an expenditure of, say, ##£##20 immediately she loses her breadwinner? I do not know what the cost would be for a simple but decent funeral, but I feel that if provision were made for the fund to be drawn upon, the expense would be reduced by one-half. Many thousands of persons in humble walks of life provide funeral benefits for themselves by contributing to a fund administered by a friendly society. Hundreds of thousands take out industrial policies for the sole purpose of covering funeral expenses. They may pay a weekly premium of1s. for 20 or 30 years in order to draw roughly ##£##30 or ##£##40 when the money is needed. I contend that they are getting a very bad deal, because the benefit is out of all proportion to the premium they are asked to pay. In New South Wales, and I presume also in other States, public companies have been formed which accept subscriptions on the undertaking that they will provide either a burial or a certain amount on the death of the subscriber, but there is no guarantee that such companies will remain solvent. A person might contribute for a number of years and be unable to collect when the money was needed. During the last five or six years, many old-age pensionersin New South Wales have been sufficiently thoughtful and thrifty to subscribe to a privately-controlled fund about 6d. a week to cover funeral benefits. Here again, however, there is no guarantee that the payment will be made. Considering that, in a scheme of national insurance, the only certain payment which the dependants of a contributor will need is the funeral benefit, the fund should make provision which will enable them to dispose decently of his remains. I do not suggest that, at the moment, any one can say what amount would be necessary to meet such demands, but I know that it would be large. </para>

                        <para>- Funeral benefit could be provided on a flat rate and, if it were desired to improve upon the arrangements which the insurance payment would permit, the further cost would be a liability on the relative concerned. It would be acceptable if the fund could make available even ##£##5 to the widow or nearest relative, but I think that the amount should be greater. I do not think that the interjection of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> was serious, but I am serious, because I know the difficulties that often confront a family when the breadwinner dies. In New South Wales, and I daresay, in other States, government charity often has to be drawn upon for burials. If a person contributes for many years to national insurance there should be available from the fund when he dies, a sum. which will give him a decent burial. The governing principle of this bill is that a person must have made 104 contributions to the fund before becoming eligible to participate in the major benefits, but I can see that payments for two years would not be a sufficient qualificationfor funeral benefits. Many persons will contribute for 30 or 40 years without return. I think that they should have the knowledge, at least that when they die they will be buried at the expense of the national insurance fund, and not at the expense of. their widows or of charity. In my opinion, if a person has contributed to this fund for, say, ten years, his widow, at his death, should be entitled to a specific sum to meet the cost of his burial. At the start the amount would not need to be great, but, as the position of the fund improved more generous provision could be made. I have no idea of what will be the cost of this benefit, and as I have no intention to do anything that would upset the actuarial basis of this measure, it would be idle to persist with the amendment, but I point out. to the Leader of the Government the necessity for the Government to make, if not in this bill, then in a subsequent bill, just provision to meet this important and urgent question. I do not contend that the fund should bear the whole of the funeral costs; a contribution towards the funeral would help a widow. It would be fair, neither to the Senate, nor to the fund, to persist in the requested amendment and, if the Leader of the Government will undertake to place my representations before the Ministry when the matter of national insurance is next discussed, I shall ask leave to withdraw the request. </para>

                        <para>- No. The term ##"## widow##'##s pension ##"## is understood in every part of the world. It is entirely different from ##"##old-age pension##"## as I shall proceed to show. If the amendment be carried, the paragraph will set out in plain English what is meant. To me the difference between ##"## old-age pension ##"## and ##"## superannuation ##"## is vital. The old age pension as we know it, is a payment from the Consolidated Revenue, to which no direct contribution has been made, upon the fulfilment of certain conditions. The principal conditions, upon compliance with which the old-age pension is paid, are as follows: - (1) Provided that the claimant has reached the age of 65 in the case of men, and 60 in the case of women; (2) provided that the applicant has lived for twenty years in Australia and is naturalized; (3) provided that the claimant is in indigent circumstances, which is determined by the hateful means test. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>Superannuation is different. It implies contributions to a special fund in order to receive a certain payment on reaching a certain age. That payment is made as a right, and no means test is applied. Superannuation, moreover, is not paid, and will not be paid, in the unfortunate manner in which the old-age pensions are paid. It is not a pleasing sight to see the old-age pensioners line up at the post offices to receive their pensions. </para>

The lining-up of the old age pensioners at the post offices every fortnight is a distasteful part of that act. A person who contributes to superannuation should receive it in the same manner as do the public servants. </para>

                        <para>- That may be. At the same time, in asking the Senate to accept this amendment, I feel that I am asking for something reasonable. A person is compelled to contribute in order that he may receive a due payment on retirement. That sort of payment is known throughout Australia as superannuation. All I ask in this amendment is that the words ##"## old-age pension ##"## be left out with a view to the insertion of ##"## superannuation ##"##. I realize that the words ##"## old-age pension ##"## occur many times in this bill, but, if the committee decided that those words were to be struck out, where occurring, and replaced by the word ##"## superannuation ##"##, the revision of the bill would be simple. As one who contributed for many years to a fund in the Public Service, I do feel that one should have the payment that is due properly designated. </para>

                            has entirely misunderstood what I said. Last night, speaking on this very subject, on the second reading of the bill,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline>
                            definitely said that the old-age pension was a charity, and that he wanted to make sure that the pension to be paid under this bill did not come under that category. He proposes, by his amendment, to put that idea in concrete form in the bill, so that everybody will understand that thepayments to be made to the aged under this bill are superannuation, and that the ordinary old age pension is a charity. If he did not mean that, I do not know what he meant.

                <para class="block">In further emphasis of his point, the honorable senator said, in effect, that he was grieved to see the line-up at the post office on pension1 pay-days. As an. old man who fought to have the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act put on the statute-.book, and has lived long enough to see it in operation, I never see the post offices on pension Thursdays without having a feeling of great pride. L have purposely walked in and out of the post offices and mixed with the pensioners, accosting those whom I knew, so that they would see that there was one well-dressed person who, with no suggestion of poverty##'## about him, was proud to move among the pioneers. None of us has any reason to object to the people getting the old-age pension. They have paid for it, not in cash, but, over and over again, in service in the industries of this country. The judges of our Supremo Courts and other public servants, who receive far higher salaries than any of us in this chamber receive, retire on pensions. They have no objection that the ##"## pension ##"## bears the stigma of charity, although they have paid for it only by service. Does a judge feel any stigma of charity when he accepts a pension of, say, ##£##1,000 a year upon retirement, after having enjoyed a good salary for many years? </para>

                        <para>- Surely every honorable senator knows that if an old age pensioner has any objection to going to a post office to collect his pension he may, by signing a simple form, authorize any person he cares to name to collect it for him. This sudden development of a spirit of overwhelming benevolence in relation to pensioners, and the suggestion that they might come to the  conclu-  sion that they arc the recipients of charity, is degrading in the extreme. I hope the amendment will not be carried, especially if it may tend to emphasize further the difference between a pension given by law as a right and a pension given by law to persons who have paid into a fund. The pensioners of Australia have paid over and over again in service for anything they receive. They will have paid ##£##1,000, where many contribu tors to this scheme may pay only ##£##100. I hope the amendment will be given short shrift. </para>

                        <para>- If the word ##"##superannuation##"## is inserted in this clause instead of ##"##pension##"## a great deal of confusion will occur. I ask honorable senators to bear in mind that this bill, when it becomes law, will have to be administered in such a way as to harmonize, as far as possible, with our existing Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. It will be difficult enough, as things are now, to co-relate the two systems, but if the word ##"## pension ##"## in this bill is replaced by the word ##"## superannuation ##"##, greater difficulty still will be encountered. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> has said that the word ##"## pension ##"## conveys to him a certain meaning ; I think I am safe in saying that it does not convey that meaning to many other honorable senators. In any case, I appeal to the honorable gentleman not to persist in his proposal, for if it were accepted it would add to the already numerous complexities of this, scheme. I have been wrestling with this bill for a considerable time, and I feel that if additional difficulties arc created in it, I shall be more or less paralyzed. As the amendment, involves sentiment more than substance, I urge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> to withdraw it. </para>

The Minister gave us to understand in his speech in reply in the second-reading debate that a clause to this effect was already in the bill, but I have been quite unable to find it. The point may be covered by some general clause. The object of my proposed new clause is to apply a check on the cost of drugs and medicines supplied by pharmaceutical chemists. It will be obvious to all honorable senators that the wholesale cost of these drugs and medicines is of first-rate importance. Indeed, it is more important than the small sum which the chemist himself may charge. </para>

                    <para>. - I am prepared to add to my amendment the sub-clause suggested by the .Leader of the Senate. The amendment was originally in that form, but I struck out the provision relating to penalty because I did not think that, in dealing with wholesalers and manufacturers, it should be necessary to provide for a penalty of ##£##100 or a year##'##s imprisonment. I think that we can fairly rely on them to answer questions asked by the commission. ##"##They could be dealt with by mandamus or otherwise. There are other ways of dealing with them than by prescribing a penalty. However, I have no objection to the additional subclause. It seems to me that if we are going to have a careful scrutiny of the agencies acting in regard to national insurance, it will be essential, in the matter of drugs and medicines, to go back to the origin of such drugs and medicines, and consider whether they are being supplied wholesale at a reasonable figure. That means that we must take the tariff into account in arriving at the price at which they are supplied to the retailer. In most cases, the retailer is a relatively small agency. What the retailer has to charge must eventually be governed by the wholesale price of the drugs, medicines and pharmaceutical preparations*. That price is not touched on by the bill. 1 1 covers the doctor, the chemist, and the approved society; everything else seems fairly well provided for except what seems to be one of the most important things of all. How are we to know whether the original cost - the wholesale cost of these goods as distributed - is reasonable or not? I think that that is rather a different question from the one with which we are dealing now. The duty on medicines, particularly those which come from Great Britain, is too high. If the Tariff Board has submitted a report on drugs and medicines, it certainly has not been presented to Parliament. There should be a report by that body on these commodities, so that we might know whether everything connected with the supply of these important requirements is, or is not, as it should be. As these goods have to be bought in large quantities, enormous sums of money are involved. Any extravagance in regard to purchasing, on the##'## one hand, or exorbitant selling charges, on the other hand, will eventually re-act heavily on the taxpayers of this country. </para>

                        <para>- Exchange will affect it to some extent. I have heard enough on this subject to know that, like other portions of the bill, this is a most intricate provision. -Many drugs are similar or substantially similar to other drugs; they are produced in different places and by different people; some are higher than others in price. I think that we can leave the straightening out of these things to the commission, for I am sure that it will deal with such matters carefully, in order to see .that not more than a reasonable profit is made. There are certain points which should be considered. I have mentioned some of them. It is laid down that the pharmaceutical chemist has to charge wholesale prices plus a fair dispensing fee. But the wholesale prices vary. Some chemists have contracts to purchase at certain rates. If a man has bought medicines or drugs at a high figure, is he to be allowed to charge the wholesale price that he has paid, or has he to take an average figure over general wholesale prices of the commodities? How is the calculation to be made? The point that I urge is that, if a retail chemist has to sell goods at prices based on the wholesale cost, the only fair way to ascertain that cost is to have regard to the price at which he actually obtained the goods. This subject is  closely associated with the cost of glass. Medicine bottles are generally made of glass. As honorable senators know, there is in Australia a glass company which has something approaching a monopoly. One aspect of this subject which might be worth considering is the fact that the manufacturers of glass will not sell their products to some of the dispensing chemists. Such chemists must obtain their requirements of glass bottles from the wholesale houses, and it has been suggested that they are charged rates above those that they should be called upon to pay. That is a point worth considering. I do not wish to over-emphasize this matter, but the information which I have been given makes me think that the supply of glass bottles for medicine is a matter which might well be looked into by the commission. I am glad that the Government has accepted the amendment, because it seemed to me that, without it, the commission would have only indirect power to inquire into what is really a vital portion of this bill. I appreciate the action of the Minister in accepting the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to know what will be the general position of public hospitals in relation to this scheme. This clause provides that sickness benefit and disablement benefit shall not be paid to any person who is an inmate of any hospital or other institution which is supported wholly or in part by public funds, charity or voluntary subscription, but shall be paid to his dependants.What will be the position of hospitals, other than government institutions, which depend for financial support largely on the liberality of the general public, and to some extent on government subsidies? If a hospital relies mainly on private contributions, are there no means by which a portion of the money to which the insured person will be entitled can be used in payment for the hospital services received by him? It seems to me that such hospitals are to be rather shut out in the cold. I am told on good authority that, far from this scheme causing a reduction of the number of patients in private hospitals, the number will either be affected very little or even increased. As a member of a hospital committee, I am well aware of the difficulty experienced in raising the necessary funds to finance private hospitals. Some people contend that all. hospitals should be financed entirely by government subsidies, but that is absurd. Hospitals conducted by private committees are liberally supported by the general public, and the care and attention received by patients in these institutions is usually superior to that obtainable in public hospitals. </para>

                    <para>. - The underlying principle of sickness benefit is compensation for the loss of earnings, and next in importance to the curing of the patient is the care of his dependants. Any balance will be handed to the hospitals. It is believed that the hospitals will be in a better position under this scheme than they are at the present time, because that has been the experience under the British scheme. In Great Britain, the work of the out-patients##'## departments has considerably decreased, because, if persons seeking medical attention at the hospitals are insured under the scheme, they are advised to consult the panel doctors. Sickness or disablement benefits are primarily designed to make some compensation to the man and his family for the loss of his earnings due to his incapacity for work. The sickness benefit is regarded essentially as a home benefit, and special provision is therefore necessary when the person entitled to the benefit is in an institution. The principle adopted in this clause is first, that the first claim on the amount which would otherwise be paid to the insured person, is for the support of the insured person##'##s dependants; secondly, that the insured person should be assisted to defray expenses of keeping his home while he is in the institution; only when these two classes ##'## of expenses are dealt with should payment be made to the institution itself. That is the underlying principle of this clause. Experience in Great Britain has disclosed that the outpatient service at hospitals has been relieved considerably, and doubtless, that will be the experience here. This feature of the proposal was closely examined by Cabinet, particularly in view of the experience in connexion with hospital administration in Melbourne. The Government has been assured that hospitals in countries operating under a similar scheme, have had fewer calls upon their services than previously, particularly in respect of out-patients. </para>

                    <para>. The request of the honorable senator is to reduce the number of contributions required from 208 to 104 to establish title to an old-age pension. If this concession could be given, it could be done more readily by omitting the first two and a half lines of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b.</inline> The average of 39 contributions ##'##for three years required by the latter part of the paragraph already requires a total of 107 contributions before title to old-age pensions is secured. It is, therefore, without substance to reduce the preliminary qualifications to fewer than 117 contributions. The purpose of the requirement of 208 contributions is to secure that a person who enters insurance within a few years of the maximum age and becomes entitled to a pension, which under the bill he will secure for contributions representing a mere fraction of the value of the pension, shall, during his comparatively short period of insurance be fairly regularly employed and shall make some reasonable contribution towards the cost of his pension. For other insured persons, who enter insurance early in life, there will be no difficulty in acquiring 208 contributions. It should be remembered that the position of persons who, by reason of their age at the commencement of this act, are unable to pay contributions is dealt with in clause 86. The object of the second amendment is apparently to deal with the case of the worker who ceases insurable employment some years before he reaches pensionable age. In order to secure his title to pension, the amendment proposes that the ##"## average test ##"##, laid down in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> shall be based on three contribution years before that in which hi3 last employment ceased, if those three years precede the three years before that in which he attained pensionable age. Presumably, the effect desired is that title to pension shall be secured even if insurable employment ceases some years before pensionable age is reached. The amendment will not secure that end. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of the clause requires that the claimant shall be insured on reaching pensionable age, and shall have been insured for the five years immediately before attaining that age. The amendment does nothing to keep the claimant in insurance for any period longer than is already covered by clauses 20 and 21 of the bill, and offers no substantial contribution to the problem. In due course, not earlier than five years from the first operation of the scheme, it will probably be necessary to make some provision for persons who have been continually insured for a lengthy period, but find difficulty in retaining insurable employment when they approach the pensionable age. Provisions for this purpose are embodied in the English act, and give concessions to elderly persons who have been insured for ten years. Similar provisions could have been embodied in this bill, but it was thought preferable to await experience of the working of the scheme, in order to see whether the provisions of the English act are suitable to deal with the problem which might arise here, or whether some other form of concession would be more suitable for Australian conditions. </para>

                <para>A more technical difficulty - in connexion with this amendment is that a man who ceases employment, with a satisfactory average of contributions in the years before that in which he ceases employment, will risk losing his pension rights if he has a week or two of employment shortly before pensionable age. The ##"##date on which his last employment ceased ##"## would be the end of that week or two of employment, and the ##"## average test ##"## would he transferred to a period of three years, most of which might be a period of unemployment. He will be penalized for getting an odd job or two as he approaches pension age. I suggest to the honorable senator that he should not press further with his amendments. The latter amendment we shall take into consideration when the time arrives; the earlier one will not attain the end he has in view. </para>

I point out to the honorable senator that a widow will be entitled to a pension as the result of contributions made by her first husband.

The object of the bill is to provide a pension for widows. I realize, of course, that it does so under certain conditions; but I am unable to understand why a widow##'##s pension cannot be paid to a lady who becomes widowed the second time. The term ##"## widowhood ##"## still applies, and we should not presume that as the result of her first experience the widow will marry a wealthy##'## man on her second venture. This request has been tendered in all seriousness, and I regret that the Minister in charge of the bill is unable to accept it. It is unfortunate, because the clause as it now stands will penalize a woman who marries a second time. After listening to the eloquent address which we heard last night upon the need for increasing the population, honorable senators should think carefully before placing obstacles in the way of the remarriage of widows. However, I shall not press the request, because no amount of argument can increase our numbers on this side to more than four. I ask leave, therefore, to withdraw the request. </para>

In calculating the difference between the benefit payable under this scheme, and the pension of ##£##1, payable under the Invalid and Oldage Pensions Act, the small allowance of 3s. 6d. for a dependent child should not be taken into account. Under the clause as drawn the insured person will receive 15s., plus 3s. 6d. in respect of the child, and ls. 6d. extra to bring the benefit up to ##£##1, whereas, under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown##'##s</inline> request, the pension would be ##£##1, plus 3s. 6d. That is all that we are asking. Of course, if our request upsets the actuarial basis, it is doomed, but we think that, in a matter of this kind, we should be influenced by other than actuarial considerations. </para>

                        <para>- This matter should not be dismissed so casually. The Minister is obviously under a misapprehension as to what is involved in the request. The object of the clause, apparently, is to guarantee that the insured person shall not get less benefit under this scheme than the pension of ##£##1 that is payable under existing pensions legislation. But it takes into account the child allowance, so that the insured person, instead of receiving 15s. from this fund, plus 5s. from the existing old age pension fund, plus 3s. 6d. for the child, will receive 15s., plus 3s. 6d. for the child, plus only ls. 6d. under existing legislation. </para>

                    <para>.  - Surely it is obvious to Ministers that under this bill an injured contributor with three dependent children, as has been suggested by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll),</inline> will receive 15s. a week pension and 10s. 6d. for the children, or a total of 25s. 6d. a week. The point I emphasize is that the Government, under this bill, contracts to pay that person 15s. a week and 3s. 6d. for each dependent child. A dependent child does not become less dependent or less expensive to maintain merely because its father has become a chronic invalid. Therefore, what we are asking is that when a man##'##s disability becomes chronic, entitling him to the invalid pension of ##£##1 a week, the Government should also honour its contract to pay the allowance in respect of his dependent children. I know that if the proposal be accepted it will increase the charge on the fund, but its non-acceptance will mean that, in order to decrease the charge on the fund, the Government will ignore the existence of the three dependent children. We on this side will not stand for that. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not disputing the right of the Leader of the Opposition to ask for these additional benefits. The only point I wish to make is that we cannot disregard the child allowance in one case and take it into consideration in another. If a man goes off this fund by claiming an invalid pension, he will get ##£##1 a week, but no child allowance. What the Leader of the Opposition is asking is that in such cases the amount payable on account of dependent children shall be added to the 5s., which represents the difference between a pension under this scheme and the invalid pension. </para>

                    <para>. - All we ask is that the Government shall observe its contract to a man who becomes ari invalid. It definitely undertakes, in this bill, to pay a disablement pension of 15s. a week to male contributors, plus 3s. 6d. a week for each dependent child. Of course I expect that the Minister will say that the Government cannot afford this extra payment. But that is another matter. </para>

I thought that I had demonstrated beyond all possibility of misunderstanding that in this bill- the Government contracts to pay a disablement benefit of 15s. a week, and 3s. 6d. a week in respect of each dependent child. We say that when disability becomes chronic, the Government should not take from this unfortunate man payments which it had contracted to make in respect of his children. To do that is not only unfair; it is also dishonourable. </para>

                    <para>. - Under this measure the Government is making contracts with different people. In the first place it specifies what contributions shall be payable and what benefits shall be given. If a male contributor dies, the Government contracts to pay to his widow  a  specified sum by way of pension, and so much for each dependent child. I ma in tain that the payment in respect of dependent children is a contract made with those children, and not with the father. If, therefore, the father##'##s invalidity becomes chronic, and he makes application for an increase of pension payments to ##£##1 a week, the amount payable under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, the Government should not withhold payments in respect of the dependent children. </para>

                        <para>- That, in substance, is the argument of the Government. The payment under this bill to a man with one dependent child will be 15s. plus 3s. 6d. To this ls. 6d. will be added, to bring the total up to ##£##1. That carries out the undertaking that he shall receive less than he would receive in the form of an invalid pension. Honorable senators are confusing the two acts. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> suggests, the amount of 3s. 6d. is to be disregarded, then in every case in which there was only one dependent child the amount of 15s. a week given under this scheme would be supplemented by a further 5s. a week, which would be a charge on the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. The Government says that if cannot accept the liability for the payment of that additional 5s. in the case of an individual who swings over from this legislation to the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. </para>

                        <para>- That is 16s. a week. If she becomes a chronic invalid, she can claim an additional 4s. a week, so as to raise the total to ##£##1 a week. We say that no woman should be penalized because she has a child. The child has to be kept. Therefore, we contend that she should be paid under this scheme 12s. 6d. a week on her own account and 3s. 6d. a week in respect of her child, and an additional7s. 6d. a week by the Invalid and Old-age Pensions department. The Minister says that that cannot be afforded. If he were to say that the proposal was not sound actuarily, we might accept the position. But from the viewpoint of ordinary justice, such a  woman should receive the invalid pension of ##£##1 a week as well as the allowance of 3s. 6d. a week in respect of each child. </para>

                    <para>. - The actuarial position referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> does not enter into this argument. If we were to disregard the allowance of 3s.6d. a week, there would have to be an additional grant of 5s. a week in respect of an individual who transferred from this fund to the invalid pension fund. The honorable senator knows that. The principle embodied in this amendment is no different from that which would be embodied in a proposed amendment to an invalid and old-age pensions bill  to  increase the pension from ##£##1 to ##£##1 5s. a week. That  is  notreasonable. No  Government  could consider such an amendment without first investigating the financial obligations involved in  it. </para>

                    GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia) ##[##11.29##]##. - This clause has somewhat puzzled me. I take  it  that,  if  an insured person who has children becomes disabled he will be entitledunder this bill  to  benefit according  to  the number  of  his children. The amount paid might be more than ##£##1. If the aggregate payment under this bill  to  a man who  is  totally and permanently incapacitated is less than ##£##1 because there  is  only one child, he can then apply for the invalid pension and the amount  of  the pension will be made up  to  ##£##1.  If  a person had so many children that, under this bill, the amount which he would collect would be more than ##£##1,he would not apply for the invalid pension, but would continue to draw the pension under  this  bill. As I understand it,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown##'##s</inline>
                    amendment is unnecessary, because this clause is really of benefit to the disabled person with one child ; in reality it gives him an option. The clause, as I understand it, means that, if a person is receiving weekly 15s., - in the case of a widow, 12s. 6d. - plus 3 s. 6d. for each child, and then becomes totally and permanently incapacitated, that person has the right to apply for the invalid pension, which would bring the amount received up to ##£##1.

This clause means that if a person is drawing 15s. a week under this bill and then qualifies to draw the invalid pension, the amount of that person##'##s pension would be increased to ##£##1, including payments made in respect of children. The benefit of this clause to which honorable senators opposite have referred, is an illusion.

                        <para>- That is a misrepresentation. All ambiguity should be removed by putting the clause in plain language. It should say straight out that the 3s. 6d. a week for childrenis taken into account. The Government is endeavouring to give the Senate to understand that the 12s. 6d. or 15s. a week will be increased to ##£##1 a week, but in the process the child will be robbed. </para>

                    <para>.- At first glance, every one will agree, this clause is rather confusing, and for a while I was inclined to yield to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown##'##s</inline> reasoning. I now think that the clause means that if a pensioner under this bill is receiving 15s. a week and becomes totally and permanently incapacitated he will elect to draw the invalid pension of ##£##1 a week. If he has one child, under this bill, he will draw 18s. 6d. a week, or under the Invalid and Oldage Pensions Act, ##£##1 a week. If a person is entitled to ##£##1 2s. a week under this bill because he has two children, he will, naturally, not apply for the invalid pension, and will keep his ##£##1 2s. Similarly, a man who has three children and is receiving ##£##1 5s.6d., will remain under the provisions of this measure. </para>

                    <para>. -  When I read the marginal note to this clause and saw ##"## Benefits to persons in remote areas ##"##, I expected something different  from  what the clause actually provides. Instead of granting benefits to persons in remote areas, the clause really relates to the lack of benefits. This clause, which links with paragraph <inline font-style="italic">j</inline> of Part II. of the  first schedule, and also with clauses 52 and 55, deals with one of the outstanding problems to be faced. Although the commission will have to deal with these problems, the Government surely has some idea of how the problem of applying the scheme to remote areas is to be met. If the bill is to be passed in its present form, wo arc entitled to know what is intended. It may be that in areas which lack doctors the Government intends to appoint its own doctors. I imagine that probably three-fourths of Western Australia and one-half of South Australia could be regarded as remote areas for the purposes of this legislation. I should be glad to know what is intended. </para>
