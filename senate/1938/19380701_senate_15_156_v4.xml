          <para>. - I wish to make it clear that the Opposition has not been consulted in any way regarding the election of  President.  The choice of a  President  was evidently made before honorable senators entered this chamber. As honorable members of the Opposition were not consulted, we propose to leave this matter to those who have accepted the responsibility of acting in this decidedly party fashion. The Senate is supposed to be, not a party house, but a States house; but we have seen to-day that, although honorable members of the Opposition represent States just as do honorable senators who support the Government, they are not considered when the parties opposite meet to arrange matters to their own taste. With those remarks, I propose to allow the proceedings to continue. </para>

            <para>- It is rather unfortunate that a difficulty of this nature should arise so soon after my election as  President.  Prom my parliamentary experience, I am of opinion that notice of a motion of this kind -must be handed into the  Clerk,  or  President,  prior to the commencement of the sitting. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> handed his letter to me a few hours ago. It is dated the 1st July. I am fortified in my ruling by a previous decision, that an honorable senator cannot submit a motion for the adjournment of the Senate to enable him to discuss a matter of urgent importance if, prior to the commencement of the sitting&#34;, he has not given notice of his intention to the Chair. I hold the view that if the Standing Orders, which have been drafted by men well versed in parliamentary procedure, are interpreted in a common-sense way, any problem arising under them can generally be solved. I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston&#39;s</inline> motion should take precedence over that moved by the Leader of the. Opposition, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> submitted notice of his motion some time ago. </para>

The ruling I have just given was to the effect that, for several reasons, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston&#39;s</inline> motion took precedence over that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings.</inline> That ruling has been challenged. Even in my long parliamentary experience, I know of no precedent for these circumstances. The Standing Orders do not provide for it. I must, therefore, decide it for myself. My ruling has to be considered by the Senate at a future date. The whole matter is, therefore, in abeyance. Neither honorable senator may move his motion at this stage. I do not take into account, at the moment, the subject-matter of either motion. In the circumstances which face us, and in view of the decision of the Senate, it would bequite unfair to allow either honorable senator to proceed&#39; with his motion at this moment. I, therefore, rule accordingly. </para>

              <para>- For a considerable time, I have been drawing the attention of the Government to the precarious state of the wheat industry and to the urgent need for effective action by the Commonwealth Government to stabilize the price of wheat so as to assure to the growers a reasonable return for their labour. I ventilate this subject now because of the feeling of uncertainty and indefiniteness that exists as to the intentions of the Government. The wheatgrowers of Australia are confronted with falling prices and are unable to discover what definite assistance the Commonwealth Government intends to provide for them in respect to the coming harvest. They also wish to emphasize the need for substantial help for the industry on some permanent basis. Only in that way can the industry be put on a satisfactory footing. It is desired that for that portion of the Australian wheat crop which is consumed within the Commonwealth the producers shall receive a fair price which will give them some profit for their work. Unfortunately, since 1931, the wheat industry has been the plaything of party politics. The situation to-day is such that a fixed price should be declared for at least that portion of the crop which is consumed in Australia, so that the wheat-growers will know where they are. The responsibility for introducing legislation to achieve this deserving object may, unfortunately, not be accepted by all of the State governments of this country. The subject is tossed from the Commonwealth Government to State governments, and from State governments back to the Commonwealth Government, like a kind of political shuttlecock. To alter the figure, the responsibility for passing legislation to assist the wheat farmers, is an unwanted political baby. </para>

          <para>Obviously, long before even the six State Parliaments can pass the necessary legislation to deal with this important subject - I leave out of account, for the  moment, the necessary action by the Commonwealth Government - the whole of the next Australian wheat harvest will have been reaped and probably marketed.

        </para>
        <para>The Minister for Lands <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. M. F. Troy)</inline> said yesterday that he knew of no contemplated State legislation in connexion&#39; with a bounty for wheat. He was replying to statements made by the Acting Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> in the House of Representatives on Tuesday during a debate on the wheat industry. &#34; When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron</inline> makes a statement that the Commonwealth Government has no power to help the wheat-growing industry, &#34; said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Troy,</inline> &#34;he ignores the fact that under its excise powers the Commonwealth Government can provide a bounty for wheat or any other primary product. &#34; The legislation which the Commonwealth endeavoured to force upon the States a few years ago was unconstitutional, and the Commonwealth Government knew it was unconstitutional. The conference of Ministers which sat at Canberra under (the chairmanship of the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> was informed by no less an authority than the Common wealth Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> that such legislation was unconstitutional. &#34; The real Commonwealth objection to raising moneys under its excise powersto assist the wheat industry is political, and not because of any constitutional objection. At least one section supporting the Government objects to being saddled with the onus of doing anything to increase the price of foodstuffs and in the interests of this section the Commonwealth Government has endeavoured to force the States to pass legislation which would not in any way meet the situation. That Government is mostly concerned with holding together the two sections which support it, and this is the only reason why it will not face the facts squarely. <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Mr. Cameron</inline> is reported to have stated that &#39;each State Minister for Agriculture has promised to initiate State legislation and report his action to &#39;the Australian Agricultural Council in August to enable supplemen tary legislation to be enacted by the Commonwealth.&#39; I know of no such- contemplated legislation and am quite in the dark as to what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron</inline> is referring to.&#34; </para>
        <para class="block">It is quite clear from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Troy&#39;s</inline> statement - or so I should judge - that the Labour Government of Western Australia does not intend to pass this particular legislation which, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron,</inline> will have to be passed by six State governments before the Commonwealth will provide its coping stone. The Commonwealth should be well aware of that because the statement was made publicly. Although I have quoted it from <inline font-style="italic">The West Australian,</inline> I have also read it in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun,</inline> and doubtless it has appeared in all other newspapers in the eastern States. Therefore, the Commonwealth could not be excused if it was unaware that Western Australia, at all events, does not intend to pass this legislation except under pressure, and I have not, so far, heard any suggestion of that nature. If the Commonwealth knows that the States are not proposing to initiate this legislation, why should it wait until August or September for a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council to obtain reports on the subject from the States? As a matter of fact, the responsibility for assisting the wheat farmers rests, not upon the State governments, but where it has rested ever since I have been a member of the Senate, namely, on the broad back of the Commonwealth Government, which has an overflowing Treasury.  The following return shows the disbursements by the Commonwealth Government among the wheat-growers of Australia since 1929-30- &#62; </para>

        <para class="block">In none of those years was preliminary legislation passed by the six States of Australia, or even by the four wheat-growing States/ before the assistance was granted. The Commonwealth Government still has the powers that it then exercised. It is curious that in giving for five consecutive harvests the assistance I have outlined, on  not  occasion did it utilize any of the powers which the Privy Council in the. <inline font-style="italic">James</inline> ease subsequently declared that it did not possess. There is no reason why the Commonwealth should not now, on its own initiative, give similar assistance. </para>

              <para>- I should have no political objection to a flour tax so long &#62;as the wheat industry  was assisted quickly and permanently. I shall deal with the flour tax and bounty later in my remarks. The principal legislation in connexion with a compulsory pool, if one be now possible in view of the decision in the <inline font-style="italic">James</inline> case, would be a matter for Commonwealth initiative and action. The prospect of increased crops of wheat in the northern hemisphere has depressed wheat prices and made the matter one of urgency. I noticed in yesterday&#39;s Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> that the price of wheat at Williamstown, Victoria, was 3s.  6&#189;d  a bushel, whilst the average price at country sidings was 3s. l&#163;d. a bushel. During the preceding few weeks the price was even lower than those unprofitable rates. </para>

          <para>Two years ago the Primary Producers Association of Western Australia placed before the Commonwealth Government detailed plans for a home consumption price of 5s. a bushel. At that time, wheat was worth 4s. 6d. a bushel for export. As prices were then higher, no hardship would have been caused had the home consumption price been stabilized at 5s. a bushel. Had our proposals then been adopted, the public would by now have been accustomed to according this proper measure of protection to the wheatgrowers, just as protection is enjoyed by the secondary industries and industrialists by virtue of the tariff and the Arbitration Court. More recently this association has asked the Commonwealth Government for a guarantee of 4s. a bushel at ports for the whole crop. The wheat-growers and the wool-growers are as yet entirely unsheltered. For two consecutive harvests, owing to the improvement of prices, the  Government has been relieved of the need to pay a bounty on production or acreage, or of providing any other direct assistance to the wheat-growers of Australia. </para>
          <para class="block">To-day, the outlook is black, and while I am sure that the Government has good intentions, the growers are complaining of its delay. It seems to many growers that the Government is simply letting things drift. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Micawber,</inline> it is hoping that something will turn- up, in this instance an unlikely rise of overseas prices, which would relieve it of the necessity for talcing action. The wheatgrowers claim that the present position calls for immediate action by the Government. There is a strong feeling in the industry that at least the Australian Agricultural Council should be called together at once, if the Government is determined to consult that body once more, rather than wait until, the end of August or until September for this purpose. However, in view of the statement of the Minister for Lands in Western Australia, there does not seem to be any need to consult the Agricultural Council. There seems no likelihood of securing legislation from the six States, but the Commonwealth has power to impose an excise tax on flour and to give a bounty to the growers at once. I tried unsuccessfully yesterday, and with delayed success to-day, to have the subject discussed here. At least the Senate should not adjourn without a definite statement from the Government, and while the House of Representatives was in session some legislative action should have been taken. </para>

              <para>- I have repeatedy asked questions on the subject, and I tried to discuss the subject on the second reading of the Supply Bill, but I had the mortification, as did the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(&#39;Senator Collings),</inline> of being ruled out of order because the Leader of the Government felt it his duty to draw the attention of a somewhat sympathetic  President  to the Standing Orders. Ever since the beginning of this session, I have been asking questions of the Government with regard to the position of the wheat-growers, but I am sorry to say that those questions did not elicit a satisfactory, answer in regard to the Commonwealth Government&#39;s intentions. </para>
