                    <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - On Friday last, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley</inline> drew attention to  a press  report concerning the registration of a company for the purpose of trading in Australia and New Zealand in imported special alloy steels. The honorable senator appeared apprehensive that an activity of this nature might be harmful to Australian secondary industry. As I promised, I brought the honorable senator's remarks to the notice of the Minister for Trade arid Customs, who informs me that the local demand for special alloy steels covers  a  very wide range. The characteristics of the different kinds and grades of alloy steels vary considerably, whilst a large number of sizes, sections and shapes is required. Australian manufacturers are producing at the present time some grades of alloy steel, but are not in a position to supply the full range. This phase of the steel industry is, however, being developed, and one important manufacturer now has arrangements in hand for the production of tool steel. The manufacture of special alloy steelsis  protected by the tariff, although by-law admission at concessional rates of duty is granted in respect of those kinds of alloy steels that are not now commercially produced in Australia. When Australian manufacturers are producing these kinds of steel, a request for the withdrawal of existing by-law concessions will receive every consideration. In my opinion, every honorable senator should have reason to be satisfied with the progress of the steel industry in Australia. Immediately the production of any kind of steel on a commercial basis is practicable, Australian manufacturers extend their activities to embrace that particular section of the trade. Honorable senators may also remove from their minds any doubt which they may have regarding the continued development of steel manufacture in Australia on a sound basis. The tariff policy of the Government is such that' the interests of Australian secondary industry will be adequately protected. </para>

How does the Minister reconcile that purchase with the statement he made, when speaking on the Anglo-American trade agreement, that the loss of the preference of 2s. a quarter in the market of the United Kingdom will not affect the Australian wheat industry? </para>

Practically all of the plant and equipment required for the manufacture of armament stores will bo provided and installed at the Government's expense, and will, at all times, remain its property and without its consent cannot be used on any work other than Government orders. The annexes, in effect, will be governmental workshops attached to the selected establishments for purposes of management and operation. Profits on armament stores manufactured in the annexes will be controlled by checking actual manufacturing and overhead costs. A special section has already been set up within the department for this purpose, and, as indicated in my statement to Parliament yesterday, the Government has decided to invite the accountancy societies to nominate a panel to advise on the scheme of costing and profit control for the production of munitions by private industry in an emergency. </para>

                    <para class="block">Government and of the Senate the serious position of the town of Broome and of the pearling industry in the north of Australia. The industry is suffering severely, not only from Japanese competition in the actual recovery of pearl shell, but also owing to the fact that that competition is reducing the price of the product upon which the pearling industry and the township of Broome depend. This matter has been brought before the Government emphatically and repeatedly during the last few mouths. I wish to refer particularly to the deputation representing the pearling committee which waited upon the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> at Broome at the end of August last. The deputation was introduced by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Green)</inline> and was supported by me. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Green</inline> and I travelled to Broome specially to take part in that and other representations which were made to the Government on the first visit of a Commonwealth Minister to the north-west coast. The Minister visited Broome on his return journey from the Northern Territory in order to go fully into the matter of assisting the pearling industry. I applaud his action in deciding to visit Broome and that of the Government in approving of his visit, which was highly appreciated by the residents of Broome, which for over 40 years lias been the head-quarters of the northwest pearling industry, upon "which it depends for its existence. Moreover, the Western Australian Government permitted the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Koolama</inline> to remain at Broome for a longer .period than is usual in order to enable the Minister to hear the views of those engaged in the industry and to investigate their problems on the spot. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carrodus,</inline> the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, also attended the deputation. The case -for assistance to the white pearlers at Broome was outlined by several speakers, including members of the Broome Pearlers Committee, who submitted a carefully prepared case for assistance. A detailed written statement of their claims was also handed to the Minister. A feature of the deputation was a speech made by the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Collins),</inline> who was invited to make a few remarks as a visiting supporter of the Government. In very eloquent terms he supported the requests of the deputation, and said that the case made out by the pioneer pearlers of the north deserved full support from this Parliament and the people of Australia. The Minister's reply to the deputation was certainly most sympathetic. He promised to submit their case to the Cabinet as soon as he returned to Canberra, and to convey Cabinet's decision to the pearlers as soon as possible. Nearly three months has elapsed since the Minister was in Broome, and the only action taken so far by this Government has been to join with the Government of Western Australia in guaranteeing a small advance against the shell raised. This assistance is not nearly sufficient to save the industry from the disaster which now threatens it. Replying to the deputation the Minister, on his own initiative, said that as the question of Australia's national prestige was undoubtedly involved in the maintenance of the pearling industry, we could not afford to see Australian pearlers driven out of business by Asiatic competition. He assured the deputation that this aspect would be borne in mind by the Government. I have yet to learn what assistance the Government proposes to provide. I understand that it has joined with the Government of Western Australia in guaranteeing an advance of £87 a ton against pearl shell on something over 150 tons of shell, the joint liability of the two governments in respect of Broome being about £14,000. Probably a smaller amount would be involved in respect of Darwin. The pearlers ask that a bonus, or subsidy, be granted on the production of pearl shell at the rate of £30 a ton while the price of shell is less than £135 a ton. I am. sorry to say that the present price is considerably less than that figure. I have been collaborating in this matter with the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Green)</inline> who, I understand, intends to raise the subject in the House of Representatives at his first opportunity. During the last few days we have received several communications from representatives of the industry at Broome. The following telegram was sent to me by the  chairman  of the </para>

To size the situation I have carefully perused pearlers' file on their case to Federal Government, and can assure you that requests are for the minimum amount only on which it is possible to carry on the industry, on which the whole town exists. At a meeting of the Roads Board to-day the situation was fully discussed, and much anxiety was expressed. We are definitely certain that if assistance asked for is not forthcoming immediately the town will be in a state of chaos, and trouble with unpaid seamen is feared.

Honorable senators will realize that the white population of 465 dependent on this industry at Broome will be faced with disaster unless immediate and substantial help, to the amount of at least an additional £16,000, be granted by this Government. </para>
                    <para>In regard to the efficiency of the industry, I point out that since criticism was levelled against it by the Tariff Board in 1935, the majority of the boats and equipment at Broome have been replaced. On the 16th August, the  chairman  of the Broome Pearlers Committee wrote to the Assistant Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> as follows : - </para>

                        <para>During 1935 the Tariff Board sat at Broome to investigate the condition of the pearling industry. At that time it was known Japanese sampans were operating off the Darwin coasts and, from information in their possession, the board expressed the opinion that the Japanese vessels were of a superior type and much better equipped than those of Broome. During 1936 and 1937 all profits and the generous help forthcoming from both Commonwealth and State governments, to those pearlers who suffered in the 1935 cyclone, plus a considerable amount of capital, were spent and invested in rehabilitating, modernizing existing bottoms and installing the latest types of auxiliary plants. To-day, 99 per cent of the unite operating from Broome are amongst the most up-to-date in the world. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Thus the Government is being asked to assist, not only a white population to maintain itself in the tropics, but also an industry which has placed itself on an efficient basis. Since the deputation waited on the Minister at Broome members from Western Australia have raised this matter on several occasions in this Parliament, but no definite reply has yet been given to their representations. I, myself, have raised the subject on two occasions in this chamber. I now urge the Government to do something for the industry before the session ends. A couple of weeks ago the honorable member for Kalgoorlie and I discussed the matter at length with the Assistant Minister for Commerce who is now handling it. We were relieved to know that he was in close collaboration with the Minister who is undoubtedly sympathetic to the requests made by the deputation which waited on him at Broome. The industry, there fore, confidently looks to both of these Ministers to support their requests. I repeat that the position at Broome is desperate. The Minister quite rightly agreed that Australia's national prestige was involved in the maintenance of the industry. Certain phases of the matter involving international competition were placed before him, but I do not propose to refer to them at the moment. I have no doubt that, they will be carefully considered by the Government. I point out that the pearlers at Broome are obliged to bear a considerable burden as the result of national policy in respect of the tariff and in other directions, whereby their costs of production have been very substantially increased. There can be no doubt that the industry is of very great value to the Commonwealth. The pearlers who have pioneered it in Northern Australia for the last 40 years are a valuable factor in the development of that part of this country, whilst from the aspect of defence we cannot afford to lose so important an industry in our vulnerable north. I again urge the Government to give an immediate and favorable reply to the requests made on behalf of the industry. </para>

                        <para>. - The urgency of assisting the pearling industry, was raised last week by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> who dealt with the position at Darwin. I might add that the position at Thursday Island is also very grave. J agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> has said in regard to Broome, and I now repeat the assurance which I gave to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper,</inline> that the whole matter of assisting the pearling industry is being carefully considered by the Government. The dangers arising from the intrusion of foreign- sampans on our pearling ground have, of course, been apparent for quite a number of years. The increase of the number of sampans and of the production of pearl shell in northern waters is causing considerable, concern to Australian pearlers, but there is no evidence available to support" <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper's</inline> fears that Japanese pearlers are subsidized by the Japanese Government. A holding company has been formed in Japan to take over the whole of the Japanese pearling interests and to regulate the output with a view to improving market conditions. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>As to the present critical state of the industry at Broome, I point out that advances totalling £14,000 have been made by the Commonwealth Bank in order to finance the marketing of pearl shell, and that an arrangement has  been  entered into between the governments of the Commonwealth and Western Australia to guarantee £12,000 of that amount An advance under similar conditions has also been made, with the cooperation of the Government of Queensland, to assist the pearling industry at Thursday Island. </para>
                    <para>As was mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> the Tariff Board in 1935 made certain recommendations as to the free entry under by-law of goods, mostly machinery, diving accessories and other incidentals to the pearling industry, and from time to time these goods have been admitted free of duty by the Commonwealth Government. By that means it has been possible to ease the burden on the industry in the far north of Australia. Consideration is also being given by the Rice Marketing Board of New South Wales and the Queensland Sugar Board to a request that special price concessions be granted to those engaged in the industry. I, personally, have received a number of telegrams similar to those received by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline> They have been submitted to Cabinet, and I give an assurance that every consideration will be given to the request for assistance to this important industry which operates in isolated parts of the continent. </para>

                        <para>.- In November, 1936, this subject was under discussion as the result of questions which I asked and some action which I took regarding grants to the pearl-shell industry. I hope that the Government will not again do what it ha3 done in the past on some occasions when grants to assist the pearl shell industry have been made. The Opposition is at all times willing to help primary industries, particularly those which are being carried out in remote parts of the continent. On the occasion referred to, I drew attention to the fact that persons who were not in any way in need of the money participated in the grant. I hope that that error will not be repeated. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that those who arc in need of financial aid to help them to carry on will get the money. Questions which were asked this afternoon should lead to some interesting revelations regarding assistance to wheatgrowers. If  this  nation is continually to be called upon to relieve different sections of primary producers - and the Opposition is always willing and ready to support such grants - we shall have to lay down definitely that persons who aru not in need of assistance, even though they may suffer some temporary disadvantage in respect of that portion of their income which happens to be derived from primary industries, shall not participate. The policy of perpetually "greasing tha fat pig " is far from satisfactory; yet that is the policy which has been followed in granting assistance to the pearl shell and other industries. Out of the grants made in 1936 to assist the industry, Farquhar's Proprietary Limited received £69 lis. 6d., notwithstanding that the proprietors of this concern live on Thursday Island, and are reputed to be well-to-do.  Wyben  Pearling Company Limited was paid £32S Ils. 4d. That firm was originally Burns, Philp and Company, which, however, found its fleet of nearly twenty boats too cumbersome to be handled in connexion with its merchandise and shipping  agency,  and consequently Wyben Pearling Company Limited was formed to take over the fleet. There was no need for any further fattening of this company which has paid some handsome dividends, the rate on one occasion being as high as 40 per cent. Another firm which participated in the grant was Bowden Pearling Company Limited, which received £269 2s. Sd. Herbert Bowden, the original owner, and now principal of the company, left Thursday Island over 30 years ago in order to manage the affairs of Bowden Brothers and Company Limited, Sydney; that firm has large operations in Japan. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowden</inline> has retired from business, and is reputed to bo a wealthy man. He has been a frequent traveller to Japan, Europe and America He could afford to do his share of the maintenance of the pearling industry of Thursday Island, without any assistance from the taxpayers of the country. </para>

                    <para class="block">Another participant was Charles Sinclair, who was paid £70 8s. 6d. This man was born in Torres Strait, his father having been  one  of the first white divers there. He is the only pearler who is nui financially strong. Had the whole of the £1,500 distributed to Thursday Island pearlers been paid to him, the payment might have been -justified. Yet he received only a comparatively small amount. The sum of £106 13s. 5d. was paid, to E. J. Hennessy who has sold his fleet, and was about to retire and leave the district. Morey and Company received £177 13s. 3d. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morey</inline> retired to Brisbane about twenty years ago, and has not carried on business since, although he has a working partner. Another company which shared in the grant was J. B. Carpenter and Sons, which was paid £91 9s. 2d. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> and William Carpenter are wealthy men who reside, in Sydney. It is said that the former gave £25,000 to imperial funds in order to obtain his knighthood. One of the brothers also participated in the grant, paid to assist the industry at Darwin. I shall not take up the time of the Senate by giving further particulars relating to recipients of previous grants. It is sufficient to say that the circumstances associated with these grants constitute a public scandal. I repeat what I said two years ago, when I expressed the hope that grants to assist primary producers shall be paid only to people who are in need, and not to those who are well able to get along without assistance. </para>

                            <para>- On a previous occasion when the Senate had before it a bill to grant assistance to the wheat industry, an honorable senator moved that at least £50 of the grant paid to any wheat-grower should be reserved to him and be beyond the claims of creditors. The Opposition, which always supports a system in such cases, favoured the proposal, but it was not supported by honorable senators generally. It is time that we awakened to the injustice of grants being made to persons who are not in need of  assistance. In many instances, wealthy persons whose activities in primary industries are subsidiary to their other enterprises, have been paid considerable sums in this way. </para>

                    <para>This bill, which contains an amendment to tariff item 334 (c)(1), is complementary to the Newsprinting Paper Bounty Bill 1938. It provides for the imposition of the following additional rates of duty on unglazed news-printing paper in rolls, namely : - 5s. a ton when the imported cost is less than £15 a ton; 7s. 6d. a ton when the imported cost is less than £14 a ton; and 10s. a ton when the imported cost is less than £13 a ton. </para>
                    <para>The additional rates will be imposed on a date to be proclaimed, concurrently with the proclaiming of the. operation of the act authorizing the payment of the bounty. On present indications, the proclamation will not be issued until at least twelve months from now, and, even then, these duties will apply only when the imported cost falls below £15 a ton. If the duties come into operation, the amount of the duty will automatically be deducted from the rate of bounty. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of the bill is to provide the machinery for the creation of a fund for publicity and research in the apple and pear industry of Australia. The money so collected will be expended in Australia, mainly to increase the consumption of these fruits in the Commonwealth. The fund will be established by means of a sales tax on apples and pears sold in Australia, and the amount so collected will approximate  £10,000  per annum. This sum will provide for an effective and continuous campaign of advertising our own fruit in this country. The tax is not being imposed as a means of raising revenue for the use of the Government; it is imposed at the request of the growers themselves and for their benefit. The raising of funds in this way is regarded as more satisfactory than the alternatives, of depending on voluntary subscriptions from the  growers -  a system which was operating inequitably - or of depending on the Commonwealth Government for a grant which, at present, the Government is not in a position to make available. </para>
                    <para>The maximum rate of tax is to be¾d. a bushel case. This rate will also apply to two half bushel cases of apples or pears, and to three trays of pears. The effective rate of tax to be prescribed is not to exceed½d. a bushel case. </para>

                        <para>. - This clause is contrary to all principles of British justice, because it places the onus of proof substantially on the defendant. According to French law, a defendant must prove himself innocent, whilst, according to British law, the prosecutor must prove the defendant guilty. I submit that the onus of proof should be the same in the case of prosecutions under this measure as in any civil or criminal prosecution. The clause provides that every averment of the prosecutor or plaintiff, contained in the information, shall be prima facie evidence of the matter averred. That means that the onus of proof is placed on the defendant. As it is intended to apply French law rather than British law, I oppose the clause entirely. There is no necessity for such a provision. If the clause were eliminated the ordinary principles of British justice would apply. I am aware that a provision of this nature is embodied in other legislation, but that does not justify its inclusion in this bill. It is now a common practice for departments to endeavour to make proof easy, but they should not depart from the broad principles which have made us proud of British justice. </para>

                        <para>. - The principle embodied in this clause is laid down in practically every taxation measure. Prima facie evidence, of course, is not conclusive evidence, but it should stand until disproved. It is necessary that averments in connexion with prosecutions under this legislation should be accepted as prima facie evidence until disproved, because the accused person might be the only possessor of certain information. Provisions of this kind have stood the test of time. </para>

                        <para>. - I am satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> has introduced a sinister suggestion which is not justified. Under this legislation, tax is to be levied on the growers of apples and pears to make possible a publicity campaign which will give the growers a better home market for their commodity than they have hitherto enjoyed. A provision of this kind is necessaryin order to deal with growers who are not prepared promptly to make the small contribution required of them. </para>

               <para>- It is with much regret that I have to announce that the  Clerk  of the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monahan,</inline> is about to sever his association with the Senate. He has a very long and honorable parliamentary service to his credit. Ho joined the staff of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales on the 17th March, 1890. He was transferred to the Senate as  Clerk  of Papers on the 1st May, 1901, and was promoted to the position of Usher of the Black Rod and  Clerk  of Select Committees on the 1st July, 1908. He attained the position of  Clerk  Assistant on the 1st July, 1915, and was promoted to his present office on the 28th August, 1920.  His  total period of service to. the 31st December, 1938, will have been 48 years 9 months. In 1924, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Monahan's  services were recog nized by  His  Majesty, and he was created a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. He has held the position of honorary secretary of the Commonwealth of Australia Branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association since 1928. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monahan</inline> has always been a most zealous officer, and he is one whom the Commonwealth can ill afford to lose. He has outstanding ability and a remarkable knowledge of parliamentary procedure.  His  wide experience and ability have always been placed at the disposal of honorable senators, who, I am sure, join with me in wishing him the long life and happiness that he has so well earned. </para>

Since .I have been  Chairman  of Committees I have been more closely associated with him, and have been able to recognize to an even greater degree his outstanding fitnessfor the office he holds. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> said that sometimes his style had been cramped by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monahan's</inline> knowledge of the Standing Orders. That reminded me of a  Speaker  in a State Parliament, of which I was once a member, who, in delivering a speech on his retirement from the Chair, said that he had only erred once, and that was when he had not done as he had been directed by the  Clerk.  I think that any presiding officer in the Senate could have said the same of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monahan.</inline> With other honorable senators I wish <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monahan</inline> happiness and good health, and I am glad to learn that he proposes to spend his retirement in Canberra, because his guidance will still be available to us should it be required. </para>

Another capacity in which he has rendered valuable service to Australia is as secretary of the Commonwealth of Australia Branch of the British Empire Parliamentary Association. With unflagging zeal he has applied himself to the interests and aspirations of that association which may mean so much to the various units of the British Empire as the years go by.

                    <para>This bill seeks to legalize certain alterations of the tobacco import duties. These duties are, in effect, penal duties imposed in instances in which less than the prescribed percentages of Australian leaf are used. This policy of imposing penal duties on imported tobacco leaf was first applied by the Government in May, 1936, and approved by Parliament in the same year. From that date increased duties were imposed on imported tobacco leaf used in conjunction with less than 2$ per cent, of Australian leaf in cigarettes, and less than 13 per cent, of Australias leaf in manufactured tobacco. This action had the effect of forcing all manufacturers to use the required proportion of Australian leaf, whereas previously some manufacturers were disinclined to incorporate local leaf in their blends. This kas resulted in much keener competition for Australian leaf, and has made practicable the purchase of all marketable leaf grown locally at prices considerably in excess of world parity for comparable leaf. </para>
                    <para>Some months ago a review of the Australian tobacco industry was undertaken, and, having regard to the increased production of Australian leaf combined with the remarkable improvement of quality, the Government decided to raise the minimum percentages of Australian leaf used in the manufacture of cigarettes and tobacco. Accordingly steps were taken in September last, to raise the required percentage from <inline font-style="italic">2i-</inline> per cent, to 3 per cent, in cigarettes, and from 13 per cent, to 15 per cent, in respect of tobacco. A similar adjustment of the Australian leaf percentages is being m'ade in relation to manufactured tobacco and cigarettes imported from the United Kingdom. This can be regarded as a second step in the implementation of the 'Government's policy to ensure the purchase and consumption of all usable tobacco leaf grown in Australia. Since the Lyons Government took office in 1932, the consumption of Australian-grown leaf has continued to increase. During 1937-38, a quantity of  5,400,000  lb., was used by , manufacturers, as compared with a consumption of  2,600,000  lb. in  1931-32.  Furthermore, financial assistance provided by the Government for research, experimentation and instruction has brought about an improvement of the general quality of leaf produced which is reflected in the remunerative prices obtained by growers of leaf  of the right type. I assure honorable senators that immediately developments justify such action, the Government will give every consideration to increasing still further the minimum percentages of Australian leaf required to be used in manufacture. </para>

                    <para class="block">On  this side have put up a very solid fight in the interests of Australian-grown tobacco. I recall with a good deal of glee the time when we were told that we should never be able to make a job of the industry, that locally-grown leaf would never suit the Australian smoker's taste, and that it- did not burn cool. On the latter point, I was unable to pass expert judgment because I have never indulged in tobacco in any form. It is pleasing to find that such prognostications have not been justified. "We are pleased to hear the Minister state that the consumption of Australian-grown tobacco is increasing, and that the public is more and more appreciating the local article. I feel very kindly disposed towards this industry, for the further reason that it has been firmly established in Queensland, where the fine bright yellow leaf so much sought after by those who appreciate good tobacco is being grown. Naturally, all Queenslanders are proud of that industry. </para>

                        <para>.- I am delighted to hear the Minister say that the use of Australian .leaf has increased to such an extent that last year  5,400,000  lb. of Australian-grown leaf was used in manufacture. I am glad also that the Government realizes that this industry is worth while. It is more than probable that Queensland's .success will be emulated in certain parts of Victoria. I hope that the Government will continue its research work with the object of eliminating blue mould, and that ultimately the whole of the tobacco smoked in this country will be Australian-grown. I can claim to know a little about tobacco. If I am spared to reach the age of  60,  I shall have smoked  11-J  cwt. of tobacco, despite the fact that many years ago a doctor told me that if I did not smoke I would be a jolly big fellow. When I was a member of the House of Representatives, excellent work was done for the encouragement of this industry by the Scullin Government, under the ministerial supervision of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly.</inline> As the result of the research work undertaken, many growers were encouraged to enter the industry. Unfortunately, in the majority of areas, -the same success was not achieved as is being enjoyed in northern Queensland. To-day, the best Australian leaf compares more than favorably with the imported article. Whenever I can get it, I smoke Australian tobacco; I think it is an excellent narcotic, at least equal to anything  brought here from overseas. To-day, all of the old prejudices against the Australian leaf have disappeared. I believe that big areas are available in New South Wales, where large numbers of people could earn a livelihood in this industry, provided the Government continues the research work that is now being carried on. </para>

                        <para>, -  I am pleased indeed that the Government is doing something in the interests of the tobacco-growers. There has been considerable discontent among the growers in the Tamworth district, where, in the past, large areas on which tobacco had been left standing presented a sad spectacle. At that time the growers were unable to dispose of their leaf owing to inadequate protection against the imported article. I made repeated requests on behalf of those growers that greater tariff protection should be afforded in order that they might be enabled to continue in the industry. They had sheds stacked with leaf which they were unable to- dispose of, and yet they could not afford to buy the necessary implements or even the seed with which to- sow another crop. They were in a very bad plight. There is no need for me at this juncture to dilate upon the  importance of this industry. All honorable senators, I believe, are fully aware of the excellent fight which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKnight,</inline> of Tamworth, has put up on behalf of the growers in his district. This measure is more than justified; 1 believe, however, that it might not have been introduced but for the inclusion in the Cabinet of the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson).</inline> He realizes, of course, that his electorate contains a large number of people who are anxious to resume operations in this industry. Since I have been a member of the Senate, the majority of our discussions so far as primary products are concerned, have related to wheat; this is the first time tobacco has been dealt with. The producers in this industry are entitled to just as much assistance and consideration from this Parliament as the wheat-growers. I hope that through this measure the industry will be enabled to prosper, not only in the Tamworth district, but also in other parts of New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>.-I feel sure that tobacco-growers throughout Australia will welcome this measure. I can see no reason why we should not be able to grow leaf as good as is grown in any other part of the world. 1" believe that the day will come whenwe shall be independent of Virginian or any other imported tobacco. Unfortunately, in the past the industry was commenced in districts which were suitable only for the production of black leaf, whereas the Australian market required a light tobacco. It has now been found that the required leaf can be produced in parts of Queensland and Victoria, and with further encouragement, growers will be induced to raise the general standard of their product. It, is unfortunatethat in theNew England district, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> referred, many people have been growing a black leaf which is quite unsuitable to the Australian taste. That tobacco could only be exported to the East, with the result that the growers were obliged to accept extremely low prices for their leaf. That difficulty has now been largely overcome. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is to be congratulated on its efforts in connexion with the control of blue mould. Only two or three years ago the raising of tobacco seedlings was almost impossible, because early in its life theleaf became infected with blue mould. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has now practically overcome that disease, with the result that to-day growers have much more confidence than they had previously. I hope that the day is not far distant when Australian growers of tobacco will be able toproduce a leaf which is equal to the best leaf grown in any other country. Honorable senators will probably have noticed that the words "Virginian leaf mixture " do not now appear on containers. Evidently, the proportion of Australian leaf used in blends is now much greater than formerly. I believe that smokers are beginning to appreciate the qualities of Australian tobacco and that in the near future, growers of tobacco will obtain good returns for a good article. I welcome the bill. </para>

                        <para>.- As this bill is important to the growers of tobacco, I suggest that some publicity in regard to it be issued. Otherwise, because so little publicity is given by the press to the proceedings in this chamber, many growers may not know that legislation requiring the use of a bigger proportion of Australian leaf in the tobacco and cigarettes which are offered for sale has been before the Senate. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill gives effect to the tariff alterations consequent upon the trade agreement with Switzerland. In conducting the negotiations which led up to the conclusion of that agreement, the Australian negotiators, for the purposes of offering turill concessions to Switzerland, selected lines in which Australian industry had little or no interest. A careful perusal of the list of concessions contained in the printed document which  has  been circulated makes it clear that most of the goods in respect of which tariff alterations are proposed are peculiar to Switzerland. Accordingly, I believe that the tariff alterations which ore now proposed can safely be adopted without prejudicing the interests of Australian industries. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to legalize the increase of Sd. per lb. excise on manufactured tobacco proposed in connexion with the budget in September last. This increase forms part of the Government's proposals to finance the wider defence plan. Over a full twelve months' period the increase of excise is expected to yield £500,000, but during the current financial year, 193S-39,- it is anticipated that approximately £375,000 will be added to the revenue. As certain interests claim that the Government's action under this measure has resulted in a reduction of the protection accorded to the Australian tobacco-grower, I desire to state, first, that the protection to the grower is granted mainly by means of customs duty on imported leaf, and to a further degree by the differential excise of 8d. per lb. in favour of tobacco made wholly from Australian-grown leaf. Secondly, the increase of excise duty applies irrespective of whether or not the manufactured tobacco is made wholly from Australian-grown leaf or contains imported leaf, and, as 12 lb. of imported leaf is used for every 5 lb. of Australian leaf used in the manufacture of tobacco, it could more justlybe claimed that the excise increase affects imported leaf to a greater degree than it does locally-grown leaf. I can assure honorable senators that this increase of excise duty does not reduce the substantial protection, ranging up to 500 per cent, ad valorem, which the Government has  accorded  to the tobacco industry. In conclusion, I point out that the Government has widened the market for the consumption of Australian-grown leaf by its action in increasing the minimum percentage requirement of Australian-grown leaf in tobacco and cigarettes. </para>

                        <para>.- I again direct attention to the dismissal of employees of the Victorian Railways, particularly those engaged in the workshops, and I suggest that the Defence Department should expedite its programme for construction of annexes to railway workshops, so as to absorb mcn who otherwise would be put ofl. In Victoria, between 600 and 1,000 men are threatened with dismissal. This Parliament has, this session, passed legislation to give relief to Australian primary producers. Some consideration should now be given to railway workers. The newly-constructed Cabinet now includes a. Minister whose sole duty it is to organize and. maintain continuity of the Commonwealth's works programme. He should be able to provide jobs for the workers in a wellordered way. The construction of annexes to the railway workshops could, with advantage, be expedited, so that the men whom it is now proposed to dismiss could be retained. The majority of employees in railway workshops are highlytrained men of outstanding ability. It would be a tragedy if they were forced to join the already large army of workless in Victoria. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to amplify a question which I asked of the Minister representing the Minister for Defence this afternoon. I asked the honorable senator if he would ascertain whether the Government was prepared, in pursuance of its defence programme, to make available a sum of money for the improvement of railway rolling-stock and permanent ways in the various States. I recognize the obligation resting upon the States to maintain their own railway services, and I do not suggest that the Commonwealth should assume entire responsibility for this work. An appeal was made to the Commonwealth Government by honorable senators recently for a special grant to tide the unemployed over the Christmas season. The answer given was to the effect that it was hoped that relief would be given to the unemployed by immediately embarking on certain defence works, and that relief given in this manner would he of much more value than the indiscriminate spending of money by way of a Christmas grant. Yesterday the Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> was approached by Senators Keane, Cameron, Brand and myself, and we elicited the information that it was proposed to undertake, almost immediately, certain defence works. Replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> in this chamber last Friday afternoon, the Leader of the Senate "(Senator McLeay) suggested that Victoria should meet its unemployment difficulties by an increase of taxes. I point out that workers in. that State are already bearing a heavy burden of taxation, and have subscribed a substantial amount for the relief of unemployment. A large sum has also been placed to the credit of the Victorian Employment Council, and has been utilized in finding jobs for the workers. Possibly the government of Victoria could continue for some time to maintain its rolling-stock and permanent ways, but, in my opinion, the railway equipment and trucks in that State are in such a condition that, from a defence standpoint, a Commonwealth grant  i3  imperative so that, in case of emergency, they would be able to operate with a reasonable degree of efficiency. If the renovation of rolling-stock and permanent ways  were undertaken, the dismissal of large numbers of employees would be unnecessary. The Victorian Government originally budgeted for a railway deficit of £180,000 this year. It is now believed that the deficit will reach £S95,0t)0. It is understood that, as the result of this revision of the State's financial proposals, the dismissal of at least 1,700 employees will be obviated. This indicates that the Victorian Government is making a determined effort to prevent a drastic increase of the number of the unemployed . in that State. Many of the railway employees who may be dismissed are technicians capable of performing work of a high standard. Honorable senators may be interested to know that, although the normal life of a locomotive engine is approximately 25 years, the average age of engines used on the Victorian railways is 26 years. This means that many of them have been in service for up to 40 years - fourteen years beyond their normal life. The economic life of a railway truck is in the region of 30 years, but in Victoria to-day there are trucks that have been in service for more than 50  year3.  This is important from a defence standpoint. If our railways are to play the part which they should in <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> system of national defence, they must be efficient. In recent years the Victorian Railways Commissioners have embarked upon an extensive programme of reconditioning the -permanent way. Money thus expended has been drawn from unemployment relief funds. The stage has been reached, however, when the railway authorities are unable to proceed any further in this direction and employees are being dismissed. It is true that a considerable amount of work has been carried out on the main lines from Albury to Melbourne, and Melbourne 'to Adelaide, two of the most important sections of the Australian railway system; but other equally important lines require attention. It is unfortunate that all railways in Australia are not controlled by the Commonwealth Government. There are good and sufficient reasons why the Commonwealth should come to the aid of the States in this matter. The defence value of the State railways needs no emphasis. I do not urge that the States should be relieved of their own responsibilities in regard to the railways, but it is necessary for the Commonwealth to assist those States which desire to cooperate with it in putting the defence machine into thorough order. If it be essential to establish annexes to private workshops in order to enable defence equipment to be supplied in large quantities in times of emergency, I suggest that the Commonwealth might well make a contribution to the States to enable them to bring their railway systems to a state of efficiency. </para>

                    <para>It is believed in some quarters, I understand, that the Government of Victoria is opposed to the establishment of an annexe at the Newport Railway "Workshops ; but that is not quite true. Representations have been made to the Victorian authorities on behalf of the Commonwealth- Government that they should make a contribution to the cost of this work far greater than they anticipated. That State is prepared to go on with the scheme if the Commonwealth will contribute a fair share of the cost. This matter merits the sympathetic consideration of the Commonwealth Government. If some of the work in connexion with the annexe could be put in hand immediately, it would bring relief during the Christmas period to persons who are now badly in need of work. </para>

                        <para>.- Recently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> as Minister representing the Minister for Defence, said that the various States would be assisted in providing work for the unemployed before Christmas. Yesterday I got into touch with the Minister for Employment in Western Australia, and I was informed that no work had yet been put in hand to absorb the unemployed. Only about a fortnight remains before Christmas, and I suggest that some work should be provided immediately. Drill halls are to be built, and unemployed could be absorbed at the Pearce and Maylands aerodromes. At the drill halls that are awaiting erection,  carpenters and painters could be employed, but a large number of the unemployed in Western Australia are not tradesmen. I was advised by the State Minister yesterday that these men were anxiously awaiting work of a similar kind, to that undertaken by the Commonwealth Government last year. It is essential that employment be found for these men immediately. Christmas will be a desolate season for them if they have no money in their pockets. </para>

                        <para>. - I also urge the Government to do something to provide work for the unemployed, not only in New South Wales, but also throughout the Commonwealth. The Government may claim that it is already doing something to relieve the position before Christmas, but, if any of the unemployed fail to obtain work at this period, they will be very unfairly treated. Work should be found immediately for all men in the Commonwealth who are now unemployed, otherwise they will have anything but a merry Christmas. Works could be put in hand without delay through State instrumentalities, such as the public works departments and the municipal and shire councils.

                <para>The New South Wales branches of the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union and of the Australian Postal Electricians Union are gravely perturbed over the' limitation of telegraph and telephone communication works, which it is feared will, within the very near future, result in the dismissal of a large number of employees, almost the whole being returned soldiers. The availability of communication, it is said, is the first line of defence, and in this regard, telegraph and telephone services are a vital link. Without hesitation, we definitely assert that a district does not exist within the Metropolitan area of Sydney where existing provisions are not totally inadequate to meet the demands, while in country districts sufficient work is available in erection of poles and maintaining lines in a state of efficiency to provide continued employment for every man nt present temporarily employed. </para>
                <para>Private employees have been urged by the Government to do their utmost to provide cm.ployment, but the restrictions being placed on the expansion of an essential service by the Government can only create public alarm, which it is felt is not in the interests of the people of the Commonwealth. Public moneys are being diverted for defence purposes, but what greater line of defence can be accomplished than by allocating funds for the maintenance and extension of services iri the Postal Department, thereby continuing the employment of a very large number of men. We understand the allocation for this year has been depleted for defence purposes. The defence policy of the Government has added a ' stimulus to the business community which is taxing the already lag in meeting increased traffic by the present telephone services. </para>

I hope that the fear which members of this organization have that they will be displaced will prove to have been uncalled for, and that sufficient money will he allocated from the Consolidated Revenue, into which the postal revenue is paid, to ensure that these men will be kept in employment. </para>

                        <para>. - I also appeal to the Government to take steps to see that no unemployed person is left without work at this period of the year. I have been associated with the officials in Western Australia who deal with the problem of unemployment and they are perturbed, as I am, over the present situation. On the 7th. October, I was informed, in reply to a question which I asked in this chamber, that defence expenditure to the amount of £478,365 would be incurred in Western Australia this year, and since that time an additional sum has* been allocated to that State. 3?he Minister said that it was foolish to talk about unemployment in Western Australia in view of the sum allotted to that State for defence works, since many men were now employed on those works. I was informed in reply to another question that during the period from July to October, contracts had been let in Western Australia to the amount of about £40,000. I was told that over £600,000 had been allotted to Western Australia for defence purposes, but from  that total must be deducted a certain sum for goods manufactured in eastern States. A few hundreds of men in the building trades are in need of employment, and <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> appeal to the Government to proceed with urgent works. It seems that honorably senators have been appealing in vain to the Government to provide immediate relief for those who are now unemployed. As the present sittings of Parliament will terminate within a day or two, I trust that some of the works proposed to be undertaken will be commenced immediately so that relief can be afforded to the unemployed before Christmas. As the money has been allocated and a schedule of works has already been drawn up, I trust that the Minister will be able to announce to-morrow that employment will be provided immediately for a large number of men. </para>

As a member of the United Social Service Committee in Tasmania, I have been engaged in social work for many years, and I can assure honorable senators that there is a good deal of poverty in that State. A few hours ago the Minister told us what the Government proposes to do, but I hope that the money already allocated will be disbursed immediately so that employment will be provided before Christinas. The amount allocated to Tasmania is very small, but as otherhonorable senators have made an appeal on behalf of the States which they represent, I again bring under the notice of the Government the claims of Tasmania. I do not want again to remind honorable senators how easy it is to finance public works. Money can be made available by the Commonwealth Bank free of interest.

Where there is a conflict between the Government's view ofwhat is best in the national interest, and the board's view, the first essential is full and frank dismission between the two authorities with a view to exploring the whole problem. In most cases 'this should ensure agreement on a policy to be carried . out by the bank which it can reconcile with its duty to the community, and which has the approval of the Government. In cases in which it is clear beyonddoubt that the differences are irreconcilable, the Government should give the bank an assurance that it accepts full responsibility for the proposed policy, and is in a position to take, and will take, any action necessary to implement it.
