I shall say no more than that in politics, as we know, there are differences. There have to be successes and there have to be losses. But I think that this day all of us would want to record our gratitude for the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Magnus</inline> conducted himself in the high office of  President  of the Senate. It is no disrespect to him that through the exigencies of politics and elections there has been a change in this office. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> we are sure that you will carry on those high traditions and the Presidency of the Senate will continue to stand above the politics and difficulties that very often arise in this place. On behalf of us all may I say that we are very happy to see you in your present position, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline></para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator WITHERS</inline>(Western AustraliaLeader of the Opposition)- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> on behalf of members of the Opposition may I offer our congratulations to you on your election this day as  President.  Naturally we would have preferred our own candidate to be elected. Apart from that, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, we</inline> trust that you will carry on the traditions of the 2 Presidents that I have seen in this place- <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alister</inline> McMullin and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, I</inline> think that you are the first member of the ex- Whips union to occupy the chair. The knowledge and experience that you must have gained as a Whip over a very long period in this place will have made you familiar with the traditions, Standing Orders and practices of the Senate. We of the Opposition look forward to your ruling fairly, firmly and impartially, favouring neither side but exercising your full authority from the Chair. </para>
          <para>Naturally there can be only one winner. As to your predecessor-my very old friend and colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack- I wish to say that he carried out the duties of that high office for some 3 years with enormous dignity and with great credit not only to the Senate and the Liberal Party of Australia but also to Australia in general. Our affection for him has in no way been diminished by what has happened. We are about to embark upon a new Senate and a new Parliament with a new <inline font-weight="bold">President. Mr President,</inline> we trust that we will have a smooth running Senate and that I will not be tempted too often to move motions of dissent against your rulings. </para>

            <para>- On behalf of the Australian Country Party I wish to join in the congratulations being extended to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> on your election by the Senate to the office of  President,  which is perhaps the highest honour that can be extended to any member of this place. We look forward to your living up to the high traditions set by your predecessor, a man who at all times demonstrated his interest in the Senate and its operations, a man who presided at all times with great calm and dignity. As one who has served in this place for many years as  Deputy President  and Acting  President  I wish to point out to the new members of this chamber that although quite often it would seem to be very easy for the occupant of the chair to make a decision, that is not always the case. Often it involves great consideration in a very short period. I am sure that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, can</inline> do it. May I, on behalf of my colleagues in the Australian Country Party, join with other honourable senators in expressing our appreciation to the retiring <inline font-weight="bold">President, Sir Magnus</inline> Mccormack? My colleagues and I are deeply grateful for the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Mccormack presided at all times over this Senate and also outside it. I think he was a wonderful example to the presidents of this Senate. We are sorry to see you go, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, but,</inline> as has been said by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, this is the way of politics. To you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> may we extend our best wishes for your term as  President  of this Senate. </para>

I too would like to add my warmest and sincerest thanks to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack for the wonderful contribution that he made as  President  of this Senate.  His  rulings, his good temper and his general conduct of the Senate are examples that could well be followed by his successors. I should like to pay that special tribute to him from the chair. I thank all honourable senators very much for the very kind sentiments that have been expressed. I hope that the confidence honourable senators have reposed in me will be well justified. </para>

      <para>His Excellency was pleased to deliver the following Speech: </para>
      <para>Senators and Members of the House of Representatives: </para>
      <para>In the elections for both Houses of Parliament on 18 May 1974, the people of Australia confirmed their decision of 2 December 1972. </para>
      <para>In preparing legislation for the 29th Parliament, my advisers have taken the view that the first responsibility of the Government is to carry out, fully and promptly, the program for change twice endorsed by the Australian people. Developments at home and abroad have created new and, in some respects, difficult economic conditions. My advisers believe that this in no way lessens the obligations imposed on the Australian Government to continue and complete its program but rather heightens the sense of responsibility and challenge which it should bring during the next three years to the task of leading Australia in a time of rapid change throughout the world. </para>
      <para>The legislative burden of the session must necessarily be extremely heavy. There are certain legislative provisions which lapsed at the end of June and which should have been reenacted before then. There are agreements with the States and rural assistance programs which should have been enacted before the end of June. These measures must receive prompt attention. Further, the Government will again submit important measures put forward in fulfilment of undertakings given to the electors in 1972 and repeated by the Prime Minister during the May elections. These measures include the six Bills which were twice rejected by the Senate and whose Parliamentary history provided the grounds upon which I granted a dissolution of both Houses on 1 1 April. Those Bills provide for electoral reform, for Senate representation of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, for the implementation of the Government's undertakings on health insurance and for a Petroleum and Minerals Authority. My Government will proceed immediately with these Bills. </para>
      <para>My Government will continue vigorous efforts against inflation. Despite the world-wide nature of this problem, the Government is confident that its measures can protect the Australian economy and the Australian people from the most harmful economic and social effects of inflation. If this is to be achieved, however, it will call for restraint and responsibility on the part of all sections of the community. My </para>
      <para class="block">Government acknowledges its duty to provide leadership in this direction. </para>
      <para>In determining priorities and in carrying out its program while continuing the fight against inflation, my Government will be guided by certain principles. These are: protection for the weaker sections of the community; a firm commitment to the principle of full employment; equity in sharing sacrifices as well as prosperity; and the need to ensure that any deferment of expectations shall not be made at the expense of those for whom deferment could mean a lifetime of deprivation- for example, children at school and migrants. </para>
      <para>The Government will continue its measures to strengthen and modernise the Australian economy, to improve the quality of the Australian workforce, to expand Australian resources and to promote Australian control over those resources. </para>
      <para>The Government will amend the Prices Justification Act to strengthen the Prices Justification Tribunal and make its operations more effective. The Trade Practices Bill will be reintroduced to strengthen control of restrictive trade practices and to protect customers from unfair practices. Further steps will be taken to promote customer protection. </para>
      <para>There will be legislation for a Securities and Exchange Commission and a National Companies Act to achieve uniformity. </para>
      <para>The Government intends to re-introduce legislation to examine and, where needed regulate activities of non-banking financial corporations. </para>
      <para>The Government will establish an Australian Government Insurance Office which will compete actively in all forms of insurance and which, in particular, will provide the widest possible cover for homes at the lowest possible premiums. </para>
      <para>The recommendations of the Committee of Taxation under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Asprey will be taken into account in this year's Budget when my Government will give urgent consideration to the restructuring of the taxation system. </para>
      <para>The Government intends to extend the provisions of the income taxation laws governing deductions for dependants to provide that migrants maintaining dependant relatives overseas shall be entitled to the taxation advantages which are already available to those maintaining dependant relatives in Australia. </para>
      <para>A Relief Board will be set up to consider requests for relief from estate duty on grounds of serious hardship. </para>
      <para>Provision is to be made for exemptions of the matrimonial home from estate duty. </para>
      <para>The home-building industry remains overstretched despite efforts by my Government to bring about a moderate abatement in the level of activity. The Government will continue to maintain the closest watch on the position, but until balance is restored between demand and supply of resources, existing restraints must be maintained. The Government is determined to provide adequate finance for an expansion in welfare housing which has suffered severely because of inflationary conditions. This will be done as soon as circumstances permit. </para>
      <para>The Housing Agreement will be amended to permit a higher proportion of funds to be allocated to the Home Builders' Account. </para>
      <para>Most Australian home owners and home buyers will receive relief from their interest repayment burdens through the provision of tax deductibility for mortgage interest repayments. </para>
      <para>Further measures will be taken to achieve sound industrial and resource development with the maximum Australian ownership and control. </para>
      <para>They will include reintroduction of legislation to expand the activities of the Australian Industry Development Corporation and to establish a national investment fund. </para>
      <para>The Petroleum and Minerals Authority will participate in the search for resources, assist Australian interests previously relying on foreign companies for development and progressively reduce foreign ownership and control of Australia 's resources. </para>
      <para>To intensify surveillance of foreign investment, new legislation will be introduced to replace the Companies (Foreign Take-Overs) Act. </para>
      <para>A Structural Adjustment Board will be set up to supervise assistance for firms and individuals adversely affected by the Government's program of structural change in industry, including the reduction of tariffs and the removal of subsidies. </para>
      <para>The Government is committed to the development of a coherent manpower policy to achieve the best possible use of the national workforce in social, economic and human terms. </para>
      <para>The reports of the Kansan Committee on Technical and Further Education and the Cochrane Committee on Adult Training and Retraining provide a valuable basis for the development of an integrated manpower strategy for Australia. There will be a Technical and Further Education Commission. Existing training schemes will be amalgamated into a single national employment and training program. </para>
      <para>Amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act will be again introduced: to ensure effective observance by all parties to industrial agreements; to promote amalgamation of industrial organisations; and to rectify the problems created by conflicting and unco-ordinated Federal and State industrial laws, and urgently brought to the attention of the Australian, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australian and Western Australian Governments by the Australian Industrial Court as far back as February 1969. </para>
      <para>My Government is keenly aware of its responsibilities as Australia's largest employer. A Royal Commission has been appointed to inquire into the Australian Public Service. My Government has accepted the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Post Office to establish an Australian Postal Commission and an Australian Telecommunications Commission (incorporating the Overseas Telecommunications Commission) and to give them control over the conditions of employment of their staffs. </para>
      <para>In recognition of the need for restraint on the growth of government spending, in the present inflationary situation, a ceiling of 2.6 per cent has been imposed on the growth of the Public Service and Government Authorities. </para>
      <para>The Australian Government seeks similar restraint on the part of State Governments. Among measures to assist the States to carry out their responsibilities, the Financial Agreement will be amended to provide for the formal takeover of $ 1,000m of State debts and an interest-free, non-repayable capital grant of almost $300m will be provided for the States' works program. </para>
      <para>Australia's sound overseas trading position is to be further enhanced by legislation: to establish an export bank; to expand the overseas investment insurance scheme; and to revise the export incentive scheme for the next five years of its operation. </para>
      <para>The Government will continue to negotiate trade agreements to provide a firm and enduring basis for increased trade with other countries. </para>
      <para>The Government recognises the fundamental importance of the farm sector to Australia's trade and to the prosperity of the whole Australian community. </para>
      <para>The report of the working group on rural policy will greatly assist the Government, the Parliament, the Australian Department of Agriculture and the community in establishing the principles which should be adopted towards a sound rural policy for Australia. </para>
      <para>Important measures on matters affecting the farm sector will cover the new wheat stabilisation plan, financial support for wool research and promotion, adjustment assistance and marketing arrangements for the dairying industry, continuing financial assistance for major water projects in Queensland and for beef roads in Queensland and Western Australia. </para>
      <para>In co-operation with the Governments of Queensland and Western Australia, the Government will press ahead with studies of the potential of important regions in northern Australia, including the Burdekin and Bowen Basin, north-western Queensland and the Pilbara and the Kimberley regions. </para>
      <para>An Australian Science Council will be established to assist the Government, the Parliament and the community to develop a coherent national role for science and technology in our modern society. </para>
      <para>Better transport is needed for the efficient development and use of Australia's resources. </para>
      <para>The Government proposes to legislate this year for the re-establishment of the Inter-State Commission. The Commission will play a major part in the reform and co-ordination of our national transport. </para>
      <para>Legislation will be introduced on the Australian National Railways and to ratify agreements with the States for the construction of new railway lines to Alice Springs and Adelaide and, subject to completion of the agreement, for a new urban railway line radiating from Parramatta. </para>
      <para>The Government will introduce legislation for a new Roads Assistance Scheme to provide assistance to the States over the next three years. </para>
      <para class="block">The Australian Government will in future take responsibility for constructing and maintaining a national roads system in those areas which fall within the Government's own constitutional responsibility. </para>
      <para>It is proposed to legislate for a national authority on road safety and standards. </para>
      <para>The Government intends to introduce legislation for a rationalised system of road and urban transport assistance to the States. The Government will introduce legislation to ratify agreements with all State Governments for the provision of financial assistance for selected urban public transport projects. </para>
      <para>Participation by the national Government for the first time in Australia's history in the modernisation and reconstruction of the urban transport systems is an essential part of the participation by my Government in the modernisation and reconstruction of Australia 's cities. </para>
      <para>Within the broad sweep of national priorities, my Government is determined to continue its commitments to rebuild our existing cities and to build new ones so that there will be more equal opportunities for all Australians wherever they choose to live or are obliged to live. </para>
      <para>My Government will promote these opportunities by continuing commitments to develop Land Commissions and new growth centres, the national sewerage program, area improvement programs, environment impact studies, and through the constant monitoring of resource allocation within our great urban areas. </para>
      <para>Parliament will be asked to approve legislation and administrative decisions reflecting the Government's view of the significance of the Australian Capital Territory as an area for initiatives in urban affairs and public participation in community affairs. </para>
      <para>Arising from the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate, my Governmentproposes to establish an Australian Heritage Commission. </para>
      <para>Legislation will be introduced to establish a National Parks and Wildlife Service. </para>
      <para>My Government regards the Great Barrier Reef as a precious part not only of Australia's heritage but of the world's heritage. The Great Barrier Reef will be reserved as a marine park. </para>
      <para>Legislation will be introduced to implement the Government's policy of ensuring that needs of the environment and the views of the public are fully considered in government decisions particularly in relation to projects under the control of, or funded by, the Australian Government. </para>
      <para>The Government is continuing to develop, in co-operation with the State Governments, an organisation to deal with natural disasters. </para>
      <para>The legislative program and the administrative decisions of the Australian Government represent the most concerted effort in Australia's history to promote, protect and preserve Australia's resources and to use those resources for the greatest benefit of all Australians. The primacy the Australian Government gives to our most precious resource- our children- remains undiminished. This finds special expression in the national Government's involvement in education. </para>
      <para>A major initiative in education during this Parliament will be the development and implementation of programs for the care and education of pre-school children. </para>
      <para>An Inquiry will be made into the place of the languages of major migrant groups in the school curriculum. Legislation will be introduced to establish a Curriculum Development Centre. </para>
      <para>During this Parliament the Government will be considering the Universities Commission's Report on Open Tertiary Education and the development of appropriate measures in this area. </para>
      <para>An Academic Salaries Tribunal will be established. </para>
      <para>My Government will continue its reconstruction of Australia's social security system. The National Rehabilitation and Compensation Committee under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodhouse of the New Zealand Court of Appeal has completed its report and it is now under consideration. An interim report of the National Superannuation Committee of Inquiry is also being studied. </para>
      <para>The next Budget will make further increases in social security and repatriation pension rates and take the next step in the abolition of the means test. </para>
      <para>It will also provide for increased assistance for the handicapped and disabled, further assistance for organisations conducting aged persons' homes and nursing homes and help for the homeless. </para>
      <para>Under new legislation, funds will be available through the Australian Assistance Plan for every region in Australia. </para>
      <para>The Government will continue to improve the health care of Australians in keeping with its constitutional responsibilities to provide hospital benefits and medical services. </para>
      <para>In addition to the two Health Insurance Bills twice rejected by the Senate during the 28th Parliament, a Bill will be introduced to regulate private health insurance associated with the Universal Health Insurance program. </para>
      <para>The Community Health Program will be further expanded. High priority will be given to a full examination of the Report on Hospitals prepared by the Hospitals and Health Services Commission. The Australian Government must play a greater role in the planning and organising of hospitals in Australia. If necessary, the Government itself will construct and operate hospitals in areas of need. </para>
      <para>The Medical Benefits scheme will be extended to cover consultations with optometrists. </para>
      <para>Legislation will be introduced to establish a Pharmaceutical Corporation to make, market and develop drugs. </para>
      <para>The Government recognises the link between the basic health and well-being of the Australian community and the opportunities for Australians to make better use of their increasing leisure. </para>
      <para>The Government will expand its program of grants to sporting and youth organisations and increase its assistance for the creation of community centres and for building of sport, recreation and tourist facilities. </para>
      <para>Bills will be introduced: to enable the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation to insure loans for tourist accommodation; to license travel agents; to provide financial assistance for tourist development projects through the Commonwealth Development Bank; and to enable the Australian Tourist Commission to undertake domestic tourist promotion. </para>
      <para>An Australian Film Commission will be established to foster and develop Australian film and television program making. The Broadcasting and Television Act will be amended to place beyond doubt the powers of the Broadcasting Control Board to expand opportunities for Australians to make their own radio and television programs. The introduction of frequency modulation broadcasting will also enhance these opportunities. The introduction of colour television on 1 March 1975 will increase opportunities for the sale of Australian-made programs overseas. The Government will re-introduce the Australia Council Bill and will bring forward legislation to establish the Australian National Gallery and the Australian Archives. Provision will also be made for a public lending right for Australian authors. </para>
      <para>My Government will submit to the Parliament a number of measures designed to reform the laws under which Australians live and to protect the rights of all Australians under those laws. </para>
      <para>The Family Law Bill will be re-submitted. </para>

      <para>Legislation will be re-introduced to create a Superior Court of Australia, a proposal initiated by the previous Government more than a decade ago. </para>
      <para>Legislation will be introduced to establish the office of Australian Ombudsman, together with Deputy Ombudsmen, having special responsibilities for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, and to establish a Defence Ombudsman. </para>
      <para>Legislation will be introduced for a Freedom of Information Act to give a right of access by members of the public to official documents, subject to appropriate safeguards. </para>

      <para>Legislation will be introduced to permit Australia to ratify the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which came into force in January 1969. Legislation will also be introduced to supersede certain provisions of the Queensland Aborigines Act and Torres Strait Islanders Act which are contrary to the principles embodied in the Racial Discrimination Convention and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

      <para class="block">Australian Government will not allow the overwhelming decision of the Australian people in the referendum of 1967 to be any longer denied or disregarded. </para>
      <para>My Government has accepted in principle the recommendations contained in the Second Report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission and following consultation with Northern Territory Aboriginals will legislate to give effect to its policy on granting land rights to these Australians. An Aboriginal Land Fund Bill will also be introduced to establish a Commission to operate the program of land purchase for or by Aboriginal communities. </para>

      <para>My Government is committed by the clearest pledges to continue substantial aid to a united Papua New Guinea before and after independence. Since Papua New Guinea achieved self-government in December 1973, the relationship between the governments of Australia and of Papua New Guinea has been based on the principles of equality, mutual respect and mutual co-operation. Pending the final decision of the House of Assembly to declare independence for Papua New Guinea, the Australian Government will conduct its relations with the Government of Papua New Guinea as a government of an independent nation to which Australia has certain special and inescapable obligations. </para>

      <para>Under the direction of the Minister for Defence, my Government is creating the most effective, mobile and professional defence force in Australia's peace-time history.

The Parliament will be asked to deal with legislation to complete the amalgamation of the former Service Departments. </para>
      <para>My Government will strive to ensure that its development aid programs make the highest possible contribution to raising the living standards in the developing world. Legislation introduced during the last Parliament for the creation of an Australian Development Assistance Agency will be re-introduced.

            <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr President,</inline>I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> on his election as  Chairman  of Committees. I know that he will discharge the responsibilities of his office without favour. He has occupied the position in the past and I believe that he has given satisfaction to the Senate. I thank those who supported my nomination. I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> and honourable senators generally that I will do everything possible to uphold the prestige of the Senate and to see that the decorum of the Senate is maintained to the advantage of the people of Australia. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MURPHY</inline>(New South WalesLeader of the Government in the Senate)- On behalf of the Government I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> on his re-election and elevation to this important office in the Senate. We all know that the office calls for impartiality and fairness. We would expect that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> would demonstrate that impartiality and fairness which is a characteristic of this very high office. The office calls in no small measure, as does that of the  President  of the Senate, for its occupant to detach himself from the kind of interchange and perhaps participation in debate which occurs among the rest of us. We trust and hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> will carry out that responsibility and we give him our best wishes in his doing so. </para>

          <para>- On behalf of the Opposition I offer our congratulations to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster.</inline> He takes up a very difficult task. We in this chamber still believe in having the Committee stage of the debate on a Bill, unlike another place where it has become almost an irrelevancy. It takes a great deal of ability and an enormous amount of patience for the  Chairman  to preside over that stage of a Bill. We saw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> in action in the previous Parliament; we know his capacity and we have great confidence that he will carry on as he did in the past. We are certain also, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that as your  deputy  he will do all he can to assist you and to stand in for you when you are engaged on other duties. We congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> and assure him of our co-operation. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DRAKE-BROCKMAN</inline>(Western Australia- Leader of the Australian Country Party in the Senate)- On behalf of my colleagues I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> on his re-appointment. When we nominated him for the position in March of this year we had great confidence in his ability to maintain the high standard set by previous Chairmen of Committees. I think his re-election today demonstrates that the Senate as a whole shares our confidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> and recognises that he has many qualities suited to such a responsible position. I am sure, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that he will give you all the support that he possibly can when you are not in the Chair and at other times. I wish <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> on behalf of his colleagues, a continuing success in the position which he holds. </para>
