I rise now to inform the Parliament that Australia will be represented at the <inline font-style="italic">service</inline> by His Excellency the Governor-General. His Excellency will leave for Paris today and will return to Australia as soon as possible after the service. </para>

        <para>Let me say at the outset that any differences we might have with the French Government are transcended by this tragic event which has befallen the French people. On such occasions we remember and reflect on the traditional and strong ties we have with France: Our common values, our democratic way of life and our respect for and affinities with the civilisation and cultural heritage that is France. All these things come to mind as we share with the French Government and people a common sorrow at the passing of a most distinguished world leader. </para>

            <para>Pompidou, who assumed the office of  President  of the French Republic on 20 June 1 969, had a daunting task in succeeding General De Gaulle. He did so with distinction, however, and became acknowledged as a statesman in his own right, not only within the context of Europe but on the world stage. But M. Pompidou was, above all, a Frenchman. He prided himself on his links with provincial France, particularly the Auvergne; but he nevertheless sought to represent the aspirations of all Frenchmen. He dedicated himself to the advancement of his country, whether through the propagation of the French language, through the modernisation of the economic and social conditions of life in France, or in directing personally the conduct of France's international diplomacy. The loss of such a distinguished leader will be sorely felt in France. </para>

          <para>- (Victoria- Leader of the Australian Democratic Labor Party)- by leave- I desire, on behalf of the Democratic Labor Party, to be associated with the statement of condolence to the French Government. I met M. Pompidou in France 2 years ago. He was a man of great personal charm and obviously of very great ability. He piloted his country through a period of considerable difficulty following the retirement of the late General Charles de Gaulle. France and the world generally owe a great debt of gratitude for the degree of stability he brought to that great country. We associate ourselves with the motion. </para>

              <para>-I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> for his interjection because it is about time some of this was set straight. Opposition Senators apparently think that they can come in here and ask questions on any subject matter at all; about what advice has been given by an Attorney-General or a Minister, about what their staff have done- and almost every time somebody goes to the toilet. This is not the object of question time in Parliament. As for the suggestion that a Minister is bound to give an answer, I say that he is not bound to give an answer. I have indicated already that it is none of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood's</inline> business what advice or assistance was given by my staff or myself. I have indicated that the person concerned, the Ambassador, has said that the document that he put in to the  President  was his document, edited, added to, amended and so forth by him. How it came into existence is none of the honourable senator's business. </para>

            <para>-There is no need for the honourable senator to make his great offers. I have consulted with the Prime Minister about the various matters here. I think that the position is reasonably clear, as I have indicated. As from not 14 March but 21 March- when, as I have already said, the matter came before the Executive Council and thereafter <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was informed of it- I did not expect or understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> would sit in the Senate again. I think that the Prime Minister has already indicated elsewhere that I took that view and expressed it as to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair's</inline> sitting in the Senate on Tuesday of this week. It is not a case of any 9 divisions. If the honourable senator thought that 1 was in some way pleased by the vote being against me on that occasion on Tuesday, I assure him that I was not. The suggestions that the honourable senator makes have no basis whatever. The person to whom he refers is a member of his own Party. </para>

            <para>- I remember well <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland asking me the question on 5 March last and my undertaking to discuss the matter with the  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. On Friday last I met with the commissioners of the ABC in Adelaide and, among other matters, raised with them <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Flower's</inline> case- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Flower,</inline> of course, having been an announcer in the temporary employ of the Commission. I received from the  Chairman  of the Commission, Professor Downing, an assurance that the Commission had taken into consideration all representations made to the Commission on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Flower's</inline> behalf by the industrial union covering his calling, namely, the ABC Staff Association. I particularly asked Professor Downing whether the Commission had given consideration to all aspects of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Flower's</inline> case. I was told that it had and that after a review of the facts the Commission had upheld the decision not to continue <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Flower's</inline> employment. Professor Downing told me that the Commission considered that in its opinion no injustice had been done and that the decision had been properly made in the first instance. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I asked the Commission whether it was intended to make public the reasons for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Flower's</inline> dismissal, but I was told by the Commission that it felt that this would create a bad industrial precedent. I am assured that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Flower</inline> was told by the Assistant Manager of the ABC's Canberra office that the major reason for his dismissal was that his work was not up to the required standards of the Commission. </para>
          <para>I am advised by the Commission that the tape to which the honourable senator has referred was not made available to the ABC Staff Association purely and simply because the tape has not been retained. In any event, I am assured by Professor Downing that termination of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Flower's</inline> services was not the result of this particular incident in isolation. The  Chairman  of the Commission has assured me that the decision of the Commission not to reverse the decision to terminate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Flower's</inline> services was made as a result of a review of several incidents which I am given to understand occurred over a period of time, and that in reaching its conclusion the Commission had before it a record of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Flower's</inline> employment with the Commission, a report from the ABC's Canberra manager, copies of a letter writ tern by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Flower</inline> himself to the  Chairman  of the ABC, and a letter written to the ABC's General Manager by the ABC Staff Association. I am advised by Professor Downing that the Commission gave the matter very great and detailed consideration and, after reviewing all the circumstances, decided not to reverse the earlier decision. </para>

            <para>- I have looked at the first paragraph of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair's</inline> letter and I prefer to disregard it. All I can say in answer to the honourable senator is that when the Senate is sitting I am never more than 100 feet from this chamber, except occasionally when I leave this area to discuss with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> matters of mutual concern. In those circumstances, upon arrival in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker's</inline> office I telephone my staff advising that I am there. If I am delayed by discussions with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> I contact my office several times to ensure that no honourable senator has expressed a wish to see me. On Tuesday I was in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker's</inline> office for a period of about 40 minutes. </para>

            <para>- There is a long history in relation to this matter involving the States. The previous Australian Government reached agreement on the production of eggs in Australia under a quota system. There was considerable opposition and disagreement in regard to the quota which was allotted to the Australian Capital Territory. I can assure the Senate that the Minister for the Capital Territory has no intention of breaking the agreement which has been entered into. Legislation will be introduced to cover the production of eggs in the Australian Capital Territory in accordance with the agreement that was reached by the Australian Agricultural Council. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable senator's questions is yes. Since the establishment of the faculty there have been discussions with the dean of the medical faculty at Flinders University. As a result of these discussions, it has now been arranged that medical students will have access to patients in the repatriation hospitals in their first year of training, rather than, as at the present time, in their third year of training. Secondly, they have been given access to the rehabilitation facilities of the hospital and this would include a number of beds in the rehabilitation sector. </para>

Secondly, on what date did  His Excellency  communicate with the State Governors? Thirdly, did the communication to the Governor of Queensland refer to the existence, or even to the possibility, of an extra vacancy? Fourthly, if no reference was made to an extra vacancy, was this because there was clearly no vacancy existing or was it an attempt to conceal information from the State Governor? Fifthly, if the Attorney-General then considered, as he now claims he did, that a vacancy had been caused by a sitting senator's self-disqualification, why did he, as the Commonwealth Crown law officer, not take whatever action was appropriate to have the  President  notify the Queensland State Governor that a vacancy had occurred? </para>

            <para>-About 12 months ago the British Broadcasting Corporation adopted a public access arrangement which has been very well received in the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the Australian Broadcasting Commission has given a lot of consideration to such programs and last night for the first time public access programs came to air in Australia. Two programs were put to air, one connected with freeway development and the other connected with people who are interested in a certain section of the arts. About 350 letters were received by the Commission from various organisations expressing <inline font-style="italic">interest</inline> in obtaining access to the public airwaves. About 150 applications have been received from a large cross section of organisations throughout Australia. I understand that arrangements have already been made for about forty or fifty groups to have time made available to them by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </para>

            <para>-Of course what I did was correct. I have informed the Senate about what happened at the Executive Council proceedings on 2 1 March. That was a Thursday. The honourable senator will recall that the Senate did not meet after that, that there was a break of some 10 days and we came back on the Tuesday. Even before we met on the Tuesday, not only was I aware, but I would imagine the whole Senate was aware- I think the  President  indicated that he might not have been officially aware, but the Prime Minister had announced it to the nationthat <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> had been appointed as Ambassador. What happened was as much known to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> and to others as it was to me. It is absurd, all this nonsense and the suggestion whether I should allow him to come in. It had been announced that he had been appointed Ambassador to Ireland. </para>

            <para>-I think that if the honourable senator would care to cast his mind over the advices that have been given in the matter and there were other advices given- he will see that the question relates to 2 1 March. While there might be some possibility as to an earlier matter, after 2 1 March the view was taken that a vacation occurred in his office. Whatever might have been done and could have been done or whether it was technically the right procedure or not to put a resignation in, the view taken on a close examination of the matter is that there is a vacation of office. If a resignation had been put in then, I suppose that no one would have cared much about it, and that could have happened. But it did not happen, and the question is when did the vacation of office take place under the Constitution. In the Government's view it took place then- that at least by 21 March this vacation of office had occurred. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> is asking what should have happened from then on. One would expect and understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> would act in a certain way. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> is familiar with the circumstance that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair's</inline> appointment was publicly announced not only by himself but also by the Prime Minister of Australia early on Tuesday. </para>

I remind the Minister that the substance of the article indicates that former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was virtually held against his will by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> and other members of the Australian Country Party in the office occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell.</inline> Can the Attorney-General inform the Parliament whether the former senator could possibly cast a valid vote in the division on Tuesday evening when, for all practical purposes, he was forced to enter the Senate under escort and left the chamber in the same manner? </para>

              <para>- I rise on a point of order. Are the question and the answer consistent with standing order 418, which states that no statements which are offensive or reflect upon members of this place should be made? My submission is that this allegation is based upon a newspaper comment, which is as serious an imputation as any which can be made. My submission is that it is the sort of reflection which ought not to be allowed. If a senator wishes to make such an allegation the traditional forms of this Parliament should be availed of, because the matter affects the whole Senate. </para>

              <para>- Yes. I would agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> on one thing, and that is that the imputation in the story is of the most serious nature. It implies obstruction of and interference with the senator concerned. I agree that that is one of the most grave reflections which can be made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> regards it as a serious imputation. So do 1. 1 would think that the Senate would. If it is correct, it is a disgraceful episode, and I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> ought to be answering whether it is correct. </para>

That is the first matter. As to the second matter, I was present in the Chair and I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> in his place during the division. As to the third question, I never inquire into the private monetary affairs of honourable senators because that would be an impertinence on my part; but this morning, in view of the matters that are engaging the attention of the Senate at the present moment, I asked whether in fact <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair's</inline> proper emoluments under statute had been paid up until 3 1 March. I have not had that information, but I assume by virtue of the fact that no one in the Senate secretariat knew that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was not a senator that the normal processes would have been applied, that is, with a warrant being sent to the Treasury and an automatic remission to his bank account of the emoluments to which he was entitled. </para>

            <para>Shortly after I assumed this office the Professional Musicians Union of Australia made representations to the Australian Broadcasting Commission and to me for a new orchestral site in Brisbane. Recently the Australian Broadcasting Commission informed me that, in the absence of any firm decision by the Queensland Government on the establishment of a performing arts centre, the Commission could not delay any longer progress on the planning for an orchestral studio and music complex for the Queensland Symphony Orchestra which, I understand, is being planned for what is known as the Ferry Street site in Brisbane. All necessary approvals have been given to proceed with this project and it has been included in the ABC's 1 974-75 works program. Apart from the fact that there has been no approval from the Queensland Government for the construction of a performing arts centre, the Commission advised me that it has received information that the land on which the ABC's complex would be constructed within the general area of the performing arts centre its land owned by the Australian Post Office, that the Post Office itself is anxious to develop and use that land and that it would not release it to the ABC. It is the urgent desire of the Commission to proceed with the establishment of the orchestral studio on the Ferry Street site. I understand that it is expected that construction will take place over a period of 2 years and that the facilities should become available about March 1976. </para>

            <para>- As I indicated before, in matters such as this it is possible sometimes that resignations might be tendered or expected and no one worries about the actual time of vacation of office. In this case, because of the manoeuvres that were taken by the Queensland Government, it was necessary for the Commonwealth Government to determine the position with some exactitude. That has been done. Advice given to the Government is that certainly after 21 March the senator had ceased to be a member of the Senate, having vacated his office by reason of the provisions contained in sections 44 and 45 of the Constitution. I am unaware of precisely what might have been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> but in our view it would not touch the position that applies. If there is a vacation by force of the Constitution in the light of the events that have occurred then that is an automatic vacation and that is the end of the matter. </para>

            <para>- As far as I am aware they are the relevant documents. The documents came from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Foreign Affairs. The advisers of the Government looked at them. As to whether they are all the documents, I do not know. The honourable senator says 'all the documents'. As far as the advisers of the Government were concerned these were the relevant documents. To take one example, who knows whether there might not have been 2 or 3 communications with the Government of Ireland? But the relevant documents were produced. As far as I am concerned, the documents were asked for, the advisers of the Government went and got the documents, and I produced what was made available to me. I do not know of any other document that is relevant. </para>

This has been the usual thing that has gone on over the years. But I have noticed over the last couple of days that that appointment has raised more than ordinary interest in the Senate and that these things are being put under the microscope and talked about. The situation, as I understand it- I could be technically wrong on this as these are things to which Ministers generally do not apply their minds in detail because they have been going on for so long- is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brennan</inline> is the Ambassador to Ireland at the moment and the Ambassador designate to Ireland is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gair.</inline></para>

            <para>- The method of appointment of ambassadors has been traditional. A lot of fuss has occurred here because obviously some people do not like this appointment. But other persons from within and without Parliament have been appointed ambassadors. It is traditional that these appointments should not be publicly announced until the matters have been dealt with. It would be the height of wrongness, for example, to indicate that someone had been offered or was accepting an appointment until approval had been granted from the other government concerned. The honourable senator knows that. As for the suggestion that he may have been appointed Ambassador to Brazil, I only hope that he would be so appointed. Is this in the nature of an offer by him for the post? </para>

            <para>- The answer to that is no. There ought to be a bit of common sense in this place. Here is a person who is in this place appointed as an ambassador. The appointment is made and the matters as pertaining to that are kept confidential. Leaving aside questions of technicalities of vacation of place or resignation, quite obviously, in any man's language, after the matter had reached the stage that it reached after 2 1 March this year, under no circumstances, considering technicalities or otherwise, should <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> have been coming into this chamber. No one would expect him to do so. At no stage have I done other than what I thought was right and proper and in the interests of this Government. </para>

In this morning's issue of the 'Australian', an article appears which refers to events which took place yesterday in the Senate and the production by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> of a letter written to you by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gair.</inline> A paragraph which appears in the article reads as follows: </para>

            <para>- Yes. My personal explanation concerns accusations that have been made against me by the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy).</inline> The first point I want to bring to the attention of the Senate is that on the night in question, Tuesday night, there were no bar or dining room facilities available in Parliament House. 1 invited, as I often do, people around to my office. Those whom I have invited have included members of the Australian Labor Party. On this occasion I happened to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> whether he would like a drink and he accepted. He had not eaten a meal all day and so he had a meal there. Various people came into the room at different times and went out. This is what usually happens. </para>

            <para>-They were not all members of the Country Party at all. It was open to anybody. Whilst this was going on, I left my office with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> when a division was called. I was not hijacking him as Government senators would have us believe. He was free to come and go at any time. It must be the greatest joke of all time to think that anyone could tie down <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair.</inline> I think that Government senators really underrate him in these circumstances. I was unaware as to whether he had put in a letter of resignation or whether he intended to put one in. The only information I had, which was around the Parliament, was that he was putting one in next day. I object to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> did not consult with me as to whether this newspaper article that he referred to was true before he attacked me in the Senate. I think that honourable senators have rights. I have always thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> was one who upheld the rights of honourable senators. I deplore the fact that he did not ask me whether everything was correct before making accusations against me. No doubt, this action is just a smokescreen to cover up the deplorable business that is going on concerning this matter. </para>

            <para>- Yes. The honourable senator said that I have made accusations against him. I have made no accusations against him. The accusations were referred to by the honourable senator in a question referring to a newspaper article. I said that if the article was correct, it was a disgraceful matter. I understood this also to be the view of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition who said that they were grave imputations or something of this nature. I said that the honourable senator ought to give his explanation to the Senate. I was not there. I was not in a position to make any accusation. The accusation was made in a public newspaper. That is the position and it ought to be understood. </para>

              <para>- In reading the statement when I use the first person singular pronoun I am, of course, referring to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard).</inline> It will be recalled that in April 1 973 I announced the establishment of an independent Committee to undertake a comprehensive review of the Citizen Military Forces. My intention was to initiate for the first time in the history of the CMF a thorough review of its role, the circumstances in which it might be used in the future, its organisation, conditions of service, training, title and its geographic disposition. This review was long overdue. The Committee was led by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr T.</inline> B. Millar, Director of the Australian Institute of International Affairs and a former officer in both the Regular Army and the CMF. The other members of the Committee were: Major-General D. B. Dunstan, formerly Army Chief of Material and now Commander of Field Force Command; Major-General K. D. Green, a recently retired CMF Divisional Commander, who is Secretary of the Premier's Department of Victoria; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr W.</inline> A. Jarvis, a sociologist from the University of New South Wales; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> G. O 'Loghlin, a consulting engineer and former CMF officer, and  Colonel La. Simpson of the CMF, a chartered town planner and surveyor from Hobart. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>At the time the inquiry was set up, I indicated that I was aware of serious problems of morale in the CMF. These problems were, and of course still are, a cause for concern. They are, to a large extent, the result of the lack of interest given the CMF by successive Liberal-Country Party governments. The abortive re-organisation into pen tropic divisions in the early 1960s played havoc with the organisation. However, the greatest damage resulted from the previous government's attitude to the CMF during the IndoChina war. Indeed the Citizen Military Forces were a casualty of that war. They suffered not at the hands of a foreign foe but of their own government. In 1964, legislation was enacted to permit the CMF to be called out for continuous service, by proclamation, in a 'time of defence emergency.' However in the Vietnam conflict, conscription was used to provide junior officers and men when the size of the volunteer Regular Army was found inadequate for the scale of involvement which that government sought. As the report says: 'There is within the Citizen Military Forces, considerable resentment of the fact that they were not called to active service in Vietnam, and a general lack of confidence in the national intention to employ them short of a full scale mobilization, which is seen as a remote possibility. This lack of purpose is a fundamental cause for many of the present problems of the organisation. ' </para><para>This Government will never deploy conscripts while volunteer reservists, willing to serve are unused. The previous Government increased the injury and compounded its failure to keep faith with the CMF by making service in that organisation an alternative to conscription. Thus an organisation made up of people willing to serve their country in war were burdened with a large influx of recruits many of whom were motivated by a desire to avoid active service. The CMF deserves better than that. It is a vital factor in Australia's ability to expand our ground forces, should a threat develop. The Committee has undertaken an extensive examination of the CMF. It has obtained evidence from a wide range of sources including the general public. It has travelled to all Australian States, visiting units of the CMF. Some members made overseas visits as well. The Committee also conducted surveys of the attitudes and views of employers, Trade Unions, the public at large, and current and ex-members of the CMF. </para><para>The members of the Committee are to be highly congratulated and thanked for their efforts in producing the report. I am aware that they have all made many personal sacrifices in order to achieve the results I place before you. This report will serve as an invaluable basis for decisions about the Citizen Forces, now and in the future. The CMF Committee of Inquiry's report argues persuasively for the need to make substantial changes to the role, organisation and conditions of service for the CMF. In this regard a large number of recommendations have been put forward, many of which will be implemented quickly, but some will require further consideration by the Government. Some will require legislative amendments. </para><para>Regarding the Committee's general commentary on strategic factors, although there is much in the report with which everybody could agree, some judgments differ from those of the Government and its Service, Defence and Foreign Affairs advisers. Insofar as the Committee's recommendations depend on these judgments, this aspect will need further consideration. The Government accepts the need for change to update the role, organisation and conditions of service of our citizen forces, which with the Australian Regular Army combine to form Australia's ground force capability. That there is a need for change is not surprising when one considers the history of the CMF against the background of other development which has occurred since its creation in its current form in 1948. In the first instance, the strategic outlook is vastly different today from what it was in 1948. Secondly, there have been large changes in the size of our population, its skills and its distribution. Thirdly, there have been major developments in our industrial base which add to our potential for mobilisation. Fourthly, there have been a number of important changes to the size, organisation, composition, experience and pay and conditions of the Regular Army. These changes have not all been taken into account for the CMF. </para><para>The current position with the CMF is that it has no clear role. Its organisation is no longer appropriate to act properly as a reserve for the Regular Army, many of its units are not viably manned. Therefore I particularly welcome the Committee's attention to the provision of a meaningful role for the Army Reserve. It suggests that the Army Reserve be responsible with the Regular Army for the ground defence of the Australian continent, that existing roles in defence emergency or mobilization be retained, that in the event of commitment beyond the resources of the Regular Army the Army Reserve be activated as the next force to be employed and that the Army Reserve have a role in civil emergencies. There is no practical alternative to the re-shaping of the CMF, if it is to be re-vitalised and be of value to our Defence effort. The changes to be made by the Government will be welcomed by those who are genuinely concerned with the need to protect our national interests. As honourable senators will appreciate, the Government has had only a short time to consider the wide-ranging recommendations of the Committee. The Army and the Defence Force Development Committee have not yet had time to consider the report in the depth it deserves. The Report, including the manpower and cost implications, requires further study and this is being pressed forward. </para><para>At this stage, I have approved the Committee's proposals for: (i) The CMF is to be more closely integrated with the Regular Army. Its units and formations are to be allocated to the Functional Command appropriate to their task, i.e. to Field Force Command, Logistic Command or Training Command; (ii) a Major-General CMF officer to be appointed as assistant commander Field Force Command, a Major-General CMF officer to be appointed assistant commander Logistics Command, and CMF Officers of the rank of Brigadier to be appointed assistant commanders at Training Command and at the First Division. The times at which these senior appointments are made will be directly related to the re-organisation of the present CMF Divisional structure; (iii) a CMF Major-General to be appointed as Inspector General at Army Office; (iv) a Regular Army Major-General to head a Reserve Branch at Army Office. The creation of the new Branch and this appointment will ensure that additional impetus is given to the re-organisation proposals. </para><para>The title 'Citizen Military Forces' is to be changed to a name which more appropriately reflects its basic role and function- the 'Australian Army Reserve', or more simply 'Army Reserve'. The new Australian Army Reserve is to incorporate other Army reserves as well as the present CMF- the Regular Army Emergency Reserve, the Regular Army Reserve, the Citizen Military Forces and the Retired List of former Regular and CMF officers. These changes reflect the Government's determination that we must have one Australian Army in the 1970s- a Regular component and a Reserve component. The acceptance of this concept, which the committee calls the Total Force concept, will give the citizen soldier a much clearer understanding of his role and place in our defence forces; it will mean that his training, function, equipment and other support will closely resemble that of the Regular Army. </para><para>The Committee of Inquiry has obtained considerable evidence which demonstrates the current impractical situation of grossly undermanned CMF units. The fact is that at present many of these units are so deficient in strength that they cannot satisfactorily train. Accordingly, as proposed by the Committee, I accept as a matter of principle that units must be manned at viable levels although I hesitate to apply the suggested requirement of 70 per cent of establishment across the board without first examining whether there should not be differing requirements for different types of units. This means that it will be necessary to amalgamate a large number of units. At present the CMF has some 900 units, and over 90 per cent of these are poorly manned. I assure honourable senators that we will endeavour to do this in a way which will preserve the best traditions and local identities of CMF units while taking account of the present and future practicabilities of having a viable reserve Army. </para><para>These changes could come as a disappointment in some ways to members of some individual units affected. The Government is sensitive to these feelings. However, changes are necessary if the Reserve is to be more than a paper army and be able to undertake the tasks it might be called on to carry out in the future. It is futile to continue the current practice of retaining battalions when in fact the reality is that the unit existing is something substantially less. Also, these changes must come because it is clear that many young men leave the CMF as they find the training boring, repetitive and unrealistic. The Committee has found that one very important reason for this is that units are so badly undermanned that it is not possible to provide realistic training at the level required. </para><para>The Committee has recommended a number of other important organisation changes including the creation of an Army Reserve Council and a Committee of Employer Support. I recognise there would be value in having such bodies, but before finally approving their establishment I wish further consideration to be given to their precise composition and role. I have ordered that this be done expeditiously. </para><para>Turning to the question of pay and conditions of service, the Committee has recommended a large number of improvements and changes. I accept the need for improvements and I want improvements implemented as quickly as possible. The Committee's recommendations on pay and conditions will be given careful consideration in the appropriate Government machinery. Of course, such matters involve other portfolios as well as defence, and it will be necessary for me to consult my colleague the Treasurer and other appropriate Ministers. </para><para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>let me assure you that there must be no doubt that this Government is determined to improve the CMF. It will give this country a reorganised CMF which is not only attractive to the young men and women who wish to serve in it but with the Regular Army will also provide a viable base for expansion should this be necessary in the future. Let me be quite clear that the CMF- in future to be known as the Army Reserve- is an essential and honoured component of the Australian Army. The Committee will present to me in a few weeks' time a separate report on the school cadets. I shall table this at an appropriate time. </para></speech>

          <para class="block">This Bill re-introduces, with improvements, the Racial Discrimination Bill 1973, which was introduced into the Senate on 21 November 1973. The purpose of the Bill is to make racial discrimination unlawful in Australia. It implements into Australian law the obligations contained in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It is recognised in this Convention that any doctrine of superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and without any justification. Seventy-five countries have already ratified the Convention and the Bill will enable Australia to become a party to the Convention. </para>
          <para>The basic framework of the 1973 Bill has been retained. The Bill will make it unlawful for a person to do an act involving discrimination based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which impairs the enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms. The Bill guarantees equality before the law without discrimination based on race or national origin. It will make it impossible to deny rights to members of a particular race of national origin, where those rights have been given to persons of another race or a different national origin. </para>
          <para>The Bill goes on to deal in greater detail with discrimination in the enjoyment of rights on grounds of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. It deals with discrimination so far as it concerns access to places and facilities, the provision of land, housing and other accommodation, the provision of goods and services, the right to join trade unions and employment. </para>
          <para>As was the case with the 1973 Bill, machinery to enforce the elimination of racial discrimination forms an important part of the legislation. The Bill sets out legal remedies that may be sought by an aggrieved person before the courts and offences of inciting racial disharmony are created. An Australian Race Relations Commissioner will be established to investigate alleged breaches of the Act and endeavour to achieve a settlement by conciliation. Where this cannot be achieved, the Commissioner will have power to commence legal proceedings on behalf of the aggrieved person. A Race Relations Council will be established to make recommendations on the action that should be taken to bring about the elimination of racial discrimination in Australia. </para>
          <para>I have mentioned that this Bill incorporates some improvements to the legislation that was introduced in 1973. The main changes made to the 1973 Bill fall into 4 categories. In the first place, the Bill has been extended to deal with discrimination against persons on the ground that they are immigrants. The previous Bill applied only to discrimination that is made on the grounds of race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. This is the basis on which most discrimination is made against migrant people and the form of discrimination dealt with by the Convention against Racial Discrimination. However, I have decided that it would be desirable for the Bill to deal also with discrimination made against a person purely on the ground that he is an immigrant, and the Bill has been so extended. </para>
          <para>Secondly, the provisions relating to the Australian Race Relations Commissioner have been revised. There has been some criticism of the provisions of the earlier Bill giving a commissioner compulsory evidence-gathering powers of the kind that are to be found in a royal commissioner and in other pieces of legislation. The New Zealand race relations legislation contains similar powers. There is much to be said for the inclusion of provisions of this nature, to enable issues to be assessed, to assist in the achieving of a settlement and to reduce the need for expensive litigation. However, I have decided that the provisions should be deleted to ensure that emphasis is placed on the Commissioner's primary role, that of mediation and conciliation. The Bill has therefore been amended to further clarify this important role. </para>
          <para>Thirdly, additions have been made to the functions of the Race Relations Council to reinforce its role with respect to the promotion of education and research. The Council's role will encompass the areas of educational programs, the promotion of studies and research programs, the publication and dissemination of material to assist in the elimination of racial discrimination and the promotion of understanding, tolerance and friendship among racial or ethnic groups. </para>
          <para>Finally, amendments have been made to the jurisdictional provisions of the Bill. The Bill invests the Superior Court of Australia with jurisdiction to hear matters instituted under the Act and, as from a date fixed by proclamation, State and Territory Courts will also be vested with jurisdiction to hear such matters. This will enable the Superior Court to establish guidelines for the operation of the legislation and will provide a ready means of extending jurisdiction to courts in country areas. These provisions will not prevent any court from exercising jurisdiction in respect of a matter arising under the Act in other proceedings before the court. The Bill also contains provisions for the removal to the Superior Court of matters arising under the Act in Territory courts or State courts, other than the Supreme Court. Until the Superior Court comes into operation, temporary jurisdiction will be exercised by the Australian Industrial Court. </para>
          <para>The changing of community attitudes and the promotion of understanding, tolerance and friendship among racial or ethnic groups will form an extremely important part of the Government 's program for the elimination of racial discrimination. For too long has Australia isolated itself from these problems. It will be necessary for both the Government and the community to increase its awareness of the complexity of race relations. Australia must approach this problem with a sense of national unity to ensure that prejudice and racialism do not form any part of our national identity. I have observed on another occasion that anti-discrimination laws cannot operate in a vacuum. They must be accompanied by positive Government programs designed to bridge the gaps that result in racial tension. These programs must enlist the support of the community because public awareness and the changing of community attitudes will be of vital importance in achieving the objectives of the Government's policy. </para>
          <para>The Bill now before the Senate will provide a focal point for the realisation of these goals. The existence of the legislation will have a great educational value. The proscribing of acts of racial discrimination, will of itself, assist in reducing social pressures that result in discrimination. The legislation will not only provide important remedies that are not at present to be found in our law; it will also provide a framework within which broader social issues, as well as individual injustices, can be tackled. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para>This Bill is designed primarily to amend the Wool Industry Act 1972-73 to provide for financing the projected cost of programs of wool research and promotion and to finance the marketing administrative costs of the Australian Wool Corporation during the 3 years commencing in July 1974. So far as research is concerned, the program represents only a part of the total research effort from which the wool industry derives benefit, but the provisions of the Bill will ensure the continuation of arrangements which have a long history in the wool industry. </para>
          <para>When the Wool Industry Act was amended last year, to provide for the financing of the wool research and promotion activities and the marketing administrative expenses for 1973-74, it was stated that the Government would be examining the whole question of the financing of research and promotion together with the need for longer-term forward programs beyond 1973-74. Honourable senators will recall that in introducing the amending legislation last year, I outlined the problems inherent in forward programming of research and promotion activities because of unpredictable and uncertain changes in wool income, and the effect of inescapable increases in salaries and other costs. </para>
          <para>The Government has since reviewed the problems of co-ordinating, programming and financing wool research and promotion, and has decided on the arrangements for a 3-year forward program commencing on 1 July this year. </para>
          <para>The Government approached the overall question of research and promotion expenditure with a view to taking account of the following major factors: Adequacy of the co-ordination and planning of research and promotion; the desirability of forward programs of research and promotion for particular periods; the overall philosophy that the beneficiaries of research and promotion programs should bear the greater proportion of total costs of those programs. </para>
          <para>Budgets for appropriate programs of research and promotion for each of the 3 years commencing in 1974-75 have been developed in consultation with the Australian Wool Corporation, and, through the Corporation, with the International Wool Secretariat, with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and with the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. The views of wool growers on these programs are directed through the Corporation and achieve considerable force. The cost of these programs, together with the estimated costs associated with the administration of the marketing activities of the Corporation, and inclusive of an allowance for estimated wage and cost increases, amounts to $44.2m in 1974-75, $49.1m in 1975-76 and $53.1m in 1976-77. The program of research and promotion will be financed jointly by contributions from wool growers and the Government. The cost of marketing administration will be borne entirely by the industry. 1 will refer to major provisions of this Bill under the 3 main headings of research, promotion and marketing administrative costs of the AWC. I will then refer briefly to the wool tax which is levied on growers to provide for their financial contribution. </para>
          <para class="block">Research </para>
          <para>The extent of the Government's involvement in the financing of the research program has been carefully examined, and it is considered that whilst rural producers benefit directly from many of the results of rural research, the Australian community, in general, also benefits in many ways from this research activity. Benefits accrue, for example, through more assured food and fibre supplies as a result of productivity increases in the rural sector. Further, research programs in agricultural and biological sciences often have broad implications for the quality of the environment generally, and for the maintenance of the productive capacity of renewable resources. </para>
          <para>Recognising that the benefits of research are so widely distributed, the Government has decided that it would be appropriate for a greater share of the cost to be borne by a contribution from public funds than has been the case in the past. In other words, the Government has decided to increase its share of the cost of the research programs financed from the Wool Research Trust Fund. Accordingly, the Government has decided that it will contribute three-quarters of the cost of approved programs of wool research, to be financed through the Wool Research Trust Fund, during the second and third years of the forthcoming triennium. Wool producers will be asked to finance the remaining one quarter. In order that there is adequate warning of these changed arrangements, the present cost sharing arrangement will be continued for 1974-75. </para>
          <para class="block">Promotion </para>
          <para>With regard to wool promotion, the Government has carefully studied the promotion activities of the International Wool Secretariat and the Australian Wool Corporation. It is agreed that there are strong economic arguments in favour of wool promotion expenditure and the benefits of promotion do spread to groups other than wool growers. In addition the Government recognises the need for continual development and improvement of the technical processing properties of wool as a fibre and the promotion of these advantages at all stages in the marketing chain. In this way the demand for wool is influenced, both absolutely and in relation to competing fibres. It is the Government's judgment, however, that the balance of arguments concerning the distribution of benefits from promotion differs from that for research. The benefits from promotion activity accrue more directly to producers than to other members of the community, and accordingly it is considered that wool growers themselves should make the major financial commitment to promotion expenditure. On this basis the Government has decided to finance one quarter of the projected wool promotion budgets, leaving to wool growers the responsibility of financing the balance. Again, in order to ensure adequate advance notice of the changed arrangements for financing the promotion programs, the Government has agreed to defer implementation of the new funding basis until 1975-76. Accordingly, for 1974-75, the Government will continue to contribute on an equal basis with wool growers towards the cost of both research and promotion. </para>
          <para class="block">Marketing Administrative Costs </para>
          <para>The administrative cost of discharging the marketing functions of the Australian Wool Corporation is currently met in total from part of the proceeds of the wool tax. This arrangement is to continue. Prior to 1973-74, these expenses were met by a charge levied by the Australian Wool Corporation, and its predecessor organisation, on shorn wool sold at auction by brokers. In 1973-74, this charge was incorporated into the wool tax and applied over all shorn wool sold. The operative rate of tax therefore incorporates a component related to the financing of marketing administrative costs. To summarise the effect of the decisions outlined above, programs of wool research and promotion, and the financing of the marketing administrative costs of the Australian Wool Corporation during the 3 years 1 974-75 to 1976-77, have been established at the following levels: </para>
          <para class="block">Funds to meet the expenditure will be provided on the following basis: </para>
          <para class="block">The Government will contribute on the basis of maximum amounts of $22m in 1974-75, $20m in 1975-76 and $21m in 1976-77. These amounts have been rounded upwards so as to provide a small margin for administrative convenience in the detailed allocation of the funds. Any benefit of the rounding will accrue to the industry. </para>

          <para>Wool growers' contributions are raised by means of the wool tax. A question of importance, therefore, is the level of the tax for the next 3 years, and particularly for 1974-75. At present the wool tax is set at 2.4 per cent of the value of shorn wool. It can be calculated that on the basis of a total seasonal return from shorn wool of about $ 1,000m, that is slightly below last year's high level, there would be no need to increase the rate of tax in order to provide sufficient finance to meet the budget in 1974-75. However, should the return from shorn wool decline to the order of $850m for instance, then a levy of 2.75 per cent would be required. In view of the fluctuations often experienced in wool returns, the Government has decided that it would be prudent to raise the existing rate of wool tax to 2.75 per cent for 1974-75. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> is making arrangements for the necessary changes to the Wool Tax Regulations. Because of the conservative basis on which probable tax income for 1974-75 has been estimated, it is possible that a tax of 2.75 per cent will result in some surplus above the amount required for funding purposes during 1974-75, but any surplus would oe credited to the Wool Research Trust Fund where it would be carried forward to help finance expenditure in future years. I should make it clear that moneys placed in the Wool Research Trust Fund may be used only for expenditure on approved wool research, and thus there is full assurance for growers who contribute tax that money placed in the Fund will not be used for other purposes. </para>
          <para>The Wool Tax Acts provide for a maximum rate of tax of 3 per cent. The present operative rate is 2.4 per cent. The increased rate which will apply as from 30 June next is thus still below the maximum rate already provided for. Depending on future movements in wool production and wool prices, it may be necessary to vary the rate of tax in subsequent years. I have discussed with the Australian Wool Industry Conference the financing and programming arrangements for the triennium. The conference, through its Chairman, has indicated agreement with the forward planning principles and accepted the advisability of the increased rate of wool tax which will bie levied during the coming financial year. </para>
          <para>I now turn to the specific amendments of the Wool Industry Act 1972-73, which are required in terms of the Government's decision, and to a number of amendments of a machinery nature which it is convenient to make at this time. The Bill provides for amendments to Part I of the principal Act by the deletion of references to the Interim  Chairman  of the Australian Wool Corporation. The permanent  Chairman  having assumed office, the position of Interim  Chairman  cannot be filled again. The various references to the Office of Interim  Chairman  in other parts of the Principal Act are also removed. Section 83 (2a) of the principal Act is amended to provide for a continuation of the existing arrangements whereby the Minister, after consultation with the Australian Wool Industry Conference, determines the total amount of Wool Tax to be paid to the Corporation in each year. The balance of tax receipts is paid into the Wool Research Trust Fund. Section 84a of the principal Act is amended to provide for payment to the Corporation and to the Wool Research Trust Fund of the Government contributions for the triennium commencing in 1974-75. Clauses have been included in recognition of relevant provisions of the Remuneration Tribunal Act, 1973, which relate to the remuneration of statutory office holders. </para>
          <para>The Government's commitment to contribute to the 3-year program of wool research and promotion will provide an immediate and sure base on which forward programs can be developed. The Government's POliCY in relation to the continuation of assistance for wool research and promotion beyond June 1977 will be determined in the light of reports by the Industries Assistance Commission on the question of Government assistance for rural research and promotion generally. The present funding arrangements for wool research and promotion will terminate on 30 June next It is essential, therefore, in the interests of the wool industry, that this amending legislation to provide for the continuation of the funding arrangements be enacted prior to that date. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Webster)-</inline> Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)- </para>
          <para class="block">Honourable senators will recall that in her speech at the opening of this second session of the Twenty-eighth Parliament,  Her  Majesty, the Queen, foreshadowed the Government's intention to introduce this Bill. Since its establishment in 1967 the Australian Tourist Commission has operated within its given charter of the encouragement of visits to Australia and travel in Australia by people from other countries. </para>
          <para>In 1968, the year following the establishment of the Commission, some 237,000 short term visitors came to Australia from overseas. In the same period, short term departures from Australia totalled some 252,000. That is a difference of some 15,000 between arrivals and departures. During the same period our foreign exchange earnings from spendings of overseas visitors amounted to $98m whereas, on the debit side $150m was spent outside Australia by people departing this country on a short term basis. This left a travel gap of $52m. Between 1968 and 1971 the travel gap maintained a steady upwards pattern. For instance by the end of 1971 it had increased to $74m. In 1872, however, it increased dramatically to $ 1 76m. While in that year the number of short term visitors increased by 9.7 per cent over the previous year, there was a significant decline on the visitor growth rates of 14.9 per cent and 22.7 per cent respectively, experienced in 1970 and 1971. </para>
          <para>While this situation can, in general terms be explained by currency ajustments, the cessation of the United States Rand R program to Australia which terminated on 31 December 1 97 1 and in some cases by an uncompetitive fare situation from our major markets, there are no indications that the position is improving, nor can one be optimistic that it will improve of its own accord. For instance, based on current estimates for the year ended 31 December 1973 about 319,000 short term visitors came to Australia and short term departures amounted to about 460,000. In money terms in the same period, receipts amounted to $139m and spendings by Australians travelling overseas as short term visitors were $359m, a staggering gap of $220m- an increase of 25 per cent over the previous year. The Government believes this to be a serious situation and while, at this moment, Australia does not have a balance of payments problem the travel gap of $220m represents a serious imbalance. Clearly then, there is an urgent need to correct this situation. </para>
          <para>The Australian Tourist Commission is doing an excellent job in promoting Australia overseas but given the many problems it faces in selling Australia as a tourist destination it is unrealistic to expect that the Commission would be able to increase Australia's foreign exchange earnings from tourism to such an extent that it would balance the spendings of Australians abroad. How can we solve, or at least minimise, this problem? Certainly the Government has no intention of taking action to limit the numbers of Australians travelling overseas. We consider that Australians travelling overseas and people from other countries visiting Australia have more than an economic impact. The interaction of people leads to a better understanding between nations and thus barriers should not be placed on overseas travel. The Government considers, as do many associated with the tourist industry, that the Australian Tourist Commission could do much to help overcome this economic problem if it were given authority to encourage more Australians to have their holidays at home- a noble objective, and I may add, in accordance with the philosophy of my Government to encourage more Australians to see and learn more of their own country. </para>
          <para>This leads me to the main purpose of the Bill which is to amend the existing Act to enable the Commission to enter into the domestic tourism promotion field. The role of promoting travel within Australia has in the past been left to the State governments and Territory administrations, through their tourist bureaux, to the Australian National Travel Association and to other private or government bodies such as airlines, shipping lines, railways, coach companies etc. But more can be done. Here I might add that the Minister for Tourism and Recreation has discussed this matter with his colleagues on the Tourist Ministers ' Council which includes Ministers from all States, and they have endorsed these proposals. </para>
          <para>While the Department of Tourism and Recreation has the authority to promote domestic tourism in Australia it desires to take advantage of the expertise within the Australian Tourist Commission. The Commission has over the years built up the experience to engage in this type of activity and indeed has done a tremendous job of making Australia better known overseas. It thus has the ability to make Australia better known to Australians. The type of promotions which the Commission will be asked to undertake will be 'umbrella' nationwide promotions, in co-operation with the States and the travel industry aimed at complementing and supporting existing promotional and policy activities and encouraging wider travel in Australia. To give effect to the Government's decision to widen the powers of the Australian Tourist Commission to enable it to enter into the domestic tourism promotion field section 1 5 of the principal Act is to be repealed. This section at present reads: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">I turn now to the constitution of the Commission as stated in clause 5. The Australian Tourist Commission Act 1967-1973 provides that the Commission shall consist of 5 voting and 2 nonvoting members, the 2 non-voting representatives being persons nominated by the governments of the States and who serve on the Commission on a rotating basis. The Bill provides that all members of the Commission be entitled to vote. This is a basic principle. It is important that the Australian and State governments and industry interests work in close harmony to achieve our aims and accordingly, all members of the Commission should be equal and have full voting rights. The Bill also provides that the number of members should be increased from 7 to 9 members. It is the Government's belief that the importance of tourism in the economy requires an expansion of the Commission to make it more representative of the various interests which might be expected to have a voice on such a body. At a later date the Minister for Tourism and Recreation will be announcing the 2 new members of the Tourist Commission. </para>
          <para>The Bill, of course, makes other provisions. However, these are secondary to the factors I have already outlined to you and are made either because of the passage of other Bills enacted by the Parliament in recent months, or because the main amendments proposed in this Bill require other provisions to be made as a matter of administrative procedure. The Government is of the view that the measures which I have outlined will represent a further step forward in the development of our tourist industry. I believe that honourable senators on both sides of this House will recognise it to be an important step which will complement other measures which have already been adopted to assist the tourist industry and which the Minister for Tourism and Recreation will be striving to obtain for the industry in the years ahead. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para class="block">The principal purpose of this Bill is to implement the Government's proposal to extend the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia to provide finance for tourist development projects, especially smaller projects in selected areas. This proposal was first announced by my colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Recreation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Stewart),</inline> on 22 August 1973, when he foreshadowed that the necessary amending legislation would be introduced this year. </para>
          <para>The tourist industry is an important contributor to the overall economic prosperity of this country. The key to the industry's continual growth to satisfy the needs of both domestic and overseas tourists is its ability to obtain adequate investment funds on reasonable terms. Most operators in the industry seeking development finance are experiencing difficulty in obtaining new funds on satisfactory terms, particularly for smaller undertakings in remote areas, and the proposed legislation is designed to help alleviate these problems. </para>
          <para>Under the current legislation, the Commonwealth Development Bank's principal function is to provide finance to assist primary production or to establish or develop industrial undertakings, particularly small undertakings, in cases where in its opinion finance is desirable but would not otherwise be available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions. </para>
          <para>The proposed amendment to section 72 of the Commonwealth Banks Act will widen the Development Bank's function to enable it to provide finance for the establishment or development of undertakings, particularly small undertakings, providing accommodation or transportation for tourists or other facilities designed to attract tourists. The provision of such finance will be subject to the same statutory provisions as those applicable to the Bank's existing lending operations, including the requirement that the Bank should be satisfied the finance would not otherwise be available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions. The amendment to section 72 will also empower the Development Bank to provide advice and assistance to tourist enterprises. The Development Bank will be particularly concerned with financing smaller enterprises involved in the development or improvement of tourist facilities away from main population centres. In accordance with the Government's wishes the Development Bank will consult as appropriate with the Departments of Tourism and Recreation, Urban and Regional Development, and Environment and Conservation in carrying out its financing role in the tourist industry. </para>
          <para>This Bill also brings into line with the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 the provisions in the Commonwealth Banks Act relating to the determination of the remuneration payable to members of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation Board and the various statutory officeholders under the Act. The amendments effected by clause 4 and the schedule to the Bill will thus formalise in the Commonwealth Banks Act the requirement that the remuneration payable to the statutory office-holders concerned be determined in future by the remuneration tribunal established under the Remuneration Tribunal Act. </para>
          <para>In accordance with current practice, clause 4 also makes provision for allowances payable to the statutory office-holders specified to be prescribed by regulations. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">Yesterday the  President  of the Senate read out to the Senate a letter sent to him by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Vincent</inline> Gair in which he said that he had vacated his seat by accepting the office of Ambassador to the Republic of Ireland. That, in brief, is what the letter states. Section 47 of the Constitution provides: </para>

            <para>Until the Parliament otherwise provides, any question respecting the qualifications of a senator or of a member of the House of Representatives, or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament, and any question of a disputed election to either House, shall be determined by the House in which the question arises. </para>

          <para class="block">In the case of R. v. The Governor of South Australia in 1907 and reported in 4 Commonwealth Law Reports, page 1497, the High Court refused to determine whether a senator had been validly appointed under section 15 of the Constitution because this was, amongst other things, a question respecting a vacancy within the meaning of section 47. Arising out of that case the Australian Parliament, in the exercise of its power under section 5 1 (xxxvi), passed a special Act to otherwise provide for such questions to be referred to the High Court of Australia sitting as a Court of Disputed Returns. This Act was the Disputed Elections and Qualifications Act 1907. Following its enactment the High Court, in the case of Vardon v. O'Loghlin, reported in 1907, 5 Commonwealth Law Reports, page 201, determined the question arising in the Governor of South Australia case. The present provisions for referring such questions to the High Court sitting as a Court of Disputed Returns are to be found in section 203 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918-73. Those provisions read: </para>

            <para>Any question respecting the qualification of a <inline font-weight="bold">Senator or</inline> of a Member of the House of Representatives or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament may be referred by resolution to the Court of Disputed Returns by the House in which the question arises and the Court of Disputed Returns shall thereupon have jurisdiction to hear and determine the question. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The procedure outlined in section 203 provides a proper means of ensuring that complicated questions involving the interpretation of the Constitution can be determined by the highest judicial tribunal in the country, the tribunal which is charged by the Constitution with the function of interpreting and applying the provisions of the Constitution. The questions raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Vincent</inline> Gair's letter to the  President  are questions of constitutional law. The answers to those questions in the Government's view are clear, but if there is a dispute about them quite obviously, on the view taken by one of my distinguished predecessors as Attorney-General, the correct and only way in which the questions respecting the vacancy can be resolved is by the Senate referring them to the High Court of Australia.  ssenator  Wilkinson- Was that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Green-</inline> \ &gt;d? </para>

            <para>I would have thought that where a Senator's constitutional right to sit in this chamber is conferred by the Constitution, the High Court is the appropriate body charged by the Constitution with the duties of interpretation, lt would be an unreal situation if this Parliament or any one House of the Parliament were to decide whether or not a senator had the qualifications to remain in this chamber. I believe it would be mischievous to embark upon an inquiry in the assumption that this Parliament or this chamber does have that power. </para>

          <para class="block">That was said in the course of a lengthy speech by then Attorney-General Greenwood. The position has been put that the constitutional provisions under which this question has been put forward enable the chamber to refer this question to the Court of Disputed Returns, but that and the other provision made by the Act of Parliament in relation to questions respecting a vacancy have been viewed as exhausting the power which the Senate previously had to determine such questions. </para>

              <para>-Let me say that the view precisely on this point which has been expressed by this most distinguished legal authority is that even though the matter may not be one to be expressed dogmatically, nevertheless the provision in section 203 displaced the former provisions and the use of the word 'may ' is not in the circumstances strong enough to amount to a reservation of the former jurisdiction of the House- and it applies to either the House of Representatives or the Senate. Section 203 means that in respect of such a question this Senate retains a sufficient jurisdiction that where there is a question- and there undoubtedly is here, because the  President  has put the matter to the Senate- it is within the jurisdiction of this Senate to refer the matter to the Court of Disputed Returns. </para>

              <para>In my opinion, since approval of his appointment as Ambassador of the Australian Government to the Republic of Ireland was made by  His Excellency,  the Governor-General, on 14 March 1974, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> has either held an office of profit under the Crown or agreed to take a fee or honorarium for services rendered to the Commonwealth. Sections 44 (iv) and 45 (iii) of the Constitution are probably intended to be complementary to each other, an <inline font-style="italic">office</inline> of profit  com temp la ting  continuous employment and a fee or honorarium  com temp la ting  limited or short-term services. In the present case this leads in my opinion to the conclusion that either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> at the latest by 14 March 1974 had agreed to take a fee or honorarium for services rendered to the Commonwealth or at the latest by 21 March 1974 held an office of profit under the Crown. </para>

              <para>A question which arises is whether the expression 'services rendered ' refers only to services which have been rendered in the past or also to services which will be rendered, by agreement, to the Commonwealth in the future. As to this, it is my opinion that the section must be read as including services to be rendered in the future as well as services which have been rendered in the past because otherwise it would be easy to evade section 45 (iii) of the Constitution by accepting a fee before rendering the services in question. </para>

              <para>- I thank the honourable senator for interpolating because what he has just said illustrates the very danger of the senator's presuming to come to a judgment on a single statement which has been made in relation to a practice which has been pursued, not only in this case but also in other cases, which does not touch the question at all. If one were to look at and approach this matter in a judicial manner and see how various appointments were made over the years one would realise that the suggestion that the office was created by the statement of terms and conditions, or the signing in the way which the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred, was nonsense. I heard the honourable senator exclaim with some glee and he probably thought: 'Ah, here is the solution to the problem'. It is not a solution to the problem at all. In the view of the advisers of the Government, based on the practices which have been pursued not only in this case but over decades, the conclusion which the honourable senator thinks he has reached is completely baseless. I suggest caution to the honourable senator. If he thinks he can come to a conclusion because of something which was said in that way at question time, or if he thinks that that was some surprise or that in some way it resolves the question, it just shows how dangerous it is for him to be making up his mind on questions of a legal nature on considerations such as that. </para>

              <para>- I thank the honourable senator- the Constitution and the law. Here is a legal question. The Parliament of Australia has provided that when such a question arises, under section 203 of the Constitution, it may be referred to the High Court of Australia. The Government takes the view that the correct course in these circumstances is not that the opinion of one person or another in this chamber may prevail or that there should be a decision along party political lines in the Senate on a question which concerns not only the rights of senators or would-be senators but also the people of Queensland. Indeed, it affects the people of Australia, and the composition of this Parliament. The matter should be determined in the way that has been contemplated by the Parliament, that is, by reference to the High Court of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I have indicated to you that the nature of the provision is such that the view has been taken that section 203 and the other provisions I have mentioned have exhausted the power of the Senate to deal with such matters except that when a question arises it may refer such a question to the High Court. </para>

              <para>-No. If any real question was to be determined, it should be referred to the High Court of Australia. There was no longer the power in the Senate to determine the question for itself. As I said, the view which I have put has been expressed by the highest of legal authorities some time ago in relation to this very matter. One would think that it is a very powerful indication, firstly of the jurisdiction here and secondly, it strongly fortifies the view that, in any event, the power being here, it should be exercised by the Senate to refer the question. What has been the history of the matter? The Senate originally had the power to look at such questions. The Senate has made no determination on such a matter since 1 907. It is true that under standing order 38 there is a provision for a Standing Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications. The standing order in that regard reads as follows: </para>

          <para class="block">We know that since 1907 that Committee has never met. Such a Committee has been appointed at the commencement of the sitting of each Parliament. One has been appointed for this Parliament. What is the course to be taken it to be said that the provisions of section 203 of the Constitution are not to be availed of? Despite the view that there is an exhaustion of the power which was formerly available under section 47 of the Constitution because the Parliament made another provision which now appears in substance in section 1 8 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, is it to be said that nevertheless the Senate will have its Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications inquire into and report upon the matter? When the power under section 47 of the Constitution was originally unimpaired by provision made by the Parliament it was understood that a decision on a matter of this nature was to be a decision made at least after consideration in a judicial manner. </para>
          <para>We are familiar with the concept that applies to all sorts of bodies- this applies to a whole host of them- when they are determining questions which affect the rights of persons. It is a rule of infinite application that those bodies are under a duty to approach a decision in a judicial manner. It is possible, even if we did not have section 203 of the Constitution, to have a body approach such a question, even though it may not be a court, in a judicial manner. This is a concept well understood as a rule of conduct applying to administrative bodies and other bodies which have to decide questions which affect the rights of persons. </para>
          <para>If we are not to proceed under section 203 of the Constitution, and if we are to ignore the view which has been put that the Senate's power has been exhausted, does the Senate intend to have this question, which affects the rights of persons, determined in a judicial manner by the Standing Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications? It would receive material and opinions, hear submissions and come to a proper decision in a way which is expected of a body concerned with the rights of persons and which is especially concerned with the right to vote- something which affects every person who is entitled to vote in Queensland, candidates who might wish to stand for election and in general the people of Australia. Or is it the intention of those who sit opposite to say: 'Let us fling away the rule book. Let us forget about a decision arrived at in some judicial manner. We will not have this determined by the body which Parliament has contemplated should determine it'- that is no minor judicial body, but the High Court of Australia 'We will not even send it to, say, our own Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications. But we will do it by Rafferty 's rules, and we will sit here and determine the rights of people according to a party political vote'? Honourable senators opposite will, in effect, put up their hands in their party rooms and then come in here and decide questions of the rights of persons, not only of senators or would be senators, according simply to a party political vote - </para>

              <para>-. . . so that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Webster can give his opinion on the question whether the power has been exhausted and other persons can exercise a vote on questions which are clearly legal questions. Honourable gentlemen opposite will say: 'I disagree with the Solicitor-General' or 'I disagree with the General Counsel' or 'I disagree with the opinion that was given by a former Attorney-General '. This is the very situation which section 203 of the Electoral Act was designed to avoid. Are these questions to be determined in this way? The Government wants the highest tribunal in Australia to determine whether it is right or wrong. A lot has been said in this chamber about the correctness of a view that has been put forward. The Government's view is that the body contemplated by the Parliament in the Act- the High Court of Australia- should determine the question which the  President  has said needs to be determined. What kind of excuse is to be put up to say that the viewpoint of the Governmentthat the decision should be made by the High Court of Australia- is not to be accepted? Are honourable senators opposite to say: 'No, we do not want this matter determined by the High Court of Australia. We are going to do it ourselves. Let us have a party political vote. It does not matter about the rights or wrongs, or who is correct; let us have a party vote and let us in some way determine this question'? If they do that, they will set a precedent which will break that which has prevailed for nearly 70 years since 1907. It could be done then because then there was no section 203; but since the provision was made by the Parliament there has been no endeavour by this Senate to determine any such question. As questions have arisen, they have been dealt with by the High Court of Australia. Is this Senate now to embark upon a course which means that it will decide these questions- legal questions affecting rights and especially the right to stand or the right to vote- and that they will be determined here on party political lines? Where is it to stop? Are we to say that because one side has a sufficient majority in the place it can do whatever it likes and exclude other persons, ignore disqualifications or alleged disqualifications which might arise, and just carry on as if legal rights can be determined on a party political vote?

              <para>- Yes. In varying degree all hold positions of responsibility; but, at the very minimum, all hold positions of high responsibility. What justification is there for not following the course prescribed by section 203 of the Electoral Act? This clearly comes within the terms of section 203. To avoid this very kind of happening the Parliament determined that there would be a procedure as set out in section 203, and now comes a case. But honourable senators opposite say: 'Because of some political advantage we happen to have the numbers- let us just decide it on political lines; let us have a vote'. That is what they will do if they do not choose the proposed course. The question which has been put to this chamber by the  President  is covered- manifestly covered- by section 203. I put it to the Senate that that is the only proper course in these circumstances. It may well be so on the authority to whom I have referred - </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator asks me who is that authority. If I do not tell him, it may indicate that I am not anxious to answer. But I feel that I ought to answer him. The author of that opinion was Garfield Barwick. It was given on 2 February 1952. The Senate ought to be cognisant of the fact that the Parliament has otherwise provided in terms of section 47. The provision that it has made is wise and proper. I suggest that those who were responsible for the passage of that legislation would regard it as unthinkable that in a situation such as this the Senate would not carry a motion to refer this question to the High Court of Australia so that it can be determined according to the rule of law and not according to the rule of the numbers which happen to prevail in this chamber. </para>

            <para>- For some 38 minutes we have listened to a very interesting piece of advocacy by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> the burden of which, as I understand it, is that the Senate ought to do certain things in accordance with the motion he has moved, because to do otherwise would be to vote on political lines. I ought to make it quite clear from the outset, as I have on numerous occasions, that we in the Liberal Party do not caucus, and no Liberal senator is bound to vote on political lines in this chamber on any question. I will go further As far as it is within my power to direct- I do not believe I have such a power- I now state quite categorically that I would direct every Liberal senator to vote upon this question according to his conscience, and under no circumstances to vote on this matter according to his political affiliation. If he did so he would not only be unfaithful to his political allegiance but he would be untrue to his position as a senator in still a free society. I would be shocked to think that the 20 Liberal senators here would vote merely upon miserable, narrow political lines. As always, they will vote according to their belief that they are putting their vote where their vote ought to go as a matter of principle. </para>

          <para>As I said, we have had from the Attorney-General a very interesting discussion which lasted some 38 minutes. I rather felt a bit sorry for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> because, strange as it may seem, I like him very much personally. I should not say 'strange as it may seem' but it is strange when one considers the impression that gets abroad. But I do like the Leader of the Government as a person. Therefore I feel somewhat sorry for him. From the little I read of the media, I saw that last Wednesday morning he was presented as the new colt. This magnificent horse they had found to win the Grand National, the Grand National being the event in this chamber. They had found a new colt. I do not know what he was previously but I think by last night that colt had been gelded and had turned into a draft horse, and this afternoon was floundering in a bog and a mire attempting to get out. For that reason I am rather sorry for the Attorney-General. For 38 minutes he floundered and wandered around in this bog and this mire. He knows, as does every other honourable senator in this place, that the facts are so much against him that he has to go back to the law. That is an old trick on which every person who practises in the courts relies. One always gets rather suspicious when someone relies too much upon the law. It is reasonable evidence, at least to those people who practise in the courts, that the case is pretty so and so shaky and your facts are pretty crook. The facts in this case are so open and so well known- it is the Watergate situation again. It is the trick that did not come off. So to justify his action the Attorney-General goes back to the law. </para>

              <para>-1 will come to the facts shortly. The facts are well known. They have been the cartoonists ' dream for some days. The media has had an absolute bonanza because, as the facts became known, the Government looked more and more foolish. The Government has to extricate itself from this situation. So what does it dolt puts up a number of specious, almost phoney, arguments which are alleged to be legal arguments. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> says: 'I come in here with an opinion from the Solicitor-General and one from my general counsel and I have one from somebody else, and I tell you that that is the law'. He does not say: 'I put forward the argument or I attempt to persuade you'; he says: 'I tell you'. With respect, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has the right to argue his point of view and to persuade in this place, but he certainly does not have the right to tell. </para>

I am delighted that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> at last has realised the enormous weight which is embodied in the opinion of the Solicitor-General. I remember an occasion a year or two back- I have not looked up the facts; 1 am relying on memory- when we had in this chamber a very great argument which extended over a day or so in relation to standing order 448, as I remember it. At that time an opinion was produced from a Solicitor-General of the 1 930s. 1 do not know whether it was <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran or <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Knowles. I think an opinion was put up by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr N.</inline> H. Bowen, as he then was, which, I think, was supported by the then Solicitor-General whose name escapes me. </para>

              <para>-Mr Mason, who I understand is now a distinguished judge of the High Court. What did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> say on that occasion? He said: 'How dare these people intrude upon the procedures of the Senate. We have a right under section 23 of the Constitution' I cannot recall whether that is the correct section; I do not think it is relevant anyhow- 'to come to the decisions the Senate wants. What right have these lawyers to tell honourable senators these things'. I see that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> is laughing. He is doing so because he recalls the incident. I only wish I had enough time to do what I did on one previous occasion and read as my speech on this occasion the speech that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> made on the previous occasion. I would have sounded very persuasive, because on that occasion the honourable senator won. So if two or three years back the opinions of Solicitors-General, Attorneys-General, past Solicitors-General and distinguished lawyers were of no account because the Senate 's will ought to prevail, why should the position be different today? However, 1 do not want to get involved in this interesting and technical but sterile and arid argument as to the effect of section 203 of the Constitution. </para>

          <para class="block">It is as simple as that. You ought to resign. I will work through what I have said in my motion. In the Senate yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> might I say with respect, you put down a very proper statement of the facts of the situation. I think it is accurate to say that at the time you made your statement you had neither been notified of the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> nor received a resignation in terms of section 19. </para>
          <para>As I understand the burden of your statement, you just did not have the capacity to notify anybody. You had not the capacity to notify the Senate, let alone the Governor of Queensland, that a vacancy existed in the Senate for a senator for Queensland. That is as I understand the burden of your statement. You went on to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> had made certain assertions that he might no longer be qualified and that that was not for you to pass judgment thereon. As you properly said, in my view, that is a matter upon which the Senate must take judgment. In the second leg of my motion I state that there is abundant evidence that the Prime Minister and his Ministers knew and intended that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> would resign in the normal process. One of the few advantages of the Prime Minister's weekly Press conference, or what passes for a Press conference, is that occasionally there is some interesting information afterwards.

          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was said on Tuesday. I do not know at what time it was said but obviously it was before the </para>
          <para class="block">Premier of Queensland trumped the ace. At that stage it was said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was going to resign. At page 5 of the transcript this appears: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Question- Can you tell us, is there still time between now and 18 May to have the sixth vacancy elected in Queensland? </para>
            <para>Prime Minister- The Queensland Government, if the Queensland Legislative Assembly is not sitting, or the Queensland Legislative Assembly if it is sitting, can make an appointment to fill a casual vacancy. The replacement is made at the first federal election after the occurrence of the casual vacancy in the Senate. The balance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair's</inline> term will be taken by a person elected on 1 8 May. </para>
            <para>Question- That depends on when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> retires. Do you know when that will be? </para>
            <para>Prime Minister- No. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Obviously the whole arrangement was to be brought to a conclusion by a resignation and there is no escaping from that factual situation. It was to be brought about by a resignation directed to the  President  in terms of section 19 of the Constitution. There is no doubt about that. The facts speak for themselves. After <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> did his thing this week the Government was in a desperate situation. It had tried, it had succeeded, and then it had fallen flat on its face. How was the Government to get out of this dilemma? I suppose the first thing that was said by Government supporters was: 'We failed on the facts. What is the law now?' One would have thought better of these great constitutionalists who seem to have solicitors-general, general counsel and about 200 lawyers in the Attorney-General's Department to help them. One would have thought that they would have canvassed the law first instead of waiting for a blunder to occur and then trying to find whether the law could help them out of it. But still, what did they do? </para>
          <para>The answer is in my amendment. The Government now attempts to assert that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> vacated his seat under section 44 or 45 of the Constitution. That did not go off too well last night with Professor Lane, who was described by Kerry O'Brien as an expert. The Government cannot deny what he says because the Government is very close to the media and it would not like to say that Kerry O'Brien would not tell the truth. Kerry O'Brien said that Professor Patrick Lane of Sydney University is an expert in constitutional law. On a media man's say-so he produces an expert- Professor Lane. I have no doubt that Professor Lane is a man of great reputation. He is certainly well acknowledged within the profession as a man who knows his subject. </para>

            <para>-1 think it is unfair to ask whether he is a member of the Liberal Party. Do I ask whether the persons from whom you obtain your opinions are members of a political party? I think that is an unfair question to ask about a person who has given an opinion in a legal capacity, providing he is not in this place. When a lawyer in this place gives a legal opinion, of course that opinion is suspect because he sits in here as a politician; but to say that a lawyer who expresses a view outside Parliament has that view coloured by his political affiliations is unfair to the profession.

              <para>-I did not know. It was alleged he was an ambassador. It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> to say that I knew. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> does not know the difference between knowledge and allegation, he needs a dictionary if nothing else. There may have been allegations and there may have been rumours, but as I understand the proposition there was no real knowledge of it in the community until the Prime Minister disclosed it in the House of Representatives on Tuesday. That is when it came to my knowledge and that of other senators on my side of the chamber and of the community in general. But the Attorney-General knew or he ought to have known that he was permitting to sit in this chamber a person whom he now alleges- and wishes the High Court to rule- had no right to sit here. That is the gravamen of our charge. It is no use <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> saying that he did not know. He can say he did not know or he can say he ought not to have known, but he cannot have it both ways, and that is what he is attempting to do. That is why this whole exercise of the Government to have the matter sent off to the High Court is nothing but a smoke screen to cover up its political ineptitude, to attempt to have the facts swept under the carpet, to have the political consequences of this very smart trick that did not come off buried under some formal legal process. </para>

They would be ashamed of themselves if they had the capacity to be ashamed. They do not like what they did. They not only do not like what they did, they are annoyed that it did not come off. So what do they do? They take refuge in the High Court. As far as we are concerned, they are not going to take refuge there. They will stand up in this chamber and be counted because whatever else happens within a parliamentary system, the executive arm of government is still accountable to parliament and that is what this is all about. The Government is not accountable to the </para><para class="block">High Court; it is accountable to this Parliament of Australia. That is what honourable senators opposite are really all about.

That being the case, I assume that they approach this question with an open mind and will want to listen to argument as to why they should support the proposition that has been put to them by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> The first question that occurs to me- and I think that it should occur to any people looking at this matter with an open mind- is that if the Opposition is so overwhelmingly confident that the facts are all on its side, why does it worry about having those facts examined by the highest court in the land? </para>

What is undemocratic and what is there in this proposition which we are putting to the Senate which will not ensure that this matter is properly ventilated and properly examined by the best legal minds in this country? We have heard gibes or implied gibes from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> at the legal advice which has been tendered to the Attorney-General. I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> is casting some sort of a slur on the Solicitor-General or on the counsel assisting the Attorney-General. If honourable senators opposite are not satisfied with this advice or if they believe that there is something partial about it, one would think that they would hasten to embrace the proposition that the matter should be decided by the most disinterested minds in the community. 1 heard one or two interjections suggesting, in a further slur upon the High Court, that somehow or other the judgment of this Court could not be trusted because, as one interjector asked: Who appointed the members of the High Court? With 2 exceptions, the 7 members of the High Court were appointed by our opponents. I am certain that one would never hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> for example, any suggestion that we would get from the High Court anything but an impartial decision. So our suggestion is a proposition which has much greater fairness and much greater impartiality about it than any suggestions that the matter be decided in the heat of Party political passions, according to numbers or in any way that would not ensure a proper hearing of this matter. </para>
          <para>We have heard also from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> a suggestion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> in this exercise today is involved in some sort of exercise of swallowing his own words- words which he used in argument on a previous occasion.

It will have become perfectly clear to honourable senators that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> will be involved in a lot of word swallowing if he is to oppose this motion because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> made perfectly clear, in a contribution to a debate in this place in August 1971 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> wenton record as saying that the appropriate place to have a matter of the type that we are discussing today resolved is the High Court of Australia. </para>

              <para>. respecting the qualification of a senator or of a member of the House of Representatives, or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament, and any question of a disputed election to either House, shall be determined by the House in which the question arises. </para>

          <para class="block">I submit that under the provisions of the Electoral Act which have been referred to, and some which were just touched on, the Australian Parliament has otherwise provided, and it has left out nothing in providing. I refer to sections 203 to 208 and then refer back to section 183 and the following sections. Every aspect of the powers referred to in section 47 of the Constitution has been provided for by the Parliament. </para>
          <para>This phrase 'Until the Parliament otherwise provides' permeates the Constitution. It appears in many other sections of the Constitution as well as section 47.I have looked through the books in an attempt to find in the decided cases some words from the High Court to define what is meant by 'Until the Parliament otherwise provides'. It is a curious fact that there is not to be found, or at least not to be found by me- I stand corrected if anybody's research is more thorough- any cases on the meaning of this phrase 'Until the Parliament otherwise provides'. I can conclude only that when the Parliament has otherwise provided, either under this section or any other section of the Constitution, it has been accepted by everybody affected that that resolves the question; one does not then look at the Constitution but one looks at the legislation until the Parliament has otherwise provided. I am suggesting that the matter is totally exhausted by the provision in the Electoral Act of machinery for meeting every possible challenge and every type of situation in which there is some doubt about qualifications, some doubt about vacancies or some doubt about the sort of matter that we are considering today. </para>
          <para>So there is this illusion enshrined in the opening sentence of the amendment- an amendment which speaks of the Senate doing something in pursuance of its powers under section 47. But the powers under which the Senate should now act are the powers conferred by the Electoral Act. By way of interjection <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> why the permissive word 'may' instead of the word 'shall' is used. I am prepared to grasp that nettle. I am prepared to admit that the Senate may or may not take the steps that we are suggesting. But I submit that it may not take any other steps. </para>
          <para>The Senate may not decide the matter itself when there is a procedure under section 203 to go to the High Court of Australia. It can, if it likes, with the use of numbers, decide that it will not take this procedure of referring the matter to the High Court. But, of course, there are other provisions under section 185 etc., which make it possible for an individual then to lodge a petition and to challenge the result of an election after the election has taken place. Of course, this may be a method which appeals to the Opposition more than the method which we are suggesting. But is that not a much more messy way of approaching this problem? Is it not much better to clear up any doubt which may exist before the election takes place? That, I suggest, is the real purport of the word 'may' in section 203. The Parliament did provide a method- a neat, tidy and eminently fair method when read along with the other sections in this Part of the Act- whereby questions of this nature might be resolved in advance of the election taking place. All we are inviting the Senate to do is to take advantage of this eminently fair method of resolving this matter. Anybody who is interested, as I have said, may be represented before the High Court at the hearing. It will be an open hearing. The Court will have the opportunity of calling for all the papers, of inviting any witnesses, including, if necessary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gair</inline> himself, or the Prime Minister ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> ) or the Attorney-General. </para>
          <para>What is it that the Opposition fears? All we heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> was the statement which, I must say, struck me as an outrageous statement for a lawyer to make- in that we were seeking to refer this matter to the highest tribunal in the land in order that the problem and facts could be swept under the rug. Is that really what the Leader of the Opposition sees as the function of the High Court of Australia? He also said that because we found that the facts were against us we were resorting to the terrible st rate gem of going to the law. This also strikes me as a most extraordinary statement, especially coming from a lawyer. What does it mean? Does it mean that we should have no regard for the law of </para>
          <para class="block">Australia; that we should go ahead if we think the facts are with us, and if we think we have the numbers to make that stick we should not bother about the law? Is this the proposition that came from the Leader of the Opposition in this place, himself a lawyer? If so, and if members of the Opposition are, as he assured us, genuinely to vote today according to their conscience and not according to the numbers, I cannot see how they can fail to reject his substitute for an argument and pay some regard to the arguments which have been advanced from this side of the chamber. </para>
          <para>Section 203 has been in the Commonwealth Electoral Act since 1907. It was inserted in its present form in 1918, but a section in almost identical words- identical except that 'qualifications' read 'qualification'- was in the Act in 1907. It was inserted, as I understand it, after the confusion arising from the case of Vardon v. O 'Loghlin and was specifically put into the statute by this Parliament in order that provision and machinery would exist for the resolution, the harmonious and orderly resolution, of a problem just such as this. Part XVIII of the Act, from section 183 to section 208, provides an elaborate code designed to meet every sort of situation of this kind that one can imagine. </para>
          <para>What is the outrageous proposition advanced by the Government? In effect we say: Let an independent, highly respected- highly respected by me anyhow, no matter what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> may say about it, and highly respected, I think, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and other lawyers on the other side of the chamber- and impartial body examine all the facts about which there are so many heated passions in this place. Let the Court examine witnesses and documents and then come down with a definitive ruling on what is the real state of affiairs. We on this side have no guarantee as to how the Court will find. If the facts are so overwhelmingly in favour of the Opposition, as the Opposition suggests, what has it to fear from this tribunal looking at those facts and giving a ruling? That is all we are asking. We are asking that the highest court in the land be given the opportunity to examine these facts, to examine the law and then to bring down a definitive and authoritative ruling on the matter which will satisfy this Parliament and which will satisfy the people of Australia. </para>

          <para>I am interested in this office of strategy and election tactics which has been set up by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> and which is being paid ibr by the Commonwealth. It appears to have some interesting functions. One of the functions of Messrs Young and Walsh is to conduct a salon of an evening between 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock, in a place frequented by members of the Press at that period, where hospitality is freely available and advice is freely available on how they should write the stories. Everybody knows the way it is done: 'Come in, have a drink. You should not be writing that this way. This is the way you ought to write it'. There are delicate suggestions that if they do the right thing- and pressmen have got diplomatic appointments abroad- pressmen will be given free trips abroad on the two 707 aircraft that are to be bought for the purposes of the Prime Minister. I appreciate that this is an extraordinary kind of operation, but the attitude appears to be that this office of strategy and election tactics was justified in the last election when it nobbled an eminent ecclesiastic and that it is justified by its organisation of libel cases against the propaganda of the Democratic Labor Party at election times. Now it has entered into the field of diplomatic appointments. Who knows which of us may not secretly have a diplomatic appointment at the present time. </para>

How do I know that some of my other friends have not received appointments, for example, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> has not been appointed in charge of the Egg Board? According to the Leader of the Government in the Senate it is not a matter to worry about, that secretly a member of this Senate may have been given an office of profit under the Crown. If it is not anything to worry about, had not the Senate better close up shop? We do not know who is a senator and who is not. That is the opinion of the Leader of the Government in the Senate. He placed it on record this afternoon that it was none of his business if he knew that a man who was not a senator was voting in this place. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Murphy</inline>said he had no responsibility to inform people that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was not a senator. He admitted that he had informed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> that he was not a senator. He admitted that he told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> that he was not qualified to come here and vote. Yet he admits that he sat in his chair and saw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> vote. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> voted in 9 divisions in the period when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> said he was no longer a senator. He watched turn do that and says that as Leader of the Government in the Senate he had no obligation to stop him or inform the <inline font-weight="bold">President. Senator Murphy</inline> also says that as Attorney-General, the man who is supposed to look after the laws of this country, he sat in his place and watched a gross breach of the law happen and did not regard himself as having any responsibility to do anything about it. This is a matter that has to be taken further. Can the Senate tolerate - </para>

              <para>-No. The other matter may go to the High Court but the matter of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy's</inline> conduct is a matter which has to be considered by the appropriate tribunal. Here we have a case where the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, the Leader of the Government, says straight out that it has happened before and can happen again. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy's</inline> view is that because the Government does not choose to notify the Senate or the people that a person has been appointed to an office of profit under the Crown, he has no obligation to stop that person from coming into this Senate, acting as a senator, receiving emoluments from the Government and doing all the things a senator is supposed to do- at a time when he is breaking the law and doing those things which are an insult to this Parliament. I express my regret. I think that the  President  of this Senate was insulted by the Whitlam Government when he was not informed by the Whitlam Government that it had made an appointment which in its view disqualified a person from being a member of this Senate. I think the Senate has to defend its rights in this matter. It has to defend its prestige. If this kind of conduct is to be tolerated then the Senate should be abolished. Unless we can rely on the Leader of the Government in the Senate and on Ministers of the Crown to defend the rights, privileges and honour of the Senate, where are we? We were told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> when I asked the first question today that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> ceased to be a senator on 14 March. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has now qualified that and said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> ceased to be a senator on 2 1 March. The Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee),</inline> who should know, has told us today in definite terms that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> occupied his official position as from yesterday. </para>

              <para>- I accept the correction. What he said was that he was an Ambassador Designate, which makes worse the position from the Government's point of view because the Minister for Foreign Affairs says that he is not the Ambassador. If that is so, what is the purpose of taking a case to the High Court when the relevant Minister who has the right of issuing the document appointing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> says that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was appointed by him yesterday as Ambassador-Designate and not as an Ambassador. No wonder an eminent law professor last night said that in this matter the position of the Government was preposterous. We have been told that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was appointed as from 14 March. A document was sent out at the wish of the Government on about 21 March or so, or later for all I know, asking the States to prepare for the election of senators. I am advised that in the case of Queensland <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen's</inline> Government was asked to arrange for 5 senators to be elected. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> claims that prior to that document going out <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was not a senator. That means that there were 6 vacancies, if his view is accepted. Can honourable senators understand anybody trying to bolster up a case by that kind of nonsense? The Government sent out its own document saying that there were 5 vacancies and 5 senators to be elected. The senator himself says that at the time the document was sent out there were actually 6 vacancies. Fancy the High Court being asked to listen to that kind of tommy rot. </para>

          <para>We were told that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was appointed on 14 March. Now the Government has shifted ground. He was appointed on 2 1 March, according to some. The Minister who has the right to appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> says that he is only a designate, he is not even appointed yet and that he was only made designate yesterday. I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> who says that as far as he is concerned he ceased to be a senator yesterday. After all, he used his parliamentary office as a senator until Tuesday. He came to and went from Canberra on his transport vouchers as a senator. He used the car which he is allotted as a senator. He collected the allowance paid for being in Canberra and he collected his salary. In addition, I believe he told me the truth when I saw him on Tuesday night to ask him not to accept the position. He told me that he could not do what I asked him because he said that he was committed. I said to him: 'When are you ceasing to be a senator?' He said: 'Tomorrow, Wednesday, when I hand in my resignation'. When I asked him when he would become Ambassador he said: 'In June, because the position does not become vacant until then'. </para>
          <para>I appreciate the frankness of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> who took the action to cut the Gordian knot when he made it clear that as far as he was concerned, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> did not become Ambassador to Eire, that he has not yet become the Ambassador to Eire. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> disagreed entirely with the recital of dates that was given to us by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> In regard to the papers that we have been given <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> was careful to qualify himself and say that he was not prepared to go on record as saying that all the papers had come to us. I think he was very wise. </para>

              <para>- I think he was very wise to qualify any admission there. Surely when a man is appointed an ambassador or an ambassador designate for this country there is a document which places on record the offer and the acceptance. I challenge this Government to produce the offer and the acceptance in writing. I say emphatically that there must be an offer and an acceptance in writing, and I challenge the Government to produce it. I ask categorically: Has it not been produced because it contains the date of acceptance? That is something that any honourable government must answer. I ask the Government to be honourable and to answer it. </para>

          <para>I heard the Prime Minister of this country, who should be an authority, say in another place that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> had warned <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> not to come into the Senate. It is an extraordinary situation when the Attorney-General, a Government leader, knows that an individual is breaking the law and that he is doing something which is a dreadful and shameful breach of parliamentary practices, privileges and traditions, and the Attorney-General does nothing about it. Surely he should have told the Prime Minister. Perhaps he did. Perhaps he told Eric Walsh or Mick Young. Perhaps he told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hogan.</inline> But whom did he tell? He did not tell anybody. He recognised no obligation to inform the  President  of the Senate that a non-senator in his view was speaking and voting. What is the effect upon the proceedings. Are the proceedings of those 3 weeks invalid? Did we spend 3 weeks wasting our time because the Leader of the Government had secret knowledge which he decided not to make available? That is the point which I should like answered. Is everything that has been done in the Senate over the last few weeks invalid because a person participated in the proceedings of the Senate whom the Leader of the Government, the Attorney-General, says was not qualified? I believe that we have to ask the Government, or we have to take steps ourselves, to ensure that a procedure is formulated under which, when the Commonwealth appoints any person who is a member of Parliament to an office of profit under the Crown, the  President  of the Senate shall immediately be notified. I ask any senator here to object to that. Is there any senator who believes that a person should be appointed to an office of profit under the Crown and that we should not be informed and that the  President  should not be informed? That is elementary, but it is disagreed with by the Leader of the Government. </para>

He said that the appointment in his view was the most disgraceful since the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Toby</inline> Belch. Now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> pretends that he has appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> to this position out of natural love, affection and admiration. He read a long list of his achievements, and they were achievements for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> deserves the utmost credit. But few people will ever forgive <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> for the action which he took in the case of a man trending towards the end of a long and admirable career, offering him a position- and I make these words clear- not to honour him but to destroy him. </para>

I want to say only this in conclusion: I will remember <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> not for what happened in the last three or four days but for the many honourable things that he did in a career during which he earned the admiration of the people of Queensland and, later, of Australia. I have made clear to him my view of what happened in the last few days, but I will remember him for what happened before the events of the last few days. The person whom I will never forgive for what was done is the man who, in the way the Prime Minister did, coldly and calculatingly set to work to wreck the reputation of a man whom he hated for political reasons. </para>

In the name of God, go'. That is what I say to this Government. </para>

            <para>- We have just heard an oration from the Leader of the Democratic Labor Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McManus)</inline> during which he at no time addressed himself to either the motion or the amendment. It was an address typical of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus:</inline> He threw a lot of mud, hoping that some of it would stick.  His  final remarks surely must condemn him for his unfair approach to the whole question. He says that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> was responsible for trying to destroy <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gair.</inline> He himself is now offering the greatest possible insult to a person who he says has been a champion in the eyes of the people for so many years. Does he seriously suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gair</inline> would not have sufficient political nous to realise that he was being made a pawn in the game? Of course he would have that knowledge. But he had become so disillusioned with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> and his colleagues in the Democratic Labor Party that he wanted to get out of the Party altogether. He had lost all confidence in them because some time previously they had railroaded him into relinquishing the position of Leader of their Party. That is why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gair</inline> was anxious to get away from the unseemly politics with which he had to associate himself when he was in the Democratic Labor Party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> is interjecting. If he proposes to start his yap-yap, let me ask: How often have we heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> say what a wonderful leader <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gair</inline> was? But the minute <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gair</inline> got out of the job, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> immediately denounced him and said that recently his leadership had been poor.

I challenge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> to go to the public library and to look at last Tuesday morning's issue of the 'Courier-Mail ', which was the first newspaper in Australia to break the news, and then to state whether that report said anything about the Prime Minister accepting the credit for this.  His  name was used once by Wallace Brown, when he said: 'The Prime Minister is allegedly reported to have stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> accepted this position some time last month'. From there on there is no mention of the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> or anybody else. That was the first report of the matter in Australia- and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Condon</inline> Byrne nearly died when he first saw it. </para>
          <para>Let me take issue with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> on a second point. He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gair</inline> himself had said that he had resigned when he tendered his resignation to the Senate the other night. The honourable senator can say all these things, but unless he has facts to support him his case crumbles to the ground. This is a report of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gair</inline> said in Canberra, as published today on page 3 of the 'Courier-Mail': </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline>has said that that is incorrect. But that is a report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gair</inline> himself making the statement. We have heard a long, detailed report of the private conversation between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gair.</inline> I do not know whether it is the politics of the Democratic Labor Party members to have a private conversation with someone and then to come into the Senate chamber and ventilate what was said. That is not my idea of ethical conduct for the leadership of a party. Perhaps it is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> 's. </para>
          <para>I refer now to the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> In paragraph (ii) of it, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> on behalf of the Opposition, says this: </para>

Of course, the reason that so much is being made of this matter is because of its political content.

Are honourable senators opposite disputing the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Paul</inline> Hasluck, consistent with all the powers that this Parliament gave him, approved that appointment on 14 March 1974?

The Irish Government returned the compliment and said: 'Yes, we are quite happy to have him'. That affirmative reply was communicated by means of the cablegram that was received on 20 March 1974. The next document which was tabled is a Minute Paper for the Executive Council, and its subject is the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the</inline> Honourable Vincent Clair Gair as Ambassador Extraordinary of Australia to the Republic of Ireland.

          </quote>
          <para class="block">There are 3 paragraphs in that Minute which indicate that this matter had been before the Governor-General in Council. Again the Minute was signed by the Governor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Paul</inline> Hasluck, on 21 March 1974, and it was filed in the records of the Executive Council. These are the steps that were taken to achieve the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gair</inline> to the position of Ambassador of Ireland. What more does anybody want? The facts are that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> as he then was, was asked whether he would take this position. He accepted the position. The Governor-General was asked whether he would approve the appointment, and he did so. The next step was to ask the Irish Government whether it approved the proposal. The next step was to take the matter to the Executive Council and again the Governor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Paul</inline> Hasluck, approved all those steps being taken. Therefore it is inconsistent with the facts for other people to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gair</inline> terminated his association with the Senate on Wednesday night last. The fact remains that the Governor-General said that he terminated his association with the Senate on or about 20 March 1974. But the legal eagles on the other side of the chamber have tried to make all the capital they can out of it by saying that these were snide moves on our part. </para>
          <para>If we are to talk about snide moves, let me now refer to the actions of the Queensland Government which is headed by Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Honourable senators opposite talk of democracy but when it comes to the crunch as to whether democracy is being observed we must have a look at some of the activities of these people who claim to be so righteous in their attitude towards democracy. I remember quite well an episode which occurred at a time when the present Premier was a Cabinet Minister in the Queensland Government. On that occasion a Senate vacancy was caused by the death of a senator from Queensland, and this man who now professes to have all the rights to democracy made a complete and utter joke of the process by which a successor was appointed. Upon being asked to nominate and appoint a successor, the Australian Labor Party nominated a person who had run third on the Australian Labor Party ticket at the previous election. But this gentleman from Queensland said that because the person we nominated was a wharf labourer he was completely unacceptable to the Country-Liberal Party Government in Queensland at that time. A tremendous political argument ensued. At last the Queensland Government submitted 2 names and said that unless we selected one of those 2 people it would give the position to a member of the Liberal Party or the Country Party. They are the ethics that are paraded by the Opposition as those of a great democrat. They are the ethics and standards that were observed in Queensland by the people with whom honourable senators opposite are proud to associate. I believe that they should be ashamed to associate with them. In order to provide a replacement senator from the Australian Labor Party we were required by the Queensland Government to submit 2 names. Otherwise the position would have gone to a member of another political party. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> you would be aware of those circumstances. I rest on the fact that the Government has a responsibility, if there is any uncertainty at all, to ask the highest court in the land to determine the issue. People more qualified than I to speak on this subject have said that that is the proper course. I will now read the final paragraph of the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Colin</inline> Howard, General Counsel to the Attorney-General: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>On this basis I am of opinion that on some date before 2 April 1974, that being the date upon which writs were issued for the election of senators from the State of Queensland, most probably on 2 1 March 1 974, but possibly on 14 March 1 974, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> ceased to be qualified to be a senator. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Honourable senators opposite put the view that the General Counsel to the Attorney-General is wrong. Let us see who is right. Surely members of the Opposition would regard the High Court of Australia as the proper authority to determine whether they as laymen are correct or whether the General Counsel to the Attorney-General is correct. Honourable senators opposite also dispute the opinion of the Solicitor-General of Australia. That is their fundamental right, but surely they would not place themselves in the same category in respect of knowledge of the law as the Solicitor-General of Australia. No one on this side of the chamber has tried to put himself in that position and I do not think that anyone on the other side should try to do so. The next proposition is to refer the whole matter to the highest legal authority in Australia. I commend to the Senate the proposition of the Government. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">In my opinion after examination of those provisions <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> disqualified himself from sitting in this House by the fact that he did accept a position from the Parliament as an ambassador. That appointment has been verified by the Governor-General of Australia whose signature appears on the appropriate document. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> in his wisdom has stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> had not resigned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> had no chance to resign because he disqualified himself from holding the position of senator immediately he was accepted as an ambassador. I have been a senator for only a few years and in that time I have noted- I do not think anyone would deny it- that this chamber is run on party political lines, much to my disgust. If the Senate were to try to reach a conclusion on this issue it would be decided on party politics. If it were agreed to put an even number of members of the major parties on each side of the House and to appoint a completely independent  chairman  a fair result might be gained; but as long as there are uneven numbers of representatives of the political parties in this chamber there will be a result which nobody could honestly accept as unbiased. That must be realised. </para>
          <para>As an independent senator I would like to believe that we could get an unbiased result but we all know that we could not. We owe it to the Senate not to be put in a position where we have to decide this matter. If we do, many people will point a finger at us and say: 'That was not a fan decision '. We have always tried to be fair in our decision in the Senate. Let us stick to that policy and that way of working. We must not let it be said that this issue was decided by party politics. We know that there are some sticky aspects of this matter that we do not like. It is not the first time that this has happened. They tell me that that is politics. That is why I do not very much like any part of politics. I did not wish to be a politician, but here I am. I am trying to give an unbiased and independent opinion. With an even number of members on each side of the chamber and 3 judges appointed to cast their deciding votes we could achieve a fair result, but not otherwise. We would be doing the wrong thing if we decided this issue in the Senate. </para>
          <para>No one can accurately predict the result if 5 or 6 senators are to be elected in Queensland because the people themselves will vote on that. They will make that decision. Who knows? Perhaps 5 or 6 Liberals would be elected, or 5 or 6 independent or Country Party senators. We must not make the decision here because it could never properly be termed unbiased. That result could be achieved with an even number of members on each side of the chamber and 3 judges who could cast their votes. No one could point a finger at that result. </para>
          <para>I believe that this is purely a political move. I do not know that we can believe everything we read in the newspapers, but it has been written that the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> as Ambassador to Ireland was a brilliant move. Perhaps it was brilliantly countered. I do not know whether that is so and no one will know until we get the final result- the vote of the people of </para>
          <para class="block">Queensland on whether it is 5 or 6 senators. I believe that Government senators are not proposing to place themselves in a position which is any different from that of other senators. If the Government sends this matter to the High Court it will be placing the matter in the hands of people who should be and I believe are without any doubt completely unbiased. Their decision should be a fair decision which, without any doubt, would be accepted by all the Australian people. </para>
          <para>I strongly recommend that we allow this matter to go out of our hands for decision because if we try to make a decision here we will make a decision for someone in this chamber, and it is wrong for us to do that at this dme. Therefore, when this question comes to a vote I will support the proposal to send this matter out of this chamber for decision, unless we can agree to have it decided by an equal number of senators from both sides of the chamber and 3 independent judges sitting where you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> are sitting at the present time. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Deputy President,</inline>this Senate is constituted by 60 elected senators, and its first duty is to maintain its own integrity. That is particularly important in this House of the legislature where the division between the major parties is so close and it is more particularly important for those individual senators who have no protection of a party but who rely alone upon their so-called individual independent strength. It has been one of the risks of politics ever since the game began that the Crown should benefit its men, and members of the legislature who appeared to be capable of being useful to the Crown were the objects of its patronage and preferment. But rarely did you get such impudent indiscretion on the part of the Crown and its advisers, who today are Ministers, or attempts so b rashly made on the eve of an election for the purpose of traducing a member of the legislature and procuring a vacation of his seat for electoral advantage so transparently corrupt as this. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The surprising thing is that, having been treated to the benefit of considered opinions by the Solicitor-General and the Counsel of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy),</inline> the Senate has not been afforded a single comment upon that aspect, the corrupt aspect, of this approach. We sit here in this chamber, a chamber whose significance has been growing year by year and will grow until it more nearly approaches the ambit of power in the comprehensive jurisdiction of the Senate of the United States if we accept the first principle of our existence, to guard and defend our own integrity. </para>
          <para>It is suggested that this chamber should abdicate its function to decide on its own Constitution at the present time when an assault has been made upon its integrity by the Prime Minister of the day, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> offering an office of profit, as is admitted, to one of our members, keeping it secret until the appropriate time, now claiming to have maintained it clandestine for some 20 days, and then purporting to trundle it out before the public at a time when the advantage would be unassailable. There has been not a word of that in any of the Crown counsel's opinions that have been laid before us. This chamber would do the worst disservice in its history of it forsook the opportunity that confronts it today to safeguard and decide the integrity of its own composition. </para>
          <para>A lot of garbled talk- garbled beyond description has been indulged in by pressmen in Australia. It is a disgrace to the medium that pretends to present public issues to the country to find such garbled and ignorant use of terms that are of very different connotation in the Constitution. Two kinds of vacancies occur in this Senate. One is the ordinary vacancy upon the effluxion of a senator's term, and the other is an extraordinary vacancy, and that is the only kind with which we are concerned today. I suggest that an extraordinary vacancy may occur, firstly, if a senator dies; secondly, if he is expelled; thirdly, if he resigns by writing to the  President  as required by section 19 of the Constitution; and, fourthly, if he forfeits his seat. </para>
          <para>The garbled Press continues to refer to forfeiture as a kind of resignation. Is it because the standards of the Press are so degraded that it is unable to distinguish between an honourable resignation and a discreditable and infamous forfeiture incurred by a secretly contrived acceptance of an office of profit under the Crown- or, to come still lower a contrived case which is categorised as an agreement to take a fee or honorarium for services rendered to the Commonwealth? There are other occasions of forfeiture, and just so there will be a context in which to discuss this claimed forfeiture, let us remind ourselves that they are treason, bankruptcy and a few infamies of that sort. </para>
          <para>But what is put forward in an endeavour to rescue the old nag from the bog in which my Leader so appropriately said she was floundering and striving to get out of? After there has been a procedure which effectually meets this corrupt manoeuvre, there is invented an idea that there has been a contrived forfeiture, which has lain secret in the archives of the Government and in the consciences of the Prime Minister and of the Attorney-General whereby <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> contrived to forfeit his seat. </para>

              <para>1 ) I am aware that in Canada, America and the United Kingdom community centres involving the use of videotape and film have been encouraged and successfully established. In Canada in particular the 'Challenge for Change' type of program has had major impact in this field. </para>

              <para>Film Australia has completed its first community involvement program, 'Whatever happened to Green Valley?' which the Prime Minister will be seeing at Green Valley on Saturday, 6 April. The residents made their own films about their lives and problems in the Valley under the guidance of Film Australia technicians. The residents supervised the editing of the films and their presentation to a community audience. The subsequent discussion was filmed and included with the other films in the final production 'Whatever Happened to Green Valley?'. A result of this exercise was the establishment of two community action groups. One of the groups has applied to the Film and Television Board of the Australian Council for the Arts for a video access centre to be established in Green Valley. Film Australia plans to go further into this field of sociological community film making. As well, preliminary discussion with other departments (including Aboriginal Affairs and Social Security) has indicated the likelihood that they may call for the advice of Film Australia and other branches of my Department in projects of this nature. </para>
