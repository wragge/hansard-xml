        </talk.start>
        <para>Is the Government aware that prior to the overthrow of the Allende Government in Chile last September, persons who had been involved in terrorist and urban guerrilla activities in South America had been accepted as citizens of Chile? Is the Government not also aware that many of these persons are now refugees from Chile, being persons who do not prefer to live in Chile or who are not prepared to be accepted as citizens of Chile by the new Government? Is it not a fact that members of the Australian Government are sympathetic to the cause of these persons? In view of the Government's admission made within the last week that 228 refugees from Chile are to be admitted to Australia, and in the light of the Government's sympathies, and restrictions which have been placed upon the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, what positive assurance is the Minister able to give that terrorists and guerrillas will not be admitted to Australia?</para>

If a futile attempt were made to secure sufficient Australian capital to satisfy the Government's requirements, would the Government then consider relaxing the 33 1/3 per cent deposit rule on overseas borrowings to ensure that this and other major decentralised projects are not forced to be abandoned?</para>

            <para>I ask this question: Are the statements made to me correct, namely, that the Leader of the Opposition had been approached before the Leader of the Government in the Senate assured me that he was going to be approached? Has he been in the position of preparing the No case for some days? Has the Leader of the Opposition in another place been informed that the No case has to be ready by tomorrow? Is it a fact that the approach to the Leader of the Opposition in another place was made without any reference to the Leader of the Australian Country Party or to the Leader of the Australian Democratic Labor Party? Is it the attitude of the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Leader of the Liberal Party in another place that the Country Party and the Democratic Labor Party can be ignored in all the arrangements in regard to the referenda?</para>

          <para>The Leader of the Australian Democratic Labor Party says that it is the most extraordinary circumstance with which he has been associated in all his time here as a senator. Probably that should amaze us all because he has been associated with many extraordinary episodes. I stand here and try to assist the Leader of the Democratic Labor Party as I try to assist all honourable senators, to the best of my knowledge. Sometimes I do not have the required information in writing before me, but I try to help. My understanding was that the Leader of the Oppositional d I meant in the House of Representatives—ha d been or was being approached about the matter. Senator McManus has told us that he has been preparing the No case for some days. Apparently he has not seen fit to consult those who assisted him in preventing the legislation being put through this House. If there is this terrible breakdown, lack of confidence, or even lack of consultation, all we can do is sympathise with the DLP and its Leader</para>

          <para>As to what the honourable senator suggests, when I answered him I assumed that they were being approached. I did not in fact know what stage had been reached. My information was gained orally and in passing, lf Senator McManus found out for himself that the Leader had been approached, it would not matter except, as he points out, for the dreadful fact that he has been going ahead to prepare a case without even consulting with Senator McManus. Let us put the blame where it correctly lies. It is a relatively unimportant aspect that I was not in a position to tell the honourable senator that in fact the Leader of the Opposition had been approached rather than indicate that he was being or would be approached. As Senator McManus properly points out, the real basis is that the Leader of the Opposition is not even bothering to consult Senator McManus or to take him into his confidence.</para>

I refer to the report and recommendations concerning the Australian Broadcasting Commission made by the management consultants Mckinney and Co., incorporated and tabled by he Minister yesterday. Is the Minister aware that at about 3 p.m. yesterday I received an invitation from the ABC to take part in a discussion on last night's 'This Day Tonight' program together with Professor Downing, Chairman of the ABC and Mr Phillip Adams, the well known critic and film producer? Is the Minister aware that, after I had spent 2 hours reading the report to equip myself to take part in the discussion I was advised by the ABC, without apology or explanation, that its invitation was withdrawn? Was the Minister consulted by the ABC either about the invitation to me or about the withdrawal of the invitation? Does the Minister agree that parliamentarians who make themselves available</para>

I can tell the honourable senator that I was approached at about 5 o'clock and asked whether I would be prepared to appear on that television program. I told the person who approached me on behalf of the Australian Broadcasting Commission that for personal reasons I was unable to do so. I was subsequently informed that Professor Downing, the Chairman of the ABC, and Mr Phillip Adams, the Chairman of the Film and Television Board of the Australian Council for the Arts, would be appearing on the program to discuss the Mckinney Report. I will certainly make inquiries on behalf of my colleague and let the honourable senator know the outcome.</para>

Is the Minister aware that the action of these few people is now resulting in thousands of others in the community—man y of them just ordinary consumers, railway workers, paper makers farmers and their families—bein g deprived of their livelihood? Does the Minister realise that the dispute is really between the union organisers and the Tasmanian Labor Government-established tribunal, the State Wages Board? Can the Federal Minister for Labour intervene urgently so that common sense will prevail and those people who have wangled their way into the unions in Tasmama, after coming from other areas, can be sent packing and despatched from our community which was quite happy until they arrived?</para>

I am told also that there is to be another conference today. However much the Commonwealth Minister for Labour wants to intervene in this matter he is not able to do so unless he is requested by the employers and the unions jointly to intervene and perhaps to provide the facilities of the Commonwealth arbitration inspectors or conciliators for that purpose.</para>

It is unfortunate that the dispute has lasted for so long.

          <para>I can tell the honourable senators that, as part of the machinery of government advertising, the wording of advertisements setting out the workings of Parliament were prepared by parliamentary officers and approved by Mr President and Mr Speaker, and they were inserted by the Australian Government. I can tell the honourable senator that as a result of these advertisements being inserted last week, there has been considerable public demand, especially from teachers and educationists, for these advertisements to be put in booklet form. It is intended by my Department that the first 10 of these advertisements relating to the Houses of Parliament will eventually be made ava dab le as a set for general educational purposes. I can also tell the honourable senator that my Department is at the moment undertaking a series of projects designed to meet the important educational need by providing material for media studies to Australian secondary schools. As part of that project, this year 2,000 booklets will be prepared in the form of radio broadcasting media kits for distribution in secondary schools throughout Australia</para>

          <para>The matter to which the honourable senator referred arises, I think, as a result of a request from one country to another. The request having been made and discussions having taken place between the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Government steps are being taken to ensure that those coming to Australia to occupy certain positions in this country have the requisite trade skills. As I said recently in answer to a question by another honourable senator, I think it fair to say that the Government adopts the attitude that all requests for migration to Australia will be based on the needs of Australia and on the merits of the individual application, and the requirements of the work force in this country will certainly be taken into account.</para>

          <para>Doe s the Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory know that in October or November last year New York State reduced its speed limit from 65 miles per hour to 55 miles per hour only because of the fuel shortage in America at that time? Does he know that this 10 mile per hour reduction in the speed limit produced a startling result in that the death rate on the roads in that State was reduced within a month by 20 to 25 per cent, resulting in the saving of nearly 1,000 lives? This was reported in the 'New York Times'. I ask the Minister: As the reduction of the maximum speed limit by only 10 miles per hour produced such a startling result in America within one month, will he introduce similar legislation in this Parliament and also strictly enforce all speed limits with the certain knowledge that by so doing he will, without any doubt, save lives on Australian roads and help to reduce the shocking road toll? I further ask the Minister: In an endeavour to make speed limits uniform throughout Australia, will he include in that legislation the following provision which was introduced and passed unanimously in the American Parliament on 3 December 1973:</para>
          <quote>
            <para>This law requires all States to establish a uniform speed limit of 55 miles per hour, and any State that does not comply within 60 days will be penalised by the loss of all Federal Funds for Highway projects.</para>

        <para>the Senate that a standing committee of Attorneys-General of Australia, the States, and New Zealand met a few weeks ago. When I was in New Zealand figures were published there of the death and injury rate from road accidents. As I recall it, during the months of this year there had been a dramatic fall in the death and injury rate. I think the figure was about half of what it had been in the previous year. This seemed to be associated directly with the lowered speed limit which had been applied. So I have no doubt that what the honourable senator is putting is correct. I have spoken to the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Bryant, about the experience in New Zealand. He has it in mind to introduce measures to help to curb the death and injury rate on the roads and the speed limit is in the forefront of his mind. I shall take into consideration the honourable senator's suggestion about using the allocation of Federal funds to induce the States to do likewise, but already we have heard the reaction of some honourable senators that even though lives will be saved in considerable numbers such action could represent an unpardonable intrusion upon the rights of the States.</para>

          <para>I will refer the question to the Minister for Labour. I have heard reports about congestion which occurs sometimes at Commonwealth employment centres. Recently the Minister for Labour introduced an innovation in South Australia when he set up what he called a self service employment service. There, because of the small staff involved, it is possible to have a number of indexes and listings of job vacancies. Employees in the area can look at the job vacancies, see what is available and make their own application. That is an innovation. I shall find out whether that system is to be developed in other areas and let the honourable senator know about it.</para>

          <para>The honourable senator raised a very technical question. I think it ought to be dealt with on the basis of the technical knowledge that is available and in the light of scientific considerations rather than on the basis of politics. My understanding is that a matter of quite serious concern is involved in Western Australia and that it touches upon the future of water supplies. The question of salinity and the  effect that the removal of the jarrah forests may have upon the salinity of the water is involved. I think it would be better if the question were referred to the Minister for the Environment and Conservation, and to the Minister for Science as I understand that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is involved in this matter in some way, so that a detailed reply can be given to the honourable senator.</para>

          <para>It seems unusual for Senator Wright, one of those people in this Senate who rise and talk about the dangers of centralism, to ask the Commonwealth Minister for Labour now to intervene in a State dispute. I already have made an offer to Senator Wright. I said to Senator Townley that if the State authorities, the employers and the unions wanted the Commonwealth Government to intervene in the dispute I was sure that the Minister for Labour, Mr Clyde Cameron, would be only too pleased to do so. Senator McManus introduced the argument that we might use Mr Foster. I said also that in my capacity as an old union official I would be prepared to try to settle any dispute. We cannot do more than that since it is a State dispute. However the Commonwealth Government would be pleased to assist the State Government or the State tribunals in settling the dispute. I know that the responsible State Minister and the State Wages Board have been trying to resolve it. I am also aware that another conference is to be held today. If the authorities cannot settle the dispute and if the State Premier wants us to intervene, I would recommend to the Federal Minister to do all that he can to settle it.</para>

          <para>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport, refers to the letter which was written and distributed a few days ago by the Minister for Transport and which refers to funds which the Government is making available to South Australia for the 'road safety improvement program', which program sets out some details of little more than traffic lights and line markings on roads. I ask: Will the Minister set aside some of these funds for the education of motor drivers generally, for the promotion of road courtesy, and for the encouragement of drivers at the wheel to behave with understanding and common sense? What is meant by the Minister's statement in the letter'to develop further policies which will reduce the toll of death and injury on the roads'?</para>

          <para>The Australian Transport Advisory Council, which comprises the Federal and State Ministers for Transport, meets to determine in what areas the allocation of funds should be made for road safety education. It seems that these days we are all becoming centra lists. The suggestion now is that the Australian Government should direct how  money allocated for this purpose is spent in South Australia. I do not think that is the intention, lt is the responsibility of the State Ministers in charge of roads to undertake this sort of task, and the Road Safety Council is concerned with finding new ways of improving safety. If this necessitates the allocation of funds, the Australian Government meets the requirements of the States so that they can implement their safety measures</para>

          <para>Yes , I have received a report on Mr Egerton's remarks, and he has also spoken to me. I have given the close consideration to his remarks which they deserve. Some of them were concerned with the uncomfortable conditions in which customs officers operate at the airports. I remind the Senate that the facilities at airports are primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Transport. I have written to him about Mr Egerton's comments concerning Brisbane Airport. I have asked the Department of Customs and Excise to prepare a full report on the matters raised by Mr Egerton. When I am in possession of this additional information, I will be in a better position to inform the Senate further. But I assure the honourable senator that when Mr Egerton raises a matter it has substance and it will be attended to.</para>

        <para>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister believe that he is reflecting the view of the majority of Australians in seeking to prevent the United States from setting up a naval installation on Diego Garcia, although this installation would help to keep the American presence in the Indian Ocean which is strategically vital to Australia? Why has the Prime</para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>Minister never made any formal protest to the Soviet Union against the extension of Soviet naval power in the Indian Ocean, which the Prime Minister presumably wants to neutralise, although Soviet naval power is the prior operative cause of the building of the American installation? Further, in view of the fact that, without protest from the Australian Government, the Soviet is increasing the number of its surface naval vessels in the Indian Ocean and that the Australian Government is opposed to a balancing United States naval presence, will the Prime Minister state what steps he proposes to take (a) to build a balancing Australian naval force; (b) to expedite the building of the naval base at Cockburn Sound; and (c) to ensure that Australia takes every possible step to maintain its control over the Cocos Islands as an essential staging base?</para>

          <para>I think all Australia accepts that the Prime Minister has presented Australia's views on these matters of defence and foreign affairs in an independent, forthright and courageous manner. He will continue to do so. What he says and what he does are in Australia's interests. I am not aware of the precise details of all the matters that the honourable senator raises; he is aware that this is not one of my responsibilities. I will refer the matter to the Prime Minister, who is now also Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs; and if he would like to comment further on the honourable senator's remarks, I will convey that further comment to the honourable senator and to the Senate.</para>

          <para>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Minerals and Energy. I refer to the statement made by the Prime Minister in the Parliament and repeated at his Press conference that the mining operations of Al west must have an Australian equity of at least 51 per cent. Does this mean that the same criterion will be applied to all future mining developments in Australia? In view of the difficulty in raising finance from the Australian public for new risk developments, does this statement mean that new mining projects which require large financial commitments will not be proceeded with? Is it envisaged that the new Australian Industry Development Corporation will therefore play a dominant part in all future Australian mining developments?</para>

          <para>The Copyright Act comes under my administration. The Attorney- General's Department has studied closely developments following upon public discussion last year of the market agreement between British publishers. British and Australian publishers conferred last September and as a result some changes were made to the market agreement for the benefit of Australian publishers. British publishers made recommendations to their members aimed at speeding up the availability of editions on the Australian market. Whilst these changes are to be commended some sections of the Australian community believe that they did not go far enough and will not overcome the problems that gave rise to the criticism of the market agreement. The Library Association is concerned that the changes will not afford any substantial</para>

        <para>My Department is making arrangements for a conference to be held in Sydney next month at which representatives with a wide variety of  viewpoints will speak on these matters. The importation provisions of the Copyright Act relating to books and the closed market situation will be discussed. My Department is taking steps to ensure that all interested persons, including members of the public at large, may participate. I expect a report of the conference to be made to me and on the basis of that report I hope to come to some conclusion on whether the present law and administration are adequate and whether any changes ought to be made in either the law or the administration.</para>

          <para>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. Is the Minister aware that Victoria receives the lowest proportional financial benefit of any of the States under the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads report? I will give 2 examples. Is the Minister aware that the per capita grant to Victoria is only $21.2 but that to Western Australia is $44, and that the per vehicle grant to Victoria is only $57.6 but to Tasmania is $ 113? Can the Minister explain why the social, cultural, economic and political heart of the nation receives such unfair treatment from this Government?</para>

          <para>The social conscience and heart of the nation, I think, receive possibly a smaller allocation because of the needs of such a State. I have reagan d 1 have with me briefings for a reply to a question which I expected— a report stating that Victoria was very much lagging behind and that it had criticised the slowness of the allocation of funds. The Minister for Transport had written to a number of States seeking a reply as to the money required. Whilst the Minister did receive replies from all States— I believe it was in December—Victori a was somewhat behind the other States in replying. The allocation of money for transport purposes is carried out under the same circumstances as an allocation of money for housing or any other allocation, namely, by agreement with the States. I would say that the proportion of the money made available or allocated would be in accordance with the needs of the States, in agreement with the Commonwealth Minister.</para>

What is the attitude to the scheme of the West Australian Farmers Union which is far more representative of wheat growers than the organisation mentioned by Senator Reid? Are there any issues still to be resolved between yourself and the Western Australian Government on wheat?</para>

          <para>Yes , I recall the question asked yesterday by Senator Reid. It is true that the West Australian Farmers Union does represent a wider cross-section of primary producers in that State than does the Pastoralists and Graziers Association. The West Australian Farmers Union has endorsed the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation's acceptance of the new wheat stabilisation scheme. I think it is pleasing to note that the West Australian Farmers Union recognises the fact that there was a considerable amount of give and take on both sides during the course of those negotiations. Insofar as the position of the Western Australian Government is concerned, I state that there are now no outstanding differences between the Western Australian Government and the Australian Government in respect of the stabilisation scheme.</para>

Is it a fact that the Albury-Wodonga development plan provides for 5 sites for government schools on a total area of 25 acres? In view of the readily available land in the proposed Albury-Wodonga area and in view of the fact that the educational facilities research laboratory has suggested that at least 8 acres is required for every 500 pupils and a further acre for each 100 pupils above that figure, will the Minister see that his colleague  investigates to find out whether this is correct and also reconsiders the position so that the situation will not be that inadequate sites will bug and hamper the future education of children in that area?</para>

For this reason it is necessary that our interest be extended to other countries, particularly in South East Asia. We have been encouraging an active and co-operative effort at all levels. During the recent visit of the Prime Minister to South East Asia he had significant discussions about this problem with some Heads of State. As honourable senators may be aware, Australia is a member of the United Nauons Commission on Narcotic Drugs. At the twenty-fifth session of the Commission in January last year Australia initiated a proposal to establish a special committee for the Far East region to make a study of the drug problem in this area.</para>

          <para>I bow to your wish and to the Standing Orders. I mentioned the part that I wanted to mention, anyway. Is the Minister aware that the Premier of South Australia in answer to a question asked on Wednesday of last week on the same subject by Mr Becker, the honourable member for Hanson, stated that there had been no approach by the South Australian Government with respect to this matter. I am rather confused about the subject at this stage and I would like the Minister to tell me which statement is accurate. If the statement of the Federal Minister is not accurate, I would like to know what approaches have been made with respect to an international airport in South Australia.</para>

          <para>I do not recall the details of the letter to which the honourable senator has referred. I presume that he referred to a question on notice. Obviously when the Parliament was prorogued the questions on notice were taken off the notice paper. A reply was sent as an act of courtesy. I cannot account for any delay which occurred in this respect. Apparently the honourable senator complains of some remarks in the letter contradictory to what the Premier of South Australia said. He refers to what the Minister said to the Premier of South Australia and immediately asks whether the Federal Minister is truthful in his letter and seeks to know what is the actual position. If the answer is interpreted correctly, I do not think that there is a contradiction between what was said by the Minister and by the Premier of South Australia. The answer necessarily expresses a truthful reply to the question in the way in which it was addressed.I will look into the matter and find out whether there are any other details.</para>

            <para>It is with extreme regret that I announce my resignation from the Victorian division of the Liberal Party of Australia. In amplification I say that 27 years ago, after my discharge from the Royal Australian Navy, I found myself very interested in and tremendously impressed by the political principles enunciated by the then Leader of the Liberal Party ofAustralia, Mr Robert Menzies, who was later to become one of Australia's truly great Prime Ministers. Over that 27 year period I think I can truthfully claim that, in sunshine and in shadow, in the Parliament and out of it, I have been a loyal and active member of the Liberal Party and have espoused what I believe to be a truly Liberal philosophy. I have shown strong opposition to socialist parties and, of course, to communism in all its shapes and forms.</para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Unfortunately, I now find myself at variance with many of the ideas and utterances coming from the organisational leadership of the Liberal Party in Victoria. This is only indirectly connected with my loss of endorsement since the policies I promote now will be similar to those I would have supported had I remained in the Liberal Senate team. There will be no attack by me on my former Party. I do not know who authorised the Victorian State President to declare in the Press some time ago that this was now a small '1' Liberal Party with whatever contradiction to tradition that implies. I am amazed that the Victorian State Secretary, Mr Leo Hawkins, declared in the Melbourne 'Herald' of 30 January this year: ' . . . dreadful things were done against the Party by successive Liberal Prime Ministers and Treasurers', including presumably our present leader, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden). I was more than surprised that a Victorian Young Liberal, now the new Federal President, announced that we have an affinity with the Australia Party. I reject these utterances completely. In particular I resent the unwarranted slur by Mr Hawkins upon Mr Snedden and his distinguished predecessors.</para>
          <para>On 4 March last year I wrote to the Victorian State Executive for an assurance of no collaboration with the Australia Party. To date I have received only a formal acknowledgment. I am a strong supporter of the traditional values upon which the Liberal Party was founded—value s</para>
          <para>irreconcilable with the defence and foreign policies of the Australia Party. It would be a disaster for Australia if this great Party which has governed the nation through a score of its greatest years were to disintegrate under the direction of the trendies and their colleagues. The Liberal Party represents the main viable opposition to the Whitlam Government— a Government whose removal must be a primary task for all thinking Australians. There is nothing wrong with the Liberal Party that an intelligent purposeful revival would not cure. Speaking generally, I shall continue to vote with the Liberal Party in this chamber. I take this opportunity of saying that no man has had a better group of colleagues than I have had in the collective members of the present Opposition in this chamber. I wish to express my thanks to them for their courtesy and assistance to me over the past 3 years.</para>
          <para>It is, therefore, with a mixture of regret and satisfaction that I announce the formation earlier this month in Victoria of the National Liberal Party. It has substantial genuine Liberal backing. I have accepted the position of its parliamentary Leader, and I shall lead a team of three, all former Liberals, at the forthcoming Senate election. We shall not remain alone for long. I wish to make it abundantly clear that there is no comfort for the Australian Labor Party in this move. We will maximise the anti-Labor vote. The interim platform of the National Liberal Party is firmly based on principles enunciated by Sir Robert Menzies, and they will be pursued vigorously by us, although in saying this I do not wish to imply that Sir Robert is a member of our Party. We will uphold the best traditional values of the Liberal Party which at present are under challenge, and we will apply modern intelligent policies to those principles—policie s which will be explained in detail when our campaign opens on 31 March.</para>
          <para>Mr President, I express my thanks to the Senate for the courtesy of allowing me to make this personal statement.</para>

        <para class="block">Not only do we have that answer but we have on record by the Treasurer public statement No.  19  which is dated  18  March  1974.  At page  12  of that statement the Treasurer has said publicly: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>There should be no doubt what that implies- a greater relative role for the public sector means a smaller relative role for the private sector. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In simple terms that statement means that the Government will have a great deal more to spend itself in order that the people as such will have less to spend by themselves. Another point which the Treasurer made in his statement should be taken much more to heart. This is his observation of the year 1945: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>This was the writing into the charter of the then Commonwealth Bank- now, of course, the Reserve Bank- the duty to exercise its powers in such a way as would best contribute to the stability of the currency, the maintenance of full employment and the economic prosperity of the people. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Stability of the currency and economic prosperity are 2 ingredients now missing from the present management-labour scene. What I suggest is happening in Australia under the present Government is this: It is turning Australia into a nation of Shylocks and pawnbrokers. There ought to be a 3-ball sign hanging outside the present Commonwealth Government premises. The total cost of interest to the Australian community in the 16 months of office of this Government has risen by approximately 3 1 per cent. We can work this back quite simply to the pacemaker, the Commonwealth bond rate, which stood at 6 per cent and which now stands at 8.5 per cent. That is a rise of 2.5 per cent on 6 per cent- over 31 per cent. That has affected the whole economic and interest rate scene. It has led to increasing interest rates and all that flows out of that. It has increased costs quite unnecessarily and exorbitantly. It has made home ownership more difficult. It has made acquisition of property more difficult. It has facilitated the transfer to the public sector and to government without any doubt at all. </para>
        <para>This was a conscious act of economic policy by this Government, as the Treasurer has stated. I believe that this has destroyed in this country the concept of what I call a property owning democracy which so many of us have stood for all our lives. I believe that this is a half thought through decision to make some taxation concessions available to some home owners. But what it does is confirm in the minds of people who look at these things- I invite honourable senators to do so- that the concession must mean an acceptance by the Government that it will continue with a high interest, dear money policy. That is what it has to mean. Otherwise, why would the Government do it? The simpler way is to reduce interest rates to a level which makes the situation what it ought to be. Later on my colleagues in the Opposition will deal exhaustively with the total problems of housing, of increased costs and this proposition of a housing taxation deduction for some but not all people. </para>
        <para>It is pertinent to comment that the average building society loan now costs 25 per cent more per month to repay than it did prior to this Government&#39;s recent action. I suggest that this proposed concession is not well thought through. It is full of strange positions which need further elucidation. There is an area which is not clear and there appear to many anomalies. But I do not think this helps those who rent houses. It does not help those who have to raise deposits to buy houses. Many of these people are low income earners. On analysis this concession could benefit the higher income earners more than the lower income earners. It does nothing to reduce the deposit gap. It is no reward whatsoever for those people who, in the past, have been thrifty and provident. I suggest to the Senate that a much better and more sensible and equitable method would have been to reduce interest rates to the old levels applying under the previous Government. Once again I draw attention to the fact that the real pacemaker in interest rates in society is the long term bond rate. That has risen by 3 1 per cent in about 14 months. Therefore the whole interest rate structure will have been adjusted upwards. </para>
        <para>I say to honourable senators that we are not a society which ought to encourage this kind of exorbitant money lending rate by anybody. The Government should not be leading in that process. A table is available showing the interest rate structures through time. I shall make that available by putting it on the table. It is rather large to incorporate in Hansard. It shows that at the end of June 1972 the 20-year long term bond rate was 5.99 per cent. At the end of January 1974 it was 8.50 per cent, a rise of slightly over 2.5 per cent on a then rate of a little bit less than 6 per cent. </para>

          <para>I understand that there is no Minister in the chamber to give leave but I have taken advantage of the courtesy of those few remaining honourable senators on the Government side to table this paper. It illustrates how little concern this Government has about this immense social problem flowing out of this massive increase in interest rates to the Australian society. This situation has been brought about by this Government. In the last couple of days there has been reference in this Senate and</para>
          </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>also Mr Tonkin, the Western Australian Premier, had a bit to say about this proposition of a refusal to create the Al west complex in Western Australia. This has come out of the general decision that one-third of any overseas money which comes in for an Australian project will go on interest free deposit with the Reserve Bank of Australia—pu t in escrow, as it were. What that really means is that the Government has increased the borrowing cost of large projects which have to have overseas funds to the point that many of them are no longer economically viable. I believe that this is a disastrous way to go on in Australia. I think that this policy has destroyed that project. It may well destroy a future steel project as it could well destroy many other projects.</para>
          <para>It has been stated publicly— I can produce this later for anybody who is interested—tha t Australia's capital requirements from overseas over the next 10 years are shown to be $ 12,000m. The annual rate of requirement is $ 1,200m every year for the next 10 years. This is what we need in overseas capital to finance our normal rate of development. I ask honourable senators to bear in mind that Australia traditionally, through being a high savings people, has financed 90 per cent to 91 per cent of its own development. So what we are talking about is not a substantial factor; it is about 10 per cent, and the 90 per cent we raise ourselves. But that 10 per cent is essential if this country is to grow and prosper. That amount is available. Sir Alan Westerman gave those figures at a seminar in Zurich, Switzerland, some time last year. They have never been denied. I used them myself in New York. They are regarded as reliable and acceptable figures. There will be a need for Australia to have overseas capital of that order over the next 10 years. Sir John Crawford has expressed a view on what I call a balance of payments obsession</para>
          <para>Over the last 3 to 4 years we have moved into a balance of payments surplus position because of the activities of the previous Government in fostering economic growth and overseas help. We have ourselves in a strong balance of payments position. What is currently happening is that that strong position, those strong reserves, are being thrown down the drain because of a series of irresponsible exercises by the current Government. The Crawford view can be read in this. He said that we want to be very careful that our balance of payments situation does not move adversely again. We have to be very careful, as sensible people, that we are not rude and arbitrary to those who helped us in the past from overseas. We ought to have a natural regard to our self</para>
          <para>interest, and we have. We should not deny the facts of our economic life. They are that we will need overseas capital. The Al west decision, taken as it has been taken, I believe has made it very difficult for us to attract anybody to this country in the future on any purposeful and worthwhile economic investment.</para>
          <para>Looking at this position I say that the Government has taken these actions out of what I call a balance of payments obsession with a surplus created by other people in earlier days. The Government believes that it has so much money that it can do anything it likes. But if it has more money in the system than it believes it currently needs it has a much better method of handling the problem than putting up interest rates. It could have quite simply called up as statutory reserve deposits any degree of surplus that it had and it could have released those funds. That is a much better method of managing. What the Government has done is to adopt a dear money policy. This is a mistake which has been shown to be a mistake. It has not worked overseas. The United Kingdom banking and financial circles tell us that they regret their own dear money policy. They are sorry that they have it. They are trying to correct the situation, but dear money is very hard to get down again. It would have been far better never to have adopted the style of policy which has been adopted by this current Government. I believe that dear money in this country is here to stay. I regret saying this. It upsets me considerably to say that this is the case. Mr Les Johnson, who is the Minister for Housing and other things in the current Government, on 13 March 1974 stated:</para>
          <quote>
            <para>We know that people have been affected by the high interest rates. We want to restore lower interest rates as quickly us we can. We are taking steps towards that end.</para>
          </quote>
          <para>I suggest that that is a piece of specious nonsense. There is no such intention. The latest action which has been taken confirms that the Government believes that the interest rates it has established are locked in. They are likely to have to continue them. This is going to be detrimental to a great number of projects in Australia o living standards, people's savings, the Australian growth rate—indee d all the things that we have believed in in this country. Various comments have been made by the Labor Party. Mr Whitlam, in a policy speech on 13 November1972, said:</para>
          <quote>
            <para>Labor will deliberately plan to reduce interest rates whenever practicable.</para>
          </quote>
          <para>Then there was a pamphlet entitled 'It's Time-Economics' which stated:</para>
          <quote>
            <para>Why has our raic of inflation grown so fast that the interest rate on money we saved no longer even covers the loss from inflation?</para>
          </quote>
          <para>The few honourable senators who are sitting in the Government benches and who feel that the subject is of any concern to them should ask themselves this question. It is very pertinent to them at present because they now have the job and are not doing it well. The long term bond rate is 8.5 per cent. The overdraft rate is one per cent higher at 9.5 per cent. Interest rates have risen dramatically across the whole scene—hous ing finance, consumer credit—an d they are at their highest level since Federation. Every government since Federation in this country has managed the interest rate scene better and at lower levels than has the current Government. I believe that the present level of interest rates is a reflection of the Government's economic management, and its economic mismanagement. The Bank of New South Wales said in January 1974:</para>
          <quote>
            <para>This drastic departure from Labor's avowed cheap money attitude is a measure of the serious inflationary pressure on thc economy and an unwillingness to tackle it by Government expenditure.</para>
          </quote>
          <para>What is happening in the present scene is that instead of relying on combinations of restraint, proper fiscal policies and some monetary policy, the Government has opted to try to do everything in a monetary style; but it has done everything in that style badly. It has done things in the wrong way. We are all going to have to pay very substantially for this in time.</para>
          <para>The Government should remember the speeches made in this Senate about the Budget when it was clearly demonstrated that the whole of the Labor Party's Budget last year was based upon a proposition that an inflation rate of 10 per cent was accepted as being necessary to balance the accounts. That is what is in the figures and that is what has been showing up. We now have an inflation rate well in excess of 13 per cent per annum. I will not say that it is any higher than that because later figures will come out at the end of March. The running rate was close to 14 per cent. While this particular situation persists, because of the actions and in actions of the present Government interest rates are going to be kept up by inflationary pressure. They could even become higher if inflationary pressures continue to mount. Think of the negative saving aspect of this in a thrifty country which has financed 91 per cent of its own development, where people have saved money in savings banks, in banks, building societies, life insurance and superannuation funds. That is what the people have done traditionally. We are a high saving people. People are going to be very disenchanted</para>
          <para>if inflation continues to mount at the current rate. They are going to find that it is not worth saving money. That can destroy the Australian attitude and can undermine the currency, the thing above all other things that the Government is charged to maintain. As a government, and as the authority in charge of the Reserve Bank ofAustralia, it must preserve the currency. If the currency fails the whole of society will fail with it.</para>
          <para>I have pointed out to honourable senators from the record from the Treasurer a conscious and purposeful decision to transfer money to government away from the private individual and the private corporation. The Government bears the responsibility in 2 ways for this inflationary problem which is part of the whole underlying scene. It has failed to implement and co-ordinate any real policy to handle inflation. It has accepted in its budgeting an implicit rate of 10 per cent. Now it is saying that it is all too hard and that inflation is imported from overseas, which is not by any means strictly true—onl y partly true. The Government has not come to grips with the problem, nor does it appear to want to do so. Equally, and this is where it is most culpable, it has raised its own rates in an inflationary market in competition with other borrowers. It did not need to do so. The Government has been saying consistently that there is much too much money around. If there was too much money around, why did the Government put up the bidding rate for money when it did not have to do so? There was no need to do this; too much money around meant that the rates could have come down, not have come up</para>
          <para>This has been proved demonstrably by the heavy over-subscriptions to the Commonwealth loans issued recently. This is clear evidence that there was money in the system and that it was available. The Government could have got what it needed by keeping rates down. Inflation, stimulated by the Government, was added to by high interest rates. The 2 things were running together and both these things are the pacemakers in all costs and in wage increases. They added to inflation totally, separately and together, and they can destroy the currency. We have in this country, because of that decision on high interest rates at a time that the Government did not need to do it, a situation of some gravity and some danger which the Opposition wishes to highlight because it wants to bring home to the Government the need to do something positive about this. There is an economic forecasting paper called 'Svntec' which said, on 5 February 1974:</para>
          <quote>
            <para>What the Government is doing in its hydra-headed way is accelerating the local cost structure via excessive wage push on one hand and on the other exposing local industry externally via tariff cuts and a high valued Australian dollar. Ultimately this combination is a prescription for disaster.</para>
          </quote>
          <para>Those honourable senators who read the financial pages will have seen a comment by Dr Bell in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' in which he pointed out that that combination of circumstances may well prove more than industry and employment in this country can sustain.</para>
          <para>I suggest to all honourable senators o members of the Opposition who are vitally concerned to demonstrate this agument, and to Government supporters who are not present and therefore do not care a bit about the whole matter— and to the Australian public which has a matter of very great concern like this in their hearts and minds, that this Government must stand condemned by its own actions for imposing these highest and most onerous inflation rates and interest rates since Federation. I think the Government has demonstrated quite clearly, by its own actions and by words out of its own mouth, that it is a dear money Party, a high taxation Party and a high inflation Party. That to me is a disastrous prescription for Australia in the future.</para>

          <para>-The Opposition has attacked the Government on the subject of interest rates. We are very conscious of the substance of the charge that it has made against us but we also are becoming accustomed to attacks of this nature on every front by the Opposition. Yet every step that the Government takes to curb inflation and to create conditions to reduce interest rates- action such as the reduction of tariffs right across the board- is condemned right along the line. We were condemned when we uplifted our exchange in relation to other currencies. This attack is just another of the snide attacks by the Opposition, having canvassed the length and breadth of Australia to try to deter the Australian Government from having a strong weapon, in the way of price controls, with which to fight inflation. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>We are faced today with one of the consequences of the inflationary situation that we inherited from the previous Government which had a long record of allowing interest rates to increase. I have in front of me a chart which shows that ever since the Opposition parties came to power in 1 949 there has been a progressive increase in interest rates. The increases were initiated by the government of the day. We saw between 1951 and 1961 a doubling of the interest rate on 2-year bonds from 2.18 per cent to 5.36 percent. From 1961 until 1 97 1 -the Opposition parties went out of office in 1972- the interest rate on the 2-year bonds was 6 per cent. That was an increase of nearly 2.5 times during the period that the Opposition parties were in government. </para>
        <para>The same situation applies in relation to bank overdrafts. While the previous Government was in office the interest rate on bank overdrafts increased from 4.5 per cent in 1950 to 8.25 per cent in 1 970. This group of people which is attacking us now built up the momentum that we are trying to come to grips with at the present time. We hear the Opposition lamenting the existence of inflation and virtually in the same breath condemning all the measures taken by this Government to come to grips with it. What is worse still, neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> nor any of his colleagues who sit beside him and behind him ever put forward any constructive proposal that could assist in coming to grips with this problem. It is our view that changes in interest rates are a legitimate instrument of economic policy. Increases in interest rates, as I have already pointed out, were part of the fiscal policy of Treasurers throughout the last 20 years. In 1970-1 did not refer to that particular year bank interest rates and long term bond rates were increased. The long term bond rates were increased by 1 per cent- from 6 per cent to 7 per cent- which proportionately was a considerable jump. In answering a question relating to the increase in bank interest rates the then Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bury,</inline> had this to say: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The demand for money is extremely strong. I would expect this rise in interest rates to weaken the demand. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I interpolate there that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bury</inline> was having the same problems that we are having. He feared the continuation and expansion of the inflationary influences in the economy. He realised that the increase in interest rates would tend to weaken demand. We are using this measure as one of the weapons with which to attack this most serious situation of inflation which exists here. In his answer <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bury</inline> continued: </para>
        <quote>
          <para class="block">But, above all. I would expect this increase to serve as a general signal and warning to the whole business and financial community that we are straining our resources and that it is not possible to extract a quart from a pint pot. This is its main purpose. Certainly, it will have the effect of dampening down some new activity at a time when the economy cannot stand it. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I believe 4that the approach taken by the then Treasurer was a reasonable one. What he said at that time is almost word for word what the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> has put forward as an explanation of the present situation. When the Government increased interest rates in September 1973 it did so as part of a broad anti inflation program. I would like to remind the Senate once again that we appealed to the people of Australia to assist us by giving us control over prices. There was no reciprocity from the States and no attempt by the States to assist us in this battle. So we have had to find alternative methods of dealing with it. When interest rates were increased in September 1973 the Prime Minister ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> ) said:  inflation must be fought on all fronts. There is no panacea; no simple solution achievable through one line of policy. But the fact that there is no simple solution to inflation does not mean that we can just throw up our hands in the face  of it.  On the contrary, we have to tackle it head on. </para>
        <para class="block">The tackling of inflation head on is a matter of trying to reduce some of the head of pressure that has built up over the years. I have been able to de most rate that this pressure has been building up over the last 20 years and increased in momentum particularly in the two or three years before we came into office. We cannot be accused of not facing up to our problems squarely and acting decisively. As a matter of fact, the argument that we are acting too decisively and facing our problems too squarely had been one of the weapons used to attack us in the electorate and in the Press. Nevertheless, if one believes in one&#39;s cause and has confidence that what one is doing is right, I am quite certain that the people of Australia will accept that what we are doing is in their interests. </para>
        <para>The problem which the increase in interest rates was designed to cope with was in reality another legacy of the inaction of the previous Government. A necessary pre-condition to slowing inflation is curbing the rate of growth in the money supply. During 1972-73, before we came into power, the money supply increased by 26 per cent, having increased by no less than 1 7 per cent in the first half of that financial year. The present figures show that we cut back heavily the increase in the money supply in the second half of that financial year and we did so by means of the revaluation of December 1973 and the consequential effects on the excessive external surplus and the December 1972 and February 1973 actions to curb capital inflow. The need for these measures had been apparent for a long time but the previous Government had lacked the courage <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> implement them. In addition, there were calls to the statutory reserve deposits of the trading banks in April and August 1973. The Treasurer and his advisers felt that these measures should be taken as part of the battle against inflation. The domestic deficit was cut back in our last Budget from $2 15m in 1972-73 to an estimated $ 162m this financial year. This is another weapon being used in the battle against inflation. </para>
        <para>Despite the fact that we have taken all these measures, liquidity remained excessively high, due mainly to the unrestrained increase in 1972. The prospective increase in the money supply, although well below that in 1972-73, remained too large, given the buoyancy of demand and the growing full employment economy. We have critics who would have us put pressure on the situation by throwing people out of work. But the members of my Party and of the Government are proud of the fact that people can obtain useful employment in this country, that business statistics show a boom in nearly every direction and that company profits are high. We have been favoured by nature with good seasons. If we can come to grips with and stabilise this inflationary process this country will be on the pig&#39;s back. One contributing factor to the excessive increase in the money supply- the external surplus- has been dealt with determinedly by this Government, as I pointed out, by means of our tariff and exchange policy and our lifting of the value of our dollar in relation to other currencies. </para>

            <para>It was an effort, although subsequently we found by investigation that the other countries with which we were dealing were very quick off the mark and immediately adjusted their currencies so that they could mop up whatever advantages we had. We did not have the experience perhaps to know that they would do this. We thought that they would have a little bit of stability, relatively. However we have just seen all these currencies go practically haywire while ours is looked upon as one of the most stable currencies in the western world. It was at the domestic level that there was need to soak up liquidity by draining off surplus funds from the private sector into Government securities. These securities were gilt edged. The people were lending their money to themselves. They were backed by resources which Australia has and which will become greater as a result of our policy whereby we will buy back our own farm, in which I include bauxite, the iron ore industry and so many other farms that have been sold out. According to John McEwen we were selling out a little bit of the farm each year. We intend to buy back a little bit of the farm and let the Australian people own their own large farm. Getting the people to invest in themselves makes it possible for us to buy back the farm so that we make a further advance in the battle against inflation.</para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>The way to achieve the objective was not by a credit squeeze but by trying to put an end to excessive liquidity. Further, to achieve this objective we had to make Government securities more attractive and more competitive with other assets, including real assets. This could be done only by increasing yields significantly. That is exactly what we have done. By increasing interest rates in Government securities, the Government has sought to encourage more savings. If one looks at the figures one will see that that is exactly what has happened.</para>

          <para>- It is altogether appropriate that the Senate should be debating this subject as a matter of urgency. As you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> will know, it relates to the imposition by the Government of the highest and most onerous interest rates since Federation. It is appropriate that we take time to discuss this subject. The Senate should take occasion to remind the Parliament and the nation that the very basis of our society, the very fabric of our style of life and the very core of our community and neighbourhood life, is threatened by this increasing interest rates situation: A high and rising rate of interest which, unfortunately, gives no sign of abating. It is appropriate also that, among other things, housing and matters related to it, including matters implied by the reference to housing, are seriously and deeply affected by the increasing interest rate. This is a matter of concern not only to our young people but also to people who make up a wide cross section of our community. The present interest rate situation therefore presents a very serious threat to so much of the nation&#39;s stability. The matter is also one of urgency because we see with regret and disappointment, and notice with some concern, that the Government is not doing anything about the increasing interest rates or, indeed, high interest rates. </para>

        <para>It seems to me that two major factors stand out. One is the oft repeated statement- I take leave this evening to repeat it again- made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> in his policy speech. He said: </para>

He assured the people that their savings would be good and would have maximum value because interest rates would be contained and costs would not get out of hand. But I think it is important to point out in this urgency debate today that the Prime Minister&#39;s promise, I regret to say, has been rendered unfulfilled and that the cause of hardship and uncertainty has been increased because, it will be seen, there is no deliberate plan by the Government to reduce interest rates. We have the highest interest rates since Federation. </para>
        <para>The other matter to which I wish to draw attention is that the underlying facts of this situation disclose the pace setting pattern of the Government. The long term bond rate is at 8.5 per cent with the overdraft rate one per cent higher than that at 9.5 per cent. This being the pace setting pattern throughout the loan structure of this country, the progression of increasing rates of interest has continued. It does not matter whether one considers housing finance, consumer credit or any other form of lending institution, they all have known this spiral. It is important to point out now that no other Government in our history has permitted interest rates to go so high as they are today. I draw attention again to the Prime Minister&#39;s statement about what he called a deliberate plan to reduce interest rates. That plan has been rendered completely ineffective. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it seems to have been completely abandoned. I draw attention also to the grave social consequences of this inactivity on the part of the Government and to this ineffectiveness of the Prime Minister in not giving effect to that which he promised the people. </para>
        <para>A high interest rate policy places the burden on that section of the community which can least afford to carry it. At all times there are various types of borrowing and lending. For example, people in the senior levels of banking and finance or in big business can, maybe, by the structure of their own concerns manage to a certain extent the problems which are created by high interest rates. But I draw attention this evening to the small depositor and, particularly the man- or woman- or young person who wants to acquire or build a home. He is placed in incredible difficulty by the increasing problem and turns to such institutions as a building society whereby there is a co-operative way to get a reasonable return for any investment that he may make. He may have only a small amount to invest but, by the same token, he can obtain a maximum loan- and by obtaining that loan he is able to buy, build or establish a home and so provide for himself some real estate which will grow in value as years go by, from which base he can make a contribution not only to his own life and future but also to our total community and well being. Further, by his involvement in an organisation such as a building society he can make an investment and, with a reasonable return, acquire the maximum loan. What is more important, he can expect to pay reasonable interest to the organisation and will have maximum time in which to repay the loan. These organisations, and through them the people concerned, have been seriously affected and hit by the Government&#39;s inactivity regarding the high interest rate pattern. </para>
        <para>Interest rates in other places and in other lending institutions have increased markedly. This has had a very serious effect on organisations such as co-operative and permanent building societies. Funds have been diverted, and the housing loan program, of course, has become confused, because those organisations are caught up in the multitudinous, complex and spiralling problems that have followed the high interest rate pattern. The problems of obtaining loan funds have become very much confounded. All this has flowed through in a variety of ways to increase costs on everything that an organisation may wish to provide or which people may wish to buy. The high interest rate pattern cuts right across the plans of anyone who wishes to buy, establish or build a home. It is socially disadvantageous for the community because, interestingly enough, it strongly affects the greatest number of people in our community. There is no point in the Government saying that the Prime Minister has announced recently that payments of interest on mortgages are to be an allowable deduction from income tax. I suggest to the Government that this tends to be a discriminatory procedure because the people who stand to benefit most are those who have already established their homes or have a program of payments to purchase a home. This is of no particular help to the people with whom we are concerned in this debate this afternoon- those people who are trying to finance their homes, trying to establish their homes, and who are gravely affected by the high interest situation. </para>
        <para>I underline this by noting in this debate that the Minister for Housing and Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> acknowledged this latter situation, and the others which I have mentioned, when he referred only a few days ago in the Parliament to high interest rates. I will quote a reference from his speech which was made on 13 March. He said: </para>

        <para class="block">To me this statement seems to obscure the fact and tends to mislead the public. I hope that the Government will give some indication today as to what it is doing about lowering interest rates. </para>
        <para>I suggest that that statement is causing widespread confusion in both the Department of Housing and Construction and the Treasury and that it has aroused expectations and speculation throughout the financial community. The Government should very soon announce the full details of the steps which it is proposing to take to reduce interest rates. We need a comprehensive and integrated series of anti-inflation strategies that would enable the Government to put before the Senate in a proper statement its plan for a progressive reduction in interest rates. If it does this then certainly we will welcome it and so too will a large number of other people. But we ask the Government to give some indication of what its plans are in this sphere because, after all, the availability of funds for home purchase is a key factor in maintaining the level of the housing program. </para>
        <para>I turn in my concluding remarks to a comment made and issued today by the Housing Industry Association. The Association has said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Because of its ability directly to control activities of some of the major sources of housing finance, and to exert a major influence on the general financial climate of the economy, the Commonwealth Government has been in a position to markedly affect levels of activity in the housing industry. </para>
          <para>The major developments in the housing finance field in the last 20-odd years, which have added greatly to funds for housing, have been the entry of the private banks into the savings bank field, thus breaking the monopoly of Commonwealth and State Government operated savings banks, and the rapid growth of the permanent building societies . . . </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth Government is able directly or indirectly to control a large proportion of the finance for housing, although the two largest private sources- permanent building societies and finance companies- at present not directly controlled- have been the ones which have grown fastest. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In that statement the Housing Industry Association goes on to point out that policies which were introduced in September last year brought about a sharp increase in interest rates and the permanent building societies were not in a position to raise their deposit rates to compete in the open market for funds. Honourable senators will recall that earlier in my remarks I drew attention to this. The Association also pointed out that the inflow and retention rates of permanent building societies dropped sharply, causing a sharp reduction in new loans advanced. The point that I am making in this reference to the Association&#39;s comment is contained in this paragraph which reads: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The increase in interest rates on housing loans, coupled with higher costs of housing and of residential land which require a higher amount of loan finance, has meant that many potential home buyers cannot meet the necessary repayments from statutory income and have been forced to defer home purchase to save more money to overcome the resultant &#39;deposit gap&#39;. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This is the enormous problem which is affecting so many people. This is why so many people are affected by the high rates of interest. This is the key to the many problems which have been occasioned by the high rate of interest. I call upon the Government as a matter of urgency to do something about implementing the promise which the Prime Minister gave at the election and to take note of the fact that there are a large number of people today who are concerned about, who are affected and hurt by, the imposition by this Government of the highest rate of inflation that we have had in the last 74 years. </para>

          </talker>
          <para>- The Senate is debating a matter of urgency sponsored by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> on behalf of the Opposition. The terminology of the motion refers to the highest and most onerous interest rates since Federation. Speaking for the Government, I counter that by pointing out that the buoyant economy is a deliberate result of our policy to redistribute incomes and to revise priorities. I commence my remarks on the subject upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> concluded his remarks before the suspension of the sitting for dinner. He referred to the building industry and to housing. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The position seems ironical to me. Opposition senators know in their hearts that unquestionably any government in a democratic country like Australia, whether it is composed of members of the present Government or members of the present Opposition, could do many things if it had additional powers. We know when we study governments of the far right and governments of the far left that they have certain powers that are used, legally or for that matter illegally, that we do not possess. This Government recognised that there were certain economic fluctuations and it sought additional power to deal with them. But we have been lectured for the last 6 weeks on the evils of centralism. Dealing with the housing theme, I would explain the position in this way: In Sydney the capital city of New South Wales, the State that I represent, one can see a myriad skyscraper buildings. If work ceased on them for the next 20 years, it would be found that not one of them would have made a contribution towards a better society in Sydney. </para>
        <para>This Government has plans for massive hospital construction in the outer western suburbs of Sydney and the corresponding areas of Melbourne and Adelaide. But the plain fact of the matter is that with the scramble for materials and the diversion of capital we have little or no control over those plans. The Minister for Housing, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Les</inline> Johnson, and the Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean,</inline> have used certain economic implements in an endeavour to control these fluctuations, but they have virtually had one hand tied behind their backs. Obviously in a democratic society it is difficult to direct and maintain the flow of materials and, for that matter, capital in the way that one would like to. Whether we speak of West Germany, the Britain of Heath or the Britain of Wilson, I think that we would accept the fact that it is far better to live with a certain high degree of inflation than to have the wheels of industry grind to a halt. Some of the theories that have been advanced by Edward Heath of Britain and by some of the spokesmen opposite do visualise a return to that ill-fated Holt era during the 1 960s with the famous horror Budget. It can be well argued that in some of the areas of financial fluctuations some price increases could have been curbed. After all, the central theme of our argument has been that in each of these dramatic national wage cases the judge or the bench- not the government of the day, mark you- has accepted the fact that industry should accept perhaps a 7 per cent imposition on its production costs. It would be reasonable to assume as a natural corollary that there would be an acceptance, even voluntarily, of current prices. We know that this does not happen. </para>
        <para>I say particularly to members of the Country Party, who ought to be well aware of the position, that I have seen situations in which we have redressed certain imbalances on behalf of farmers, yet we have found that retailers have  damaged the marketing position of farming products by imposing excessive price increases. This is a dilemma that faces every government today, but because of the Labor Government&#39;s trade policy that was expounded and developed overseas by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr J.</inline> F. Cairns, we find that today we have given rural industries permanent markets for years ahead. We have arranged trade agreements with countries such as East Germany, North Korea and the People&#39;s Republic of China. Let us be honest about the position. In years gone by when Canada moved in on the Chinese wheat export trade, Australia was involved in a sort of double standard as to whether it was contrary to the concepts of our rigid foreign policy to trade with China. That has all gone. The fact that we have provided permanent markets is far more important than the less important argument about subsidies. It is not much use subsidising industries, whether they be manufacturing industries or rural industries if it is not known where the markets will be. We have reversed the priorities, and that has been our broad attitude. </para>
        <para>I think that one of the questions to be asked during an inflationary period is: Who makes the most worthwhile contribution in the community? I have had a lifetime in the trade union movement, and notwithstanding the fact that during the last 8 years I have sat in the Senate in a much easier atmosphere than that of working with my hands, it still amazes me how young people can leave school at 1 8 years of age, work in a clerical position in one of these sky-high office buildings and receive excellent amenities and wages, while the Miners Federation will probably have to indulge in a rather vigorous industrial campaign to achieve comparable conditions and reasonable wages. What I am expounding in the Senate was expounded in Britain during the unnecessary miners &#39;strike there. </para>
        <para>I wish to refer to one of the problems that besets our economy today. In doing so, I might coin a term used by a former Prime Minister, the late Ben Chifley, when he referred to the people who really keep the wheels of the economy rolling. We see the situation today in which some loco engine driver has to sign on for work at 4 a.m. or a miner&#39;s  deputy  has to go down into a mine at some ungodly hour and yet loses his wage relativity with luxury industries. But this same society is able to produce a man named Barton who can make a big financial kill and then go to another country. It is no wonder that on many occasions the trade union rank and file members feel that the processes of arbitration, whether they be conciliation or decisions to be handed down by judges, are not fast enough. I know that there comes a time when wage demands have to be equated with the overall national aspirations of a country. But unfortunately, with these distorted values today, people look up to big developers because they can make a quick dollar. This is the sort of thing that develops this counter-militancy from the trade union movement. It also has an effect on the average and small businessman. He cannot get into all these tax lurks that have been part of the game for the big entrepreneur. </para>
        <para>I repeat that the present Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean,</inline> is endeavouring to block up these taxation loopholes. He is going further than that. I know that further details will be given in subsequent debates in the Senate. On the question of giving justice to people who have taken out home loans, I say that we are endeavouring to introduce a formula that will bridge the gap. But I repeat, worthy or not as the tables on interest payments may be that have been advanced by the Opposition, the plain fact of the matter in regard to building materials is that while the Australian Government is not allowed to have the additional powers, and while the States, if they do have the powers, cannot control the black marketing across State borders involving bricks, timber and other commodities, the priorities of the building industry will be distorted. I say this without any inhibitions whatever: I would like to see a building czar, whether appointed by the State Premiers or by the Australian Government, who would issue cease work orders in regard to every skyscraper under construction in metropolitan Melbourne and Sydney. </para>
        <para>Honourable senators opposite know in their hearts that the people erecting such buildings are anti-social. They make no attempt to become involved in the community. Look at the miserable contribution that the major developers made to the flood relief funds during the recent flooding. They have been bloodsuckers living off normal building activities. Then consider their blood brothers. When you talk about cheap money have a look at the various insurance companies. I have heard honourable senators opposite bleat about the decision of the Queensland Trades and Labour Council to place a ban on the construction of the AMP Building in Brisbane. But what do we find? I interjected when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie</inline> was in full flight making his speech. I said to him: Do you defend these insurance companies?&#39; He could not. All that could be said is that the clients did not read the small print, but if that is the concept of business that is held, morality does not count. No insurance companies are guilty, some naive folk would say. On every occasion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has argued the need for more effective control of insurance companies the Opposition has b lea ted about socialism. There is no question about it. </para>
        <para>We are not wedded to the idea of an automatic freezing of credit. We want to improve society. I challenge honourable senators opposite to get out on the hustings and tell the people that it is accepted business enterprise. We may all come into the Senate with different ideas. Perhaps we should put aside our boyhood, but I cannot forget the Westinghouse Brake Company of North Strath field on the western suburbs railway line. Its management took a fiendish delight as late as 1937 and 1938 in saying to men looking for work: &#39;Get off the premises or we will prosecute you&#39;. The Australian Gas Light Co., another industrial giant, was also notorious for its industrial relations. When its managing director retired recently he had the temerity to question the manifestation of Australian nationalism because we are determined that we will control the pipeline that is to be built in Australia. </para>
        <para>Earlier today an honourable senator opposite I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster-</inline> interjected about the percentage of foreign capital. We have never disputed the need for foreign capital but we have said that it must be allowed in on our terms. It is not an important ideology. Anyone looking for precedents should turn his eyes to Latin America. I have in mind, for instance, pre-junta Chile, Peru, Bolivia and other South American countries, most of which have military governments. Their citizens were certainly not raised in socialist households, much less by the tenets of Marxism, an ideology to which I do not subscribe. Purely on a socialist evaluation those countries are demanding at least equity with foreign capital. I may be going a little beyond the subject of this debate, but my personal viewpoint has been that John Gorton got a somewhat better agreement with Esso/ BHP than did his 2 predecessors as Prime Minister. But that does not mean that if Rex Connor, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> were negotiating we would not get a better deal. </para>
        <para>I ask honourable senators opposite to ponder on what I am about to say. There have been misgivings today- and justifiably- about Indonesia and its attitude towards civil liberties. When we have raised the subject I have noticed honourable senators opposite line up in their ranks of defence because they have the vague idea that they are reacting against any semblance of socialism. However, the present Indonesian Government has imposed far harsher terms- the word &#39;harsh&#39; is really erroneous- on the foreign oil companies engaged in off-shore drilling. Nobody would claim that the Indonesian Government has become left wing. I am amazed by all the apologies that are made by the Opposition when we are rightly concerned about maintaining the outflow of capital to foreign countries. Irrespective of which party is in office, the Australian companies can be lumped together. Far be it for me to defend Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd. At least taxes can be imposed on the big companies, but it may be found that the directions are given from outside the boardrooms. </para>
        <para>Let us have no illusions about it. Even if certain inbuilt advantages are accepted- we have the Bass Strait oil- the plain fact of the matter is that when it comes to bunker fuelling it is then that the fangs of the oil companies are shown. Our Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> indicated that trying to grind Australia down just was not on. The days of Australia as a Crown colony as in the time of Governor Phillip and Governor Macquarie are finished. We realise that a certain price must be paid to develop our national economy, but I would call it moderate nationalism. We do not run away from it. We have injected massive expenditure into education and if we are given assistance or a fair go from the Opposition Parties we will do the same in the field of health. Some inconveniences may be experienced but the economy is being kept within reasonable bounds. We are deliberately deciding that immigration numbers will be geared to the number of jobs available and not to exploitation. </para>

          <para>-The urgency motion we are discussing refers to the disgraceful rates of interest chargeable in this country today on borrowed funds. Before we criticise we have to decide whether the situation has arisen from the normal market fluctuations or the market forces that tend to cause fluctuations in industrial rates, or whether it has emanated from deliberate official policy. Those of us who take an interest in these matters must readily recognise that both factors can affect the interest rates in the country. The reasons given for the situation are quite varied. Some people presume that higher interest rates will slow credit and therefore slow demand. There is not much proof in the marketplace that it largely follows that pattern. Indeed, if some steps are not taken to prevent the influx of overseas capital attracted by high rates of interest in a politically stable country such as Australia, even more demand may be created than existed before the increase in interest rates. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>On this occasion before criticising the Government we must decide whether the dominant factor has been the market forces or the Government&#39;s deliberate policy. I propose to quote from no less an authority than the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> and to ignore what was said by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> when endeavouring to square off in this House a few nights ago. He then suggested that the situation had arisen from the pressure of overseas circumstances. I do not think that he took any real part in the actions leading to an increase in interest rates, but I believe that the Prime Minister primarily understood what the Labor Party was quite deliberately doing, particularly to people with whom Labor had entered into a contract in the last election campaign in order to win their votes. I wish to quote from an address given by the Prime Minister as recently as 14 March. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>We have elevated the status and importance of the trading banks in Australia to a position they have not enjoyed for more than 20 years. We did this by removing the ceiling on bank interest rates for negotiable certificates of deposit. In that way we enabled the banks to compete vigorously for funds on the money market. Instead of being the first institutions to feel the effects of necessary monetary restrictions, the banks are the beneficiaries: other institutions arc forced to compete with them. I suggest that the extraordinary success of our February loan, which attracted $509m in cash subscriptions - </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Of course, the increased interest rates may have helped-  is evidence of the new role we have given to the banks. The private banks- for so long anathema to Labor governments arc back on top. I welcome the fact. They are great institutions. My only regret is that 1 have yet to hear any acknowledgement from them of the fact that a Labor Government has restored their position as the dominant financial institutions in this country. </para>
        <para class="block">That cannot be interpreted in any other way than a deliberate statement of policy, lt is clear that the Prime Minister of this country was discarding completely the interests of the little men buying a home, people endeavouring to buy on time payment a refrigerator or washing machine, and the other people in the indebted class in the community. They are seldom the wealthy unless their indebtedness is attractive to them as a tax deduction when expanding their businesses. I renounce the Labor Party that is prepared to put that forward as a deliberate act of policy. I hope there are Labor men in this House who will try to explain it away. I see no explanation for it. The increases in interest rates that were forced upon the community were a deliberate act of policy by the Government and had nothing to do with the market circumstances of the time. Proof of the deliberateness of the intent was the fact that the Australian currency was revalued in  an  endeavour to stop the influx of overseas capital, to coincide with the increase in interest rates. These facts show quite clearly that the Government recognised what the results could be. Yet, this was done to the detriment of those people in the community who could least afford to pay. I refer to the indebted class whose interest rates are not claimable as a taxation deduction, as the debts of businesses invariably are. </para>
        <para>More shocking in its intent was the contract that was deliberately manoeuvred by the Government. In a statement issued by the Prime Minister the reason why the contract was deliberately manoeuvred was given, lt was that, whilst the opportunity was given for the credit institutions of this country to charge 10 per cent, they were not obliged to pay more than 3.75 per cent to those members of the community who had smaller sums of money in savings accounts in banks. That injustice is still being inflicted on the public. I know that the Government has made a move now- after 12 months of effort, particularly by the Democratic Labor Party, to expose the attitude of the Labor Government to the people it allegedly represents- to make tax deductible interest payments that are made on loans for home building purposes. But as yet, in spite of questions we have asked deliberately in this House and in spite of our opposition to Government proposals which do not recognise this need, no move has been made by this Government to remove this injustice from the poorer people of this community who are receiving interest at a paltry 3.75 per cent on their money deposited in the savings banks. The banks are at liberty to re-lend that money at interest rates of up to 10 per cent. Indeed, interest rates of 10.25 per cent are being offered by large companies to attract capital for credit purposes to expand businesses. That, of course, is understandable. The large companies do not really pay 10.25 per cent on that capital. This is a cost of running a business and the cost of expanding a business and this sum is tax deductible from profits. </para>

If companies pay tax of 50c or 60c in the dollar on profits additional tax payments over and above that level are made on the figure obtained by subtracting from their income expenditure incurred in the development of the business. These are some of the great injustices that have occurred.</para>
          <para>What has been the result of this action? The only excuse the Government offered to the people of this nation for its action was that it was taken to curb inflation. Previous governments of Australia, of a different political complexion, had pushed up the rates of interest by much more modest amounts. In one single year of my membership of the Senate I made 12 speeches on this subject. In answers to questions Ministers have asked why we should dare to propose our theories in opposition to those of the members of the Treasury. As far as I am concerned that is a frightening aspect. People involved in government become so enslaved by the theories of those who live to some extent, in relation to business and an understanding of the behaviour of currency and interest, in an ivory tower that they think nobody should dare to challenge, with ideas and thoughts of their own that may not be the accepted academic theory of the day, the views of those in Treasury. A peculiar facet of economics is that nobody suggests that a decision be based on facts. These persons always have an economic theory, unproven by events. Yet the proof is there in the everyday way of life. The Liberal Party started with an interest rate of approximately 3.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent. It gradually increased interest rates to 7 per cent and 7.5 per cent. After many attempts to try to prove the fallacy of this action to members of this Parliament, members of the Labor Party were beginning to join me in my belief. Yes, they were opposed to increased interest rates. The Labor Party made this a part of its policy for the last election campaign.</para>

          <para>It had a mandate from the people to reduce interest rates. The Labor Party was hardly on the Treasury bench, after it had rid itself of the important things like raiding the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, before it raided the pockets of the poor by  increasing interest rates, not by one-half of 1 per cent, but by 2 per cent. But these increased</para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>interest rates did not affect everybody. Oh, no! The Prime Minister said that the Labor Party took this action for the private banks, to put them back into the position which he felt that they should enjoy in the community. This action was not taken to help the little people who had their money in savings accounts. No movement was proposed in interest rates in respect of those accounts. These people are not in a position in a period of inflation to invest their money, as they may need it in the near future to meet an emergency. These people cannot withdraw their money from their banks when, as the result of the actions of this Government inflation is running at the rate of 13 per cent or 14 per cent, and hide it under the carpet as they may once have been able to do with golden sovereigns. The little people have to leave their money in the bank and suffer the loss inherent in receiving interest payments at only 3 per cent to 3.75 per cent on their money. At the same time the value of that money is evaporating because of inflation which currently is at a rate of 12 per cent to 13 per cent.</para>
          <para>I have raised the question here of the effect of this situation on those children whom we teach to save in their little savings accounts with school banks. They are being robbed by the policies of an Australian Prime Minister. Inflation in our economy is increasing every day because of the stupidity of his Government's policies. The interest rates on the modest savings of these children are fixed at 3.75 per cent by his policies. We encourage children to put 20c or 50c a week into a savings bank account and the Government, through the rate of inflation, robs them at the end of the year by 20c of every 50c that they bank. The Government calls that honesty of purpose and it wonders why we have introduced an urgency motion in this chamber today.</para>

          <para>Well, that is a theory, of course, like all the other theories. Was the rate of inflation at 20 per cent before the Labor Party came to office? Inflation runs at 20 per cent now. Was it 20 per cent before the Government increased interest rates to 10 per cent? No, it was not. When the Government was told that by increasing interest rates it was adding to the rate of inflation it said that Treasury officials had advised the Government to increase interest rates. Honourable senators opposite know that such action is against Labor Party policy. They know it has always been against Labor Party policy. If I were still in the Labor Party—than k God I am not— I would be ashamed of it. The</para>

          <para>Labor Party would never have got away with this action under the leadership of a Curtin or a Chifley. They would not have allowed the Labor Party to rob the poor in the way in which it is robbing them today.</para>
          <para>Honourable senators opposite know, as I know, that when interest rates are increased to the level at which they stand today the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. I ask Government senators to tell me what else could happen. I ask them to tell me how the poor can lend money at 10 per cent interest. Of course they cannot. They are the payers and they are on the paying end of the increased interest rates. We then have a Prime Minister who says that he took this action for the private banks. He indicated that he was putting the banks back on top; he boasts about this. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Murphy) came into this chamber and said: 'Look, we did not do it because we wanted to but because we were forced to do it'. I suggest to anyone who is interested in this subject that he should read the Prime Minister's speech on this matter. He should decide whether he is running the Treasury and the Treasurer (Mr Crean) or whether they are running him. The Prime Minister's statement is, to me, unequivocal and unforgivable from any politician or Australian Prime Minister. It is especially unforgivable when it comes from an allegedly Labor Prime Minister who promised to reduce interest rates. The Labor Party members in this House rant week after week about how their Party has a mandate from the people. The Government does have a mandate from the people to reduce interest rates. If it is not prepared to carry out that mandate I warn the Government now that the DLP will never let up on it. Will interest rates be increased again?

          <para>. . . or the 5 political parties in the Opposition now expect us to take them, because one week ago today in another place the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) moved an urgency motion. The terms of that urgency motion were that the House of Representatives discuss the following matter as one of urgency:</para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The imposition by the Government of the highest and most onerous interest rate since Federation.</para>
          <para>The motion before the Senate is taken verbatim from the motion before the House of Representatives last Wednesday. Today, because the proceedings are being broadcast to the Australian people and because for the first time there are four if not five Opposition parties, they have decided to show their strength and their mettle to the Australian people by saying: 'We have been able to copy our friends in the House of Representatives and come forward with the same urgency motion that was discussed a week ago there'. With respect to our friends opposite, it is like yesterday's men trying to plan and develop for the future.</para>
          <para>It is interesting to note that in their urgency motion and also, I think it is fair to say, in the terminology of their remarks today hardly one word has been spoken about what they believe should be done by this Government to solve many of the problems. They have simply refused to admit, both in their motion and in their speeches today, that inflation is a world wide problem. They conveniently ignore the high interest rates which have been prevailing in England under, until a fortnight ago, a Conservative Government—interes t rates running at about 14 or 15 per cent. They conveniently ignore the high interest rates in the United States. They conveniently ignore the high interest rates on the Japanese yen. The 5 Opposition parties also ignore, in the discussion today, the dependency of this country on foreign money as a result of policies pursued by a series of conservative governments in this country over 23 or 24 years. The year in which the highest volume of money was created in Australia was the year in which honourable senators opposite went out of office.</para>

          <para>Yes, compared with this year. In that year the volume of money put into circulation by the policies of the previous Government, by the policies of the McMahon Government in a deliberate attempt to save their political necks, was an increase of approximately 25 per cent. That was the genesis of the present degree of inflation in Australia. I am prepared to admit that other forces have been operating since then.</para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>These gentlemen opposite ask us and the Australian people to put the clock back 25 years when they won an election against one of the best governments that this country has ever seventh e Chifley Labor Government. They were elected on a slogan 'Put value back into the pound'. I wonder what happened to the value of the pound and after that the Australian dollar between 1949 and 1972, when the Australian people had the common sense to throw them out. The greatest rate of inflation that ever occurred in this country was in the first 3 years of the Menzies-McEwen reign. But what was the position in 1972? I have already said that in that year the volume of money put into circulation as a result of the Budget of the McMahon Government in August 1972 increased by approximately 25 per cent. But what was the position? In addition to that heavy volume increase of money in circulation we had record inflation and we certainly had rising unemployment. Whatever else our political opponents might say to us today— they can talk as much as they like about high interest rates and about inflation—the problem of unemployment, the scourge of unemployment, has been tackled by this Government.</para>
          <para>I am the first to admit that there is inflation in this country, as there is in every other developing country. No simple solution can be achieved through one particular line of policy, but the fact that there is no simple solution to inflation does not mean that we can throw up our hands in the face of it. On the contrary, we must tackle it, and we must tackle it head on. Opposition members in their speeches today and the Leader of the Opposition in another place, Mr Snedden, have criticised the higher interest rates imposed by this Government. No doubt the Leader of the Opposition has legitimate fun at the expense of the Government on this question. Surely the Opposition is not facing up to the point that higher interest rates were necessary in order to bring the monetary situation under control and that it got out of control in the latter part of 1972.</para>

          <para>I have already explained that to the Senate. I told the Senate that in a desperate attempt to save the political necks of honourable senators opposite and to save the political neck of the then Government, that Government adopted certain fiscal policies which increased the flow of money in circulation in the latter half of 1972 by approximately 25 per cent, and that is the problem which this Government, in its first 16 months of office, has had to tackle.</para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Our friends opposite have also asserted that home owners are worse off under the Australian Labor Party than under their Government. Actually the number of houses being constructed is greater now than it has ever been. When they come to their own anti-inflationary platform we find them producing a very bedraggled mouse out of their hat. Firstly, the Opposition said that it would reduce public sector spending. The fact is that the Opposition is opposed virtually to all proposals by the Government to cut back public sector spending. The Opposition's attitude to the superphosphate bounty is the latest example of such a reaction. Moreover, the Opposition positively advocated increases in Government spending in some areas, defence of course being a notable example. Secondly, the Opposition has said that it would arrest the growth of the Australian Public Service. With respect, perhaps it has a point, but the saving certainly would not be much unless expenditure also was cut back on the functions of government. This gets back to a point which I have already attempted to make. Where are the big expenditures to be made?</para>
          <para>But what has this Government done in a genuine endeavour, having regard to international problems in inflation, to relieve the burden on the wage and salary earner, on the primary producer and on secondary industry? I have already said that there is no simple solution to inflation. But that does not necessarily mean that we can throw up our hands in the face of inflation. Actions which we have taken since December 1972 when the Labor Government came into office have considerably slowed the rate at which money is being injected into the Australian economy. But present prospects are for a further over large increase in the money supply in 1973-74. Such an outcome would be entirely inappropriate if we are to stand any chance of reining in the rate of increase in prices. We are determined that such an increase must not occur. Of course</para>
          <para>measures were taken in the very month- December 1972—tha t this Government came into office and again in February 1973, some 2.5 months afterwards, to restrict capital inflow and to reduce external surplus. Then, last July, we decided on a 25 per cent across the board tariff cut. The tariff cut of last July in due course had a further significant effect in reducing the external surplus. Nonetheless, in 1973-74 reserves again seem likely to increase strongly from a level which, admittedly, still remains excessive. But these are only some of the things which we have done.</para>
          <para>In September of last year the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) said that after a close and careful examination of the present situation and prospects it had been decided to appreciate the exchange value of the Australian dollar. He went on to announce that the exchange rate change would establish a new formal parity of 28.3848 Australian dollars per fine ounce of gold and that this represented an appreciation of 5 per cent from the former parity. In a statement the Prime Minister made on 9 September he added:</para>
          <quote>
            <para>This further appreciation in thc exchange rate will help to reduce the growth in reserves and thereby moderate the growth in the money supply emanating from that source, lt will also help to keep down thc prices of imports. Figures published by the Statistician on 5 September indicated that, following the revaluation of Australian dollar last December, import prices fell by 5 per cent between the December quarter of 1972 and the June quarter of 1973. The appreciation will also serve to dampen somewhat the effects in domestic markets of high prices on world markets for exportable goods.</para>
          </quote>
          <para>This Government stands firmly and proudly on the record that it has set out to accomplish. This Government has done much in a period of 16 months of office. It has set about the overwhelming and near insurmountable task of correcting the injustices and inadequacies which have occurred as a result of a perpetration of 23 years of conservative governments in this country. This Government is the government of reform. This Government is a government that sets out to give equity and justice to the wage and salary earners of this country. While we as a government are concerned about the inflationary rate in this country nonetheless we appreciate that inflation is a world-wide phenomenon. Today the Opposition in its urgency motion—on e which was discussed a week ago in the House of Representatives— i s only repeating parrot fashion the conservative shibboleths that have been repeated in this place for far too long.</para>

It is well to remind the Senate and the people of Australia that the Senate is debating a motion of urgency moved by the Liberal and Australian Country Party Opposition censuring the Government for having achieved in its unique 16 months the highest interest rates in history. We censure the Government because, by its deliberate action in putting up interest rates, it has created a unique inflation of prices. The Minister is now seeking cover. He talks about inflation being a worldwide phenomenon. Let us remind him quite clearly that when we left office inflation was running at 4.7 per cent and falling. For the 20 years that we were in office, with all the overseas inflation, in this country we averaged a 2.5 per cent inflation, the lowest in the world. So, with the outside world breathing on us, we still managed. We are debating the effect of the record interest rates. They affect the people of Australia in every purchase of goods they make and they affect notably the home buyers and the intending home buyers. Tonight I say emphatically that in no issue, in no policy promise, has this Labor Government created a more shabby hoax- I repeat, a disastrously shabby hoax- than it has in its housing policy and its recent extension of tax deductability on interest. I remind the people of Australia that the Labor Party went to the people with 4 main policies on housing. It said: &#39;We will reduce inflation in Australia.&#39; It has converted a 4.7 per cent inflation rate to 14 per cent, rising to 20 per cent. It stated: </para>

        <para class="block">The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean),</inline> in his own words said that in 1973 land and housing costs rose 20 per cent. Labor promised interest deductability and by its silence implied that it would maintain the homes savings grants. Let us see what has happened. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> have said that by this tax deductability, the people of Australia in buying homes will now be saving money. I want to show honourable senators what a disastrous situation has occurred. In to nights Press the building authorities say that of all the people in Australia who are seeking to acquire homes in the coming year less than half will be able to do so because they have been priced out of the market. Let us look at this. Because of inflation in 1973, in the Treasurer&#39;s own words the cost of a house has gone up 20 per cent. A $20,000 home- a modest cost- has gone up to $24,000. The cost of a $25,000 home has gone up by $5,000, so the people of Australia, by the action of this Government, have to pay another $5,000 for the most modest of homes. This year the cost will go up another 20 percent. </para>
        <para>On top of that, by raising interest rates by an average of 2 per cent, shall we say, the cost of repaying a $20,000 home over 25 years has been increased by the Labor Government by some $8,000. By two strokes of the pen- as a result of inflation which puts up the cost of a house by $4,000 to $5,000, and by raising interest rates and thereby putting up the long term repayment of a house by $8,000- the Government has robbed individual people in Australia of an extra $13,000 on a home. The Government took from the people the homes savings grant and therefore made it impossible for them, in many cases, to bridge the gap. </para>
        <para>Let us look into this matter. The Government is going to finance this interest subsidy out of taxation and says it will cost between $120m and $150m a year. There are some 5 million taxpayers in Australia. By looking at the tax scale, the Government should know that it will cost on average an extra $ 100 a year at least for the average taxpayer to finance this $150m, and that is $2,500 over a period of 25 years. The very best that anyone can get out of this scheme will be about $2,500 by way of tax abatement over 25 years. It would cost a person $14,500 to get it by the deliberate action, in one year, of this Government. </para>

            <para>The honourable senator interjects. Does anyone deny that the cost of a home went up $4,000 last year? Does anyone deny that a 2 per cent increase in interest rates adds $8,000 to the cost of an ordinary home? Does anyone deny that the extra $100 a year interest subsidy that a taxpayer will have to pay will add up to $2,500? I want to look into this because of the interjections of honourable senators opposite who cannot stand the truth. The Government says that this scheme is an attractive one. It says that those people who have an actual income of $4,000 a year will get a tax deduction of 100 per cent of their tax. That is a piece of phoneyism if ever there was one. That is an income of $77 a week. Anyone who knows about the borrowing of money for homes knows that the only loan that would be made to a person on $77 a week would be one with a maximum repayment of a quarter, which would be</para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>$ 19 a week. That would be for a loan of $ 10,000. That would buy nothing at all.</para>
            <para>Let me take the simplest case. There are in Australia today 1 million working wives; that is, there are 1 million families in which both the husband and the wife are working. If you take the average wage, the husband would earn about $6,400 and the wife would get $4,000 or less. The combined income of each of those 1 million families is just over $10,000. That would be the actual income. It is these 1 million families which are struggling. The mothers are going out to work to help to buy a home. What does this proud Government propose by way of interest deductibility? If they earn $10,000 they will be able to get 40 per cent of their interest rebated— not 100 per cent or 60 per cent but 40 per cent. If honourable senators want to do a simple sum, this kind of family, with 2 spouses working, will have to pay about $320 a year extra in interest and can get a rebate of $230. Therefore it is behind scratch before it starts. This is the greatest charlatan trick even inflicted upon the people of Australia.</para>
            <para>I remind the people of Australia that they are now seeing an alibi being created. The Government is saying: 'Do not blame us for inflation. It is not caused by us, it is caused overseas.' This is the same Government which some 15 months ago went to the people and said: 'Put us in and we will reduce inflation. We will reduce housing costs and land costs. Put us in and we will reduce interest rates. Put us in and we will make housing within the reach of the ordinary people of Australia.' I repeat this simple formula to the people of Australia, and I quote the Treasurer: In the year 1973, housing costs in Australia rose by 20 per cent. They will, of course, rise another 20 per cent this year. If the cost of the most modest of houses rises by 20 per cent the Government, by doing this, will rob a family of $4,000. The Government, by forcing up interest rates by 2 per cent, has robbed this same family of $8,000.</para>
            <para>What twaddle it is to pretend that this interest deductibility is going to help at all. It cannot help. It can only impose another $100 a year punitive taxation on these people. What about these husbands and wives who are going out to work? What about the poor struggling family? What is the so-called workers' Party doing for these families? It proposes to allow them a princely 40 per cent deduction of interest and the effect of that will be that they will get less back than they have to put out in extra interest. So they will be worse off. Where was the honesty of the Government regarding the homes savings grant? What has been done to bridge the gap?</para>

            <para>I hear the chickens moulting tonight in the rafters. This Government has done a dreadful thing to the people by its own deliberative action. The Treasurer said that he put up interest rates deliberately to reduce liquidity in the system, not to be competitive but in fact to pull money out of the community. Somebody said today that this is not a credit squeeze. What is it if the Government puts up interest rates in order to pull money off? This Government deliberately set out to make everything in this community more costly and to make the ordinary home $12,000 more costly in one year. No one would think that even the reckless, irresponsible Labor Government could achieve this kind of nonsense, that it could make the purchase of an ordinary motor car several hundred dollars more costly, or make the purchases of a refrigerator or a television set, all these things, more and more costly for a young married couple setting up a home. I repeat that no shabbily hoax has been brought on the Australian people by a government renowned for its charlatan tricks than this device that this Government is using. I move:</para>

          <para>PRIME Ministers VISIT TO SOUTH-EAST ASIA</para>
          <para>Ministerial Statement</para>
          <para>In this, the first week of the new session ofParliament, I wish to report to the House and to the Australian people on my recent visit to South-East Asia. I believe that visit advanced Australia's national interests in a region of continuing and increasing importance to this country. No one in this House would deny that Australia and the countries of South-East Asia share profound and lasting common interests. No one in this House would deny that the maintenance of close relationships with these countries is one of several important challenges facing Australian foreign policy. The confluence of our history and geography—ou r mainly European origins and our location on the edge of South-East Asia—afford s us a unique opportunity to demonstrate that countries with different cultural, ethnic, social and religious backgrounds can evolve intimate and lasting relationships. The Government is determined to seize that opportunity and to ensure that Australia is accepted as a good neighbour and a co-operative and helpful member of the Asian and Pacific region.</para>
          <para>I visited Malaysia from 28 to 31 January, Thailand from 31 January to 4 February. Laos on 4 February, Burma from 4 to 6 February, Singapore from 6 to 9 February and the Philippines from 10 to 13 February. I also paid a brief visit to thc Malaysian Air Force Base at Butterworth where our Mirage squadrons arc stationed and a brief private visit to Kota Kinabalu. at thc invitation of an old friend, the former Malaysian High Commissioner to Australia and Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and present Governor of Sabah, Tan Sri Stephens. I have now visited in the 15 months since the Government came into office, virtually all the major countries in the Asian and Pacific region. No former Prime Minister has done more. Visits by the Prime Minister and other ministers symbolise the importance that the Australian Government attaches to the countries visited. But there is more to it than that: thc results which will flow from my visit will, I believe, advance our interests and involvement in this region to a new level.</para>
          <para>1 had four main objectives in undertaking this visit, I believe I succeeded in fulfilling them. My first and perhaps my principal objective was to emphasise to leaders in South-East Asia the continuing and undiminished importance which my Government attaches to its relations with the countries of South-East Asia. I wanted to explain to them that what had changed was not the degree of Australian involvement in the region but the nature and direction of that involvement. I wanted to make clear that our emphasis had shifted from an involvement based mainly on ideological considerations and military alliances to one based on more enduring ties such as trade, aid programs, regional co-operation, economic cooperation, and the development of a network of cultural contacts and agreements. My second objective was to establish or reinforce personal contacts with South-East Asian Heads of Government. I was able to have very frank and detailed talks with them. My third objective was to outline to Government leaders in the region the positive character of the Australian Government's foreign policy and to dispel any misunderstandings about it. My fourth objective was to seek practical and enduring ways in which co-operation between Australia and the countries of the region an bc strengthened.</para>
          <para>In all the countries I visited Australia has. and always will have, an important influence. While our foreign policy interests have been diversified and our horizons are now wider than the United States, the United Kingdom and South-East Asia c no longer ignore, for example, the existence of Communist Asia, including China with its 800 million people—the fact remains that it is in our own immediate neighbourhood that wc are most likely to find an effective</para>
          <para>role for Australia. 1 found that the new friendships which we have developed with countries like China and North Vietnam have in no way diminished our traditional friendships with the countries I visited. If anything, they have enhanced our standing in them and increased their interest in us.</para>
          <para>Foreign policy cannot be created in a vacuum. It must grow out of national aspirations and patterns of events in our environment. We need to take account of the evolving Great Power relationships. In the sixties the main thrust of United States policy in this area was the containment of China by military involvement in Vietnam. But the United States has itself opened up new opportunities by abandoning these policies; it no longer looks to Australia to provide a mere supporting echo of policies which it has itself progressively abandoned. As Dr Kissinger, the most realistic and pragmatic negotiator to fill the office of Secretary of State, has shown, initiatives in foreign affairs open up new possibilities for progress and understanding. Such initiatives will not always produce predictable or entirely desirable results, but log-jams are broken, stale habits of mind are abandoned, and movement is often preferable to a dogged perseverance with an outmoded status quo.</para>
          <para>Like most of the leaders 1 met, I believe that detente between the Great Powers must be made to work. The journey down this road has begun. It will not bc smooth. Peace and security do not come simply because we wish them to come. But diplomacy must be based on realistic hopes rather than on resignation and despair. It was in this spirit that I went to South-East Asia. And it was this spirit which evoked such a warm response. I recall, in particular, the remarks by the Prime Minister of Singapore at a dinner he gave for my delegation. 1 shall seek leave to table the text of that speech, and all other principal speeches during my visit, later this evening.</para>
          <para>Trade and Economic Links</para>
          <para>I turn now to trade. I believe that increasingly our foreign policy in South-East Asia will be related to our efforts to develop mutually advantageous trade, ln each country I visited I expected, and found, keen interest in closer trading and economic links with Australia.</para>
          <para>I turn now to trade. I believe that increasingly our foreign policy in South-East Asia will be related to our efforts to develop mutually advantageous trade, ln each country I visited I expected, and found, keen interest in closer trading and economic links with Australia.</para>
          <para>Australia has long established and valued trading ties with all the countries I visited. Last year we had a favourable trade balance of $225m with these countries and we expect this favourable balance to increase in the show term. Our exports last year to these countries totalled $318m, of which over 40 per cent were manufacturers; our imports from them were $93m. It can be seen that this situation, while advantageous to us now, could generate friction if neglected. So in each country I made a point of explaining the 25 per cent tariff cut made by the Government in July last year and the greatly expanded scheme of tariff preferences for developing countries which came into force on I January. I told them of the special service which has been established in the Department of Overseas Trade to help developing countries in market research and commercial contacts. I arranged for experts from Australia to visit all the countries on my itinerary, as well as Indonesia, in March and April. This will ensure that new preferences and trading opportunities are understood and that the countries concerned can take full advantage of them. These experts will also visit a number of other developing countries later in the year. I elaborated on the statement on Australian investment policy which the Government issued on 22 January.</para>
          <para>I emphasised that, for the first time, an Australian Government had adopted a co-operative and creative role in encouraging Australian investment overseas, particularly in South-East Asia. I made it clear that such investment must accord with the social and economic objectives of thc host country and be consistent with progressive labour relations</para>
          <para>and local environmental policies. I was also able to point to the expansion of the EPIC investment insurance facilities and thc creation of two separate funds, one of $250,000 a year and one of $100,000 a year, to promote respectively, investment feasibility studies overseas by Australian manufacturers and investment awareness within Australia.</para>
          <para>All these policies and initiatives were warmly welcomed. I believe the ground is now laid for increased Australian investment in South-East Asia. Thc obvious link between trade and investment and the general acceptance of Australia as a source of investment was widely recognised.</para>
          <para>Wc have reached understandings that our trade agreements with Malaysia and the Philippines will bc updated and that new Trade Agreements with Thailand and Laos will be negotiated. A feature of such agreements will be the establishment of mixed commissions of Australian businessmen and officials, who will meet their counterparts in thc other countries on a regular basis to examine the practical problems of two-way trade and to seek their prompt resolution.</para>
          <para>1 also took thc opportunity to stress the desirability, wherever practicable, of securing access to markets over a long term for the products of Australia's rural industries. Since my visit, the parties directly concerned have met to explore the possibility of long term contracts for the export of substantially increased quantities of wheat and sugar to Malaysia. An inquiry for 500.000 tons of coal from Thailand is under consideration and export approval has been given by the Australian Govern men i for 150,000 ions of coal to Burma. A number of countries I visited inquired about products essential to their economic development, including nitrogenous fertilisers, steel and engineering products. These are being dealt with as a matter of urgency. An Australian investment of over $4m in the forging industry in the Philippines was approved within a few days of my raising i his question with President Marcos. In Thailand our offer io assist with the establishment and training of their Trade Commissioner Service was accepted and the initial moves are already under way. Wc are also examining, as a matter of urgency, requests received during my visit for extensions to our scheme of tariff preference for developing countries.</para>
          <para>All of this provides a practical illustration of our present objective of securing a thriving and well-rounded commercial relationship with the countries of South-East Asia. The Government's decision last October to respond positively anal constructively to interest in thc ASEAN countries in Australian co-operation with agreed ASEAN projects was also well received in the ASEAN capitals I visited. In fact, all our policies and initiatives in trade were accepted as evidence of our strong continuing involvement in South-East Asia and our willingness to assist our Asian neighbours in genuinely constructive ways.</para>
          <para>Defence</para>
          <para>During my visit I stressed on a number of occasions that although the emphasis of our policy is changing we still retain important defence interests in South-East Asia. We no longer look on the countries of South-East Asia as buffer slates or as some northern military line where a possible future enemy should be held. Rather, we look upon them as countries having a common interest with Australia and New Zealand in consolidating thc security and stability of the region as a whole</para>
          <para>I made it clear to representatives of the Lao Patriotic Forces in Vientiane that Australia was concerned that all foreign countries withdraw their forces from Laos. I also expressed the hope that the Great Powers would cease supplying arms to North and South Vietnam. I said so in the firm belief, which I have expressed before, that the opportunities which were lost after the signing of the Geneva Accords of</para>
          <para>1954 should not be lost again. Thc prospects for reconciliation and for the formation of genuinely national governments in thc countries of Indochina would be greatly enhanced if external interference of all kinds could cease.</para>
          <para>We have pledged that the terms of the Five Power Arrangements will be honoured in full until a more enduring settlement is reached in establishing the peace, freedom and neutrality of the region. Our defence co-operation programs with countries like Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia will bc maintained. 1 also indicated that Australia's Mirage squadrons would remain at Butterworth as long as they are relevant to thc needs of both our nations and the realities of thc region and that, as previously announced, this question would be reviewed, as appropriate by the two Governments.</para>
          <para>It has been suggested that because I believe our interest in this region has in the past been seen excessively in terms of defence, Australia is in some way drifting towards isolationism. I repeat categorically what 1 said several times in South- East Asia: Isolationism is not a policy option for Australia, lt is precisely because 1 thought that we were isolating ourselves from a quarter of the world's population in China, and to some extent, from Black Africa and Europe east of the Elbe, that I have stressed since December 1972, the Government's wish to diversify its foreign policy interests, ln faet, in both action and philosophy, 1 believe that my Government is the most genuinely internationalist government Australia has had.</para>
          <para>Race, Culture and Immigration</para>
          <para>The Government's attempts to rid Australia of any lingering racist image are very warmly welcomed in South-East Asia. They are especially welcomed in Singapore and the Philippines.</para>
          <para>Race is a transcending international and moral issue. I am not prepared to allow the bridges that have been built to the countries of Asia, and which are currently being widened and strengthened by the Government's policies, to be undermined by stigma of racism. Thc Minister for Immigration and his Department are working to ensure i hat there are no gaps between our enunciated principles and our administrative practices. As I said in Manila, we want no double standards in this matter.</para>
          <para>I was particularly concerned in Manila to explain to President Marcos thc Government's uncompromising opposition to racism in all its forms and to assure him that our immigration policy is non-discriminatory. 1 was able to announce that the Government had given its agreement in principle to the entry of 35 Philippine skilled workers for the Leyland factor)' in Sydney. A team is to go to Manila next week to help select the immigrants who will come to Australia.</para>
          <para>The Government's wish to negotiate cultural agreements with Malaysia, Thailand. Singapore and the Philippines evoked a warm response. As a result of my visit we have undertaken to double the number of cultural agreements we now have. We already have such an agreement with Indonesia. The new agreements will mean that we shall have cultural agreements with all members of ASEAN. This is a manifestation of the importance the Government attaches to promoting a distinctively Australian culture and excellence in the arts generally. It acknowledges that wc have much to gain from the rich and ancient cultures of our Asian neighbours.</para>
          <para>Contacts With Youth</para>
          <para>During my visit I sought, with members of my party, to establish contacts with student and youth leaders. I visited the University of Singapore, Nan yang University and the University of the Philippines, at which I delivered a major speech. In Thailand a senior Foreign Affairs official accompanying me and two mcmbers of my personal staff spent five</para>
          <para>hours in discussions wilh Thai student leaders. These contacts, unprecedented in a visit of this kind, were of value to both sides.</para>
          <para>Discussions</para>
          <para>The discussions I had were, of course, confidential and lasted many hours. It would be impossible to summarise them all in detail. Thc roles of the great powers—the United States, thc Soviet Union, China and Japan n the Asian region were discussed in each capital. I discussed my own visits to China and Japan and economic problems in the region, including thc effect of the oil shortage and the energy crisis. I discussed the situation in Indochina and general questions of security and stability in South-East Asia. I found these discussions in total educative, valuable and of great interest. In Malaysia. Thailand. Singapore and the Philippines there was an acknowledgement that the normalisation of relations between China and thc countries of South-East Asia is inevitable. Burma and Laos already have diplomatic relations with China. In the other countries the issue is not one of principle but of timing.</para>
          <para>Another common theme was regional co-operation. The ASEAN countries naturally attach priority to the consolidation of ASEAN, an organisation which Australia does not seek to join but which has our wholehearted support. I was encouraged, however, to find a widespread interest in the idea of a future wider regional association in which the countries of Asia and the Pacific could meet at a high level for informal discussions, much in the manner in which Commonwealth Heads of Government meet. The Philippines, in particular, fully agrees with this concept and President Marcos has advanced almost identical proposals.</para>
          <para>Students</para>
          <para>I had the opportunity during the visit to discuss with a number of countries in the region their concern over students. The countries I visited n particular Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore—continu e to place importance on the opportunities for their students to study in Australia. The sponsored student programs, that is, the Colombo Plan and other official programs n the main run smoothly and successfully. There are no difficulties in this area. There have been some difficulties, however, with private students in Thailand over the English test, which is a pre-requisite to entry for study, and the level of entry for their students. I have agreed to look into these problems and the departments concerned are at present conducting a review of policy with a view to resolving them. The Ministers for Education and Immigration have also had discussions with the Thai authorities on this matter</para>
          <para>In Singapore there were discussions on thc return of private students and the so-called brain drain. Under our nondiscriminatory immigration policy, private students enter Australia on thc understanding that they will return home. However, if they can meet migration criteria they are allowed to remain in Australia. The Singapore Government was perturbed about this and have now decided to sponsor officially all private students coming to Australia. Sponsored students have always been required to return to their home country on completion of their studies and this has been at the express insistence of their home governments. I want to make it clear that if any student from Singapore is to be sent home, it will be as the result of his sponsorship by the Singapore Government and not as the result of a decision taken on its own account by the Australian Government. Mr Lee also raised thc question of students already in Australia and I have agreed to look into this.</para>
          <para>Aid</para>
          <para>I did not see my visit as an occasion for new aid commitments. I believe that visits by the Prime Minister and Ministers to neighbouring South-East Asian countries should be seen as part of a regular pattern of visits and not necessarily as occasions for important new aid agreements. Naturally, however, bilateral aid programs were discussed in each capital. In Kuala Lumpur 1 undertook to study Malaysian requests for assistance in preparing a feasibility study on the development of the Trengganu River Basin and on the development of the proposed Quanta industrial area. In Vientiane 1 undertook that the Government would consider assisting that city in its proposed expansion of its city water ,supply. I stressed to the Prime Minister of Laos and the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Forces that Australia would do all it could to help in the postwar rehabilitation of Laos. In Bangkok I announced that Australia would support the Pioneer Medical Volunteers Program of the Princess Mother. We will provide ambulances and radio transceivers for "the pilot project. In the Philippines I was glad to announce that the Australian Government had agreed to enter a joint aid project with the Philippines Government for the construction of roads and related irrigation and agricultural development in Zamboanga Del Sur. This is a large project which will cost the Australian Government approximately $2m a year for each of the next five years.</para>
          <para>1 take this opportunity of informing the House that the Australian Government has decided to contribute S18,150,000 to the Asian Development Fund. This decision, following as it does on our decision to join the Ministerial Conference for the Economic Development of South-East Asia and the South-East Asian Ministers of Education Organisation, and our decision to help finance agreed ASEAN projects, is a further manifestation of the Government's growing interest in the well-being of the South-East Asian region.</para>
          <para>I mentioned during my visit the possibility of sending Australian staff and other forms of assistance to Asian educational institutions. This would ease the demand for places in Australian universities. I expect it to become a more significant part of our aid programs. It would not, however, mean that we would be unwilling to continue to assist in training the students and officials who come to us under the Colombo Plan and other aid schemes. The presence of overseas students in our educational institutions and in our whole society is a valuable means of furthering understanding between Australia and Asia. This view was also put to me by the Prime Minister of Singapore and the Prime Minister of Thailand.</para>
          <para>I believe that during my visit I was able to affirm Australia's genuine, continuing and growing interest in South-East Asia. I was gratified that the leaders with whom I spoke and their statements were reflected in the press of the countries I visited saw fit to praise Australia and the Government's policies in terms that went beyond the normal requirements of courtesy to a visiting Head of Government. I believe Australia walks taller and stands in higher regard in South-East Asia than ever before. Our policies are understood. Our continuing and growing interest in the region is accepted and appreciated. As one leading South-East Asian statesman said to me, our present policies are 'approved and applauded'. I believe we are rightly regarded in South-East Asia as a genuine and trusted friend.</para>
          <para>(I seek leave to table the six main speeches I made during the visit and the main speeches made by the six heads of Government of the countries visited).</para>
          <para>NATIONAL REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION SCHEME INQUIRY—EXTENDE D TERMS OF REFERENCE</para>
          <para>Ministerial Statement</para>
          <para>Honourable members will recall that on 8 March 1973 I made a statement in the House in which I gave details about the establishment, by the Australian Government, of the National Rehabilitation and Compensation Scheme Inquiry, under the Chairmanship of the Honourable Mr Justice Woodhouse, D.S.C, the distinguished New Zealand judge. It will bc recalled that, in the original terms of reference, the Committee was asked to examine ways of rehabilitating and compensating every person 'who at any time or in any place' suffers a personal injury.</para>
          <para>Recently I was advised that from the submissions received by the Committee of Inquiry it had become apparent that the plight of the sick could not be separated from that of the injured. As a result I agreed to the extension of the terms of reference of the Committee in order that it may inquire into and report upon an extension of the scheme to cover every person who suffers an incapacity as a result of sickness. The words extending the terms of reference of the Committee are as follows:</para>
          <para>And further to inquire into and report on an extension of the scheme for the purpose of rehabilitating and compensating every person who suffers a physical or mental incapacity or deformity by reason of sickness or congenital defect, together with the application of the scheme where death results from such sickness or defect.</para>
          <para>The Committee had originally planned to complete its report by the end of this month but with this additional important responsibility it now hopes to be in a position to report its findings to the Government in June. I am grateful to the members of the Committee for agreeing to undertake this further task for the Government.</para>
          <para>I would also like to express my thanks to the New Zealand Government and the New South Wales Government for releasing Mr Justice Woodhouse and Mr Justice Meares respectively for a further period. The Australian Government looks forward with anticipation to the report of the Committee which I am sure will be a significant social document.</para>

        <para class="block">This Bill merely amends the Airlines Equipment Act 1958-1973 by introducing metric units into appropriate sections. This Act is one of the keystones of the 2-airline system, and under its provisions the Minister determines the aircraft capacity required by Trans-Australiann Airlines and Ansett Transport Industries Ltd to carry the estimated traffic on their competitive and noncompetitive routes during a particular period. The air transport industry is progressively adopting metric units of measurement, and statistics will in future have the kilometre as the unit of distance and the tonne as the unit of weight. The basic unit of capacity and performance is the tonne-kilometre, which is one tonne carried one kilometre, and it is approximately equivalent to two-thirds of a ton-mile. Consistent with the general move towards metric conversion, it would now be appropriate to specify these metric units in the Airlines Equipment Act. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para>- I take the unusual course, for me, of speaking on. the first reading of this Bill, which is a money Bill which the Senate may not amend. I do so in order to point out some features of the Bill. This Bill seeks parliamentary approval for an appropriation &#34;of $ 168.575m for the payment of salaries and other related charges. It is an amount additional to that approved in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) passed on 29 November 1973, which should have lasted the Government until 30 June 1974. But, apparently, the fat cats have had more kittens than even the Labor Government expected. . </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Opposition will not vote- against the Bill, because we do not believe that any citizen should suffer direct financial loss or embarrassment because of this Government&#39;s maladministration and financial lunacy. Ho weyer,, the Opposition wishes to take this opportunity to place on record its rejection of the Governments. reckless expan-sion of the Commonwealth Public Service. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> may be nominally a republican, but at heart he is surely a true empire-builder. Just look at the Commonwealth Public Service. I say: &#39;What an empire&#39;! How the Prime Minister has built upon it. Not only is it an expanding empire, but the Prime Minister sees it as a model empire, a pace-setting empire- and he certainly set quite a pace when he took over. </para>
        <para>In the first 10 months of his reign the Prime Minister increased the number of government departments from 27 to 31 and created 95 boards, commissions of inquiry and task forces and 157 new divisions and branches of the Commonwealth Public Service. Furthermore, he increased the number of Second Division officers, on salaries ranging from $17,000 to $27,000 a year, by 205. On top of this, the Prime Minister has forecast that the Public Service will expand at the rate of 240 new public servants each week. I repeat: It is an expansion of 240 new public servants each week or, in his language, 5 per cent per annum. So far the cost to the public for these extra public servants is in the vicinity of $150m a year. This increase in the wages bill for the civilian Public Service is augmented by the general wage rises for all public servants and has sent the total bill for the Australian taxpayers from $569.9m in 1972-73 to $802.3m in 1973-74. That, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, is</inline> the cost that the rest of the Australian community has to bear. It is equal to an astronomical growth in the Public Service income expenditure of some 41 per cent in the current financial year. </para>
        <para>The public servants are ripping off the Australian community. The only thing they add to the nation is wages and sadly enough the wages bill is not the end of this sorry story because there are ancillary services. Each public servant who puts a. foot outside his own town or city on official business is entitled to first class air travel- unlike the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and many other countries where only very senior officers are entitled to travel first class, with economy class travel provided for other members of the Public Service. Every Commonwealth public servant is entitled to the most expensive form of travel. The Public Service Board estimated, as far back as 1972 that the total cost of air travel alone by Australian public servants in 1971-72 was approximately $9m in respect of domestic journeys and approximately $4m in respect of international journeys. The Board also estimated that if all these public servants had travelled economy class approximately $ 1.2m would have been saved on domestic journeys and $0.75m on international journeys. These figures were taken out before the great expansion in the Public Service, so today the savings would be very much greater. </para>
        <para>Now let us take a look at housing and another hidden cost in the Public Service- a financial handout masquerading as regulation 97 allowances. For the uninitiated, regulation 97 is a housing subsidy which provides eligible married officers with $33 a week towards their rent if they have no children and $40 a week if they have children. The original purpose of the allowance was to help officers &#39;where the quarters provided are temporarily not available for occupancy, or where an officer, upon transfer, cannot enter into occupancy of quarters or private residence through unavoidable delay in the transmission of furniture and household effects&#39;. The second sentence of that regulation provides: </para>
        <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
          <item label=".">
            <para>. such allowance shall not be paid for more than 3 months except upon the approval of the Board. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">On 1 November 1973 there were 13 first level second division officers on $17,000 a year who were receiving the regulation 97 allowance. </para>

          <para>-1 wonder how age or invalid pensioners would feel about this continuing handout to Commonwealth public servants? What would they think of this Government, which is supposed to be so interested in social welfare and which claims to have done so much in housing the poor? What would they think of this hypocritical Government which has insisted on continuing regulation 97 allowances for its greatly expanded, highly paid, pace-setting Public Service- a Government which is prepared to give to public servants who receive $17,000 a year, or more than $300 a week, an allowance of $40 a week towards housing? This Government is prepared to pay these officers weekly almost twice the old age pension so they can rent a house. Surely these officers on $17,000 a year should stop budging on the Australian taxpayers and should go to the private sector for their housing needs. Even under the escalating costs which have been prevalent since the Labor Government took office these officers should be able to meet their own housing needs. What does the Australian taxpayer who, after all, foots the bill for the Public Service, get for his money? He gets very little, for the service by its very nature is non-productive. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> reluctantly we support this Bill which is only a partial repast for the Prime Minister&#39;s deliberately created, rapidly expanding, self-perpetuating, money-eating giant. </para>

          <para>- I want to speak on another subject on the first reading of this Bill. I could answer well the arguments that have been put up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> because most of the things he said were implemented by his Party when it was in office, but I have something far more important to discuss tonight. I refer to the victimisation of a member of the Australian Labor Party in the State of Victoria by an insurance company known as Federation Insurance Ltd which is directly associated with the financial activities of the Victorian branch of the Australian Country Party. I believe that the best way in which I can demonstrate the victimisation that has taken place is to read a statement from a gentleman by the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brian</inline> Smith. I have his authority to use his name and to read into the record the statement that he gave me. It is prefaced with these words: </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">It reads:  1, Brian Smith, the endorsed ALP candidate for the Federal seat of Mallee in the House of Representatives have been employed by the Federation Insurance Limited of 342-348 Flinders Street Melbourne since February 1972 as their resident inspector at Charlton. </para>
        <para>I was informed by the companies Victorian Country Branch assistant manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Alan</inline> Gallagher upon my appointment that my job would involve addressing meetings of the Victorian Farmers Union and obtaining insurance business from their members. </para>

          <para>At about this time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tudor</inline> the Victorian Country Branch manager of the company, instructed me to accompany him to a Country Party meeting at Donald on 16 October 1972. </para>

          <para>At the end of 1973 I was nominated as candidate for the ALP for the seat of Mallee. I informed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tudor</inline> of this fact and he did not complain or advise otherwise except tell me not to send any political letters to newspapers as it could be inferred that I was speaking on company policy and in fact </para>

          <para>From that occasion on I never released anything to any newspaper unless it clearly stated my position as ALP endorsed candidate, in this way no inference could be drawn that I was speaking on behalf of the company. </para>
          <para>The whole Mallee area knows that I am the endorsed ALP candidate and when I do speak there is no question that it is the ALP view that I deliver. Not the view of an insurance company. </para>

            <para>One hour and a half later at 5.00 p.m. on Friday, 1 March 1974, just as 1 was ready to finish my work for the week and go home I received a telephone call from Mr Gallagher. It went as follows:</para>
            <para>Brian Gallagher here, I'm sorry but I will have to spoil your weekend'</para>
            <para>I said,' Why, what's happened?'</para>

            <para>I said, 'Why, what's happened?'</para>
            <para>He said, ' I can't tell you that, you will have to see Mr Tudor on Monday and talk about it.'</para>
            <para>I said, 'Then that means there is still room for talk and I don't have to bring my rate books down?'</para>
            <para>He said, 'No, you still have to bring your rate books with you and you will be returning by train.'</para>
            <para>I then rang Mr Paris Chambers the General Manager. He claimed he was quite surprised and was not foretold by Mr Tudor of his intentions. Mr Chambers also said that my work effort was quite good and he had heard no adverse remarks. He further stated that he had been in attendance all the week at the branch manager conference and my name had not come up for discussion. He said that my ALP endorsement was of no concern to the company but that the decision had apparently been made by Mr Tudor as a branch decision and he could not interfere.</para>
          </quote>
          <para>There are further statements in this document that I could read out, but I want to get to the crux of the whole situation. Associated with the dismissal of Mr Smith is a set-up between this company and the Australian Country Party that is rather staggering. In 1972, Federation Insurance Ltd gave $30,564.04 to the Victorian Branch of the Country Party as a backhander. In 1973, the company paid $47,257.54 to the Victorian Branch of the Country Party as another perk. In 1974 the amount is estimated to be $60,000. These are handouts from this insurance company to the Country Party. So why has the company moved in and had this man dismissed? He is a young man with a wife and 4 children who has been dismissed overnight on the basis that he dared not only to be a member of the Australian Labor Party but also to stand as an endorsed candidate for it.</para>
          <para>But the Country Party is in a far better position than this. The Victorian Branch of the Country Party has been granted 8,858 ordinary shares of the company under option with a value of $ 17,716. The Country Party has been granted an option to purchase shares to the value of $ 17,716 in this company. Honourable senators can see the tie-up between this insurance company and the Country Party and the reason why this person who decided that he would have political freedom in the community was sacked summarily overnight by virtue of the fact that he was the endorsed candidate for the Australian Labor Party. But the position goes even further. From the next part of the statement we find that this company is completely unethical in its operations with its clients. I would suggest that the Insurance Commissioner should have the company investigated. Federation Insurance Company inspectors were told by a responsible officer of the company to tear out the centre page of the company's superannuation statutory information sheet which showed a loss of $30,051 over the last 2 years. The inspectors were not permitted to show any client they were interviewing the losses that the company had been incurring.</para>
          <para>Whilst the company is losing this kind of money—$30,00 0 in a period of 2 years t is giving handouts by the backdoor to the Country Party of up to $60,000 a year. I believe that a company with this reputation needs to be investigated completely and absolutely by the Treasurer (Mr Crean) in order to ensure that this kind of racket will not continue in the political life of our community. The handouts are based on one of 2 factors: Either the company is too lousy and mean to pay agents and is using Country Party membership to sell its premiums or it is</para>
          <para>charging premiums far above those that it should charge and is robbing the clients to whom it is selling insurance. So we have this situation in Victoria at least and, as the company is called the Federation Insurance Ltd the racket could be going on all over Australia. On the basis of the huge amounts that have been given out in Victoria alone, a major insurance company is giving handouts to the Country Party by the backdoor. It has handed out approximately $130,000 during 3 years of operation in its association with the Country Party.</para>
          <para>This great democratic organisation that will not allow a man to earn a living because he happens to be a member of the Labor Party is obviously is in a situation in which rackets operate and in which it can deceive the people it wishes to have as clients to the extent that it expects its agents to cheat and lie by the removal of figures and documents from the company's statutory reports which would show that the company was losing money on certain aspects of the premiums that it wished to sell to people. I hope that, in the light of the information I have been able to provide to the Senate this evening, the company is investigated.</para>

But I simply say that the use of parliamentary privilege for purposes of that sort is an abuse unless the honourable senator who has spoken guarantees to sustain the charges upon examination. </para>

          <para>A11 the cackle in the world will not gainsay the verities of what I put to the Senate. I do not propose to occupy the time of the Senate any further with that matter until there has been a proper investigation of it. I prefer to address the Senate on much more substantial matters which I hope would attract a much wider interest than individual accusations such as those which Senator Poyser has made. Senator Withers, in addressing himself to this Bill, brought before the Senate some startling information. It is being presented to the Senate for its first reading as a money bill. It is an Appropriation Bill, one of the Bills that under the Constitution the Senate is unable to amend. Therefore</para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>the wisdom of our forefathers provided that in our procedures we should have an unusual principle in respect of Bills of this sort; that is to say, upon their being presented for the first time we can speak upon them at undue length, for up to 1.5 hours except on the nights on which our proceedings are broadcast, and on matters which are not strictly relevant to the legislation.</para>
          <para>Senator Withers took the course of speaking on matters relevant to the Bill and showed that it is another gulp by the Labor Party from the Treasury of another $ 186m by way of appropriation; that is to say, an appropriation not provided for in November. The Government shamefacedly confesses that this appropriation is almost entirely required because of extra costs incurred for the Public Service. Senator Withers has told us that the cost to the public so far of the extra public servants that the Government has engaged is $ 150m a year; that is an increment of $150m a year. This increase in the wages bill for the civilian Public Service takes the cost of the Public Service from $569m in 1972-73 to $802m for the current year. We live in a situation in which none of these things ever interests the media. Tonight our proceedings are broadcast and it is necessary to mention the bald facts so that some of the dairy farmers who have been deprived of their subsidy and are now about to sit down after milking their cows might understand the way in which they are being milked by the Labor Government that they took a risk in electing in December 1972.</para>
          <para>The wages bill for Commonwealth public servants is enlarged to $802m in the current year from the already inordinate amount of about $570m in 1972-1973. As Senator Withers has told us, that is equal to a growth in the Public Service expenditure of 41 per cent in one year. In my opinion these are the startling figures of today; that is to say, an increase of $232m representing a 41 per cent increase in the wages cost of the Australian Government's Public Service. If that could be sustained by this country without producing galloping inflation and irresponsible and damaging costs, it would defy all facts. The Government is creating such extravagant expenditure on its own Public Service that unbridled inflation threatens every member of the community.</para>
          <para>But that is not the only matter to which attention should be drawn. In the last week or so I have endeavoured to direct the attention of the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Bishop), who represents the Minister for Labour (Mr Clyde Cameron) in the Senate, to matters of dangerous and chaotic import in our industrial situation. His</para>
          <para>only response is to take a wide sweep of Germany. He has told us that after comparative stability in the German industrial scene over the last 20 years when the poor devils were building up their own economy after the war, they have broken out and have become irresponsible. He tells us that industrial disruption has occurred in England and the United States of America. At question time this Minister shows himself to be quite unconscious of the dangerous and disastrous situation that has been reached in industrial relations in Australia. He refers to the United States of America, a country which we know has been bedevilled by an irresponsible administration of industrial law for the last 25 years and by an economy in which in the postwar period a most inflationary condition was created by rampant pressures of the unions.</para>
          <para>In Great Britain the unions have been unbridled by law since 1906. Despite the efforts of Heath in his Bill of 1971 the paralysis in the British economy is now of such a careful nature that visitors to Britain and half of its population are almost on the brink of despair. It is because of the disastrous precedents in those countries that I intend to advocate this cause with all the vehemence I can muster before disaster befalls us. In Australia, far from inheriting the conditions of those countries, we inherited a system that is unique and precious. I refer to the system of arbitration which was legislated for in 1904 and operated with somewhat indifferent success over the years. But it was successful in creating a remarkably improved condition of life for our working people. It was successful in maintaining some semblance of law and order from an industrial point of view in disputes.</para>
          <para>The Labor Government has come to power. It announced unashamedly first that it will not enforce the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act where they are breached by strikes or industrial disruption. That policy gives encouragement to the substitution for a system of arbitration of the primitive form of settling industrial disputes, that is, by boycott, pressure, intimidation and monopoly power. We are reverting headlong to that ungoverned system of industrial relations simply because this Government proclaims that it will not support the arbitration system. On the one hand it creates a whole army of inspectors of police offences committed by employers in breaches of awards made through the arbitration system. But on the other hand it unashamedly proclaims that it will not enforce the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Therefore, the Government must</para>
          <para>accept a great degree of responsibility for the industrial chaos that now prevails.</para>
          <para>I wonder whether it is realised in Labor Party circles that this Government, for the first time in Australia, advocated the chaos that was brought into England in 1906. In the British Trades Disputes Act a provision existed which relieved trade unions of all responsibility for damage done and wrong done only because they were done in the course of industrial disputes. The Minister for Labour (Mr Clyde Cameron) initiated the introduction of Bills which were presented twice to the Senate and which contained that provision. It is the purpose of this Government to introduce that direct contribution to industrial anarchy and to give the unions the opportunity to act completely irresponsibly in respect of any damage done and wrong done in the course of industrial disputes. That is bad enough, but every time the Government is asked to justify or to excuse its shocking performance which has resulted in industrial chaos the Minister for Labouring w echoed by the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Bishop)—say s that if the Senate had passed this legislation, which took the form of amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the position would have been improved. The position would have been absolutely chaotic, primitive and even worse than it is now.</para>
          <para>In my home State at present we have in southern Tasmania an industry operated by the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Asia Ltd which for 70 years has employed some 2,000 employees. It has the reputation of being one of the best employers in Australia. The wages bill for its factory at Risdon last year was, I think, about $ 13m. The bonus paid to employees, under a sustained bonus arrangement, was $2.1m in the company's factories at Rosebery and Wisdom last year. Disruptionists have come onto the scene. A small minority group has been able to precipitate a strike on the whole of that undertaking at a time when the superphosphate being manufactured by that company is sought by farmers and other products are wanted by the newsprint mills for newsprint manufacture. A strike causing wholesale losses for those wage earners has been in progress for a fortnight.</para>
          <para>The strike has been caused by one issue that has been imported into the zinc works by foreigners. It is a foreign issue. Those who have caused this strike want the company to subscribe to what they call an industrial agreement in lieu industrial disputes and conditions being determined by the State Wages Board system which exists in Tasmania and has been maintained and</para>
          <para>brought up to date from time to time by a Labor Government in that State. This is only a euphemistic way for the union agitators to say: 'We do not want a tribunal to adjust our conditions. We will frustrate the tribunal and insist upon bargaining as animals bargain in the scrub', that is to say by pressure, boycott and monopoly bargaining. I think nothing could be more deplorable. Today a new disclosure has been made. The Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd, which is about 15 miles further up the Derwent River, is responsible for the employment of about 1,500 workers. That company was able to get its product moved from the factory to the mainland until November last year by the sporadic aid of international ships that call into Hobart from time to time. The unions then made the statement: 'You must not employ international ships to move interstate cargoes'. The result is that production, continuing at the rate of about 800 tons a week, is mounting up and there is now a backlog of production in the store of approximately 16,000 tons. Unless it is moved by ship within the next 2 or 3 weeks the whole works are threatened with closure. This is as a result of the absurd restrictions placed upon shipping vital to the transportation of that product from Tasmania to the places where it is to be used.</para>
          <para>How can the Government be so stupid as to enforce a prohibition against international ships being used to carry interstate cargo when interstate ships are wholly insufficient for that purpose? On the north coast of Tasmania a similar restriction on shipping exists. The stage has been reached on the north coast that the last private enterprise ship in the trade has been notified to pay off its officers within a few weeks, which will leave only the Australian National Line services operating. I have indicated that I intend to try to persuade the Senate and the Government to reconstitute the Inter-State Commission which was the constitutional body, provided for in the Constitution, to administer laws relating to interstate trade, which would have the responsibility of seeing that economy is exercised and that efficiency is shown. There will be an agency thereafter required to give Tasmania efficient and economic shipping services.</para>
          <para>Since the introduction of a system of grants by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, there has been a notion among a great number of people that we get compensation, by way of financial assistance, because of this shipping disability. That is a complete myth. The Commonwealth Grants Commission does not take this item into consideration in the slightest. I complain of the shocking performance of the Labor</para>
          <para>Government in this industrial disruption. Only a fortnight ago we were threatened with a shortage of wheat because of a sustained strike at Geelong which immobilised one of the essential wheat carrying vessels which goes to Hobart.</para>
          <para>Add to that the general scene. The metal trade workers have been on strike for 48 hours this week. There has been a threat of continuation of those strikes. There has been the performance in the rad ways this week. Then one recalls the building labourers' strikes not merely in regard to building industry disputes but in regard to disputes pertaining to other matters altogether. I say here tonight that it is imperative that the Minister becomes conscious of the fact that his Government is doing everything to paralyse and smash the arbitration system. His Government is doing everything to support his masters, the trade unions from whom his Party was spawned. His Government is giving government of the industrial sector of the country to the trade unions. The Government, the supposedly responsible Government, the elected and representative Government, sits by and gives active encouragement to this disruption which seeks to establish the old primitive process of bargaining by boycott and disruption instead of by our arbitration and wages boards system.</para>
          <para>This situation has reached a position of peril in Great Britain, which never had an arbitration system. It has reached an insidious stage in the United States and has caused a rate of inflation which brought even that country to a position of financial danger last year. It is imperative that in Australia the Government wakes up and ensures that the element of trade unionism, which has a real function in regard to industrial organisation, does not become the substitute for government and does not make the elected Government subordinate, but that the trade union movement should be required to conduct its dispute in accordance with law, without disruption, before the arbitration tribunals and the wages boards.</para>

          <para>- I wish to take a few minutes of the Senate&#39;s time tonight to reply to what, to me, have been most extravagant speeches by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and, more particularly, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> who holds a very senior position in the Senate. He is the Leader of the Opposition. He attacked Commonwealth public ser vents and accused them of bludging. He attacked the Government for introducing an Appropriation Bill which seeks the appropriation of over $168m. Both honourable senators claimed that the expenditure generally is largely on salaries, and so it is. I wish to point out some of the expenditures about which they talked. Let me refer firstly to an important sector about which they have been campaigning for many months, that is the Labor Government&#39;s failure to assist the defence forces. The expenditure, as shown on page 39 of Appropriation Bill (No 3), for the Department of Defence is $5 5. 5m. It is for salaries and wages, which are necessary and which are a part of the obligation which the Government has in respect of all the Services. That is a part of the Bill which we are presenting to the Parliament tonight. But the Opposition says that it is a most extravagant Bill, the amounts are too high, and something should be done about it. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline>attacked Commonwealth public servants. He called them fat cats. He attacked their housing subsidies. Under division 548, on page 33, the additional amount required to service the Leaders of the Opposition and the Parliamentary Parties,  Deputy  Leaders of the Opposition and the Whips is $ 1 1 1 ,000. It is a necessary amount. I do not disagree with it. They are some of the additional payments about which the Leader of the Opposition in this place is complaining. </para>

          <para>I am not disputing that figure, but the strange thing about the honourable senator's Party is this: Senator Withers said that Commonwealth public servants are largely non-productive. Is he saying that about the Senate? On page 4 of the Bill the additional sums necessary to service this Parliament are listed. We know how active this Parliament is, with all its committees. The amount is nearly $lm. It is a necessary amount. Does he say that the servants of the Senate, the servants of the Parliament, are non-productive? In effect, that is what he said tonight. Not only did he say that they were nonproductive but he said that they were budging on the taxpayers. 'Budging' is the most offensive word in the Australian vocabulary. I never thought that I would hear a Leader of the Opposition talk that way about Commonwealth servants who, after all, are the servants of the Government and the Parliament. They carry out the dictates of the Government and, to a large extent, the Parliament. But he called them bludgers, and he attacked the housing subsidies.</para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>People who are transferred to Canberra from other States and who cannot get a house must pay the high rents which private enterprise demands. They are entitled to a departmental cottage. They cannot get one. They must pay extra</para>
          <para>rent. Because they pay extra rent they receive a subsidy, which is necessary to keep the Service going. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that the people who receive the subsidy include members of the defence forces. Why should not they be entitled to a housing subsidy? The wives are separated from their husbands. The men are posted to places where their homes are not and where their families are not. Why should not they be reimbursed for the high rents which they are charged, when they ought to be entitled to Government accommodation? Most of the enterprising private employers in outback places supply accommodation, generally at a lower rent than the rent which the Governmentcharges.</para>
          <para>I just cannot understand this sort of attack on public servants. If the Leader of the Opposition had centred his attack on the very senior heads of branches, if he had said that their pay was too high, etc., there may have been something in his argument. The same comment applies to Senator Wright. They did not produce any facts and figures. No case was presented. There was no study of the position. But they attacked Commonwealth public servants and the Government.</para>

          <para>Of course you did. I am saying that you did. The honourable senator also attacked the need for public servants to travel first class. He demands first class travel. We want first class travel for ourselves. We get it. We use it. We have transport provided. The honourable senator said that our servants, the people who are instructed to carry out our responsibilities, should not have first class travel. We know that all these committees which the Senate has sought will mean extra costs and extra wages. We pay more for specialists. We pay more for draftsmen. Why should the Opposition not acknowledge that? Why should it not be fair? The growth of the Public Service is not new to Australia. It happened during the regimes of previous governments. It is a matter which we have to watch, but surely we do not have to attack everybody in the Public Service, people who as yet cannot reply. Generally speaking they are doing a good job and they certainly are not non-productive. They have a duty and a productive efficiency and produce something in the same way as a boilermaker, a fitter or a carpenter produces something. I resent the attacks on them. They are our servants and they should be respected. If honourable senators want to make a case out against them, let them bring in a studied case.</para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In a very short statement I shall refer to what Senator Wright has talked about in relation to industry and industrial relauons. This week in his questions to me he has talked about a dispute within a State. As I pointed out today, the Federal Government can do nothing about that unless it is invited to do so by the State Labor Government or by the employers and the unions jointly seeking the assistance of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to solve the dispute. I said I was sure— I am sure— that at the present time the Minister, his officers and I , if necessary, will be willing to assist in trying to solve the dispute. Many of us have been doing this for many years. Our attitude towards the question of employee-employer relations is based on the idea that there ought to be more conciliation and there must be more agreements. If the dispute to which Senator Wright has referred is a dispute which today rests upon the need for cementing an agreement, it may be that an agreement between the parties is better than having a State wages board determination. Under the sorts of proposals which our Government is putting forward we would like to see the employers and the workers making agreements and, during the course of those agreements, being bound to refrain from disputes and to adopt a disputes procedures clause. That is a good thing. That is the sort of thing we are aiming at and that is the sort of thing which was contained in the legislation which was previously before this Parliament but which was held up. That is the sort of proposal which the Government will shortly reintroduce.</para>
          <para>The idea is that the bosses and the workers ought to get together and make an agreement, outside the court if necessary. But during the currency of the agreement they should agree to minimise disputes upon the matters which are to be settled. They ought to agree that there will be no stoppages and they ought to have a regular disputes procedure. That has worked in some industries. In those cases there have been agreements which have worked for several years without major disputes. That is the sort of thing we want. That is the sort of legislation which will be coming into this Senate. I hope that because of our arguments the Senate Opposition will give passage to that legislation when it comes to hand. I suppose that I have had as much experience as most people in the field of industrial disputes. Of course a situation often depends on the personality of the employer and the union leader. In the area of industrial disputes one of the worst things is to get inflammatory people making inflammatory remarks. Looking at Senator</para>
          <para>Wright in this chamber I would not like him to be in a position where he had to settle disputes because as active and constructive as he is sometimes, he is a most militant and aggressive talker. There are circumstances where it is a matter of personality.</para>
          <para>We know that internationally there has been the sort of situation about which the honourable senator has talked. It is a sign of the umes that when there is an inflationary position people in industry are trying to seek a remedy against rising prices. As a matter of fact, in our country, if honourable senators look at the figures they will find that while the number of disputes might have increased the number of people involved has decreased. In the United Kingdom, America, Germany and other places there is this tendency for more disputation. Labor Party policies have been designed on the basis of involving workers in management, participation in management and agreements which should run for a long time. If those agreements provide a good deal or a package deal which benefits the workers and the employers, we believe that they should run without disputation for a sub st anu al length of time. They are the objectives. They are sensible. But however sensible they may be there will always be circumstances where disputes will occur. In those circumstances the best people to solve the disputes are the people who have had experience in the field, whether the State field or the Federal field. All we can do as a government — jus t as honourable senators opposite used to do as a government s not invoke penal clauses but provide the best conciliator or arbitrator in the area, to get him quickly on to the job to help to resolve the dispute. I entered the discussion mainly because I thought the attacks on the Commonwealth Public Service were most offensive. I object to the word 'budging' and the suggestion that Commonwealth servants are budging. When that is said there is obviously a blanket assertion that every public servant is doing it, including some of our own staff.</para>

          <para>-I shall mention 3 items briefly tonight. The first one I want to deal with is the criticism that we have seen of the Senate over the last few weeks by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam).</inline> The second point 1 shall be dealing with will be inflation and then, briefly, I shall comment on tourism. The first thing is the criticism of the Senate by the Prime Minister. No doubt he would like every Bill which comes before this chamber to go straight through. No doubt he would like to have open slather with all his legislation so that, as quickly as possible, he could push through socialist schemes which could well prove to be irreversible, no matter how far in the future we look. Perhaps in their wisdom the people who drew up our Constitution foresaw our present Prime Minister with his desire to change everything as quickly as possible. Perhaps they knew that at some stage in the future we would need the Senate to act with judgment based upon the needs of the States rather than the political needs of the major parties. I make no apology for siding at times with those who suggest a certain slowness of action as is required by our Standing Orders and by the Constitution. Because one Party- the Australian Labor Party- received a very small surplus of seats and votes at the last election, that does not mean that that Party should have a completely open go. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It has been my contention always that a Party does not actually win office. The Government of the day loses it. During the last year or for a bit more than a year we have heard about this Government having a mandate to do whatever it likes. To me that is just rubbish. The Government has a bare majority of some .5 per cent to one per cent. I expect that at the next Senate election we will see quite a swing against the Government. One of the reasons that I expect a swing is that the referenda questions will confuse people. In this I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bob</inline> Hawke &#39;s first contention, anyway. I feel that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> is quite crazy having the referenda questions at the same time as the Senate election. I have said before that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> just does not understand figures. If he did he would not spend so much of his time overseas on ministerial trips and he would not be buying 707 aircraft for the VIP fleet. If he knew anything about figures he would be able to reduce taxes rather than continually increase them. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para>Mr Whitlam just does not understand figures and I do not think he understands Tasmanian people very well. A few weeks ago he was silly enough to make certain pronouncements about independents in Tasmania. I am sure that he would like to have our seats but he should at least be accurate in the pronouncements he makes. The Federal government, no matter which Party is in power, is controlled from Melbourne and Sydney. Together those 2 dues hold 45 of the 123 seats in the other place; so just what hope do the votes of the 5 Tasmanian members have against those odds. In an evenly balanced Senate independent senators from Tasmania have a special role to play. They can have a lot to say and anyone saying anything else is wrong.</para>
          <para>I refer now to inflation. We have been warned about this from many areas from almost the first few days of this Government's coming to office. In my opinion it is going to get even worse during the next few months. I think that one of my independent Tasmanian colleagues hit the nail on the head when he said that this Government is assisting a high rate of inflation on purpose, because in that way it automatically socialists us a little bit because of the cancerous tax scales. Also inflation makes it easy for the Government to get extra money for its socialist schemes.</para>

            <para>I have seen nothing lately which would make me disagree with my colleague's assessment of the facts. In the last Budget we had a 20 per cent increase in taxes which were imposed on the community in one way or another. Taxes on cigarettes, beer, whisky and so on went up. I think i.t was only on liquor, not on beer, but maybe that increase will come this year. We saw the Government Tip-off 5c a gallon from all of us who drive. Many of us drive long distances in this country. The Government justified the increase by comparing our price for petrol with that charged in places like Switzerland or Italy. To do that is just not honest. People in those countries do not have to drive the long distances that we travel and they do not have to lug commerical goods for thousands of miles as we do in this country.</para>

          <para>are having a lot of trouble selling their fruit. I know that there have been increases apart from the increased petrol tax, but in my opinion this Government really has not helped the apple industry a great deal. In fact I think it did a very bad thing by removing the tax exemption on carbonated drinks which contained 5 per cent of Australian fruit juice. In my opinion that was a bad decision for Tasmania.</para>
          <para>The petrol tax increase will raise the cost of all bread and butter items. It has affected everything. I believe it has added considerably to the cost of running farms and this, I suppose, eventually will add to the cost of our food. As I said, it has affected everything. I hope that one of these days this Government or another government will see fit to alter this decision and reduce the petrol tax that has been imposed. This year we have seen an increase of about 20 per cent in tax collections by this Government which ostensibly was not going to increase taxes. Next year is the year I am particularly worried about. I do not want to hold up this Bill unduly. I will deal with other things like inflation and high interest rates at some other time. All these add a tremendous amount to our inflauon.</para>
          <para>I want to refer briefly to tourism, which is important to my State of Tasmania. This morning we read in the Press that the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) wants to encourage more Australians to holiday at home instead of going overseas. I agree with him; we should encourage people to see Australia first. The Prime Minister said in his policy speech that his Government would encourage Australian airlines to provide cheap holidays within Australia as Australia's overseas airlines had been able to do for overseas travel. Once upon a time the Prime Minister realised that tourism was an identifiable nationally important industry but when Budget time came instead of helping to provide cheap travel in my opinion he did all  that he could to clobber the travelling family man while still allowing nearly all our civil servants to travel around Australia on first-class air fares. I am not going to harp about luxury being accorded to our public servants today; that will come at another stage. At the moment the tourist industry is not getting the travellers from overseas who were coming a year or so ago. Revaluation has stopped many overseas visitors coming to this country. Even before the recent increase in air fares the high cost per mile of air travel within Australia was such that the majority of those who came here spent most of their time in Melbourne and Sydney and did not get to places like</para>
          <para>Tasmania. Tourism could make quite a significant contribution to the economy of my State</para>
          <para>I believe that Tasmania needs special consideration in this matter of air fares. I have mentioned before that Tasmania should get special consideration in lieu of the money that is spent by the Federal Government or by the State governments, after it is given to them by the Federal Government, on interstate highways. Also, while we in Tasmania have such dreadful airport terminals, such as those we have at Hobart, Devonport and Wynyard—</para>

            <para>The one at Launceston is not bad. But while we have these bad terminals it means that our air fares are subsidising places like Tullamarine and the proposed new $ 1,000m airport to be built somewhere in New South Wales. If we pay the same fare cost per mile I cannot see why we cannot have better facilities. I think that Hobart airport should be upgraded to international standard. Tourism can be important to employment in Tasmania because industry is a major employer of females. It is important for women who want a job after their kids have grown up to be able to get jobs such as helping in a motel.</para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have emphasised air travel so far but 1 should say that I fully appreciate that the car is still a very important means of travel. It is important for many tourists within Tasmania and on the mainland. If the Government did a stupid thing in regard to the cost of living when it lifted the petrol tax by 5c a gallon, it really did a crazy thing when it applied the same tax to each gallon of aviation fuel. Instead of providing Australians with cheap travel within Australia, by increasing the fuel tax Mr Whitlam added some $5m to the fuel bill of Trans-Australiann Airlines aad about $5m to that of Ansett Airlines of Australia as well. This already has been reflected in the higher fares we have seen. For my State of Tasmania this action was most undesirable. Instead of helping to provide cheap travel as was promised, Mr Whitlam did the opposite and increased air fares to such an extent that fewer people will travel and fewer people will come io wonderful Tasmania. Fewer people will sty in our hotels and motels and fewer people will !n y goods in our shops. With higher internal fares we will see more Melbourne and Sydney people opting for a holiday via Qantas Airways to Singapore on one of the special flights that are available. Fewer people will come down to share with us the beauty of Tasmania and fewer Tasmanians will be able to afford to go to places like</para>
          <para>Singapore because of the higher fares from Hobart, Launceston, Devonport or Wynyard to the non hern ports on their route. The Commonwealth Government evidently has no intention of helping Tasmania in relation to this matter of air fares. It has been manifest for years that air services across Bass Strait should be on a commuter basis, without meals or drinks being served in flight. But we have seen no effort on the part of the Government to give Tasmania that special attention, that special consideration, which we deserve because we are so entirely dependent on air and sea transport. This is an obvious disadvantage when it is compared with the fact that people in the other States can choose either rail, air or car as a means of communication.</para>
          <para>Young people find it difficult to afford the cost of air travel. Young people attract very little Government assistance. I hope that the Government realises the need to provide basic accommodation for this travelling age group. Places such as youth hostels are not nearly numerous enough. Because so many young people travel long distances by car, the extra petrol tax has been an unwelcome addition to their costs.</para>
          <para>What of the future? The Government unwisely intends to extract from the airlines the full cost of operating airports. But what of the millions of dollars extra tax received via the money spent by tourists in motels and shops all over the country when they travel to different areas of Australia by the airlines. To me it would make economic sense to allow some loss on the airport operations in order to encourage the tourists to travel about. When they arrive at their destination in other parts of Australia they will spend their dollars and thus make a contribution to the Treasury because of the extra income received in the places where they spend their money. In 1972, $139m was spent in this way. It would also make economic sense, I feel, to start allowing for depreciation on hotels and motels so that we can see sufficient investment in these important areas to cater for future requirements. This would also enable hotel and motel accommodation rates to be lower, thus making travelling for the family man just that little bit easier. If we are to have the number of hotel rooms that has been projected as being needed in the 1980s then I feel that the Government should be looking at the possibility of giving direct financial aid through grants and loans and guarantees to Australian owned companies. Incidentally, I completely agree with the principle of full Australian ownership in this area. Australians do not get much benefit if Americans fly here on American airlines, stay at American hotels and then fly home on American</para>
          <para>airlines. I think we should have full Australian ownership of hotels.</para>
          <para>Australian has some of the world's greatest attractions. Let us be long sighted about their development. The costs will be small and the returns to the community, I believe, will be quite large. Let us see co-operation, too, between the Treasury and the other government departments so that we will see that Australians travel about and see their own country first.</para>

          <para>- I want to take the opportunity on the motion for the first reading of the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1973-74 to refer to a couple of matters. Firstly, I would like to refer to some of the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> earlier in this debate. I did not hear all he said, but I understand that he attacked Federation Insurance Ltd and attacked particularly the Victorian Branch of the Australian Country Party. Federation Insurance Ltd is an Australian owned and controlled insurance company. It is one of the few insurance companies in Australia that is entirely owned and controlled in Australia. It deals with many organisations, and the Victorian Branch of the Country Party happens to be one. I know also that it has agreements with other political organisations and many primary producer organisations such as wheat boards, wheat growers and other people of that type. It makes no secret whatever of its premium refunds; they are widely publicised. It carries on business all over Australia, and it saves on advertising and many other things. Many organisations insure with Federation Insurance Ltd, including some trade unions. Why do we not go a little further and look at the operations of the Australian Council of Trade Unions? It receives rebates from its major suppliers of goods, and much of this money passes as profits from the ACTU back to the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party. We have no objection to an inquiry being held into Federation Insurance Ltd or any other insurance company, provided there is also an inquiry into Bourke&#39;s store, and why they receive such large discounts. An inquiry should be held also into the ACTU travel service which is trying to obtain discounts and rebates in order to provide cheap travel for its members. There is nothing wrong with that at all. But why should one organisation be attacked and no reference be made to the others? </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I want to refer also to the appropriation for the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department in this Appropriation Bill. Strange to say, the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department is not mentioned in this particular Appropriation Bill. I know that I will be told that it has a one line appropriation, that money can be transferred from one section of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department to another without reference to the Parliament. One would think that there would be a very high wages content in that one line appropriation. Since the main purpose of this Appropriation Bill is to provide extra money for wages, one would think that the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department would figure a fair bit in this. </para>
        <para>I want to refer particularly to a couple of matters related to the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. I refer, firstly, to its telephone services. When the previous government was in power we had quite a good policy in relation to country telephones: Fifteen miles of line was constructed free of charge and for distances more than that the line was constructed at a very cheap rate; and it was maintained in perpetuity. This had to be the case because of the high standard of line required for automatic telephone exchanges. Some progress was being made under the previous Government in providing services for those who, by their very occupation or the place in which they lived, whether it was by accident or otherwise, required a telephone service of their own. They were not like the people who had access to public telephones in the next street or a telephone in the neighbour&#39;s place. </para>
        <para>In Australia there is a very large number of telephone exchanges which operate on restricted hours. When one goes to other parts of the world and talks about one&#39;s telephone service being cut off at 6 p.m. or 8 p.m. and not starting again until 8 o&#39;clock or 9 o&#39;clock in the morning and a telephone service which finishes at midday on Saturday with no other service until Monday morning apart from possibly a short time on Sunday, one is just laughed at. One is not believed. People overseas do not believe that any place could be so backward as far as its telephone service is concerned. When we were in government we were beginning to get away from these restricted hours by putting in automatic telephone exchanges and by helping people with the construction of their telephone lines. It all came to an end with the change of Government. </para>

            <para>They are hastening very slowly, and at the rate at which automatic exchanges are being built at the present time, it will be the end of the century before these restricted telephone hours are eliminated. I have mentioned before the case of a man who lives not very far from a big city. He happens to live</para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>about 14 kilometres from the new exchange. He has been told that if he pays $2,000 he can get a telephone connected when the Department is ready to put it in in perhaps two or three or four years. He has to pay the $60 connection fee, the same as everybody else. We live in a Commonwealth where everything is supposed to be shared. Therefore, why should this man have to pay $2,000 now to get a service which in perhaps X number of years will provide him with the same service as is now available to people who live closer to the exchange? The limit for free construction is now 5 miles or 8 kilo meters. This makes things very unjust for some sections of our population. The postal section is a bit different in that respect. We do not have to charge people $1.50 or something like that to send a letter to a place like Birdsville to which delivery, we are told, does cost that amount. It still cost 7c—fo r the time being, anyhow. But some postal officials have told us that in the next Budget it will be increased to at least 10c. One can imagine that if a person has to pay 10c for a stamp every time he posts a letter that he is not going to write many letters. It is a far cry from the day 130 years ago or so when the penny post was introduced in the United Kingdom and they got so much revenue and could hardly cope with with amount of mail that they got at the cheaper standard postage rate.</para>

            <para>Yes-and a lot of other people increased it afterwards. I would like to carry on a bit further about the mails. We have had a glaring example of union control or dictation whereby the Postmaster-General was compelled to cut out Saturday morning mail deliveries. He did not just cut out Saturday morning mail deliveries; he closed all official post offices. We have the spectacle of the post offices being closed. Once they could not give out mail there was not much more they could do, I suppose. But instead of the people now getting deliveries twice a day and once on Saturday as they used to get not too many years ago, they get 5 deliveries a week. But the overall situation is worse than that. The non-official post offices, which are remaining open, are not allowed to give out mail over the counter. Many small towns and villages do not have a household delivery service; everybody—mayb e 120 or 150 families—goe s to the post office to collect mail. If the bag arrives the Postmaster sorts the mail, puts it into pigeon holes and the people can come in, look over the counter and see it. But they are not allowed to collect it.</para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>District postal officers in the various bigger centres have issued official instructions to all non-official post offices in these terms: 'On no account are you to give out any mail over the counter on Saturday mornings.' As a result many of these small post offices that do not have a telephone exchange have nothing to do on Saturday morning. I saw a circular which was going around the other day asking them to report on whether it was wise to keep the post offices open. So I foresee that soon they will have all post offices shut on Saturday mornings. If they are not shut, what can they do? They cannot give out mail; they can probably only sell a few stamps and postal notes. Many of them are not money order offices. For that reason the post office and the postal service have gone downhill very much in the last 7 or 8 weeks.</para>
          <para>There is more to it than that. When we get away from the big cities we find that many mail services come in on Friday nights and Saturday mornings and that people come in from the rural areas, mining camps and other places like that to get lihir mail but find they cannot get it until Monday mornington d so they have to make another trip to the post office. The mail is not sorted into boxes on Saturday mornings. If a small post office has a few boxes, the mail is not sorted into them. The officials are not allowed to sort or give out any mail. So some officials, rather than cause embarrassment to or have trouble with the local people, have requested that the mail bag that usually comes out late on Friday night or Saturday morning be not sent to them but held in the main post office until the Monday morning and then sent out. But there is more to it than that. They are not allowed to sort mail anywhere at all on Saturday mornings, although employees are now asking for overtime for Sunday sorting. Because they are not allowed to sort mail on the Saturday, as I said, they cannot make up mail bags for the mail contractors who go out to farms, station properties, mining camps and smaller places all around the countryside. We have got ourselves into such a fix with our mails that when the postage is increased to 10c—w e are told it will be something like that-</para>

          <para>- I recall that prior to the last election when his Party became the Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> made a statement that he had to admit that there was a vein of authoritarianism inside the Labor Party. That vein of authoritarianism has been illustrated by the fact that we now have in Australia a government which for the first time in history has decided to tell Australians whom they can play sport against and whom they cannot play sport against. I refer to the announcement that the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia has been pressured by the Government and told that it should not send a team of women to South Africa to play tennis. A statement that I heard tonight is to the effect that this organisation- a voluntary organisation which in my view is not subject to Government dictation- has been instructed that this tour should not take place. I regret the fact that it did not tell the Government that voluntary sport is controlled by the people who run the sport and not by governments. They have pointed out that should South Africa win through to the finals of the Davis Cup, under that ruling Australia would have to forfeit the Davis Cup by not playing against South Africa. </para>

            <para>Oh no. The Government's attitude is that our team should not play South Africa. It is not a question of the ground.</para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Surely it has reached the limit when a government starts to tell people: 'You can play sport against this country, this country and this country but you cannot play it against others'.</para>
          <para>Some time ago the Australian Government refused to permit teams from Taiwan to come to Australia. It said to the people concerned: 'You are not allowed to play them.' A female athlete who was allowed to run in the Olympic Games and who wanted to come to Australia was not allowed to come here because the dictatorial Government said no. We have had the example of the Government telling the Australian people that they can have this cricket team here but they cannot have that cricket team here. I think we have reached an extraordinary stage when a government, which surely has enough on its hands ih dealing with inflation and all the other policies which it-has put forward and which have failed, is devoting itself to instructing the Australian people whom they can play sport against</para>
          <para>The alleged reason that has been put forward is that there is a denial of human rights in South Africa. We have all heard of Solzhenitsyn and his book. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Willesee) has expressed shock at the disgraceful denial of human rights to millions of people in the Soviet Union. I would at least have some respect for our Government if it were consistent and if it said: 'Because there is a denial of human rights in South Africa the cricketers, footballers and tennis players cannot go there,' and because if it also said: 'Because that happens in Russia and we are all shocked at what Solzhenitsyn has revealed, our footballers, cricket teams and others cannot go to Russia.' But if the Russians were to send a soccer team to Australia tomorrow then all the people who today say to the people that they cannot play sport against countries in which human rights are denied would be in the front seats applauding vociferously the people who come from Russia and countries like Czechoslovakia where liberty does not exist today. Teams are sent out from Czechoslovakia and Ministers in the Commonwealth Government go along to the match, sit in the front seats and applaud; yet Czechoslovakia is the one country in which there is less reliance on human rights than in any other country.</para>

            <para>I will mention Portugal too, and the honourable senator will wish that he</para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>had not mentioned it. I believe that there should not be bans of this nature on sport or the arts. I think that we should allow people associated with the arts to come to Australia from any country because art should be above this kind of political ban. The people who are most prominent in banning this kind of thing are those who claim that they stand for the utmost freedom and that any moving picture, no matter what it is like, ought to be shown here.</para>
          <para>Spain and Portugal were mentioned. I was in Spain 2 years ago, at a time when the people were holding demonstrations for the 35 th anniversary of the defeat of communism by General Franco. I arrived there after the celebrations. But when I arrived there, on the day of the great celebration of the saving of Spain from the communists, the star attraction in Madrid was the Moscow Ballet. When I said to some Spaniards that this was rather strange they said: 'Look, sport and art should be above these kinds of bans.' An honourable senator mentioned Portugal. When I went to Lisbon our Ambassador told me that the matter causing the utmost excitement at the time was the fact that the top Portuguese soccer team, Benfica, had been invited to tour the Soviet Union. What governments could dislike one another more than the governments of Spain and Portugal and the government of the Soviet Union? Yet they have enough sense to put sport and the arts above that kind of political ban.</para>
          <para>Who is going to tell me that a South African cricketer is a racist? The South African cricketers may well be people who are entirely opposed to any form of racism or apartheid. When our Australian teams play overseas teams we do not play the governments; we play the representatives of the ordinary people in those countries. I think it is a scandal that in a country like Australia that is supposed to be free there is the Whitlam Government bringing in legislation which calls for more and more power for Canberra and adding unnecessary things like telling our tennis players, footballers and cricketers whom they can play against. I do not support for one moment any person who says that we should bring this kind of attitude into sport or the arts. I do not support those who sometimes say: 'Let us keep the Russian Ballet out because of Stalin and Khrushchev.' The Russian Ballet is the highest form of ballet in the whole world. Why should</para>
          <para>we deprive ourselves of being able to see that high form of art perhaps because a government says: 'There is a denial of human rights in Russia, therefore let us keep the Russian Ballet out.'</para>
          <para>The final point that I want to mention is connected with sport too. I am sorry to see that the Australian Government proposes to make a sum of money available for a team of Australian footballers to go to certain countries. I will tell the Senate why I feel sorry. I support Australian football. I hold the No. 1 ticket for the North Melbourne club, which will be the premiers in Melbourne this year. I believe that in Australia today many clubs are having a tough trot particularly in my own State of Victoria. Teams in the country cannot carry on. One big team in the Victorian Football League is wondering whether it can carry on. These trips to Europe, where soccer and rugby are well entrenched, cannot achieve anything by way of promotion. They are just joy rides. I have no objection to private companies which have financed these joy rides; that is their business. But if the Australian Government has money to spend on this sort of thing let it spend it on encouraging the Australian game inside Australia and if there is any money left over let us encourage Australian football where it already has a foothold n New Guinea, where it has a flourishing competition. Let us encourage it in the areas near our shores where promotion has a real chance—wh o am I to deny the players a gift from Father Christmas? They are going to get a free trip, but from the point of view of promotion it will be meaningless. If the money is available, then I say we should use it to encourage the Australian game inside Australia and in the countries close to our shores where there is a chance of doing something for development.</para>
