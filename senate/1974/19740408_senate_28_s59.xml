          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MARRIOTT</inline>(Tasmania)-To make my statement meaningful, I desire to quote from an article which appeared in the Sydney &#39;Sun&#39; of Friday, 5 April. It reads: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>A handful of Liberal Senators could block the Opposition plan to force a general election. </para>
          <para>These are the people who risk losing seats which normally would be safe for another three years. </para>
          <para>Colleagues will be urging them over the weekend not to chicken out&#39; of the moveto block the Government&#39;s supply bills in the Senate next week. </para>
          <para>These Senators are known to have misgivings about taking the unprecedented step of blocking money to a Government. </para>
          <para>They are reported to include <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson, of New South Wales, and Senators Lillico and Marriott, of Tasmania. </para>
          <para>They would not have been expected to retire from the Senate until 30 June 1977, in normal circumstances. </para>
          <para>With the prospect of a double dissolution, they could have their parliamentary careers ended on 30 June this year. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>the facts are; I speak with great truth- that at a private meeting in Parliament House on Wednesday morning, 3 April, I expressed certain misgivings which I have respecting the advisability of the Senate&#39;s defeating the Appropriation Bills. So far as I am aware at that time there was no threat by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> of a double dissolution if Supply were not granted. Secondly, insinuations that I am frightened for personal reasons of a double dissolution can be proved wrong in that I have voted with the Opposition against the Government on all the occasions when the Senate has provided the Prime Minister with grounds for a double dissolution. Thirdly, although it is true that I, without a double dissolution, have 3 years of my fourth 6-year term to serve, I believe that unless my character has been harmed by what I believe to be baseless accusations I will be endorsed again to represent my Party and Tasmania in the Senate, and what is more I will win a longterm seat. </para>
        <para>These opinions, which I hold to be true, make the snide insinuations of this front page bannerheadlined article, which includes a photograph of me, very hurtful to me personally and unless repudiated, as I repudiate them now, they can be very damaging to my character as a public man- a character of which at least I am proudand I may take action to defend it by additional means which are available to all Australians under our laws. </para>

            <para>- (New South Wales)- I saw the article perhaps with more particularity, if possible, than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> because I happen to be a senator of long-standing for the State of New South Wales. I served the State of New South Wales for many years in local government and then in its Parliament before serving it for 20 years in the Senate, for something like 9 years of which time I was a Minister of the Crown. This stupid statement, which has a high degree of defamation in it, was made about me also. All I want to say in relation to the matter is that if the newspaper wished to defame me it should not have defamed me as much as it did in the photograph it published. Seriously, the truth of the matter is that what was said was hurtful, harmful and derogatory in any sense in which one could read it. I too expect, and have no doubt, that I will be in the Senate if we have a double dissolution, as well we may, as a member of my Party and, giving the same loyalty as I have in the past, I expect to be here for the normal time of a senator, as I am now and will be until that event takes place. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Attorney-General. Is he aware of statements attributed to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that the unsightly objects on the lawns outside Parliament House should be removed, and of the statement attributed to a person claiming responsibility for those tents that they would not be removed? Will the AttorneyGeneral at long last state why action to remove the tents has not been taken either under the Trespass on Commonwealth Lands Ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory or any other law available to the Commonwealth? </para>

            <para>-I seem to recall that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition raised this matter a few weeks ago and that I then indicated to him that it seemed to me- and I have not been advised to the contrary- that it is open to him to set the law in motion. If he feels so strongly about it, why does he not take some action? He has not given us any satisfactory explanation of why he, with his burning zeal to take the action, has not instituted some action. I saw a report of what the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs said. I still say it is open to those who want action to take action. It is convenient that in this area of the law proceedings can be commenced by the citizens generally. I do not know that there is any special reason why I should take action. </para>

As the Senate would know, even if not all members are aware of it, in considering whether to take action as Attorney-General one considers what will be the effect generally upon the administration of justice and whether it is to the public advantage to take such action. I think a lot of honourable senators would share my view that the Government and the Attorney-General have been wise in this instance in not taking action which would probably be misunderstood around the world. I say this especially in the light of the fact that no request has come from the Parliament itself. Certainly it has been open to any individual including the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, to initiate action if he thought it was so amply justified and demanded. </para>

              <para>- The sub judice doctrine is a matter to which I have given a great deal of thought. I can well understand the honourable senator&#39;s requirement to draw to my attention that the matter is sub judice. However, I do not think that in these matters the Senate should be restrained from consideration of matters that are within its own province. Therefore honourable senators and the Senate as a whole are entitled to seek information so long as it does not prejudice the rights of the individual who is a litigant before the courts. </para>

              <para>- I can well understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser&#39;s</inline> attitude to this matter because he has raised questions about it before. I gave myself the exercise of examining the matter in case any honourable senator raised it this afternoon. My ruling, which has just been typed out, is as follows: In practice the rule as to anticipation at question time has not been interpreted narrowly in the history of the Senate because, if it were, the rule could operate to block questions on a wide variety of subjects. I think it is a reasonable practice to allow questions which seek information on subjects related to matters on the notice paper but which do not necessarily amount to anticipating discussion. Questions and answers thereto, provided they are restricted to the seeking and the giving of information, make for an informed debate when it comes on. That is my ruling. So I do not uphold the point of order. </para>

The situation is that I have not the power of appointment of an ambassador or high commissioner. That is reserved to the Governor-General- not even to the Executive Council. On 14 March the Governor-General appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> to the position of Ambassador to Ireland. Agrement was received on 2 1 March. Following that, the Executive Council charged me with the responsibility of fixing rates of pay and the other things that go with the appointment, and the taking up of that appointment. The paper that I signed following that authorisation was in fairly standard form- that he takes up his position as Ambassador to Ireland when he hands in his credentials and at the same time hands in another letter withdrawing the credentials of his predecessor. This morning I received such advice from 2 overseas ambassadors. It is happening all the time. As to when his pay begins, I now leave it in the hands of the Senate or the High Court to tell me. </para>

          <para class="block">Defence would be making such a statement some time during April. The position is- and I think answers have already been given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> about this matter- that when we became the Government the question of whether the DDLs ought to be manufactured in Australia or in fact manufactured at all was a subject of consideration by the Defence Force Development Committee and by the Government. Because of the escalation of price from something like $339m to about $400m the Government, acting on advice from the Defence Force Development Committee, decided not to take up the options. In fact I mentioned only last week in a speech in this chamber that the designs were not complete when we became the Government and that the designers were not in fact Australians. The Government decided, because of what it then termed the urgency of determining defence equipment, to make the purchases mentioned, and about which a statement will be made later. </para>
          <para>The question of whether DDLs should be built in Australia is one related to the options about which I have spoken and the need to have equipment ready. It has been mentioned before to the honourable senator that the Government decided that in its&#39; first year of office improvement of pay and conditions for the Services should be the first action by the Government. This it did. It decided that in the second year of office, which is now, it should purchase equipment. We are now doing this. I can only say to the honourable senator that the statement concerning this matter will be made either late today or tomorrow and the answer I have given to the question will probably be expanded. </para>

Sergeant Haswell was also unanimously chosen by his classmates to address the graduation ceremony on their behalf. I am sure the Senate will agree with me that this was a very commendable performance on the part of Sergeant Haswell. who showed himself to be a credit to the Commonwealth Police Force. Arrangements for attendance of Commonwealth police officers at the FBI Academy are made on an ad hoc basis when it is felt that suitable officers could profit by doing a course at the Academy. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Sergent Haswell is the first officer to attend the course since an officer of the Victorian Police Force, Sergeant Miller, attended the course on a Churchill Fellowship in 1967. Sergeant Miller also graduated with distinction. The arrangements for Sergeant Haswell to attend the Academy were made on the basis that upon his return he would be able to work in connection with the training of other police officers, thus obviating the need to send other officers from Australia to undergo similar training. </para>

            <para>- Since the present Government has been in office it has desired to restructure marketing authorities along the lines which we feel will give the primary producer the best returns he can obtain for his products. In the process there has been a desire to reach a reasonable degree of uniformity in structure. The only board which has been restructured along those lines up to the present time is the Australian Apple and Pear Board. Discussions were held with members of the Australian Wheat Board concerning the restructuring of that Board and the * possibility of the formation of an Australian wheat corporation which would possibly be along lines different from its present structure. There was no pursuance of that matter. The Government recognises that the Wheat Board in fact has been doing very good work for the wheat industry in Australia. For the present the Government has no intention of pursuing this matter any further. </para>

            <para>-Since the commencement of the insertion of these advertisements in the Press my Department has been inundated with requests for copies of the advertisements. To date, a large number of letters have been received from schools and technical colleges. Indeed, the Teachers Federation has been in touch with my Department. At the annual meeting of the Australian Provinical Press Association, which I addressed in Melbourne last Thursday night, the Government was congratulated for initiating such a campaign and for the response which the provincial Press was receiving to the advertisements. As a result my Department intends to produce the advertisements in booklet form for distribution among schools and bodies of this nature. But this cannot be done immediately. Eventually it will be done- I hope next financial year after the Government has been re-elected. </para>

            <para>-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. I advert to the shocking tragedy which occurred when a DC 10 aircraft went down outside Paris on 3 March with a loss of life to about 346 passengers. Subsequently, after an intensive examination of the area and all the factors concerned, the air safety experts believed that an improperly sealed cargo door had burst open in mid-air with tragic consequences. Is it a fact that the air authorities have indicated to the company which manufactures the DC 10 aircraft that certain additional safety precautions should be taken? Is it a fact that some international air companies fly the DC 10 aircraft into this country? What is the poition in relation to those DC 10 aircraft? Have modifications been carried out? If they have not been carried out will action be taken immediately to instruct the companies that unless modifications are carried out immediately the Government will not allow the DC 10 aircraft to operate to and from Australia carrying international passengers, including members of the foreign service. </para>

            <para>-I believe it has been reported that the DC 10 aircraft proposed for Australia is different from the one involved in a catastrophe outside Paris airport. The Minister for Transport is very safety-conscious. If there is risk at all I think that modification or rectification will be made to see that we are not endangering lives in Australia or in any way soiling the good safety record which Australian civil aviation has in its operations. I shall take up the matter with the responsible Minister to see whether there is a difference in the aircraft and to ensure that the necessary precautions are taken to see that no accident happens to planes which we purchase. </para>

            <para>- Consideration was given to Australian shipyards building the bulk ore carriers. The demand was an urgent one. The price overseas was more competitive than the Australian price. To put the ships in service it was necessary to get them from shipyards which could complete the contract in a shorter time than it would take the Australian shipyards to complete the contract- if they were capable of carrying out the contract. </para>

            <para>-Since the Australian Labor Party came into office, as a result of initiatives taken by my Department there has been a much wider circulation of Film Australia productions in Australia as well as abroad- Film Australia being the film production organisation of the Australian Government. Last year, for instance, at least 6 productions were shown on commercial television stations, a number of them being dramatised documentaries which were shown in prime viewing time. Last week arrangements were made by my Department with the Channel 0-10 network for it to purchase a film relating to the Sunderland flying boats, a documentary which has been produced by my Department. The Australian Broadcasting Commission has purchased six films from Film Australia on Thailand and negotiations are under way at this stage between the Channel 7 network and Film Australia for Film Australia to produce a number of documentaries for that organisation. In addition I can tell the honourable senator, as I told the Senate last week, that there has been a tremendous response for these types of productions in the United States and in Mexico, so much so that in Mexico, as a result of a week&#39;s productions being shown there, there has been a request for repeat performances. </para>

I stated in the Senate only a week or so ago, I think, that I have received a submission from the Western Australian Farmers Union which is, as I said at the time, a very good submission and the type of thing that the Prime Minister is seeking from rural industry. It has not yet been determined whether a prima facie case has been established. At least on the face of it, it has some good material. There will be a decision as to whether that matter will go to the Industries Assistant Commission. I am suprised that the honourable senator should raise objection to the decision to continue the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty because I would have thought that Australian primary producers would have been pleased with the decision. </para>

            <para>- The answer is no. Three weeks ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard</inline> told the House of Representatives that a decision on defence equipment purchases would be announced in April. As everybody knows, we have made other similar statements in this place and elsewhere to the effect that the Government was considering what sort of program should be adopted. The Minister has stated several times- I have also said this in reply to questions- that the Government had decided that in its first year of office it would make sure that wages, salaries and pensions were adjusted. This has been achieved. As the honourable senator knows, the cost of the increased payments was about $200m. The Government, and particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard,</inline> have said that after that happened we would decide what we should do about the equipment purchase program. It is not a political judgment. It is based on a recommendation put forward by the Defence Forces Development Committee. That Committee did not finish its studies and deliberations until 29 March. The recommendation was presented to the Cabinet meeting yesterday, which was the first meeting since that date. </para>

            <para>- These rumours have been drawn to my attention. I can assure the honourable senator that there are no proposals on the part of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to reduce the amount of local content in programs and that indeed, on the contrary, the Commission is at present examining ways by which programming for regional radio services throughout Australia can be improved and the local content increased. The honourable senator will be aware that in this financial year the Government made available to the ABC an additional $10m. This amount of money has enabled considerably increased production of, essentially, locally produced programs. On radio young people&#39;s programs are being extended by the inclusion of local contributions from the States, replacing some elements of the nationally relayed programs. This has involved expenditure to the order of $25,000. As to the rumours to which the honourable senator refers, I can assure him that they are not correct and that the ABC, far <inline font-style="italic">from</inline> intending to reduce local programming, is setting about finding ways and means by which to increase it. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It relates to the action taken recently by the Minister at the South Pacific Forum to oppose and to achieve opposition to the inclusion of the People&#39;s Republic of China with France in a resolution condemning nuclear tests. I ask: Is the Minister aware of the authoritative article entitled &#39;Radioiodine in Animal Thyroid glands from 1966-72&#39; published in the Medical Journal of Australia of 2 March 1974. Is he aware that the article refers to exhaustive tests over a lengthy period of sheep and cattle thyroid glands from animals slaughtered in New Zealand and in Australia? Is he further aware that the article provides persuasive evidence that radioactivity on a number of occasions as detected in the thyroid glands originated from Chinese atmospheric tests? In view of the authoritative evidence on the effect of Chinese fallout in Australia and New Zealand and the proven <inline font-style="italic">real</inline> threat to human health in the Pacific area from the Chinese tests, what possible reason, other than a politically protective one, has the Minister for excluding the Chinese from a motion relating to the Pacific region? </para>

            <para>- Firstly, it gives me a lot of powers in excluding anything in the South Pacific Forum. I answered this question the other day. What the South Pacific Forum did was to condemn all atmospheric testing, wherever it might occur. The motion went on specifically to name France and, as closely as I can remember, it used the words &#39;The only country testing in this area&#39;. As I explained the other day, the South Pacific Forum, which is a body derived from the <inline font-style="italic">South</inline> Pacific Commission of a few years ago, is dealing with those problems in the South Pacific area itself. Therefore, that is the specific thing that it is looking at. </para>

              <para>-Just a moment. The honourable senator also asks the reason for it. That is the reason for it. He says that the motion is politically protective. It is not. The Australian Labor Party protested long before the Party of which the honourable senator is a member when the Chinese first started nuclear testing in the atmosphere. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> as Leader of the Opposition, protested to China when he visited that country. He has protested to the Chinese since he has become Prime Minister and we have specifically sent our Ambassador to China to protest to the Chinese again. The honourable senator tries to hang the matter around our necks as a smear at election time in an effort to produce an impression in the community which is not true.  His  actions do him little credit. As I say, this is not true. As the honourable senator well knows, the reason we took France to the International Court of Justice and did not take China to the Court was that China never accepted the jurisdiction of the Court. Therefore, the same sort of parameters were not available to us within which we could act. For.the second time, I state that that is the reason. As for this business of why we protested against one country and not against another, the fact is that it was specifically written into the South Pacific Forum communique. </para>

            <para>- I have heard rumours. I am not in a position to be able to verify them to the honourable senator. So may I speak about this matter in general terms without depending upon the accuracy of that allegation? In this area of industry, as in other areas of industry, it is clear and I think should have been accepted on all hands- I understand that in a sense it is- that monopolisation tends to force up the price of goods and that that kind of restrictive practice is injurious to the public and is not to be encouraged. The honourable senator asks what can be done about the position. A great deal can be done about it. First of all, we have a Prices Justification Tribunal which would operate in the case of a very large corporation. Next, we have some proposed laws in regard to trade practices which are designed to protect the consumer and outlaw these practices. These proposed laws were introduced substantially into the Parliament last August or September. They are again before the Senate for I think, the third time. We do not seem to be able to have them debated despite the fact that I understand all through industry and commerce there is no outstanding substantial objection to them. But for some reason or another our opponents opposite are, I think, still resisting debating those Bills. If the Bills are passed, the honourable senator will have his answer. </para>

            <para>- I raise a point of order, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> It is the point of order which I raised earlier. I feel very diffident and sad at the fact that I have to do this. I am very sad that you made the ruling that you made previously on this matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> The point of order I raise is that questions shall not anticipate discussion upon an order of the day or other matter which appears on the notice paper. The position is that the first order of the day on the notice paper is headed: <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator the</inline> Honourable V. C. GairPlace in the Senate. . . .&#39; Speaking to the point of order, I believe that we must have some consistency in these matters. I accepted your ruling a fortnight ago in relation to a matter I raised at question time. When I asked the question you immediately rose and said that I was out of order because I was anticipating a matter that appeared on the notice paper. I accepted your ruling without equivocation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and I would do so again if you ruled accordingly in relation to that matter on another occasion. But I cannot see how, in your rulings, you can make flesh of one matter and fowl of another. It is a precedent that will go into the records of this Senate and a precedent that may be used in the future to the advantage of the political party which has the numbers in the Senate. I feel very sad that I have to rise to my feet again on a point of order of this nature but I believe that your ruling on this occasion is flouting all of the rulings that we have had previously on this matter. </para>

            <para>- Speaking to the point of order, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> may I advert to a different aspect of the matter. It seems to me that in substance <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> is asking what the Minister for Foreign Affairs would do in the event of a certain decision being made by the High Court of Australia. It seems to me that that point is different from the one on which you ruled previously. Irrespective of the matter of anticipation here and irrespective of the other issues, that does seem to me to be really trespassing substantially into the area of the sub judice doctrine. The matter involved is not of such a nature as to involve the general rulings, which I also accept, in relation to the public interest prevailing over the sub judice doctrine. This is a question of a different nature, which asks: &#39;If the High Court makes a certain ruling, what will you do?&#39; For that reason, it is proper, I submit with respect, that it should not be allowed. </para>

Because of the near tragedy that occurred that day and the possibility that the demonstration was influenced by other than rural groups, will the Attorney-General give whatever assistance his Department can offer to the Western Australian Government? Is he also aware that an Australiawide demonstration is being planned for midMay at the remote north-west telecommunications base? Does the Government have -any intention to address the demonstrators at the site? </para>

            <para>-I had not heard that the Western Australian Government proposed to inquire into this deplorable and threatening incident in Western Australia. I think that most Australians would say that that was a terrible incident in our public life. The Prime Minister actually was threatened in no slight way by what happened there. I shall look into what has happened. If it is suggested that some proper inquiry take place I think that the experience of the past indicates that the Commonwealth would cooperate in any reasonable inquiry into the events. It seems strange, considering the way that we distribute powers, that because of the defects of our Federal criminal law this is not a matter which is subject to Federal criminal law. However that may be, I will look into it. As to the other aspect of the matter concerning addressing a meeting, I do not quite follow what the honourable senator meant. I am quite sure that the Government of Australia is not in any way organising some such demonstration. It is not responsible for any arrangements there and is not proposing to participate in the arrangements of the meeting. </para>

Is the Minister able to say whether the extensions to the building will contain provisions so that international flights can be handled at Hobart? When does the Government anticipate building runways so that fully laden aircraft larger than 727s can fly direct to Hobart from places like New Zealand? </para>

            <para>- I address my question to the Leader of the Government. Are we to accept from the figures produced by an advisory committee of the Commonwealth Employment Service appointed at the instigation of the Minister for Labour, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Cameron, that 61.8 per cent of all people unemployed in Australia should not be receiving unemployment benefit? If so it would mean that it is costing the Government and the country $435,000 a week for people who are not genuinely unemployed. Further, 19 per cent of the people in the figures given had been on unemployment benefit for 6 months of more. </para>

              <para>-I think that is right. Some people have obviously been getting this benefit irregularly. Last year there was a prosecution of one person who had obtained the benefit under a number of different names. There have been a number of other prosecutions. The Government is using its best endeavours to see that in a time of full employment people do not get benefits irregularly. However, I am a little surprised, if I may say so with respect, at the figures that the honourable senator has mentioned. I did have a look at them and they seem to me very much larger than what I had understood was the position. I assure the honourable senator that the matter is being investigated by both Ministers and that where there are any irregularities appropriate action will be taken. In a time of full employment it is quite wrong that anyone should be imposing upon the Government. This is wrong at any time but especially at a time of full employment. </para>

            <para>-Cabinet decided yesterday to update Brisbane airport. As the Minister representing the Minister for Transport I do not have with me the full details of the proposal to update the airport but I expect that I can get the details within a very short period. I could not reply properly to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> when he asked his question, but I have since received details of the proposal for Hobart airport. With your permission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and for the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley,</inline> I would state what work it is expected will be undertaken at Hobart airport at a cost of $1.3m and expected to be completed in 1975-76. The present airport was built in 1953 to cater for passenger loads of the smaller Viscount and Douglas DC6B aircraft. It is now completely inadequate, in size and design, for the bigger passenger loads of the DC9 and Boeing 727 aircraft. The Government has decided not to extend the present terminal. It is proposed to replace it with a new structure on the existing site. The terminal is to be built in stages so as to minimise inconvenience to passengers and airlines. The present terminal had capacity for only 1,400 passengers and visitors. It is expected that by the early 1980s the Hobart terminal will need to cater for at least 3,500 passengers and visitors. The Minister added that the existing roads, car parks and aprons will be adequate for the time being. It will be necessary to construct a small operations building nearby to replace the existing operations centre in the old terminal. </para>

            <para>-My ques  tion is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industry. I refer to the action of unionists in refusing to permit the export of livestock on the basis that it is endangering abattoir employment. Is the Minister prepared to condone a position in which contracts are in danger and a valuable trade is in jeopardy because of the attitude of union officials, or has the Minister intervened? Has he had discussions with the union or with the Minister for Labour? </para>

              <para>- Yes. The position is, of course, that the reduction in the slaughter of livestock in Western Australia, which I understand is the key to the issue, is due to the simple fact that less meat is available for slaughter. Whether or not the Minister for Labour has taken any steps to intervene in this matter, I do not know. I think it is more appropriate that I should refer the question to him to see whether he can give the honourable senator any further advice. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. When is it expected that the Taxation Review Committee, chaired by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Asprey, will report to the Government? When it does, will the report be tabled in Parliament? Is it a fact that the Australian Council of Trade Unions, generally known as the ACTU, has made a submission to the Committee? Is it a fact that part of the submission of the ACTU to that Committee advocates the abandonment of sales tax and that any consequential loss of revenue be covered by an adjustment of the income tax scales? Does the Treasurer agree that such a proposal, if adopted, would undoubtedly result in lifting the income tax revenue by between 25 per cent and 30 per cent and inevitably would place an additional tax burden upon the lower and middle income groups in the community? Is it also a fact that the ACTU, in its submission, advocates that child endowment be replaced by a new scheme which would provide for direct grants to parents, and would be taxable? Is it not a fact that child endowment payments at present are not taxable? Is it also a fact that the ACTU, in its submission to the Asprey Taxation Review Committee, advocates that claims made by parents in their taxation returns for the education of their children be reduced to the average cost of parents sending a child to a State school? Is it not a fact - </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DOUGLAS</inline>MCCLELLAND (New South Wales- Minister for the Media)- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> the Senate will be aware that on 13 March 1974, 1 tabled in this chamber a report of the independent inquiry into frequency modulation broadcasting, indicating at that time that the Government would be studying the details of the report and would eventually announce its decision on the method&#39; of introduction of FM broadcasting in Australia. I can now indicate to the Senate that the Government has accepted in principle the recommendations contained in the report and has approved the establishment of the first stage of an FM broadcasting system in the VHF band. This first stage will, of necessity, involve the re-allocation of television and other transmissions in some areas in Australia, and the Government has given approval for the expenditure of $3m over the next 2 or 3 years to facilitate this allocation. </para>
          <para>The FM radio system to be adopted in Australia will be the pilot tone stereo system and will be located in the radio frequency band that lies between 88 and 108 megahertz. This system will be compatible with international standards for FM radio. The spectrum space involved will be allocated on a 0.1 megahertz channel basis with adjacent channels initially spaced 0.8 megahertz apart in any single reception area, but in adjacent reception areas a spacing of 0.4 megahertz may be used. It is intended that the initial allocations in the band should be made in the 92 to 94 megahertz and the 101 to 108 megahertz areas. </para>
          <para>At this stage the Government has not made a firm decision on the types and functions of the stations to be established in FM radio, because detailed technical plans are to be developed for the system. Planning in both of these areas, however, will commence immediately and will be undertaken in a manner that will allow the development of FM services to proceed without interruption. In the initial stages of planning, most particularly on the types, functions and locations of stations, my Department will be consulting with other Government departments before recommending the policy to be adopted. </para>
          <para class="block">The Department of Urban and Regional Development, in particular, is expected to play a significant role in this planning because the Government believes that the policies adopted in the planning of media services should take particular account of the special needs of growth centres such as Monarto in South Australia and Albury-Wodonga. In the course of the planning, the Government will also take account of the effects of the adoption of a new policy on the allocation of frequencies in the medium frequency band. Honourable senators may be aware that on 20 February last I indicated that with a new policy in the medium frequency or AM area, it may well be possible to double the number of stations currently available to the listening public through existing conventional radio receivers. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Francis</inline> McLean and Professor Renwick, the commissioners who conducted the independent inquiry, expressed the opinion that the adoption of a new policy here is of a major significance to the policy to be adopted in the introduction of an FM system and there will need to be a careful examination made to decide which of the new requirements for radio services should be more properly accommodated in the AM band and which in the FM band. &#39; It may well be desirable, in utilising the FM spectrum space available, to ensure that the services established in FM are those which can best make use of the high fidelity, interference-free characteristics of this mode of broadcasting. In general, music broadcasts, for example, will be best heard on FM, while broadcasts which predominantly involve speech, may generally be best established in the medium frequency area. This, of course, will be subject to later decision by the Government but, at this stage, I thought I should indicate some of the lines that may be pursued in our future deliberations. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators who have followed in detail the deliberations and recommendations of the independent committee of inquiry will be aware that the committee did not confine its recommendations simply to the commencement of FM broadcasting. Some of the recommendations within the McLean report contain suggestions to the Government on the future conduct of considerations on frequency modulation as well as suggestions on the standards to be established for radio and television receivers, the nature of new services and administrative arrangements which will assist in future planning. The committee recommended, for example, that I should consider &#39;setting up a permanent consultative committee to advise on basic matters affecting the development of all broadcasting services, whether over the air, by wire, by satellite, by recorded form or by any new form of mass communication&#39;. It also recommended &#39;that a body should be set up to co-ordinate the purely technical aspects of broadcasting development&#39;. </para>
          <para>In the light of these recommendations, the Government has decided, at this stage, that it should set up a permanent advisory committee, established broadly along the lines proposed by the inquiry, but with its functions confined to advice on the allocation of frequencies in the Australian frequency table. This committee will be responsible to me, as Minister for the Media, and to the Postmaster-General. The proposed membership of the committee will be decided by the Government at a later date. At this point of time, however, I should indicate that the Government believes that the  chairman  of this committee should be selected from amongst representatives of Australian Government departments on the committee. </para>
          <para>The report of the independent inquiry has also recommended that an assessment should be made of the problems involved in the use of the UHF band for broadcasting in Australia, that as soon as possible all colour and all black and white television receivers should be made suitable for UHF reception and that arrangements to control the performance of television and FM receivers should be made, particularly in relation to their mutual interference-producing capabilities. The Government accepts these recommendations. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators may be aware that my colleague in another place, the Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morrison),</inline> has been considering for some time the establishment of standards for television receivers from the consumers&#39; point of view. The Government believes that it is important that the consumer should be assured when he or she purchases a television set that the set is safe to use in the home and will provide reasonable reception, free of interference. As Minister for the Media I have asked my Department to co-operate with my ministerial colleague in the preparation of standards for television sets and I now propose to examine the provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act to see whether it is possible to ensure that standards laid down for all forms of broadcast receivers can be enforced to provide protection to the public. </para>
          <para>It has not generally been realised that a large part of the problem that has existed with the introduction of FM radio in Australia has had to do with the fact that many television sets purchased in Australia have not had built into them the design features that might have protected them against interference from FM radio signals. At the initial stages of FM development, the lack of this design feature in television sets may cause some minor problems but will not constitute a serious impediment. If the system is to be thoroughly developed, however, these design features will need to be incorporated in new sets if serious interference problems are to be avoided. Meanwhile the Government intends to avoid some possible problems in this area by accepting the recommendation of the inquiry that &#39;no new television transmitters should be authorised in Channel 5 and no new authorisation should be made in Channels 3 or 4 pending a detailed forecast of FM facilities required in the 1980 V. It also accepts the recommendation of the inquiry that for new FM allocations the definition of the service area covered by the licence should be clearly established. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators will be aware of the fact that the inquiry has recommended that in the first phase of an FM system, television programs established on the Channel 5 area should be cleared by allowing the stations concerned to transmit their signals on another channel. The first stage of this clearing process will necessitate the movement of Channel 1 in Taree, New South Wales, to Channel 6. It will then be possible to proceed in areas like Newcastle, New South Wales, and Bunbury, Western Australia, with the reallocation of their Channel 5 services. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>it is significant that the final recommendation of the inquiry indicates that additional staff should be provided in the technical planning department of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and in the transmitter construction department of the Australian Post Office, sufficient to enable the implementation of FM development ... to be achieved in the time indicated&#39;. This recommendation will be taken up in the normal way after decisions have been made on the detailed schedule of the introduction of FM radio. I believe, however, that the Broadcasting Control Board accepts, as I do, that the report of this inquiry is a thoughtful and well prepared document and opens up the most exciting prospect for radio listeners that has been seen in the last 40 years in Australia. </para>
          <para>I express my appreciation and thanks to the commissioners for their report and, as Minister responsible, give my assurance that the Government will do what it can to see that FM services are introduced with the least possible delay. That is my Party&#39;s policy as established at its last Federal Conference. I would be remiss, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> if I did not also use this opportunity to extend my thanks to the members of the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts for the role they have played in this area. I believe that the Government&#39;s acceptance of the Committee&#39;s recommendation for a new inquiry and now the Government&#39;s acceptance of the recommendations of that inquiry, constitute one of the best examples to date of how a system of open Government can operate in Australia to the benefit of all Australians.

          <para>- Although the Opposition had some general information last week that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> would move this motion, it has taken us a little by surprise that the motion has been moved today. I feel, in view of the imminence of certain events, that it is appropriate that this Bill should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. Therefore, the Opposition will not oppose its reference. However, I should say this: It had been the intention of the previous Government that it should await the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs after its consideration of the terms of reference dealing with divorce, custody and family law before presenting any Bill relating to matrimonial causes. We appreciated that a considerable amount of work had been done by that Committee since this reference was made in December of, I think, 1971. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>At the time of the change of government in December 1972 the Committee had not reported. I asked a question of the  Chairman  of that Committee late in 1972 as to whether it was correct that the Committee had met only once in the course of 1972. Though that be my impression, I have not yet had it confirmed by the  Chairman  of the Committee. Certainly, the Committee has not met on many occasions since the change of government in December 1972. One can hope only that if the matter is now referred to this Committee the Attorney-General will use his good offices to ensure that the Committee does meet and consider its report. I have stated publicly that I think there is a great deal in the Bill which has been introduced which is constructive and which provides the basis for consideration of an appropriate divorce and family law in this country. I say that, although I personally would have a number of reservations about a number of the provisions contained in the Bill. I acknowledge that it provides a constructive base for future work. If the work of this Committee is to be of assistance, then it seems to me that it must be prepared to do its work, and do it reasonably promptly.&#39; That, of course, necessitates its sitting. As I say, whether the events of the next few days will permit the Committee to sit is another matter; but I assume that that is a matter to which the Attorney-General must have given consideration when he moved the motion. </para>

          <para>- in reply- In response to what has been put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> let me say that the intention is not to take the Bill out of the Senate. I should make that point clear. The motion says that, notwithstanding anything contained in the Standing Orders, the Committee shall be empowered to consider the clauses of the Bill. So the Bill will remain in the Senate, although the Committee will be entitled to look at its clauses in pursuance of its previous reference on this whole subject matter. I am aware of the enormous public demand for reform of the laws in this area. I had hoped that the Bill would be dealt with by the Parliament during this present sessional period, and it is very much to be regretted that events which will delay or prevent the consideration of this measure, which so much affects the people of Australia in their individual ways, may intervene. I will not pursue that matter because we will see what the events bring. However, I want to ensure that no opportunity at all is lost to have the Bill pursued, whether in this chamber or in the Committee. </para>

          <para class="block">One of the Bills before the Senate is the Health Insurance Bill 1973. It comprises the principal legislation to enable the implementation of the Govenment&#39;s health insurance program. The Health Insurance Bill 1973 provides for payments for medical benefits, hospital services and certain other specific services such as health program grants. I should emphasise that the Bill contains the same provisions as those outlined to the Senate when it was originally introduced in December 1973. Last year, it will be recollected, the rejection of this Bill prevented a key promise of this Government from being realised in the public interest. The Government is now putting this Bill once more before the Senate. </para>
          <para>We are putting this Bill once more before the Senate because the introduction of an equitable and efficient health insurance program covering all Australians was one of our major election promises and one which was clearly approved by the electorate. Some members of the Australian public have perhaps been affected by the false fears which have been spread about the meaning of our program. However, a great number of people have seen through the smokescreen and it is apparent that organisations such as the Australian Medical Association have lost credibility with the public, and it will also be demonstrated in the future that political parties which align themselves with such narrow, sectional and ferociously conservative groups will similarly lose all credibility. </para>
          <para>The whole debate on health insurance has polarised opinions roughly according to whether people have a progressive and socially concerned outlook or whether they are so conservative as to resist all worthwhile change. But there is one point on which there is general agreement and this is that in some way or other all Australians should have health insurance coverage. It would, of course, be possible to tinker with the so-called voluntary health insurance scheme to provide a patch-work coverage for the more than one and a half million people who do not have insurance coverage at present. One proposal- that of the Australian Democratic Labor Party, which I understand has some attractions for honourable senators opposite- would cost an additional $180m at least, which represents nearly a 2 per cent increase in taxation. Instead of opposing, I would suggest that the Opposition should go further than that and in the course of the debate it should explain exactly the cost of any proposals it has to rectify the defects in its scheme and indicate from where the money is to be raised, given its clear undertaking that it will cut back savagely on public expenditure. </para>
          <para>Nobody can pretend that the present health insurance scheme is either equitable or efficient. Moreover, it is not even comprehensive. One of our first concerns is to see that everyone in the community is brought into the system. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that the present scheme covers only about 87 per cent of the population. In absolute figures, having regard to the total population, this means- and I repeat what I said earlier- that over one and a half million Australians are not covered. Under the proposals in these Bills- and I point out that the Health Insurance Commission Bill flows from the Health Insurance Bill- everyone in the community will be automatically covered. As I mentioned, it would be possible to do a patch-up job on the present scheme to cover such people as pensioners and low income earners. I repeat that the Democratic Labor Party seems to have some vague suggestions about how this can be done. The DLP may well be sincerely motivated in its proposals but the fact is that they represent a poor solution to the basic problem to which they are addressed. The total annual cost of the DLP proposals which would seem to have so much attraction for honourable senators opposite are of the order of $ 180m. That is an expensive &#39;band aid &#39; exercise on this very defective system. </para>
          <para>This would represent a very costly partial solution to the social challenge posed by the inadequacies of the present pensioner medical service and the plight of low income earners who are unable to afford coverage under the existing health insurance scheme. In practice the DLP proposals would have the effect of excluding from eligibility for free general practitioner care many pensioners who would be eligible for this free treatment under the existing pensioner medical service. The fact is that the present means test for deciding eligibility for the pensioner medical service for a couple without children is $86.50 a week, whereas a couple without children cannot be admitted to the subsidised health benefits plan unless they have a weekly income of $69.50 or less. </para>
          <para>The Bill now before us will enable the implementation of a program which will provide complete coverage, including specialist medical care, for all pensioners and low income earners for the same total cost as would be incurred in the continuation of the existing ramshackle array of health care schemes. Let me restate what I mentioned a few minutes ago. Tinkering with the pensioner medical service to cover pensioners under the subsidised health benefits plan will exclude great numbers of people who would otherwise have enjoyed the benefits of the pensioner medical service. Let us hear clearly and in quite concrete terms what is the Opposition&#39;s alternative program and how the Opposition proposes to remedy the serious defects in the present health insurance scheme. </para>
          <para>Perhaps the single aspect of the program most frequently and blatantly misrepresented has been the matter of choice of doctor. Many people do genuinely appear to have been deceived into thinking that they will lose their freedom of choice. It therefore must again be emphasised that our program in no way alters the present doctor-patient relationship. Patients will be perfectly free, just as at present, to choose their own family doctor. In the hospital situation, which is of course governed by State authorities, patients in public wards will generally be treated by sessional or salaried doctors, just as they are at present, and in intermediate and private wards they will be free to have the doctor of their choice by virtue of the extra insurance premiums they pay- which again is the same situation as applies at present. Attempts have been made to cause fear in the public mind about the use of health insurance cards. I should rather hope that we will see no more of this discreditable propaganda following the report, tabled in this place on 7 March, by the Committee of Inquiry into the Protection of Privacy on the question of patient privacy in health insurance. But in case there is a lingering desire to debate this issue on the part of the Opposition let me remind honourable senators opposite of the shocking degree of intrusion into personal records held by the Department of Social Security which my colleague, the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> uncovered in the latter part of last year. This had been a longstanding practice tolerated by past governments until the time we achieved office. </para>
          <para>The Committee of Inquiry into the Protection of Privacy made recommendations which are in line with the Government&#39;s intentions, as spelt out in the White Paper, regarding the use of health insurance cards. We had, prior to the report by the Committee, made it clear that the recommendations of the Committee concerning confidentiality of patient information would be included at an appropriate time in the health insurance legislation. A close examination is being made of the Committee&#39;s recommendations in preparation for the introduction of appropriate amendments to the health insurance legislation, whether embodied in the Bill now before the Senate, in complementary legislation, or in interim amendments to the existing National Health Act. </para>
          <para>The total costs of the program will be the same as those which will be needed for the present unco-ordinated series of health care assistance schemes. For individual members of the public the costs will be based on the equitable principle of ability to pay and they will mean that the great majority of the public will pay less for the benefits of the program than they at present pay for coverage under the so-called private health insurance system. It is true that those on the highest incomes will pay a little more than they do at present but most of those on low and middle range incomes will pay less. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators opposite are welcome to the role of defending the present inequitable system by which those who earn least pay the most for health insurance coverage and those who earn the most pay the least. Opposition to our program has been expressed by many conservative groups during public debate over the last year or so. It is surely noteworthy that such groups as the AMA, the General Practitioners Society, the Association of Medical Specialists and the Voluntary Health Insurance Association have vested interests in the continuation of the existing health insurance scheme. They may have ideological beliefs about the concept of universal health insurance financed through taxation, but it is very plain that their primary motivation is concerned with their perception of their own material interests. There are, of course, hundreds of unions and other organisations which support our health insurance program, many of them no doubt for reasons of ideology and because our proposals offer a materially better deal for their members. But it is significant that considerable support for the program has come from groups which have no political commitment to either side of the debate and no discernible material interests. </para>
          <para>What of the Anglican Bishops, the Church and National Committee of the Presbyterian Church and the Australian Council of Social Services, to name only a few? It surely could not be suggested that those people are biased in their support for our program or that they are naive or have a misplaced sense of social values. The plain fact of the matter is that they are people concerned with social equity and progress who, after honestly and dispassionately examining our proposals, have decided that the health insurance program will be for the general good of the community. </para>
          <para>All of the deceit and distortion which has been injected into the community debate on our health insurance proposals cannot alter the fact that this Government came into office with a clear mandate for its program. The introduction of that program has already been delayed too long. Too many Australians are suffering too much hardship because of inadequacies of the decrepit existing scheme, cynically bequeathed to the public by the Opposition, for this Government to accept further delays. </para>
          <para>I should mention that while the Health Insurance Bill is the main legislative instrument for the introduction of the Government&#39;s health insurance program it is the Government&#39;s intention that complementary legislation concerning such matters as the scope and operation of private health insurance and the introduction of levies on taxable income and on motor vehicle third party and workers compensation insurance will be introduced at a later date. We will also, I repeat, introduce complementary legislation on the subject of the protection of privacy in health insurance operations. </para>
          <para>In conclusion, let me quickly sum up the main principles of this scheme. It provides universal cover and rectifies a serious defect in the present scheme which cannot be overcome except at enormous expense. Even then, there would still be gaps in coverage. The equity of cover in the present scheme should be intolerable to any community that claims to have a social conscience in that those people who can least afford it pay most for their health cover, and those people who are most able to afford it pay least. Perhaps most importantly of all- we lose sight of this- is the way in which the pooling of funds allows the whole community to be covered and allows an expansion of the range of services available to the community to be provided at no additional cost to that currently outlaid under the present system of private health insurance, repatriation and medical services and pensioner medical and hospital services. That is one of the crucial points- I suggest that it is the most crucial point, which is consistently lost sight of. </para>
          <para>The alternatives are to incur greater expenditure. That can be done only by increasing taxation, by reducing outlays in other areas, by an amalgamation of those things or by foregoing important priorities which could be included in general programs if a more efficient system of pooling finances could be undertaken as the Government is proposing in this universal health insurance scheme. When it is all boiled down, the real crux of the issues centres around the point that we are offering universal coverage to the community- something that belongs in most countries today; something that is being introduced in the United States of America; something that has been established in Canada for many years. As he indicated in another place, the Minister for Social Security was in Canada recently and was advised by the Ontario Medical Association, amongst other representatives of the medical profession, that they wholeheartedly embrace a universal system of health insurance based on fee for service private medical practice in the community.

            </talker>
            <para>-Since this debate commenced last week other events have developed which have defused it of some of its intensity. We are therefore able to consider the motion and the amendment that were brought before the Senate somewhat more patiently, 1 suggest, and, I hope, with a little more clarity. It will be remembered that arising out of the transaction affecting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> and his appointment as Ambassador to Ireland, it was first of all announced that he was appointed to that position and both the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> referred to an intention of submitting a resignation. Then events took place in Queensland that preceded that resignation and commenced an election as from the night of 2 April. What we are debating is the attempt of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> to counteract the effect of that by antedating that proclamation of the commencement of the election in Queensland and claiming that a casual vacancy occurred in this Senate on either 14 March or 21 March. There has been a lot of glib talk which seems to use in the language of some people the word &#39;resignation&#39; as if it were not different from a &#39;forfeiture&#39; by reason of acceptance of an office of profit or for other reasons. I suggest that there is the greatest difference between a voluntary act of resignation of a senator and a contrived forfeiture of his office under either section 44 or section 45 of the Constitution. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The proposition which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has advanced to the Senate is that there was a forfeiture of office. The proposition which I advance to the Senate is that there has been neither a forfeiture of office nor a resignation up till this time. </para>
          <para class="block">Therefore I support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> which is broadly to that effect. The proposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> depends upon a claim that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> as from 14 March or 2 1 March held an office of profit. I suggest that to examine that one must consider the documents that he put before us to claim that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> has been appointed to and holds an office of profit. The document of 14 March is simply a letter from the Prime Minister to the GovernorGeneral expressing the Government&#39;s wish &#39;to appoint The Honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Vincent</inline> Clair Gair, who is presently a Queensland member of the Australian Senate, as its Ambassador to the Republic of Ireland&#39;. It certainly concludes with a paragraph saying: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government considers that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gair</inline> is well suited to the position of Ambassador to the Republic of Ireland and I recommend that you approve his appointment. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That letter is minuted &#39;Approved. Paul Hasluck. 14 March&#39;. Then there is the minute paper of the Executive Council of 2 1 March in which it is recommended by the Prime Minister, as Acting Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, for the approval of  His Excellency,  the Governor-General in Council, that in relation to the appointment, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gair</inline> be paid such salary and allowances as may be determined by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs; that such appointment be subject to such other terms and conditions as may be approved by the Minister; and that such appointment commence on or from a date to be determined by the Minister. </para>
          <para>It is quite clear that the appointment was not commenced by this document. The Executive Council minute specifically provides that the appointment shall commence on a date to be determined by the Minister. It provides for the Minister to provide in relation to that appointment salary and allowances and other terms and conditions. That is followed, in the haste with which events pressed upon us on 3 April, by a long document, hastily prepared by the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee).</inline> It says: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. Donald Robert Willesee, Minister of State  . . hereby approve the following salary, allowances and terms and conditions in relation to this appointment: </para>

                <item label="2.">
                  <para>Unless otherwise provided herein, the undermentioned terms and conditions shall come into operation on the date upon which the Head of Mission shall arrive at the post provided that . . . </para>
                </item>
              </list>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">This provides certain provisions as to commencement of salary, outfit and certain other allowances shall come into operation at a date previous to arrival at the post. But, in that document so prepared by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, there is not one word that exercises the provision of the Executive Council minute determining the date upon which the appointment is to commence. I would have thought that in that situation learned counsel who have been good enough to provide opinions, obviously for the purpose of submission to Parliament, would have taken the trouble to analyse those particular parts of the documents and would have given us some analytical discussion on the formal requirements for appointment as an ambassador, and then would have discussed the extent to which these documents conform to those formal requirements. Even giving full credence to those opinions, nobody could be persuaded on the present documents that up to this time any appointment has been commenced. </para>
          <para>It is a specific provision of the GovernorGeneral&#39;s approval that the Minister for Foreign Affairs shall determine the date upon which the appointment shall commence. To get over the imbroglio that was caused by the afterthought of the contention- that is to say, for a contrived forfeiture of the office- the Minister did go to some pains to provide terms and conditions that should apply in relation to the designated appointee and when he should commence duty; but, as to the commencement of the appointment, it is left open for one to believe- I suggest it is open to belief on a reasonable basis- that the Ambassador designate will carry with him letters of credit which are the Governor-General&#39;s appointment of him to the office. They will be the authority for him to commence duty in his office upon his arrival at his post. As to that being the reasonable contemplation of all parties concerned with the transaction, we were told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> last week that specifically as of Thursday last <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was not Ambassador to Ireland, he was Ambassador designate; that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brennan</inline> is our continuing Ambassador to Ireland and when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> gets there he will hand in his letters of credit and also <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brennan</inline> &#39;s recall. There will be an immediate changeover in the position of Ambassador when the new Ambassador&#39;s appointment will commence and the outgoing Ambassador&#39;s appointment will cease. </para>
          <para>I take the opportunity to say that in the light of this situation it is impossible to be persuaded that there is very much reason behind the viewpoint put forward by counsel. It certainly is impossible to accept the afterthought of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> who has just conjured up this contrived forfeiture for the purpose of counteracting the astute move by the Premier of Queensland to commence the election before an anticipated resignation. It quite clearly was to be supposed, apart from the point of the formality of the documents, that whatever was signed by the Governor-General and the Ministry here while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was a member of the Senate is properly to be interpreted as a proposal conditional upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> resigning his position in the Senate. It is quite in the ordinary course of affairs for arrangements to be made for the formal appointment to be made when other preliminaries such as resignation from the Senate have been undertaken. I suggest that anybody who does not advert to the interpretation of the transaction that gives to these documents that we have before us a conditional operation shows that the consideration that has been given to the matter has been quite conspicuously incomplete. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> had something to say, according to the Daily Mirror&#39; of 4 April; that is to say, as late last Thursday. He is reported to have said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I consider that I did not resign from the Senate until I presented a letter to the  Chairman  of the Senate announcing that I had accepted appointment as Ambassador to Dublin. I was still a senator on Tuesday night. That is why I attended the Senate sittings and voted in some divisions. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That deliberate statement was made by him after the matter had come into controversy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> said that on the Tuesday night he was still a member of the Senate. He went on to say in another part that he had his resignation in his pocket and intended to submit it the next day; but what he did submit the next day was not a letter of resignation but a letter that had been prepared for him by the Attorney-General or his advisers, asserting a contrived forfeiture because he held an office of profit. </para>
          <para>Suppose that all I have said needs questioning. Consider the next point. Any person who holds an office of profit under the Crown becomes subject to a disability upon which his place becomes vacant; that is to say, he has to hold the office, not merely to be promised it, or not merely preliminary documents prepared. He has to hold it; not merely to be in receipt of salary, but in such a position that he is authorised to exercise the authority of the office. Fancy an empty shell of an ambassador with no authority to act in respect of one ambassadorial duty from now until he gets to Dublin. Who could suggest that in any real sense that person holds an office of profit within the terms of the Constitution? That leads me to make a comment, retaining all the respect that I can for the opinions that have been submitted to us to persuade us on legal grounds. Not a word is said in those opinions that when we are about to a forfeiture of an important office in the affairs of this country, that is to say a seat in the </para>
          <para class="block">Senate, or if we are to prove a forfeiture of such a matter as a licence or a lease, the courts, of course, with great prudence- and we would follow them in this attitude- require the strictest of proof. The onus of proof is heavily upon the person who is asserting the forfeiture. In the circumstances of this situation how can it be said in any real sense that a person in Brisbane, even though he is put on the payroll and has been provided with a garment or an outfit allowance and some promise of travel expenses, holds that office? Does he hold that office? Certainly not. A person holds an office when he takes his place to exercise the authority of that office. It would be an impossible proposition, I suggest, in any court of law to argue that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> holds an office of profit. </para>
          <para>It is said that he has agreed to take a fee or honorarium for services rendered to the Commonwealth. Not a word is addressed in the opinions to the actual meaning of that phrase. We have already had attention drawn to the other phrase in section 44 of the Constitution relating to the holding of an office- not any office, but an office of profit. Let us suppose that profit would include the case of taking fees or honoraria. One would have thought that we would be entitled to a little elucidation from learned counsel as to what particular meaning should be attached to this second phrase. Other than to deny what has been alleged by other counsel outside the Senate, and to say that it does not merely apply to past services, there is scarcely a mention of this phrase and its proper meaning in the opinions. </para>
          <para>So, we are asked to be persuaded that this senator directly or indirectly takes or agrees to take any fee or honorarium for services rendered to the Commonwealth. If it is an office of profit to which he has been designated carrying salary, allowances and fees would the language of one&#39;s country construed without cleverness considered that a person holding an office of profit came within the description of a person who had agreed to take any fee or honorarium for services rendered to the Commonwealth? I submit that we must get to a very aborted construction of that phrase if we are going to apply it with propriety to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> position as now ambassador designate and even after he becomes ambassador and agrees then to take fees or honoraria for services to be rendered. When the clause is subjected to a little notice- I do not pretend to have given it full consideration- it instantly bears in upon one that it certainly does not cover the case of an office of profit of an ambassador in which he takes regular salary, fees and allowances. It is obviously a case where there has been a contract whereby somebody has rendered services to the Commonwealth in the discharge of some public duty in connection with his membership of the Parliament and then agrees to take from the public purse a fee or honorarium for the services that he has rendered. Ex post facto it is corrupt reward for services that were rendered as a member of the Parliament. </para>
          <para>The other thing that puzzles me about these opinions- I express no final conclusion with regard to them- is that there is not a word of reference to the provisions in the Crimes Act with regard to bribery, conspiracy and the buying and selling of offices. Section 88 of the Crimes Act states that any person who corruptly obtains any benefit of any kind for himself on account of anything done or omitted to be done by him with regard to the appointment or contemplated appointment of any person to any office in the public service of the Commonwealth is guilty of a crime, and any person who corruptly confers upon any person any benefit of any kind on account of any such act or omission is guilty of a crime. This section reproduces an old statute of George III which was brought in to make criminal the corrupt purchase and transfer of offices. I am speaking only from memory. It was 20 years ago when a matter of corruption came up in Tasmania. I have not had time to verify the matter. The only thing to be consedered here is whether it is corrupt and that is essentially a jury question. But secrecy is a badge of corruption and so too is the degree of benefit and the degree of unreasonableness of the transaction where an arch enemy of the Government gets the benefit of a public office and thereby agrees to vacate another office for the benefit of the Government electorally. It is a matter for the jury to determine whether or not there has been corruption. </para>
          <para>Section 86 of the Crimes Act states that if 2 persons are engaged in an agreement to effect a purpose that is unlawful under a law of the Commonwealth it is a crime. I do not know, and I do not assert at the moment, whether an agreement to contrive a forfeiture of the seat of a member of the Parliament is an unlawful act in the sense of the section but at least it deserves consideration by counsel who put forward their opinions as advice to this chamber. </para>
          <para>In section 73 of the Crimes Act one finds that bribery is defined without reference to the term corruptly&#39;. In that section any Commonwealth officer who obtains or attempts to obtain a bribe shall be guilty of an offence and any person who bribes a Commonwealth officer shall be guilty of an offence. &#39;Bribe &#39; is described in this way: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Bribe&#39; includes the giving, conferring . . . of benefit of any kind in respect of any act done or to be done ... in relation to a matter arising under a law of the Commonwealth . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">A Commonwealth officer is .described as:   a person who performs services for or on behalf of the Commonwealth . . . </para>
          <para class="block">Obviously if the Senate were to be persuaded that forfeiture has been effected it should receive an analysis of the legality or illegality of the transaction which is supposed to constitute the forfeiture. We would not entertain very readily evidence as to a transaction if responsible counsel, on consideration of that and all the other evidence which an inquiry might produce, said that there was a prima facie case for the AttorneyGeneral to investigate as to whether crimes had been committed. That leads me to say that on none of the grounds put forward could anybody responsibly be persuaded that this retrospective idea of the Attorney-General of a contrived forfeiture should be accepted in any degree. </para>
          <para>But then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> realising the weakness of his situation, comes in here with a motion that the question clearly entertained by the Government should be submitted to the High Court under section 1 56 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The Attorney-General says, if you please, that section 156 of the Electoral Act is exhaustive and that no remnant of jurisdiction remains in this Senate to exercise the jurisdiction which formerly belonged to us by virtue of the section of the Constitution. So <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> says that section 156 exhausts our jurisdiction. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> I remind you that section 156 - </para>

I should be using section 203. 1 forebore to consider section 1 56 in relation to the other 3 sections of the Crimes Act, but I would have expected the Attorney-General and his advisers to have given comments on section 156 of the Electoral Act from the point of view of legality.

          <para class="block">Section 203 states that any question respecting the qualifications of a senator or respecting a vacancy in either House may be referred by resolution to the High Court as a Court of Disputed Returns. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> tells us that that section was penned with the introductory words: &#39;until Parliament otherwise provides&#39;. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland who said that he could not find any exposition of those words. Of course, they are words which he used in relation to section 5 1 of the Constitution which gives this Parliament power over matters in respect of which other sections provide &#39;until the Parliament otherwise provides&#39;. Section 203 provides that any question respecting a vacancy may be referred to the High Court. When Parliament was dealing with disputed elections it provided in section 183 that the validity of any election may be disputed by petition addressed to the Court of Disputed Returns and not otherwise. This is a clear and specific direction that any question as to a disputed election has to go before the High Court. But when it came to a question of vacancy other than under a disputed election, Parliament carefully used the word &#39;may&#39; without saying that it should not be determined otherwise. In the absence of a reference to any authority by the counsel whose opinions were put before us, I make a casual reference to Professor Enid Campbell&#39;s book on &#39;Parliamentary Privilege in Australia&#39;. This is how this learned professor sees the matter, at page 101: </para>

            <para>Where, as under the Commonwealth Electoral Act, section 203 ... the House has a discretion to refer such questions to the elections court, there can be no doubt that the House still retains power to determine whether a member duly returned has, subsequent to election, become disqualified or for some other cause has vacated his seat. </para>

          <para class="block">So in relation to the contentions which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland put before us that there now rests within us no jurisdiction to determine upon a vacancy or disqualification, this learned author says that there can be no doubt that the House reserves the power to make an effective determination in those circumstances. </para>
          <para>I suggest that all I have said is confirmed when one considers the structure of the whole of this part of the Constitution. The idea is that a secret vacancy, contrived by forfeiture 20 days before it was announced to the public, can have any effect upon the duties of the Governor of Queensland with regard to the election. That the ridiculousness of that ought to appear when honourable senators examine section 2 1 of the Constitution. The Governor of Queensland takes no notice of such a vacancy except upon the authentic communication from the  President  of the Senate. Section 2 1 provides: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Whenever a vacancy happens in the Senate, the  President  . . . shall notify the same to the Governor of the State in the representation of which the vacancy has happened. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I suggest that a little reflection upon any one of those propositions will destroy the argument for the motion and support the argument for the amendment. I submit that at the time at which the amendment took place, of course, there had been no resignation and no vacancy caused by this contrived forfeiture. </para>

            <para>- I rise, as an ordinary person and not as a lawyer, with some trepidation after listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> speaking for three-quarters of an hour. He based most of his argument, both last Thursday and again today, on the question of whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator, at</inline> that time, V. C. Gair had or had not written a resignation; because he had not written a resignation a position as Queensland senator was not vacant. The position is quite interesting when one looks at the Constitution, as I have done. Section 44 is the first section which deals with a person who can be eligible to sit in the Senate. The section lists a number of people who cannot under any circumstance become a senator. Section 44 (i) to (v) lists the people who shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator. Having established who is eligible, the Constitution, as is quite reasonable, deals with the case of a senator or a member of the House of Representatives who does something which takes away his right to be a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. Section 45 (iii) of the Constitution is the important section because it states that if a senator &#39;directly or indirectly takes or agrees to take any fee or honorarium for services rendered to the Commonwealth&#39; his place shall thereupon become vacant. The phrase &#39;directly or indirectly takes or agrees to take &#39; is an extremely wide one. It covers pretty well any situation one could think of. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let us deal with the letter which V. C. Gair addressed to the  President  and which is dated 3 April 1974. The third paragraph of that letter states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As you are aware, the position of Ambassador is an office of profit under the Crown and also carries with it fees for services rendered to the Commonwealth . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think it is obvious to anyone that at that time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was of the opinion that the position of ambassador was an office of profit. He considered that at that point of time, by this letter which he sent to the  President,  he was not eligible to continue as a senator under section 45 (iii) because he had agreed to take a fee or honorarium for services rendered to the Commonwealth. He said this is his letter. I know of no ambassador who at present is in his position in an honorary capacity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> will probably find out whether there is one, but I know of no person in an ambassadorial position who is not receiving an emolument for his office. Therefore, when V. C. Gair said &#39;As you are aware&#39;- he was referring to the  President-  he believed that the position of ambassador was an office of profit under the Crown. I think that sentence is the relevant part of his letter. It makes the point that his office as a senator would have become vacant because he had agreed to accept the position. </para>
          <para>I wis&#62;h to take the matter a little further. Section 47 states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Until the Parliament otherwise provides, any question respecting the qualification of a senator or of a member of the House of Representatives, or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament, and any question of a disputed election to either House, shall be determined by the House in which the question arises. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I contend that this is in the normal flow of the way in which the Constitution was compiled and is presented here. Section 44 lists the persons who are eligible to stand. Section 45 states that a person cannot remain a senator if he does any of the things listed, such as becomes subject to any of the disabilities mentioned in the last preceding section, takes the benefit of any law relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors or agrees to take any fee, which is the one I quoted- section 45(iii). The notation in the column alongside section 47 is &#39;Disputed elections&#39;. I have dealt with a case in which a person automatically leaves his position in the Senate when he does certain things. When a person has been elected or appointed, as he can be by a GovernorinCouncil in any of the States- he can be appointed; he does not have to be elected- if any one of the provisions of sections 44 or 45 of the Constitution are contravened, the Senate can meet and determine whether any action should be taken against the person who is sitting as a senator. </para>
          <para>I feel that we should not be guided by the weight of numbers. We are faced with a very complex situation. It seems to me that the reasonable and just thing to do is not to come down on one side or the other but to refer the matter to people who understand the workings of the law. This would happen if the motion moved by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> were carried. We are not asking the Senate to determine, we are not coming down on one side or the other; we are asking that the highest authority in the land determine the correct procedure in view of the whole of the proceedings in relation to the nomination of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> to the position of Ambassador to Ireland. I think we would be recreant to our trust if we tried to take over the responsibility of determining the right thing to do when we are not able to argue this matter properly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has argued it from one point of view, and members of the Government who are lawyers have argued it from another point of view. There are always 2 points of view to any question. I believe that the correct procedure is not to accept the amendment but to vote for the motion. </para>

              <para>- I would go along with what the honourable senator said in relation to the Constitution in making out his case if it were not for what appears in the House of Representatives Hansard record of 2 August 1946.

It is rather interesting to read how, after about six or seven speeches had been made, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Makin</inline> referred to his parliamentary life, what happened during his career, how he had enjoyed it, had gone on finally to Become the Minister for the Navy and capped his career by being appointed as Australia&#39;s first Ambassador to the United States of America. On 2 August 1946 he said: </para>

We all knew in this place that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Annabelle had been so appointed. But it was some time after it came to be known in this place that she resigned from the Senate. At that time I did not hear any honourable senator on the Opposition side raise any concern over her appointment or her resignation. A case very much closer to me involved my colleague, ex-Senator Prowse. He told me that he had been to a doctor who had recommended that he get out of Parliament. I had to study the Standing Orders and the Constitution and abide by what they set down to ensure that he resigned from the Senate in the proper manner. I had to do this. </para>

          <para>The case under the discussion is totally different from the 3 cases that I have mentioned. I believe that this is a crisis which is very serious indeed. To me this case reeks of premeditated scheming and a disregard for political morals. We have had many crises in this Senate. One has only to think of the VIP flight crisis in which honourable senators who are on the Government side but who were on the Opposition side at that time tried to bring down the Government of the day because they believed that they had a very good case. They believed that there was a situation in which the Minister responsible was acting improperly. When one thinks about how VIP flights are run these days, what happened during the early stages when this Government came into office and what happened in regard to the transporting of members&#39; families and so on, surely we could have raised a VIP issue with just as much force as did Opposition senators in earlier days. Other crises involved Jetair Australia Ltd and the Hoffmann case. One of our Senate colleagues paid a very high price for his administration of that portfolio and for the criticism that was levelled at him by then Opposition senators. </para>
          <para>I was very concerned last week and also this week when I found out from answers to questions that the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> was inclined to say that Opposition senators were not able and did not have the right to question him in detail on these matters. This is a very different story from what happened in 1970 when I was Minister. I remember very vividly the case of an aircraftsman who went absent without leave. I can recall sitting in the place now occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> and being grilled by the then Opposition Leader in this place as though I were in some court. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator who interjected is aware of this. He went through this on the Jetair business. It is wrong for the present Leader of the Government in the Senate, who has the responsibility for this case, to stand up and say that Opposition senators are not allowed to ask questions or to ask them in much greater detail than he would desire. It is plain that the Government has been dishonest in this case. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> has said that the Honourable V. C. Gair was appointed on 14 March. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> who is the Leader of the Government in this place, said in answer to questions the other day that the appointment was no later than 2 1 March. Then we had the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee)</inline> saying that the appointment was formal on 3 April. At the same time that Minister admitted that the Honourable V. C. Gair was only Ambassador designate. We had a further elucidation today on this matter, also by that Minister. But whatever the situation is I believe that the Parliament and the people of this country have been hoodwinked. I believe that the people are entitled to be disgusted with the Prime Minister who has schemed to gain a majority vote in this Senate in order to reverse the balance of power given by the people in a democratic vote. </para>

          <para>I believe that the Prime Minister and his Government can be likened to a group of men who set out to plan the perfect crime. Honourable senators can imagine these men examining all the wherefores and the whyfores. If they take this action they will get a certain result; if they take another action, they will get a different result. So these people plan the situation very carefully. But like many people in this situation, they disregard one important fact. I am not saying for a minute that the Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues disregarded a particular fact. What I am saying is that they did not place the importance on one particular fact that they should have placed on it. That is the issuing of the writs. They thought that they could overcome that problem when they came to it. But like most offenders, they slipped up on one vital point and it has brought their scheme undone. I am sure that their sordid actions have not been obliterated from the memories of the people of this country. </para>
          <para>I come to the way in which appointments are made. I said earlier in my remarks that we have had examples of appointments made. I referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Makin</inline> and the former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Annabelle Rankin. It is quite traditional for a person to resign so that he or she can take up another appointment. It is not traditional for an appointment to be made in order to gain a resignation from Parliament. That is the point that counts in this case. Let me talk about the acceptance of the appointment. How does the Government explain away the fact that the terms and conditions of appointment were signed on 3 April 1 974 if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was, in fact, Ambassador to Ireland on 14 or 2 1 March 1974? How was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> to accept an appointment without knowing the terms and conditions? Is it not logical that he should wait and learn the terms and conditions before he agreed to accept them? </para>

          <para class="block">Willesee, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, said today that he was given the job of drawing up the terms and conditions in writing and that he did that on 3 April. Did not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> then have a look at those terms and conditions on that day, or did he accept the appointment before those terms and conditions were drawn up? I believe that the Government has shown itself to be guilty of connivance and trickery. I think that that has been borne out by the questions that have been asked in the Senate and by the statements that have been made which have been contradictory and misleading. The Government has abused the trust of the people. Therefore, I believe that it no longer has a mandate to govern. f now wish to say something about manipulation. Who can say that today or tomorrow or next month or next year the Government will not try to pull off a similar manipulation of the Parliament? I wonder whether there is sitting in the Senate amongst us another Opposition senator who is to lose his seat by being whisked away overseas post? Certainly, we would not be told if such an action had been taken. The Government, by its malpractices, has created an intolerable situation of doubt and suspicion. I believe that there is a gross offence against the Senate. Not only is the Senate competent to deal with the matter, but also it has a clear obligation to demonstrate by its vote that it will not again be used as a pawn in a rigged game of political chess. So we support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I hope that by doing so we will not see this sort of fiasco come before the Senate again. </para>

            <para>-The proposition before the Senate is a simple one. It is that the question be referred to the High Court of Australia sitting as a Court of Disputed Returns, as to whether, and if so when, a vacancy has happened in the Senate in the representation of Queensland in connection with the place of Vincent Clair Gair. We are debating this issue at a time when the whole of the exercise can be neutralised by other events. This will become part of history. I think that some of the exaggerated statements that have been made by members of the Opposition to bolster up their very weak case will reflect upon them very badly in the view of historians in as much as they are contradictory of statements that have been made previously in the Senate by people such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> I think that it is worth repeating the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> as stated on 24 August 1971, when he was Attorney-General:  1 would have thought that where a Senator&#39;s constitutional right to sit in this chamber is conferred by the Constitution, the High Court is the appropriate body charged by the Constitution with the duties of interpretation. It would be an unreal situation if this Parliament or any one House of the Parliament were to decide whether or not a senator had the qualifications to remain in this chamber, I believe it would be mischievous to embark upon an inquiry in the assumption that this Parliament or this chamber does have the power. </para>

          <para class="block">This is the proposition that we are debating this afternoon. Because of the charges that have been made, we had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> talking about the Crimes Act and we have heard him state that a crime has been committed. We have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> claim that the Government has been dishonest in the case. I think that it is a logical proposition that this matter be taken away from the heat of political argument in the Senate and properly investigated by the High Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockmen</inline> said: &#39;Who can say that tomorrow or next year a member of Parliament may not be similarly manipulated?&#39; All of these descriptions of the events leading up to this debate are highly accusative and would much more properly be dealt with by the High Court of Australia sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns. </para>
          <para>I personally would like the matter to go before the Court of Disputed Returns because there I would be able to give on oath certain evidence in relation to other matters leading up to and surrounding this issue and the charges which have been made about manipulation. I would be able to tell the Court that before the Senate rose for the Christmas recess <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> and I had our first conversation for a long period of time about an operation for dupretrens contracture that he was to have on his hand. He was advised by his doctor to consult me because I have had a series of operations on my hand for this particular complaint. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> approached me and said: What was the result of your operation?&#39; We exchanged views on the matter. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> returned to the Parliament after the recess, which was on 28 February when  Her  Majesty opened the Parliament, I met him in the little reception room near the members&#39; bar. I said to him: &#39;How is your hand progressing?&#39; I gave him some advice that was given to me, about how to exercise his hand so that he used the muscles and how to deal with any adhesions that might result from this. As a matter of fact, this was an unusual conversation because of the very rare occasions on which I have ever spoken to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair.</inline></para>
          <para>On 5 March the Senate elected its  Chairman  of Committees.

In the circumstances, people as bitter as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> and many of his colleagues and others who have, been under pressure in different ways should not now sit in judgment on a matter that obviously should go to the High Court. However, I will continue with the sequence of events, because it is very important. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> had given me this description of his colleagues and the way in which they had treated him, I suggested to him that he should go for a holiday with <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Gair.</inline> Before we parted company 1 said that he looked tired, that he had had a long parliamentary career, and that that was what I thought. Then, on S March <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> came to me and said that he was interested in the discussion I had with him. I said to him: &#39;What do you have in mind?&#39; I said that because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Negus</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> had been overseas.

We can see what has happened. Certain people despised or resented <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> action in getting out after being treated the way he was by his own Party.

              <para>- Professor Lane was said to be a member of the Liberal Party. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said that no one should question the political background of any person giving a legal opinion but it is my view that Professor Lane came in, without any basis facts, from the very night of the announcement and possibly he was seeking some political kudos. The fact is that he deigned to come into the argument without knowing the facts and wanted to influence the Senate. Possibly he was one of the Opposition &#39;s advisers. That is the sort of advice that Opposition senators seek from people within their own political ambit. They got this information from him.

          <para class="block">Here we have Professor Patrick Lane putting up a proposition without the facts, trying through the Press to influence this Senate. Now the Senate itself is putting up a case that this should be referred to the proper quarter- to the Court of Disputed Returns. I would very much like to see this matter go before the Court of Disputed Returns. The facts would then be elucidated, the case would be judged by dispassionate peoplethe highest legal people in the land- the odium that would remain on the Senate for making a judgment in the heat of political argument rather than on logic would be removed, and the traditions of the Senate would be followed, much to its advantage. I support the proposition that this question be referred to the High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns. </para>

            <para>- The question before the Senate is a very serious one indeed. To understand it it is necessary to understand the chronology of events of the past week or weeks. The starting point is the emergence of a point in time at which there came into public knowledge the understanding that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> Gair had been appointed by the Government of the day to be Ambassador to Ireland. The method by which that knowledge came to the public is of real importance. It did not come from the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee)</inline> sitting in this chamber. He is the Minister responsible for that Department, for ambassadors, for the appointments within the Department and, very specifically, he is responsible for the determination of the terms and conditions of appointment of ambassadors, including this starting point of their appointments and their emoluments. I would stress that one would have believed that the normal thing would have been for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to rise in his place and announce the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> and the terms and conditions of his appointment including the date of commencement and the emoluments. That did not happen. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As I understand it, the public knowledge came by way of response and not by initiative; it came by way of an answer to a question in the first place, that answer given by the Prime Minister. It did not come otherwise. There followed on 2 April a questioning as to whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> had resigned. This culminated on the evening of 2 April in an action taken in the Queensland Parliament, through the Governor of Queenslandvery properly under the powers vested in him and in his Government under section 1 5 of the Commonwealth Constitution- to issue a writ for the coming Senate election. The Prime Minister had written to each of the State Governors telling them of his intention to hold an election on 18 May and giving them the clear belief that they were to issue writs for that election for 5 Senate vacancies. No mention at all was made that there would be a sixth Senate vacancy. It is important to understand that that letter itself is evidence that at that time the Government of Queensland, and the Governor of Queensland, clearly had prima facie evidence that there was no other vacancy; there were only 5 prospective vacancies. Accordingly, under section 1 5 of the Constitution, the Governor of Queensland issued a writ and an election is now in process for the election of 5 senators in Queensland, the election date being 1 8 May. Quite clearly that is so. </para>
          <para>In the next day or two we had a number of events. One was the handing to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President</inline> on 3 April of a letter signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> Gair, which is now tabled in this Senate. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> studied that letter to determine its nature and you on that day made a statement in this Senate, saying, if I may precis it, that you had considered the letter of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> in the light of your responsibility under section 2 1 of the Constitution which requires you to notify a vacancy in the Senate to the Governor of the State in the representation of which the vacancy occurs, that you had to satisfy yourself whether such a vacancy had occurred; that you had reached the opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> letter was not a letter of resignation but a notification of his appointment as Ambassador to Ireland and that in his view the effect was to vacate his position as a senator by virtue of various disqualifications under sections 44 and 45 of the Constitution, and that you therefore, quite properly, referred the matter back to the judgment of the Senate, having the conscious knowledge that your responsibility was under section 2 1 of the Constitution. Section 2 1 states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Whenever a vacancy happens in the Senate, the  President,  or if there is no  President  or if the  President  is absent from the Commonwealth, the Governor-General, shall notify the same to the Governor of the State in the representation of which the vacancy has happened. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>you, very properly under section 21, studied <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> letter, concluded that it was not a letter of resignation and concluded also that within your powers of determination <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> had not resigned and to that extent at least he was still a qualified senator; but that to the extent that events relating to his appointment may have disqualified him under sections 44 and 45 of the Constitution, you would refer this to the Senate. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, no</inline> doubt had clearly in your mind that you would do so under the terms of section 47 of the Constitution, which is the relevant one at this moment. That section says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Until the Parliament otherwise provides, any question respecting the qualification of a senator or of a member of the House of Representatives, or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament, and any question of a disputed election to either House, shall be determined by the House in which the question arises. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">As I read that section it imposes as the normal responsibility on the Senate the determination of the qualifications of a senator and whether there shall be a vacancy, and it does that until the Parliament otherwise provides. So the Constitution charges this Senate with a normal responsibility of determining the qualifications of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> at the date of reference of the letter and whether that vacancy had occurred at that time. I say that the Senate has a fundamental obligation to act within that section of the Constitution. After you had made your statement, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, in</inline> opening debate on it the Government moved that under section 203 of the Electoral Act the matter be referred to the Court of Disputed Returns which, in the Commonwealth jurisdiction, is the High Court. The Opposition replied by way of amendment, the substance of which is in Hansard. It contains a clear understanding that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> had not resigned, that there is abundant evidence that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> and his Ministers knew that he had not resigned, that he intended to resign on 3 April and that clearly therefore the Government has acted with immense impropriety and not only should be censured but also should resign. </para>
          <para>Let me trace the events as such. I want, in terms of section 47, in determining whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was disqualified prior to 3 April, to call 4 witnesses. The witnesses are <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> himself; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> the Prime Minister; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> the Foreign Minister; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> the Attorney-General. I draw attention to 6 profound items of testimony demonstrated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> and available to the Senate. Firstly, I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact, which is beyond doubt, that from the relevant date of 14 March, on which the Government contends <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> appointment was made, until the evening of 2 April <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> functioned and operated as a member of this chamber without any challenge by any other member of this chamber, without your knowledge of any disqualification, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> without anyone&#39;s conveying to you any such knowledge, and without any challenge to him. I remind the Senate that I chose the date of 14 March because on that day the Prime Minister sought the approval of the Governor-General for the appointment in the future of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Vincent</inline> Clair Gair as Ambassador to Ireland and  His Excellency  approved it under the date 14 March. Therefore, the relevant information concerns the point of time, either on 14 March or thereafter, on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> vacated his place either by resignation or by disqualification. </para>
          <para>As first testimony I have said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> attended in the Senate on all sitting days from 14 March to 2 April inclusive. The records show that he voted in 9 divisions, some of them very important divisions; that he spoke on a constitutional matter; and that he voted in this chamber at approximately 10 p.m. on 2 April when you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President</inline> were in the chair and were freely available to him should he have desired to convey to you a message of resignation. So, by that action <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> purported to be a senator and nobody challenged that. </para>
          <para>The second testimony is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> received all salaries, allowances, emoluments and travel allowances for the month of March. That, of course is a matter of record. If he were not a senator he would not have been eligible for those payments. </para>
          <para>No person in this chamber took any action in that regard. Thirdly, he used his office in this place and on the evening of 2 April used the travel warrant provisions of this Parliament, through the transport officer, to leave Canbrra and to fly home. If he were not a senator, that would not have been available to him. Fourthly, he told many people in this place, including his colleagues, that he would resign on 3 April. That evidence is capable of being obtained verbally and no doubt by way of statutory declaration. Fifthly, he has not ever provided a letter of resignation. Sixthly, he was available to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President</inline> at all times from 10 p.m. onwards on 2 April. </para>
          <para>Conclusively, by all the actions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> he was a senator discharging and being permitted to discharge all his functions and, incidentally, taking part in divisions on 2 matters regarding constitutional alterations. They are matters of very great importance. A disqualified senator, by participating in a vote on them, could have put in peril the whole question of the authenticity of the business of this chamber. </para>

The Attorney-General, who had the passage of the Bills, sat in this chamber knowing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was voting. He knew of the majority required. By his silence and by the silence of all Ministers including the Prime Minister and of all members, tacitly the Government gave proof of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was a qualified member. I now call as witness <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> the Prime Minister. </para>

          <para class="block">The Prime Minister said on 2 April that on his understanding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was still a fully qualified member of the Senate. Who would know better than the Prime Minister? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> finds nothing of merit in this matter. In  fact, he washes his hands of it, and frankly I do not blame him; but it will be hard to do so. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> why he had not responded on this matter and he said that the Prime Minister was the Acting Minister for </para>
          <para class="block">Foreign Affairs at all relevant times; that the Prime Minister was the Minister in charge of this matter. So the Prime Minister is the one man in Australia who can speak authoritatively on this question. Had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> resigned or disqualified himself by 2 April? The Prime Minister said: He has not, I understand, resigned from the Senate yet&#39;.

          <para>Now I will call, by way of involuntary testimony, the Foreign Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee.</inline> He is the responsible Minister- if not for making the appointment while absent overseas, for supervising all the terms of the appointment. It was necessary for him to discharge the terms of the Executive Council minute of 2 1 March. No man could have been more in possession of the facts than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> save the Prime Minister, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> must have known from 2 1 March that it was his job to fix the terms, conditions, emoluments and the date of appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair. Senator Willesee</inline> sat in this place, however temporarily, recognising the existence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair-</inline> he was here on 2 April and before- and not raising a voice challenging the qualifications of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair.</inline> He made no attempt to intervene at all. </para>

              <para>-I will invite the Senate and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline> to make this decision. I can quite understand the nervous dyspepsia of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill,</inline> who is interjecting; he had to hurry back from a half-completed visit to Africa because his own pre-selection is in a turmoil and because he is threatened by the very people on his side who caused this debacle. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> attempts to raise his voice after his panic race back from Africa to try to protect himself against the left wing steering committee which has wrecked his Party in conjunction with the Prime Minister- the Gietzelts, the Murphys and the James Mcclellands of this world. I call every Labor member who pauses in the corridor to deny this. What are members of the Labor Party saying today? They are saying there are 2 causes of this debacle they are now in. One is the wilful, headstrong Prime Minister they have who resists and disobeys Caucus. They are saying this day after day to me. At the weekend my telephone was running hot on this point. The other thing they are saying- of course <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> does not like it- is that once again as with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and as with the breaking of pairs- and I sympathise with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> on this- this was the result of action of the left wing steering committee. </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline>had not resigned or been disqualified from this Senate by at least 3 April. I called as the first witness <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> pointing out that by his actions, his deeds, his acceptance of the emoluments of office and his conversations with his colleagues he had indicated that he proposed to resign on 3 April. I made it clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> at a Press conference had indicated that his clear understanding was that on 2 April <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was a functioning senator with full qualifications and that he, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> understood that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> would resign on 3 April. I was examining the actions and words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee.</inline> I quoted the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> and the answer given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> to illustrate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> made it clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> would take up his appointment, in terms of conditions and commencement date, on 3 April. I went on to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> had been in this chamber in the weeks before. He was fully aware of the circumstances regarding the appointment. He did nothing to indicate any disqualification of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair.</inline></para>
          <para>I now draw attention to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> has produced no paper, no letter, no written document of any appointment by the Government of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair;</inline> nor any indication of an offer and an acceptance. But let me test the situation regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair.</inline> If there were an office of profit under the Crown, if there were directly or indirectly any benefits or honoraria coming to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> then those benefits would have come between 14 March and 3 April of this year. It is the habit of all departments as at 3 1 March to make up the cheques for payment of all out of pocket expenses of all servants of the Commonwealth, including honourable senators who today will have received an acknowledgment of their travelling allowances for last month. Then, I quote as evidence on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> the fact that he has not by any act, word or deed tabled any document to indicate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> has acquired any monetary gain or any reimbursement for the month of March. If he had done so, that evidence would have been available and it would have been produced. But the fact that such evidence was not produced is conclusive evidence that it did not occur. If such evidence happens to emerge tomorrow, everyone will have the correct suspicion of how it is invented. But the fact of the matter is that if expenses had been incurred, if salaries, allowances or emoluments had been paid, then that matter would have been capable of proof. No such proof has come forward. </para>
          <para>The Attorney-General is another definitely involuntary witness. He sat in this chamber from 14 March to 3 April. He said he knew during that time that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was disqualified as a senator. If this is true, then, in fact, he is guilty of a very serious offence because he condoned a breach of Parliament and he connived at actions which could have rendered the whole of the proceedings of this chamber invalid. It was his duty as a senator, as a Minister and particularly as Attorney-General to acquaint you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and, either through you or directly, the Senate of any knowledge which he had of a disqualification of a senator. He did not do so until some time after 2 April. He then said: &#39;I knew it a day or so before. I told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> that I thought he should not have been in here&#39;. That is quite outrageous. If that is so, he should have told the Senate. But, in fact, we did not know. </para>
          <para>Another piece of evidence which is of great importance is the fact that it is admitted by all sides that the letter signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> and delivered to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> was, in fact, not drawn up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair;</inline> it was the brainchild of others. There is some suggestion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> edited the letter. </para>

              <para>- He said that he edited it, but the production was that of the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> in a broadcast interview said that one of the many special assistants who have bedevilled this Government- I think in this case <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Eric</inline> Walsh- came to him and saw him. It is strange that, in terms of an appointment of a person to ambassadorial rank the negotiations and the details of administration should be done not by a member of the Department of Foreign Affairs or by the Minister but by a Press officer, a public relations officer. This, in itself, is of immense interest because it indicates what was intended, and that was a public relations exercise. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> said that he was pressed to hand in this letter. Let us see what the situation is. I point out that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, under</inline> your full authority announced that under section 21 of the Constitution you had decided that there was no vacancy; you had no evidence of a resignation and therefore there was no vacancy. You ruled that the letter was not a letter of resignation; if anything, it was a letter to be adjudicated on under section 47 of the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> since that is your clear prerogative, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> had not resigned. As you have not said that you have received any subsequent letter, he has not resigned. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The question then arises as to whether he has disqualified himself. One must keep this situation against the background that the Prime Minister said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was a senator on 2 April and that he was fully qualified. There are 2 relevant situations in which a senator can disqualify himself. Section 44 of the Constitution states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Any person who- </para>
            <list type="lowerroman">
              <item label="(iv)">
                <para>Holds any office of profit under the Crown, or any pension payable during the pleasure of the Crown out of any of the revenues of the Commonwealth: shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So the question is: Did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> at the relevant time hold an office of profit under the Crown or was any pension payable out of any of the revenues of the Commonwealth? Equally, section 45 of the Constitution provides: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>If a senator or member of the House of Representatives- </para>
            <list type="lowerroman">
              <item label="(iii)">
                <para>Directly or indirectly takes or agrees to take any fee or honorarium for services rendered to the Commonwealth, or for services rendered in the Parliament to any person or State: his place shall thereupon become vacant. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Does anyone suggest, by any kind of evidence before the Senate, that there is proof of a fee or an honorarium or payment for services rendered? Where has there been the faintest evidence; where has there been the faintest proof? Clearly under neither of these heads is this so. </para>
          <para>Let me recapitulate the facts. We are asked, under section 47, to decide the qualifications of a senator or whether there is a vacancy in the Senate. As to the qualifications of a senator, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> remains completely qualified in that he has not resigned. As to his disqualification under section 44 or 45 of the Constitution, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> has said: &#39;I was a senator until 3 April&#39;. The Prime Minister has said: <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator Gair</inline> was a senator until 3 April&#39;. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has said to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack:</inline> &#39;The appointment, including the commencing date and the conditions, functions from 3 April&#39;. They are the 3 responsible people- the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the person involved. All of them said this. This having been said and the writ having been issued in Queensland, the Government found that its snide intention had been frustrated. Its intention was quite clear. It wanted, by an act of surprise, to appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> have him resign at its timetable and therefore force 6 vacancies in Queensland so that it would not be possible for the Government to be defeated- 3 non-Labor Party and 2 Labor Party- in Queensland. The whole aim was to frustrate the electors of Australia. The 2 intentions were to deceive the Parliament grossly and, by deceiving the Parliament, to frustrate the will of the electors because by such a connivance the electors of Australia would be denied their right, under proportional representation, to exert a majority of non-Labor senators in this chamber. </para>
          <para>This was not just a trick on Parliament; it was an evil-genius plan to trick the electors of Australia. Clearly this is so. Clearly this was a post facto plot. In fact, it was a fraud in every sense. It comes close to being a criminal fraud in that it aims to deceive the Parliament and the people of Australia into a belief that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was disqualified on 1 4 or 20 March. </para>

              <para>-I said that if the Labor Party knew, it was conniving in a fraud. If it did not know, it invented this after the fact, and that is as great a fraud. On either level it is a major fraud. It is quite clear that it is a fraud. The Constitution places as the normal and proper responsibility and charge of the Senate the determination of whether a senator is qualified or whether there is a Senate vacancy. The duty of the Senate is to determine that fact, not to run away from it. Of course the Government wants to run away from it. Of course the Government wants to take it into the Court of Disputed Returns- anything to get it out of the public mind for the next few weeks. Why would the Government not want to do that? Why would the Government not want to delay now that it is caught out, with its sticky hands? </para>

              <para>-Senator Gietzelt is eager for me to answer a question. I will, so that we can be helped on this, because I would not like him to miss. He asked very phrenetically whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> is still a senator. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> you ruled that as at 3 April he was a senator in that he had not resigned. You ruled that he had not resigned. If, as at 3 April he had not resigned, unless he was disqualified he was still a senator. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> appointment and its conditions and emoluments took place from 3 April. I did not say this. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that it is so. I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt,</inline> through you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that his Minister for Foreign Affairs said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> vacated his seat, by disqualification, on 3 April. That is also what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> said. Whichever way we go, he certainly had not resigned by 3 April. The Prime Minister said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> had not resigned by 3 April. The Prime Minister said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was still a qualified senator. I did not say that; the Prime Minister said that. So <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> is asking for a test. The Prime Minister, ruling under section 47 of the Constitution, said that in his view and understanding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was a fully qualified senator as at 2 April, and he understood that the senator would resign on 3 April and not be disqualified. That is the situation. </para>

          <para>As is quite clear, a massive fraud has been attempted. Quite clearly, this has failed. The Government has been caught out. The guilty people are, firstly, the Prime Minister because he clearly knew; secondly, the Foreign Minister because, although he apparently was a very unwilling party to the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> he knew of it. He knew of the possibility of qualifications and he remained silent. So he must share the culpability. The Attorney, on his own confession, said he knew and he did nothing about it at all. Others are talking about letting the Labor Party judge those who egged it on. As with Horatio at the bridge, those behind cried forward&#39; and those in front cried &#39;back&#39;. So the left wing steering committee, which has done so much damage to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and with all its bad advice had divided and split the Labor Party once again, with the Prime Minister, has brought disruption and utter discredit to the Labor Party. The credibility of the Prime Minister cannot be re-established under this motion. I support the amendment as moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline></para>

            <para>- I intervene in this debate in relation to this whole matter for the first time. The matter before the Senate is, of course, one of very great consequence. It stems from a series of actions which are most reprehensible and must invoke the condemnation of the whole Parliament. We are seeing now a situation in which the greatest confusion has been caused, in which there is very grave doubt as to whether a certain person is or is not a member of this chamber, as to what are the consequences of that and whether or not that gentleman was or was not entitled to participate in certain deliberations here at the end of last week. All those things have been precipitated by something which could only be described as a grave violation of the traditions of the Parliament and an attempt to induce a person from one party to come across, to abandon his position so that the relative strengths in the Parliament could be redetermined. Those things are of very great consequence and must bring an element of very deep concern to all members of the Parliament. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline>has proposed that the matter as to the vacancy should be determined by the High Court sitting as a court of disputed returns. The first matter that comes in consequence is this- and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> said this-that in looking at the section of the Constitution under which the Senate itself may determine the question of a vacancy until and unless otherwise provided, the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> would argue that as the Electoral Act has been passed under the relevant section the Senate, to use his term, has exhausted its own power to determine this matter. I think that is a proposition which, whilst it was repeated time and again by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> without any substantial support, if any, is one that cannot be sustained. The section of the Constitution uses the permissive word &#39;may&#39;, and on any interpretation of that word, on the authorities in the High Court and elsewhere, that permissive or facultative term is one that must be given its ordinary meaning unless there is substantial evidence to the contrary. The authorities in relation to this matter under debate are not many but at least there is a very current authority. It is a very modern authority issued this year. </para>

              <para>- The Senate has the power under section 47 of the Constitution either to make the decision whether it will sit in judgment itself on the question of a vacancy or whether in a particular case it will pass that judgment over to the High Court sitting as a court of disputed returns. It may elect in its discretion to do one or the other. The authority I quote is from a recent textbook called &#39;The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia&#39;, annotated. The distinguished authors are R. D. Lumb, barrister and solicitor of the High Court of Australia, Reader in Law, University of Queensland, and K. W. Ryan, barrister-at-law, University of Queensland. This book was published this year, 1 974.

            <para>However, as these are essentially legal questions it is to be expected that they will be referred to the court.

          <para class="block">In other words, the learned authors say, in spite of the protestations of the Attorney-General, that the Senate has not exhausted its power to deal with this matter, if it elects to do so, merely because it passes over concurrent jurisdiction to the court of disputed returns. That is the first thing. The question is that the Senate has this power if it elects to use it. The next logical question is: Is this a matter in which the Senate should so proceed? We have seen this Senate act in matters of privilege. We have seen journalists arraigned before this chamber. Matters have been referred to the Committee of Privileges, which is the Senate sitting in another place and in another guise, a report being brought back and this Senate then sitting in judgment and confirming the investigation of that Committee. </para>

              <para>- There were legal interpretations that went to a layman committee- the Committee of Privileges of this Senate. This Senate sat in final judgment in an adoption of the report of that Committee. Nobody could say that one matter I have in mind, the recent matter of the 2 journalists, involved a situation in the Senate as important and as serious as this one is today. That matter involved the action of 2 journalists who prematurely had reported the contents of a parliamentary committee report. They were cited for that. In that matter the Senate said &#39;We are competent to deal with this ourselves&#39;, deputing the investigational committee of the Senate. In this matter where the very good name of the Senate is concerned, where the inviolability of its proceedings is involved, surely the Senate is entitled to take upon itself the responsibility of determining this matter if it elects to do so. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I hold strongly to the view that the Senate has that residual power. It has not abandoned it and it has not surrendered it totally. In a particular circumstance in a proper case and in the appropriate situation it is not only able to do that but, it is also required and is under a duty so to exercise its power and authority. There is too much of a tendency in these days for Parliament to surrender its power to bodies outside the precincts of these halls. Parliament is the elected body. It is the supreme body in the Commonwealth of Australia and at times it must accept all the responsibilities that go with that high office and high position. This is such a case. </para>
          <para>I do not wish to speak at length. But there is one aspect of this matter that concerns me very greatly. It affects the situation in which the honourable senator whose name is concerned in this matter has involved himself or in which he has been involved. There was some dispute as to whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was or ceased to be a member of the Senate as at a certain date, whether it was 1 4 March, 2 1 March or 3 April. Apparently, the matter remains unresolved. If the honourable senator was not, in fact, a member of the Senate, was not entitled to take his seat here and, more particularly, if he knew that that was the situation, he has involved himself in the possibility of an action at law by any complainant who may proceed by way of civil action against him, with a very high recovery of damages resulting for every person who so elects to proceed against him. </para>

              <para>- I am glad that the honourable senator made that point. This is not a criminal or a quasi-criminal proceeding. This is an action for the recovery of damages. Therefore, the situation of autrefois convict does not apply. If it is a criminal or a quasi-criminal proceeding and a person is convicted, he then raises that as a defence in a subsequent action. But this is a civil matter. It is what might be called a &#39;common informer matter&#39; and I would imagine the actions could be interminable. </para>

              <para>- I do not know. Let met leave aside all the questions involving the quantum of damages to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> might be liable. The fact is that under the circumstances that I have mentioned, if he were not entitled to take his seat, if he did, in fact, take his seat and particularly if he knew that he was not entitled so to do, then he becomes liable to an action at law. One of the pieces of evidence that would be adjuced against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> in any such proceeding would be, of course, his admission in his letter of 3 April in which he himself acknowledged that he had not been a member of the Senate since 14 March. </para>

It was prepared by people who were around <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> and by people who had an interest in sustaining the proposition that he had ceased to be a member as at a certain date before the writs were issued in Queensland.

              <para>- -Exactly. I would say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> had no independent legal counsel advice. Apparently, he was induced, persuaded or encouraged to sign a self-incriminating document that rendered him liable to legal proceedings. If that is the type of conduct of those around him- more particularly, of those people who were professionally qualified in the law- it is most reprehensible conduct and is to be condemned.

              <para>- I was saying that my disposition was that in order to clarify this position and in order to determine the situation an amendment might well have been moved in addition to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> amendment stating that this chamber itself make a declaration that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> is not longer a member of the Senate. Obviously, the documents indicate- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> own public presentations indicate- that he regarded himself as no longer being a member of the Senate. All that is in question is the date of resignation. That is in dispute. Therefore, I say that an obligation rests upon the Senate for it to determine this matter as soon as possible so that the position can be clarified. I have little doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers&#39;</inline> amendment will be carried. It will receive the support of the Australian Democratic Labor Party. 1 have in mind that perhaps tomorrow I might consider moving a further motion for a declaration by the Senate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> is not a member of it. I think that it is something that he himself would welcome. Obviously, it is something that is concerning him because in the documents he indicates that he thinks that he is not longer a member. He obviously wished to sever his connection and accept another post. He has been left in a position of uncertainty which the Senate can easily resolve. I think that there is a duty upon us to resolve the question as soon as possible. </para>

          <para>I finish on this note: If the Government wished to increase its numbers in the Senate it was not necessary to descend to this type of reprehensible subterfuge. The Government already had prepared the machinery for a double dissolution of the Parliament. If it felt it had the confidence of the people, over the last few months it could have gone to the Governor-General and asked for a double dissolution which would have tested the popular feeling in relation to the Senate. The Government could have done that if it had been confident that it could get the support of the people and gain a corresponding increase in its numbers in the Senate. But instead of having the machinery ready and showing that it was prepared to go to the people, it was prepared to use this indefensible method to persuade somebody to leave the Parliament. There is little doubt that that is the inescapable conclusion. For these reasons, I support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and indicate that I will give consideration to moving a substantive motion for a declaration by the Senate that, in fact, a vacancy exists thus letting the matter be finally resolved. </para>

              <para>- I am here to speak the truth, and I will speak it. Let me go through the incidents that led up to the position in which we find ourselves today. The story first broke in the Press last Tuesday morning, and I read about it in the newspapers. When we got to Canberra we met <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> and talked to him. I asked him whether the story was to be believed. At that time it was completely unbelievable to me that he would take that attitude. He immediately informed us that the Press report was true; that he was contemplating acceptance of the position; indeed, that he felt the matter had gone beyond his control; and that he thought he was committed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was asked, not by me but by another member of our Caucus who can speak for himself, to reconsider the matter. </para>

              <para>- That was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane. Senator Gair</inline> said that he did not think he could reconsider it, but he might. Asked when his term in the Senate would end, he said: &#39;Tomorrow I propose to hand in my resignation&#39;. They were the circumstances and that was the truth of the matter up to that point of time. </para>

          <para>When the story broke, of course, the Government was gleeful. Statements were made in the other House and in this chamber, and the Government felt that it had pulled a shrewd and competent political trick. I suppose it could have been said, if one has that standard of morality in politics- I have never subscribed to it- that it was a smart or clever political trick. But when one plays politics on that basis, of course, one naturally attracts resistance, and apparently resistance occurred. The Government was outsmarted. I. believe that this chamber is more interested in what happened then&#39; than in the circumstances of the purchasing, by the offer of an ambassadorship in Ireland, of the most hated enemy of the Labor Party. Those who hated him most set out to destroy him. Those are the circumstances we should be discussing, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> or ex-Senator Gair, whichever he may be, is no longer important in relation to the responsibilities that go with what has happened in this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> no longer is a significant factor in the arguments that are taking place because immediately the smart ones found that they were outsmarted they resorted to dishonesty and trickery and, it is alleged, lies in this Parliament in order to substantiate the situation. </para>
          <para>I want to trace the circumstances of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> appointment, not as a man with a legal mind but as an ordinary member of the Australian community. The first claim that was made to prove that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was no longer a senatorindeed, had not been for some weeks- was that he ceased to be a senator on 14 March when a letter over the signature of the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, who happens to be the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> was sent to the Governor-General informing him of the wishes of the Government in this matter and asking for his approval to proceed with the appointment. The appointment had yet to be made. According to the paper placed before us, the Government received that approval. On the basis of that approval it was suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was no longer a member of the Senate from a time which suited the Government. </para>
          <para>The Government made a hasty decision because it would be completely impossible to prove that a man had been appointed as ambassador to a country before that country had accepted the appointment. It would have been a breach of all the procedures established by all countries to appoint a person to an office such as this before he had actually been accepted by the country concerned. Of course, it is necessary to obtain the approval of the appropriate authority in one&#39;s own country before one can proceed to set in motion the necessary machinery for appointment. But who ever heard in any previous case- I hope that the Government tries to prove this in the High Court- of it being even possible to make such an appointment before acceptance had been received from the country to which the person involved was to be appointed. </para>
          <para>Now in this chamber the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> has shifted ground. Although the learned legal opinion submitted by the Solicitor-General states that the appointment became effective on 14 March, the AttorneyGeneral now wants to make it 21 March because that is the day after approval was received from the country that was to receive the benefit of the services of Vincent Gair as Ambassador for Australia. That approval was received on 20 March. On 21 March a minute, again over the signature of the Acting Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> was sent to  His Excellency  the Governor-General for his approval. The subject matter of that minute was: &#39;Appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the</inline> Honourable Vincent Clair Gair . . .&#39; So at that time the appointment was still the subject matter of a minute; it had not been accomplished, as was claimed originally, on 14 March. Of course, the fact of it being the subject matter of a minute does not constitute an appointment either, does it? Paragraph (iii) of that minute states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">Such appointment commences on and from a date to be determined- </para>
          </quote>
          <para>It says not that it has been determined but that it is to be determined in the future; if it does not mean that, what does it mean?  by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs. </para>
          <para class="block">That is what the Prime Minister and Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs asked  His Excellency  the Governor-General to approve, and the Governor-General gave his approval. He approved nothing other than that &#39;such appointment commences on and from a date to be&#39;- in the future- &#39;determined&#39;. Then we come to the honest legal opinion. It is strange that the very learned gentleman who gave this legal opinion used the same verbiage in expressing the opinion that the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> as Ambassador to Ireland was approved, and actually <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was the Ambassador on 14 March. In giving his opinion the Solicitor-General said:   . . that the former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator held</inline> an office of profit from the moment of his appointment . . . </para>
          <para class="block">I repeat the words: &#39;from the moment of his appointment.&#39; But the appointment had not commenced on 21 March; it was to commence on a date yet to be fixed. So how can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> have become an ambassador on 21 March when the legal opinion of the Solicitor-General is that he become Ambassador on 14 March? The legal opinion admits that he held an office of profit from the moment of his appointment. Yet the minute dated 21 March states that the appointment was to commence on a date to be fixed -in the future. </para>
          <para>As we all now know, the only suggestion that any date has ever been fixed came in an admission by the Minister for Foreign Affairs relating to the document that he has laid before the Parliament. Paragraph (ii) of the document sent to  His Excellency  on 2 1 March for approval contained all the subsidiary matters which go with the appointment, such as what it costs to get there, how much it costs to transport the furniture and the glassware, the cost of the insurance thereof and everything else; but it carefully omitted the date of commencement that had to be fixed. It has still to be fixed unless we can accept what the Attorney-General said here, that he considered that document to be the date determined. That is answered in Hansard because in an answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> there were 2 separate and definite statements from the Minister. What other construction can be placed upon it than that? That he was appointed at some previous date? Of course you cannot say that. </para>
          <para>But that is not the most serious thing. To make that stick, following the enormous pressure exerted by honourable senators by way of questioning to get at the truth of what had happened in this instance, a statement was made, not in this chamber but in another place, and for the first time, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> who was alleged by the Government to have been an ambassador for some 3 weeks and had come in here on 9 occasions and voted in divisions during that period, was told by the Attorney-General, who sits in this chamber, that he should not be here and that he should not vote. That statement was not made by the Attorney-General under pressure of question. It was first suggested in another place by the Prime Minister and later substantiated in this chamber by the Attorney-General who alleged that he did this. I want to read a statement made in Brisbane to a newspaper by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> on this very subject. I am not suggesting that the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General are liars. That has yet to be determined and it should be done by a royal commission because somebody has lied- either the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General or the Ambassador to Ireland. If the Ambassador to Ireland lied and the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General knew it, his appointment should have been withdrawn already. What inference can we draw from the fact that he is still tonight the Ambassador-designate to Ireland except that what he is reported to have said to this newspaper is correct. He is reported as having said: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">I issue this challenge to the Government: If that statement is true, is it going to send to Ireland the man who made it? Is it going to find out whether he did or did not make that statement? Is it going to send this man to Ireland? If its Prime Minister told the truth and if its Attorney-General told the truth he must be telling a lie. Is that the sort of status that the Government wants Australia to have abroad? </para>
          <para>I challenge the Government that it dare not allow this matter to proceed beyond this point. A royal commission at least should be appointed to ascertain the truth. I have heard honourable senators on the Government side talking about Watergate and somebody bugging somebody&#39;s office. This is political trickery again, is it not? Is bugging any worse than buying a political opponent to gain a political advantage? Who cares? Not I, because I have not been involved in such things. Let honourable senators opposite answer and tell me which is the worst- bugging somebody&#39;s office or buying somebody they have hated for the last 18 years. Honourable senators opposite know full well the answer to that question. The whole of the Government of the United States of America today stands in doubt in the eyes of the world because of one question and one question alone and that is: Did those in high authority conspire to deceive the Congress? </para>
          <para>This matter we are dealing with also is a conspiracy but here we have deliberate and direct evidence of those in the Parliament who are involved but they are too cowardly now to defend their honour. This is involved in the statement made by the Ambassador-designate to Ireland who said that people lied in the House of Representatives and they lied in the Senate. Yet those people are still going to send the man who said that to Ireland. Somebody is frightened to establish the truth and therefore they are going to allow this country to be besmirched in the eyes of the world and never resolve where the lie is. The lie must be somewhere between the 3 people who made the statements on this question. </para>
          <para>It is because this Parliament is more precious to the people of this nation than any of the little people in here and any of the parties represented that the Democratic Labor Party will go to the people, whatever seems to be the obvious political consequences. We will go to the people and give them their opportunity. This Senate has been charged with a sacred trust and that is the right to recall parliaments and send them to the people, their true masters. We do not dismiss the Government in this chamber; we merely say: Go back to your masters, the people, and let them decide whether your actions of the last week will preserve democracy and good government in this country, or whether they will destroy the prestige of this House and the other place for all time.&#39; For that reason we will have no hesitation when we come to vote on this motion. We will have no hesitation in regard to any of the other motions that come before this Senate and have to be decided not in the interests of politicians but in the interests of Parliament and the people. </para>

            <para>- This debate has aroused a great deal of heat and hysterical rantings from Opposition senators who are endeavouring to make some political capital out of an endeavour by the Government to carry out its mandate, its policies, and to exercise the prerogative of any person involved in politics attempting to achieve the art of the possible. I make no defence of the Government&#39;s position in this matter because I believe that the immorality in the matters that we have been determining over the last several months lies not so much in the appointment of the Honourable Vincent Gair but in those 10 senators who were elected in 1967 and who have sought to sit in judgment upon a government that was elected in 1972. That is where the immorality lies. Those people who were elected in 1967 were basking in the inability of the Australian electorate to understand the real issues of the Vietnam war. But by 1972 it had become apparent to the great mass of the Australian people that that was a dirty and unwinnable war and that in fact there was a need to clear the slate as far as politicians in Australia were concerned and to elect to government a party which had consistently followed a policy of not being involved in any war in Asia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In the last 18 months since this Government was elected in 1 972 it has sought to implement the mandate that was given to it by the Australian people but these 10 senators have been sitting in judgment and have been attempting to nullify and to destroy the mandate that was given to the Government by the people of Australia. That is the immorality in this whole situation. This Government has been frustrated by an obstructionist Senate. The Government has sought in every way to exercise the mandate given to it by the Australian people but that mandate has been set aside, amended or rejected by a number of people whom history has passed by in terms of the political development of this country. I do not believe that what the Government did in this case is any different from the practices that have been symbolic of the Australian approach to politics or, for that matter, the approach to politics in all the Western world? If in its endeavours to obtain a majority vote in this place the Australian Government was able to persuade any member of the Parliament to accept a position, one can only conclude that the person who accepted the position knowingly and willingly made the decision in the light of all the circumstances. </para>
          <para>One can understand the Democratic Labor Party&#39;s concern about this because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> has certainly affected its position in the Australian political scene; his retirement from this place has been a very heavy blow to the Democratic Labor Party. When one hears of attempts that have been made by those who seek to have this Senate determine the issue of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> retirement one would imagine that somebody in the Government Party had twisted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> arm, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> did not have possession of his faculties, that he would not have been able to make the decision himself, that this man who was formerly Leader of this Party had suddenly become irresponsible and incapable of making a decision affecting his future. It is a state of affairs which has, of course, created some sort of political reaction in this country. I do not intend to get involved in the legal side of the argument. It is crystal clear to me, since I have read the Constitution, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> agreed to accept the appointment and that it then went through the normal and formal channels of approval; that is to say, he accepted, it was then conveyed to the authorities in Ireland, and then conveyed to the Governor-General, and he gave his formal assent to it. From that moment on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> remained a member of this chamber no longer. </para>
          <para>With respect to the  President  of this place, it seems to me that in the first instance the responsibility to determine whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was in fact a member of the Senate on Tuesday last was the responsibility of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> himself. I cannot understand the thinking of the Opposition senators who have suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> was recreant to his responsibilities, that as the Leader of a minority party in this place he had to rectify a situation. Surely the responsibility rested either with the senator who should have understood what were the constitutional requirements or certainly with the  President  of this place. With respect to that statement, 1 say that I have the utmost confidence in the  President  of this Senate. However, it seems to me that he knew that the Prime Minister had made an announcement in the other place in respect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> and that then the responsibility rested with the  President,  the person in charge of this House. It was equally a matter of the responsibility of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus,</inline> the Leader of his Party, to question whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was entitled to be recording a vote in this chamber. To suggest that there was something improper on the part of the Government seems to me to be an untenable suggestion and one which no reasonable person could accept as capable of being believed or accepted. </para>
          <para>Of course, when certain members of the House became aware of some of the loopholes- I suppose that is the way one could describe the incident- a conspiracy was begun in which the Premier of Queensland, not acting honourably and in accordance with the Constitution, conspired with the Leader of the Country Party and certain persons in this place to deceive the national Parliament and to deprive the people of Queensland of an opportunity at the elections on 18 May of electing a successor to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair.</inline> I find that a conspiracy. </para>

              <para>- I think it is fair to recall the events that took place last week. The Premier of Queensland has basked in the publicity; he has taken great credit for having created some sort of situation here in Canberra. I do not think there is any doubt that he was aided and abetted by some members of the national Parliament. I do not think there is any doubt that there was a prawn night here in which attempts were made, quite deliberately, to restrain the senator from exercising his right to regularise this whole situation. The senator concerned was probably completely befuddled by the great amount of attention paid to him by those who hitherto had been his greatest admirers and supporters. Now that they are confronted with the legal situation and with the Government&#39;s proposition to regularise the departure of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> from this chamberthat is, by referring the question to the High Court for consideration- all sorts of unpalatable suggestions have been made. It has been suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> has rendered himself liable to some penalties because he has voted in this chamber. I am told that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Annabelle Rankin placed herself in a similar position some time ago when she in fact sat here from the time she had been given her appointment and before she took up her appointment in a new place. </para>

              <para>- There was no prawn night organised for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Annabelle Rankin. So we have a situation which is most unsatisfactory from the point of view of the Australian people, brought about by the intransigence of the Queensland Government and by attempts of members of this House and by other members of the national Parliament to try to prevent the regularising of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> retirement from this place. As a layman I have always understood that ignorance of the law has never been regarded as an excuse. If I had been appointed to some government position outside the Parliament, I would have made it my responsibility I am sure that is the way all of us should review this particular matter- to ascertain whether I was sitting in this chamber properly or otherwise. I certainly would expect that those who are senior to me in the official conduct of this chamber also would take steps to see whether my position was regularised. I cannot believe that anyone in his right senses can suggest that somehow or other the Government is at fault in this whole matter. </para>

          <para>But, of course, one would imagine, having regard to the hysterical rantings of some of those who have spoken on this matter, that this House has suddenly become a House of review; that it is not a party House, that it is a House of politics, that it is a House which exercises its right as a tribunal free of all party taints that affect us because we happen to be politicians. What sort of a trick are we trying to play upon the Australian people? Everybody knows that the matters involved in this question are being decided in each of the party rooms; that there is no possibility of the decision being arrived at free of the political influences and prejudices which we each hold and express. We are all subject to political influences in this matter. That is why the Government &#39;s proposition to put this question to the High Court ought to be supported. But everybody knows there is no chance of that happening. The DLP, having lost its former leader, is now prepared to decry him and pull him down from the pedestal on which it had placed him in recent years. It is so ashamed of the position it is in and so much aware of the political oblivion to which the electors are shortly going to confine it that we have no doubt about the attitude it will take. </para>
          <para>We have no doubt about the attitude of the Country Party because its Leader was part of the conspiracy to circumvent the will of the Government and the will of the people. The Liberal Party is prepared to make a last throw in the hope of getting electoral support. It will take any steps to try to get back into office. Let us have no illusions about what this chamber will do. Let us have no illusions about the inability of the Senate to deal with this matter in a judicial sense. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers),</inline> in moving his amendment, is seeking to delay the retirement or removal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> from the Senate. Is it suggested by those honourable senators who have been so vocal in this debate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> is still a member of this chamber?

              <para>- Yes,  His Excellency.  If the letter that he sent to the  President  of the Senate is not a letter of resignation- that is what has been seriously suggested- he is still a member of the Senate, although some people are now trying to put another proposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> in answering a question, said that as from a particular date last week <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was considered to have been appointed to the position of Ambassador, and some people are suggesting that that has no particular relevance to the matter in question. Either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> is a member of the Senate or he is not. Either he has resigned or he has not. Either he is constitutionally a member of the Senate or he is not. </para>

          <para>Honourable senators have taken a great deal of time in pointing out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> voted last Tuesday- probably in all ignorance, probably confused by the turn of events and by the hostility of his own Party.  His  Party colleagues, without any trial or notification, expelled him. He was not treated democratically or given a right of appeal. In the face of all these difficultieshe also was invited to a prawn evening in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> &#39;s office- how could it be expected that the matter would be regularised so that the people would understand what has taken place? If there is any guilty man, every member of this chamber is guilty because not one of us got to his feet to draw to the attention of the  President  that we had a stranger in the House. The colleagues of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> amongst whom he formed so large a part of the situation, took no steps to advise him, their former mentor, that he was transgressing in attending in this place. </para>
          <para>It is quite ludicrous for the Opposition to endeavour to paint the Government in some sort of black picture. Heavens above, have they not heard of the action of Premier Askin of New South Wales? I address myself to my friends opposite who are members of the Liberal Party. Have they not heard what Premier Askin did to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Abe</inline> Landa, a former Attorney-General in the New South Wales Labor Government? Premier Askin appointed him as Agent-General in London in 1965. I am sure that my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> would have been privy to that decision because at that time he was General Secretary of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party. How does it suddenly become immoral now that it is done federally when it was morally good and acceptable in the New South Wales political arena? Of course politics is the art of the possible and we are entitled to take every step at our disposal in order to get a majority in this place so that we can implement the mandate that was given to us by the electors in 1 972. </para>

I am one of those who believe that if the process of Parliament sets a certain course that is the right course to adopt. The Senate has been set up so that half its membership comes up for election every 3 years. That was arranged for a specific purpose. Whilst the other chamber changes more or less completelythat is, the government moves from one side to the other when there is a change- in this chamber that does not take place so far as the composition of the Senate is concerned. Our founding fathers specially provided that there would not be a complete change of thinking in this chamber as in the other. There is a carryover of membership from a previous 3-year term. 1 do not think it is right that that system should be altered by us as a matter of expediency. </para>

          <para>There is no doubt that the deal done with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was intended specifically to upset the particular purpose to which regard was had by the founding fathers. Normally 5 senators from each State come up for election, but in this case it would have meant that 6 senators would have been elected to represent Queensland. This was not done to observe a high thinking parliamentary standard. It was done especially to obtain a gain of one seat in Queensland&#39;s representation in this chamber so that the composition of the parties in the Senate might be changed materially. </para>
          <para>From a political point of view it might be regarded as clever thinking or good strategy, but from a parliamentary point of view it is very bad. When people know that the action is being taken for a certain purpose it is bad for them to acquiesce and to operate in this way. There is no doubt that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was offered and accepted the position the intention was not to get the highest possible ambassadorial representation in Ireland. It was done purely out of political expediency, and in those circumstances I think it was very bad. My own view is that the people appointed to ambassadorial posts should be chosen on the highest possible basis so that that is the type of representation we have in other countries. I an not degrading <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> in any way. He was Premier of my own State of Queensland for a number of years. He also has been a senator for a number of years. I am not speaking of him personally. But it seems to me that for such a post to be filled out of political expediency is the wrong way to choose an ambassador for this country. </para>

              <para>- The inside story is very simple and straightforward. It was just a matter of letting the Premier of Queensland know that in this way the usual process of election of the Senate would be altered. In those circumstances it was necessary for him to use his State powers to ensure that what the founding fathers had intended for this chamber would still remain. </para>

          <para>I entered this debate because I feel that the whole event should not have happened. I am very pleased that the Government&#39;s efforts have been frustrated. I hope that it will be a lesson to governments of all political colours and that they will learn that this sort of tactic should not be used. I am not in favour of its being used by a government of my own political thinking or by any other government because I think it is a very wrong practice. Therefore I am glad that what was thought would take place has not taken place. It seems now that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> will achieve the position of Ambassador to Ireland but the Government will not achieve its aim of securing the sixth Senate seat in Queensland in the way it hoped. </para>

I am very pleased that the situation has not developed in the way that the Government hoped. I feel very happy about any part that I have played in frustrating the Government&#39;s effort. In conclusion I say once again that these tactics, irrespective of the political colour of the government that uses them, are bad. I think that we should discourage these tactics as much as possible. Contrary to the view held by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt,</inline> I do not believe it is a thing we should aim for.

Had he done so the question of whether legally such a resignation would be necessary or operative may never have arisen as it apparently has not arisen in regard to a number of previous appointments. The fact is that he did not resign. After the actions of the Queensland Government it was necessary to examine closely the question as to his holding of and vacation of office. The legal view accepted by the Government is that in any event after 2 1 March he was not entitled to sit. There was no sitting of the Senate from 21 March until Tuesday, 2 April. Before that the Democratic Labor Party, of course, was aware of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> position. </para>

Yet, all this nonsense is spoken that some time on the Tuesday after the announcement was made the Government or the Ministers or myself were at some fault. After the matters were revealed Opposition members still stand here and contend that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> is a senator right now. The Government says that the proper course is that the judicial authority which has been established to deal with such matters should determine them. This was contemplated by this Parliament in section 203 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. We had the discussion on whether the power of the Senate was exhausted. We had cited to the Senate an eminent legal authority who considered that the power of the Senate was exhausted. Whether that be so or not, it is quite clear that the matter of such a vacancy involves considerations of law which have been dealt with at length in the opinions of the Solicitor-General and of Professor Howard, the general Counsel to the Attorney-General. These opinions which have been put before the Senate are that if legal questions are disputed they should be determined by a judicial authority. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> when he was Attorney-General, said that it was mischievous for such questions to be determined in the Senate. Last time I spoke in this debate I quoted the honourable senator in full to the effect that it was quite wrong that such a question should be decided on Party political lines in this chamber. As far as I know he has not spoken in this debate. He has been significantly silent. </para>

              <para>-That is right. No doubt he will cross the floor and vote because this will be a vote on Party political lines. He will vote for a proposition that this matter be not referred to the High Court of Australia. We heard what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said. I know he said some rather uncomplimentary thing about public servants, but he did not stop at that. He said that if this matter were sent to the High Court it would simply sweep it under the carpet. </para>

              <para>- I think he is a gentle kind of person. Perhaps he does not mean all that he says about these people. But he did say some rather extraordinary things about the High Court of Australia. One would think that the High Court sitting as a court of disputed returns, with the most distinguished gentlemen on it, was some kind of a trumped up body, notwithstanding that most of the appointments were made by the honourable senator&#39;s own administration or its predecessors. Therefore we have the spectacle of the Opposition saying: &#39;Look, something is clear. No one could possibly find otherwise. No one could possibly accept what the Government is putting forward and what the Government says here. &#39; Let us send the case to the High Court of Australia and get its decision. The Opposition is not prepared to have the legal position, which the Government puts forward as its view, determined by the High Court. Instead the Opposition says: &#39;Let us have a Party political vote. Let us determine this issue here so that it can be done on Party political lines, so that those honourable senators who are about to depart from this place will be able to act as justices and determine these great legal issues before they are rejected by the people of Australia when a double dissolution occurs within a few days. &#39; That does not seem to be altogether in accordance with the rule of law. The Australian Labor Party believes in the rule of law. Here is a question which certainly ought to go to the High Court. </para>

          <para>If we assume for the moment, against what was put by the eminent legal authority, that the Senate does retain some residual power to determine legal questions, surely it is not a question such as this. This is a tangled legal question in respect of which the only legal opinions produced to the Senate have been those of distinguished authorities cited by honourable senators on the Government side. These opinions support the Government view. They indicate that a vacancy had occurred prior to the Queensland action and that certain consequences flow from that. The Opposition prefers to use numbers instead of having a determination by the highest body of law. It will not have those numbers for very long. The vacation by the former honourable senator- whether he resigned or forfeited his seat; however it came about- was prior to the issue of the writs and there should be an election for 6 honourable senators in </para>
          <para class="block">Queensland. That simply means an election by the people. The Queensland Government is endeavouring to bring about a position where appointment would be made by the Government. The people will be deprived of a vote in the election. For our Government here to contend that there should be a vote by the people is somehow considered irregular and improper. It is suggested that the people should not be entitled to have a vote. The constitutional consequence is that if the seat were vacated before the election in Queensland there should be. a vote of the people to fill that position. </para>
          <para>The Opposition complains and says that there has been some endeavour to alter the balance here. If that were the consequence and it would help to deprive the Opposition of its majority, that might be viewed with favour by a great number of people. We have the situation in this chamber where this year there have been 36 divisions and the Government has been defeated 35 times. This Senate does not reflect the popular vote. If we have a double dissolution, what will occur? The Senate may well end up in a deadlock. Suppose the unlikely were to happen and a non-Labor Government were elected in the House of Representatives, could that Government expect supply from the Senate in these circumstances? What the Opposition has been doing over the past 18 months and especially over the past few months is to produce an era of unstable government. I said last week that the actions of the Opposition were calculated to undermine the system of Government- not merely to undermine the Government. That is what the Opposition is endeavouring to do. It has set about on a course to undermine the system of government. Here is an illustration of what happens. After the  President  put down his statement the Government came in with a straightforward, logical and appropriate motion to refer the question to the High Court of Australia sitting as the court of disputed returns in order to determine the question. Now, what happens? An amendment is moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> What does it say? It states: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(i)">
              <para>that, at the time that the  President  made his statement on 3 April 1974, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> had not resigned his place in the terms of section 19 of the Constitution and he was therefore, at the time of the statement, a senator for Queensland and accordingly, at the time of the statement, the Senate was entitled to regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> as a senator for Queensland. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">Have you ever read such a nonsequitur in your life- because he had not resigned he was a senator? The Leader of the Opposition well knows that in the Constitution- this is the very point at issue- there is another provision by which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> could vacate his office in a number of circumstances. We have pointed to two of them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has the impudence to put in his amendment a statement that because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> had not resigned he was still a senator. If the amendment said &#39;because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> had not resigned and he had not otherwise vacated his office&#39; one could understand it. The amendment continues: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman">
            <item label="(ii)">
              <para>that there is abundant evidence that the Prime Minister and his responsible Ministers knew and intended that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> would cease to be a senator by resigning his seat in the Senate in terms of section 19 of the Constitution . . . </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">I have dealt with this matter. What is the position? Whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> said that he would resign, whether somebody stopped him as a result of the prawn night or whatever it was, the Senate knows that he did not resign.

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline>said that this is a terrible thing. What nonsense. After the Queensland Government took the steps that it did, this Government&#39;s proper duty was to ascertain the precise legal position. It has ascertained that, obtained legal advice and put the opinions before the Senate. This amendment is nonsense. The Opposition is not dealing straightforwardly with a Government motion which seeks to refer the question and get a determination by the High Court of Australia. </para>
          <para>A lot of things have been said about the role of the Senate and about what is right and proper. Honourable senators opposite have said an awful lot. I suppose we have read in the newspapers and heard in this chamber so much nonsense and so many misstatements that one could go through all of them and correct the amount of rubbish which has been said, and I do not propose to do so except to say that it is there and almost every page on which the Opposition spoke is full of it. The Opposition talks about upholding the Senate and upholding the proprieties. It is about to use numbers to reject a motion to have a proper legal determination by the highest judicial authouity. The Opposition purports to determine a question of the rights of a person and the rights of a chamber by the brutal use of numbers. This is what the Opposition has been doing all year. This is why the Opposition has brought us to this situation. This is why the Opposition will be rejected by the people. I am happy to say that a considerable number of senators opposite will not be here after the double dissolution to carry on their pernicious practices. </para>

        <para class="block">This Bill now before the Senate is an interim measure to provide for 2 members for the Australian Capital Territory in the event of a general election for this House before the Distribution Committee for the Australian Capital Territory has completed its task. This Parliament has already enacted legislation supported by the Opposition to give the Australian Capital Territory 2 members from the next House of Representatives election. The appropriate procedures for the division of the Australian Capital Territory into 2 areas have been in train for some time but, because of the unprecedented threat made by the Opposition to deny Supply to a popularly elected Government, it may be necessary to hold a general election for this House before the Committee has completed its task. If a general election for this House is held without the passage of the interim measure proposed by this Bill, the people of the nation&#39;s capital will be denied any form of democratic representation. </para>
        <para>The Australian Capital Territory is one of the fastest growing centres of population in the country but it has traditionally been one of the most under-represented areas in our polity. By definition, the people of the Territory have no state parliament and, by the refusal of previous Liberal-Country Party governments, the people have no effective local government either. The Government has sought to provide representation for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory in the Senate but these just measures have twice been rejected by the Opposition in the Senate. It is the intention of this Government to ensure that the people of the Australian Capital Territory are not also denied their rightful representation in the House of Representatives. </para>
        <para>In 1 948, the Chifley Labour Government first provided for the people of the Australian Capital Territory to be represented in the House of Representatives. Since the population of the Territory was then small, the member so chosen was not granted full voting rights at that time. However, the rapid growth of the city of Canberra has led to the Australian Capital Territory electorate having a larger enrolment than any other federal division. For most of the period since 1948, the people of Canberra were very ably represented by the late Jim Fraser and, as a result of his agitation, the member for the Australian Capital Territory was given full voting rights in the House of Representatives as from 1967. Last year, the present Government sought to provide for the return of 2 members from the Australian Capital Territory. The current enrolment in the Territory is of the order of 100,000 electors and Parliament recognised that the time had come to adjust the number of members accordingly. It is only right that the people of the nation&#39;s capital should be represented as adequately as are people in the various States. </para>
        <para>The Distribution Committee appointed by the Governor-General on 18 December 1973 has released its proposed division of the Territory but must wait for a statutory period of 30 days to elapse for the receipt of suggestions or objections. This period concludes on 18 April 1974 and the Committee can proceed no further until that date. The Government therefore proposes, as an interin measure, to adopt the Committee&#39;s original proposals for the division of the Territory. It is worthy of note that no objections to these proposals have been received by the Committee, according to the <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman, Mr Ley.</inline></para>
        <para>The Committee has proposed a remarkably simple and logical basis for the division, namely, that the Territory should be split in two by the path of the Molonglo River and by Lake Burley Griffin. This is in agreement with the suggestions put forward by all of the major political parties. What a remarkable achievement to have the Liberal Party, the Country Party and the Australian Labor Party in complete agreement on redistribution. Is this another first in the history of our Parliament? This yields 2 divisions which differ in enrolment by less than 1,000 electors. Further, population projections by the National Capital Development Commission show that the 2 electorates will remain almost equal in population until 1980 and beyond. Thus, we will have achieved a most equitable distribution. </para>
        <para>The proposed boundary is the most natural geographical basis for the division and will produce almost no confusion on the part of the people of Canberra as to the division to which they belong. Rather than deprive the people of the Territory of any democratic representation whatsoever in the next Parliament, the Government is by this Bill seeking to adopt the Committee&#39;s original proposals as the basis for returning 2 members for the Territory should this be necessary. </para>
        <para>As I stressed earlier, the present Bill is purely an interim measure without which the people of the Australian Capital Territory would be denied any representation in the next Parliament. I believe that no senator could, in all conscience, vote against such a fair and just proposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">By this Bill Parliament is again being asked to create the Petroleum and Minerals Authority. The functions of the Petroleum and Minerals Authority will be to explore for and develop our petroleum and mineral resources and to assist in implementing the Government&#39;s policy of promoting Australia ownership and control of our natural resources and resource industries. The Bill was first introduced into the House of Representatives on 4 December 1973 and into the Senate on 13 December 1973. The Senate refused to read the Bill a second time on 2 April 1974. </para>
          <para>This is a measure to which the Government attaches the greatest importance. The Government&#39;s policy in relation to this matter was completely vindicated by the events late last year prior to the introduction of the Bill into the House of Representatives on 4 December 1973. Events since that announcement have strengthened the arguments for the creation of the Petroleum and Minerals Authority. There is additional evidence too in the proposed actions of other governments. Since the preparation of our legislation the United Kingdom Government has announced proposals for the establishment of a Government authority and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Trudeau,</inline> the Canadian Prime Minister, is planning to introduce legislation shortly to create a national petroleum corporation whose objectives are remarkably similar to those in relation to petroleum proposed for the Petroleum and Minerals Authority. </para>
          <para>It is through the Petroleum and Minerals Authority that the Government plans to recycle the savings from the withdrawal of the section 77 taxation concessions and the cessation of the petroleum search subsidy scheme. We plan to use these funds initially to promote the search for petroleum under arrangements to be determined. In addition, and of no less importance, they will be available to further our policy of ensuring that future on-shore mining development is at least predominantly Australian owned and controlled. We will consider assistance to the many small companies and syndicates which have used up their capital on exploration and have discovered worthwhile mineralisations so attractive that, in default of obtaining internal Australian capital, they fall into the hands of foreign companies before they have a chance of getting off the ground as Australian concerns. </para>
          <para>The Government&#39;s action in introducing this Bill today is evidence of the great urgency which it attaches to this proposal and to the tasks for which the Petroleum and Minerals Authority is being created. The Federal Liberal Party&#39;s proposed new policy statement, as publicised recently in the Press, after emphasising that Australian ownership is &#39;preferable&#39; states that where this is not possible, carefully monitored participation by overseas interests or by Government is acceptable in the nation&#39;s best interest&#39;. Equal government participation is precisely the objective of this measure.. In the case of off-shore petroleum exploration it will be in partnership with competent and experienced petroleum search companies, who will be providing the major risk capital and equipment. In respect of on-shore exploration, government participation will take the form of either equity acquisition, loan, partnership or guarantee. All these projects will be financed by the recycling of the $50m to $60m hitherto paid to undeserving companies without in most cases an effective return and certainly without any interest accruing to the Australian people. </para>
          <para>The Government has a mandate for this proposal, the nation a need; and the measure of our sincerity is the existence in this country today of government corporations co-operating with and competing effectively with private enterprise. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">For several years the belief has grown amongst Australian people that Australia was being sold out too cheaply to foreign interests. This belief has become a conviction and even the LiberalCountry Party governments, which had permitted and encouraged it, finally were compelled to restrict foreign takeovers and establish the Australian Industry Development Corporation. But the AIDC was established with one hand tied behind its back and with restrictions upon its own independent action. It could do few of the things which could be done by its foreign competitors or even by its Australian competitors for funds. So much was this true that the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Ownership and Control concluded in October 1972 as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Committee is of the opinion that the Australian Resources Development Bank and the Australian Industry Development Corporation are both performing important tasks. However, at this stage of their development, due to courses beyond their control, their role is far too insignificant to be considered a major force in the capital market. The Committee recommends that the activities of both these two bodies be expanded further. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It seemed beyond doubt that when the Australian Labor Party Government on 30 August 1973, introduced Bills to expand the activities of the AIDC the Opposition in the House and in the Senate would give them serious consideration. The Minister for Overseas Trade <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr J. F. Cairns)</inline> left plenty of time for that to be done. The Bills introduced on 30 August were not called on for debate until 16 October- 47 days later. But what was the attitude of the Opposition in the House of Representatives? When introducing this Bill in the other place the Minister for Overseas Trade said that the official spokesman, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> said as recorded on page 2 166 of Hansard </para>

            <para class="block">I oppose this Bill in its entirety for reasons I will explain. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It was not only opposition to some part of the 2 Bills, but also it was rejection of them- rejection in entirety. The Opposition was not only unconcerned that its own Senate Select Committee had concluded after inquiry that the AIDC and the Australian Resources Development Bank were far too insignificant to be considered a major force in the capital market and recommended that the &#39;activities of both these two bodies be expanded further&#39;, but also unconcerned too that the majority of the Australian people were appalled at the sell-out of Australia and wanted something to be done. </para>
          <para>Both Bills- the Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill and the National Investment Fund Bill- passed the House of Representatives on 17 and 18 October respectively and were so certified by the  Clerk  as ready for presentation to the Senate. On 23 October both Bills were presented to the Senate. It was then that tactics, which now appear to be little more than delaying and obstructing, began. It was not until 28 November, nearly 5 weeks later, that the Senate found itself able to make a decision about the 2 Bills. Its Select Committee had found a year earlier that the AIDC and the Australian Resources Development Bank were too insignificant to perform a major task and should be expanded and yet the Senate took 5 weeks even to begin to consider Bills which had that purpose. </para>
          <para>Having found time to consider the Bills, the Senate decided not to pass them, wholly or in part, but referred them to the same Select Committee for inquiry and report, not at some indefinite future date, but &#39;as soon as possible&#39; and not later than 12 March. But &#39;as soon as possible&#39; did not mean much, and 12 March has come and gone. It is already 25 days since 12 March, the date fixed by the Senate itself as the date beyond which the Committee should not go, and there is no report from the Committee and no action by the Senate. On 7 March 1974 the House of Representatives adopted a resolution requesting the Senate to resume consideration of the 2 Bills but there was no response from the Senate. It seems now to be clear beyond doubt- the Opposition in the House of Representatives has rejected the Australian Industrial Development Corporation and National Investment Fund Bills, and the Senate has obstructed and hindered their passage until it has now become equally clear that the Senate has failed to pass the Australian Industrial Development Corporation and National Investment Fund Bills. </para>
          <para>The Opposition in the House of Representatives has already stated its position clearly and, quoting the Minister, perhaps even arrogantly. It rejects the Australian Industry Development Corporation and National Investment Fund Bills in their entirety. The Minister for Overseas Trade said that there is therefore no particular reason then why we should waste time on the matter here, meaning the House of Representatives. These Bills are being submitted to the House now so that they may be sent to the Senate without humbug or delay. The Government wants to know where the Senate stands. Does it want to stand against the Government, against the will of the Australian people clearly expressed in December 1972, or will it consent to give effect to the will of the people? </para>
          <para>There are few matters upon which the will of the people is more clear than it is about the AIDC. The Australian people want something to be done to stop the sell-out of Australia. They want the AIDC to be strengthened to become a significant force in the capital market to help retain Australian ownership and control. The AIDC will become a co-ordinator of enterprise in the ownership and development of Australia by </para>
          <para class="block">Australians within the normal free enterprise system, and it will receive the ready co-operation of Australian business enterprise. Much time has been taken up in this parliament and out of it in misrepresenting the Government&#39;s plans for the AIDC and the NIF. The AIDC and the NIF are to perform a positive constructive role in the Australian business economy, not as an alternative to it. </para>
          <para>Up to now, Australian resources have often been sold out at low prices to suit the multinational corporations which make their profit elsewhere. Up to now, investment in Australian resources has often been limited to those who will invest and at the same time acquire and dispose of a share of the output and will be allowed to invest only if they do so. This take and pay principle excludes investors who seek to invest for normal profit return. In this system investment may not take place at all unless the investor contracts to take over a share of the output. This is not a free enterprise system of investment, and there can be no wonder we are unable to get enough money to remove the undercapacity which leaves Australia today so short of many basic resources. There can be no wonder that we are short of capital to increase capacity and short of Australian capital to ensure the operation remains Australian. It is in the promotion and co-ordination of investment of a free enterprise kind that AIDC will find most of its work and its service to the Australian people in the future. Equally the role of the National Investment Fund is a free enterprise role. No more than 15 per cent of all wage and salary earners now invest in shares and between them hold no more than 3 per cent of the value of all shares. The purpose of the NIF is to provide for the ordinary Australian a readily available chance to invest his savings into the ownership and development of Australia. The average Australian will respond to this chance and by doing so there will follow an increase in the total amount of savings invested in Australia. </para>
          <para>Not only the House of Representatives and the Government of Australia but the people of Australia want AIDC and the NIF to become the law of this land. These 2 Bills will show where the Senate stands. The Government does not want any delay or equivocation here to protect the Senate from facing that responsibility. It wants these 2 Bills to pass here without delay or obstruction so that the Senate can stand up and be counted, not only on these 2 Bills but upon whom it considers should be the Government of Australia.

These proposals were dreamt up by 2 economists whom most people thought were medical practitioners. The proposals have been criticised and exposed as being a fraud and as being phoney operations.

              <para>-Last December. Well, they were defeated last year. The Government then admitted by its own statements that there must have been something wrong with legislation. I recall that only a month or so ago, was it not, the Minister for Social Security, if that is what he is termed nowadays, was sent overseas to look at other proposals. I think my facts are right in this regard. The Minister visited the Dominion of Canada to study its system. If the Government was so convinced that the propositions it brought forward last year were perfect, absolute, the greatest things ever dreamed up for the health of the people of Australia, why then, at the stage when the Bills had been defeated, did it have a second thought about them? The Government had a second thought about them for a very simple reason. It knew as a result of the debates, when the weaknesses of that legislation were exposed in this place, that if Australia wished to have any sort of health scheme the one it proposed, and the one now again proposed, was so inadequate in its concepts and in its attempts to be a health scheme that it had to come up with some other idea. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>While the Government has grandstanded about this so-called health proposal, what does it come up with? As I understand the situation it has come up with one of the Bills that was passed last year which, I think, related to a Health Insurance Commission. I think I am correct in that regard. These 2 Bills, I understand, are part of a scheme which comprises at least another 2 Bills which are yet to come and which have not yet even seen the light of day. So the Government&#39;s great and grandiose health scheme, which it was presenting as a total health scheme, is being dribbled into Parliament in bits and pieces- a health Bill this year, a health Bill next year and a health Bill at some other time. How can the Government expect the Parliament to make a judgment when it keeps dribbling in, in bits and pieces, what it claims to be a total scheme? </para>
          <para>They are the reasons, outlined last year, why it was felt that we on this side could not accept these proposals. It is now April. We know that, if the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> can only get up enough courage, with luck the people will have a double dissolution and there will be an election on 18 May. Out will go this Government and there will be a Liberal-Country Party majority in both Houses. The Government is now going window-shopping. I love a cartoon I saw today. There was a bloke streaking past the defence area and 2 proper well-known streakers complained that it was unfair that the Minister for Defence was taking their credit away from them. So we are to have a series of these propositions. The Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill was just introduced and the Government spokesman complained about what has happened in the Senate when in fact the Government only a month or two ago, referred that Bill to a select committee. So what are we talking about? We really are not talking about a health Bill this evening, nor will we be doing so tomorrow when we come back to it. What we are talking about is nothing but a piece of Government propaganda which is being produced in both Houses of the Parliament for electioneering propaganda purposes. These Bills have been produced for that reason and no other. </para>
          <para>How then could one expect the Parliament to consider these Bills as a health proposal? We have complained over the Gair affair that this cynical, corrupt Government has no interest in the Parliament. These proposals before us at the moment expose the cynicism of this Government and the lengths to which it will go to manipulate the parliamentary procedures for mere cheap political advantage. </para>
