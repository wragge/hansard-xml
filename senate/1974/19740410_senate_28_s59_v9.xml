          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DEVITT</inline>( Tasmania )-The first notice of motion relates to an ordinance which prohibits pyramid selling in the Australian Capital Territory. Section 8 provides that where a corporation is convicted of an offence against the ordinance, each director of the corporation shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and liable to conviction and punishment unless he proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge or that he took all reasonable steps to prevent it. The Committee has objected to this type of provision in the past, and has caused it to be amended in other ordinances. It is regarded as objectionable because it reverses the onus of proof and places an unreasonable burden upon the defendant in the matters which he is required to prove, and thereby trespasses unduly upon personal rights and liberties. </para>
          <para>The second notice of motion relates to an ordinance which prohibits the removal of seaweed from the waters of the Jervis Bay Territory. The ordinance makes it an offence to be in possession of seaweed in the Territory and provides a penalty of $2,000. It is a defence to a prosecution for such offence that the defendant proves that the seaweed was obtained from waters outside the Territory. The Committee considers that what amounts to reversal of the onus of proof and an extremely heavy penalty for such an offence makes the ordinance unduly oppressive and an undue trespass upon personal rights and liberties. </para>
          <para>I have given these notices of motion so that, should the Senate be dissolved, the Committee will have a clear 1 5 sitting days in the new Parliament to deal with the ordinances, in accordance with the Acts Interpretation Act. </para>

          <para class="block">According to the list circulated, the Senate is to rise at 5 p.m. this day for Easter and resume on Monday, 22 April, at 2 p.m. As no notice to the contrary has been given, may it be assumed that unless something intervenes, such as a double dissolution, the Senate will rise this day at 5 p.m.? If the Senate does rise at 5 p.m. and the Parliament is not totally dissolved, when does the leader of the Government expect the Senate to resume its sittings. </para>

            <para>- I have discussed the program with the leader of the Opposition and I think I can fairly say that given the co-operation of the Senate we will be able to dispose of, or should I say deal with in one way or another, the business which is before the Senate. It has to consider the Bills which I mentioned last night and which are numbered 1 to 5 on the notice paper. Other Bills which are to come before the Senate and which I do not think would be in question are the Flood Relief Bills and the Bill providing for the disbursement of surplus funds from the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund for public servants. Of course there are several Appropriation Bills. On what has been put to me by the Leader of the Opposition- and I do not wish to tie him down- the expected times for debate on these various Bills are short because the Senate has made up its mind on these various matters. </para>

May I say that I would not like to predict anything about the resumption because others need to be consulted and certain arrangements may need to be made in the event of various happenings. I would endeavour to inform the Senate as soon as I could.

            <para>-I cannot be sure of the precise application by the Australian Government to the Davis Cup teams. However, I can inform the honourable senator that I am aware, having looked into this matter closely a year or two ago, that there is a special resolution of the United Nations which expresses concern that lawn tennis competitions are one of the grave departures from the policy of the United Nations. The resolution calls for action by governments in respect of that aspect. I would apprehend that the Australian Government would be implementing its policy in accordance with the views of the United Nations. As the honourable senator may recall, this subject matter was touched on at the Teheran Conference on Human Rights and since. My understanding, and I am subject to correction, is that while any country practices apartheid the other nations of the world are expected to cut off cultural, sporting and social contacts with it in order to bring that country to its senses and have it desist from practising this awful crime against all mankind. </para>

Is it a fact that officers of the Parliament were consulted by the Minister's Department and that these officers assisted in the drafting of the advertisements which are designed to inform members of the public about the operations of the Parliament? Has the Minister seen the advertisement in this morning's 'Australian' newspaper which plagiarised the form of advertising of the structure and functions of the Parliament and purports to emphasise the role of the Australian Country Party in the Parliament?

As a result of my Department's inserting the advertisements in the newspapers, on a completely apolitical basis, my Department has been inundated with requests from a wide cross-section of the Australian community for copies of these advertisements. Before the advertisements were inserted, let alone prepared, we were accused by our political opponents of using public funds for political purposes. That accusation has now been well and truly laid at rest. But unfortunately the Country Party, by adopting this attitude in its advertising, is transferring this type of constructive and informative advertising into party political matter.

Will he take note that the Australian Labor Party in that upper House of fat succeeded in forcing the lower House, the elected House, to an election and that in that election the people overwhelmingly endorsed the action taken to deny supply in the upper House by giving the Labor Party an immense majority which enabled it to become the Government? </para>

The consequences of such action may be good or bad, and I assure the honourable senator that his Party will have to take the consequences for its actions. He knows and his followers, diminished as they are, also know their fate. It is well and truly written across their faces. They know that they will be obliterated in the coming election. </para>

            <para>-The question calls for some technical information. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> said that it is a question without notice, it should be asked on notice because obviously such a question cannot be answered off the cuff. It is too technical and too important for that. One would imagine from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott's</inline> question that the people we employed, and whom the previous Government employed- these specialists in the Department of the Navy whom honourable senators on both sides often compliment did not know what they were up to. The reply is as follows: The ship has bow thrusters capable of propelling it at about 5 knots. The power units on the 2 bow thrusters are large electric motors run from main generators and are similar to motors in the most highly specialised United States submarines. The single screw is driven by 2 gas turbine engines. If both engines failed or the shaft or screws were put out of action the bow thrusters would be used. The chances that these events would happen are very slight indeed. </para>

              <para>- These are not my views. The United States Navy conducted very extensive studies of battle damage to warships and found in very few cases where ships were sunk or damaged was there any advantage in ships having 2 screws instead of one. The technical information continues as follows: If battle damage were sufficient to destroy a single screw or shaft it is almost certain that the second screw or shaft in a twin screw ship would be put out of action.

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. Is the Minister aware that Queensland Druggists Ltd and Drug Houses of Australia Ltd have issued a circular advising that in future there will be a $5 opening fee plus taxi fares both ways when particular life saving drugs are required by chemists for seriously ill patients? Can the Minister inform the Parliament whether drug wholesalers have taken this matter to the Prices Justification Tribunal? Alternatively, is this a further example of profiteering as encouraged by the Leader of the Opposition in another place? Will such matters not be subject to price restraint until such time as this Government is given a new mandate? </para>

            <para>- In my capacity of Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, I tell the honourable senator that I have not seen the reports. I most certainly will refer his question to my colleague in another place, the Minister for Social Security, for his information and comment thereon. If the facts are as mentioned by the honourable senator that Queensland Druggists Ltd and Drug Houses of Australia Ltd intend to impose a $5 opening fee plus taxi fares for the provision of life saving drugs to seriously ill people and chemists when they are needed- surely such action must have a very bad effect on the living standards of a very large section of the Australian community which, because of the tactics adopted by the Opposition in this place, already has been deprived of a more efficient and more up to date national health scheme. Frankly, I find it incredible that large organisations such as those referred to by the honourable senator would adopt what I might call- if the facts are correct- such callous approach. I certainly shall raise the matter with my colleague and ascertain the position. Although I cannot say with certainty, as far as I am aware no such matter has been referred to the Prices Justification Tribunal. </para>

            <para>-Approximately 450 Aborigines reside within a 30-mile radius of the Mission, although the number varies dramatically because of Aborigines who pass through and stay for some time. As in other places, very few Aborigines there are on unemployment relief. In this area there are only sixteen. The area was prospected by Western Mining Corporation Ltd for copper and other mineral deposits. I understand that that company has left the area, which suggests that mining was not profitable. There was a small amount of Aboriginal copper mining in the area, but this has been abandoned now. I have no knowledge of any worthwhile gemstones in the area. I think the final question was: How many staff of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs are at the Mission? There is only one member of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs planning staff there. I do not have any information as to residences built for the staff, but I imagine that there would not be a great building boom to house the one staff member we have in the area. </para>

            <para>- I have seen the reports attributed to the Leader of the Opposition at his impromptu and unexpected Press conference on the steps of Parliament House yesterday. I assume that they are the ramblings to which the honourable senator is referring. In reply to my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner,</inline> it occurs to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden</inline> having been a former Federal Treasurer apparently believes that the way to deal with inflation and its effect is to reduce taxes and interest rates on the one hand and increase defence spending on the other and then hope that no one notices that social welfare spending has to be cut back. But certainly I think that the pensioners of Australia would notice that. Apparently the Leader of the Opposition in another place is complaining amongst other things that since this Government came into office some 17 months ago - </para>

The main difference between the previous bounty and the assistance now to be provided is that whereas previously the money was handed out on the basis of the bigger you are the more you get and the smaller you are the less you get, our scheme will be designed to help those dairy farmers who really need some help. </para>

How much would be lost by ex-servicemen and their dependants receiving repatriation pensions if expenditure on these pensions were to be cut in the way that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden</inline> 's so-called economic package would require? </para>

              <para>- I am just stating what I have seen. The transcript shows clearly that the reduced spending will occur more particularly in capital areas. That is the clear answer. Let me relate the question to what is happening today. If the Senate fails to pass the Appropriation Bills many people in Australia who are entitled to repatriation payments which have been approved by this Parliament will not receive those payments. </para>

            <para>-The question of ANZUS did not arise in the discussions on the request or suggestion by some scientists, when they were here recently, that a scientific base be established. A scientific body came from the USSR and had discussions with our scientific people. We intend to sign a pact with them on the whole question of co-operating in science. Arising out of that discussion, they repeated something that they had said in 1971, 1 think, in which they suggested that we might co-operate in looking at things in the sky and that type of thing. Following that, when we were seeking information, talks went on between the American Ambassador and my Department. The question of ANZUS did not come into the talks. It was a question of discussions at this level. It is very clear that if there is any military connotation in this matter it will be rejected by us. </para>

              <para>-Perhaps the problem is best illustrated by the position of the honourable senator who is interjecting. He is the leader of a party. Is it the National Alliance or the Country Party? He leads a party to which he does not belong in Western Australia. If these rag-tag and bobtail parties manage to come back in some kind of fashion they will be fighting among themselves in future, as they have been in the past in Opposition. </para>

He is endeavouring to make reflections upon the Prime Minister. One would think that if somebody wanted to express some criticism of the Prime Minister there ought to be ample opportunity for his colleagues in the other House to do it.

              <para>- I heard yesterday that the Prime Minister had made a statement in relation to my action in the context of the supposed resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair.</inline> I say 'supposed resignation' because it is embodied in the statement I made earlier to the Senate. I asked the Prime Minister whether he would let me have a look at what are known in the House of Representatives as his 'greens'. The Prime Minister was gracious enough to send me a copy of the transcript of what had transpired in the House of Representatives and his observations. I was surprised, I might add, that any ruling of a presiding officer should be canvassed in another place. As a result </para>
            </talk.start>
          <para class="block">I have this morning examined the Hansard of the House of Representatives, and I therefore feel it is proper that I should make some observations on this. </para>
          <para>My observations are these: My attention has been drawn to the Prime Minister's statement made yesterday in the House of Representatives. As honourable senators know, the position is that on 3 April 1 received from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> a letter, dated that day, relating to his appointment as Ambassador to the Republic of Ireland. I read that letter to the Senate. Later in the sitting on the same day, 3 April, I made a statement to the effect that I did not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair's</inline> letter was one of resignation on which I could have taken action to notify the vacancy to the Governor of Queensland. Rather did I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair's</inline> letter was a notification that the effect of his appointment as Ambassador to Ireland was to vacate his place as a senator by virtue of the disqualification provisions of sections 44 and 45 of the Constitution. If that was the position, 1 was in doubt as to the date upon which the vacancy occurred. In all the circumstances, I considered that it was a matter that should be determined by the Senate and accordingly I referred to the judgment of the Senate the question of whether a vacancy had happened and when. Those matters are unresolved. </para>
          <para>Because that is repetition of what I said on 3 April, I now go on to add- and I shall say no more than this-that in those circumstances the Prime Minister's statement, namely, that quite clearly I should have notified the Governor of Queensland of the vacancy caused by the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gair</inline> as Ambassador, cannot, I believe, be fairly sustained. </para>

            <para>- My question which is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate arises out of the observation on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> last night which I took to be an invitation to the Prime Minister to jump or to be pushed. I suppose this puts the honourable senator in the position of being the Leader of the Push. I ask the Leader of the Government: Did he get the impression that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> was hoping that the Government would take a course of action which would then provide an excuse for the Opposition to avoid voting against the granting of Supply and the odium and, of course, the impropriety of such an action? Will the Leader of the Government assure members of the Opposition that we have not the slightest intention of letting them off the hook, where they are now suspended, and that we will call their bluff and put them to the test - </para>

            <para>- I do not know exactly what the question refers to. There was a disturbance on Saturday evening at a place called Row Creek in the Northern Territory. As a result of that disturbance I have received a letter from the honourable member for the Northern Territory, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Calder.</inline> I have received a telegram from a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Don</inline> Burgess of the Killara Hotel-Motel. I have also received a telegram from Legislative Council members- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Greatorex,</inline> the member for Stuart, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kilgariff,</inline> the member for Alice Springs, asking that the matter be inquired into. Of course, the matter has been looked into. It appears that a group of young Aborigines from Papunya journeyed by bus to Row Creek, which is 1 1 miles from Alice Springs, to meet the elders of the Areyonga tribe. Either while waiting for such elders or as the result of a disputation between themselves and the bus driver, the bus driver refused to continue the journey any further, abandoned the passengers and went back to Alice Springs. The Aborigines were left at Row Creek. </para>

          <para>I am informed that during Saturday they arranged for a large amount of liquor to be brought from Alice Springs by taxi. At 6 p.m. on Saturday night the police were informed of the stoning of passing traffic. Two policemen who went to the scene attempted to pacify the group, but they themselves were stoned and returned to Alice Springs. The police returned with reinforcements and one policeman was hit by a stone. A <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mervyn</inline> Torres from Papunya, a member of the staff, arranged for trucks to pick up members of the group and take them to Victoria Downs Station where, I believe, they are still waiting for the elders to arrive. On Monday morning 7 Aborigines appeared in the Alice Springs police court. Six of them were charged with disorderly behaviour and one was charged with carrying a dangerous weapon. I want to say that this is in no way associated with any acts which people seek to describe as racial violence between one race and another. It was a reaction of a group of men who had too much to drink. The Northern Territory section of my Department has arranged for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Hunter, who has great experience and who is acceptable to the Aborigines, to undertake an in-depth study to see what, if anything, can be done to reduce any such incidents or prevent a recurrence of such incidents in the future. </para>

            <para>- Has the Minister representing the Treasurer seen the newspaper reports of 1 April which disclosed that borrowing by Australian companies of fixed interest capital was at record levels? Were those levels recorded as being $434.2m for the December 1973 quarter as against $ 1 53.6m for the same quarter of 1 972? In view of those figures, does the Government still persist with the view that the vicious increase in interest rates will deter borrowing and assist in controlling inflation or does the Minister consider that the Australian Democratic Labor Party is right and that higher interest rates encourage the lender, expand credit and aggravate inflation? </para>

              <para>-When this matter was proposed by the Government there was no suggestion of any alternative scheme, as far as I know. We were asked to consider whether or not we would re-introduce the free milk scheme. The Government, having given consideration to the matter and having made a detailed study of it in its search for evidence, was unable to find evidence of nutritional deficiency which would warrant the issue of a particular food to school children. In those circumstances, as I have already said, it is not proposed to consider the re-introduction of the free milk scheme. If the honourable senator wishes to propose an alternative scheme to us for our consideration, we will have a look at it. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to a public assertion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane,</inline> the General Secretary of the Australian Democratic Labor Party, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> concealed the fact for many days that an ambassador was sitting in the Senate and the Senate was deprived of valid representation from Queensland. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy:</inline> Is it not a fact that former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane,</inline> as Secretary of the Democratic Labor Party, that he had accepted the post of ambassador on Friday, 29 March, a week before the Senate resumed on 2 April and before the former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator came</inline> into the Senate? Why is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> afraid to tell the Senate the facts which I have outlined and which he knows to be the truth? </para>

            <para>-I am aware of the assertion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> on behalf of the Australian Democratic Labor Party in today's Press. It appears in an advertisement. It makes the statement that I claimed to have conspired in breaking the Constitution. That statement is a lie. It also states that I claimed to have concealed certain facts. I say- and everyone here would know- that statement is a he. Also, it was intimated to the Senate on 8 April- this weekthat <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> was told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> in the week before the Senate resumed. So before 2 April <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane,</inline> the Secretary of the Democratic Labor Party- and I suppose also a party to that Party's alliance with the Country Party- was aware of the facts. It is interesting that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> keeps out of this debate and has not been able to stand up and tell the truth to the chamber. </para>

All I can say is that this really is not a ministerial statement; it is another in the long list of items of window dressing for the election. This Government would not dare go into an election in Australia with the thought hanging over its head that it was considering a request from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to establish in Australia a base which would put the ANZUS pact at risk. We know that the Australian people will not be fooled by this last minute panic move, because they know that there has been one promise broken after another. This is the stance of the Government today; but the Australian people have no assurance whatever that there would not be a different stance if the present Government, by some great mischance, were returned to office. This statement is another in the long list of pieces of propaganda that we will see during this election campaign. </para><para>Yesterday a defence statement was made and it was exposed as a phoney operation. Today this statement has been made. Why was it suddenly made today? It is all part and parcel of the same operation. The Australian people ought to be grateful for honourable senators who sit on this side of the chamber with me and who have brought the Government to its senses so that it is starting to make the proper decisions, even if it is making them only for cheap electoral purposes. I welcome the statement because we on this side of the chamber always felt that this base ought not to be established. The matter never needed consideration. It did not even need to wait until June. I am only delighted that the threat of a double dissolution has brought the Government to its senses. </para>

            <para>- I notice from the ranks of Government supporters an indication that they claim that this decision is just an ordinary routine decision which had nothing to do with the coming election. I shall try to believe that, as in the same way I tried to believe, until I found that it was not true, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> had ceased to be a senator on 14 March. This Government has made statements of the most courageous nature in recent days. Its members have been beating their chests like Tarzan. They have said that they are the greatest. They have said that they are not frightened of any election and will play a straight bat against anybody. Then they resort to contemptible and hypocritical little subterfuges such as this. I think that the Russians are a bit unlucky. If there had not been an election, they would have had a good chance. But I am sure that they will watch the results of the elections most anxiously in the certainty that when the elections are out of the way <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> will be able to show towards them the kind of friendship which in South East Asia has earned him the title of the running dog of  Chairman  Mao. </para>

            <para>-The Australian Country Party adopts a view similar to that of the Liberal Party and the Democratic Labor Party in regard to this matter. We are pleased that the Government has decided to reject the offer of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to set up in Australia a photographic observation station. When the suggestion was made, and was made public here, there was no doubt in the minds of members of the Country Party that there should be an immediate rejection of such a proposal. The military consequences for Australia could be quite great. A judgment could have been made on this very promptly. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The point of concern to the Country Party is that the Australian Labor Party is willing to dally with the communists of this world. We heard a statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee)</inline> that it would need some assessment; that this was not a matter that could be concluded immediately. One can only imagine that the same consideration that has been given to this offer could be given to any similar offer made to the Australian Government by any other communist country. The public of Australia can recognise that under Labor firm consideration will be given to any request if a communist country wishes to set up some type of photographic observation station in Australia and that it will not meet with quick rejection by the Australian Labor Party. </para>
          <para>A point of concern as a result of the statement which the Government has made relates to another statement which I believe has fallen into absolute disrepute over the last few months. That is this Government's pronouncement and promise to the people of Australia that it would be an open government. We have seen an example of open government in the Gair affair in this Senate when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> and the Leader of the Government in this place, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> held close to their chests the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> and the Governor-General had apparently come to some agreement on 14 March this year. Open government! Certainly not for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy;</inline> certainly not for the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)-</inline> no question of advising the public. </para>

I hope that the Minister will be willing to table the advice of his Department so that it may be made public. Let him advise us of the thoughts of the Department of Foreign Affairs on this matter. I congratulate the Government on its belated decision on this matter. It demonstrates very clearly that it is quite willing to engage in dalliance with the communists in this world. </para>

            <para>- This is a statement which, because it is made virtually on the last day which this Parliament will be sitting, should not remain unnoticed. Its significance is enormous. It is one further example of the deception which this Government has practised on the people of Australia. It is only a week since the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee)</inline> stood in this chamber and said with all the feigned innocence and indignation that he could muster that this Government gave careful consideration to all sorts of proposals which were put to it and that this proposal from the Russians for a joint installation in Australia would be given careful consideration. I quote again what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> said in answer to the first question asked in this House on 2 April. The question was asked by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers),</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> concluded by saying: </para>

          <para class="block">What has happened in the intervening week? We are about to have an election and this Government is about to face its masters- and it is about to learn that the people of Australia want to belong to the free world and want to honour our alliance with the United States and those ideals, practices and objectives which we have in common with the people of the United States. We do not want to become part of either the Third World or the communist world. If the Labor </para>
          <para class="block">Party ideologues believe that by having power in this country they can masquerade as a reasonable type of government and still take us into the communist orbit, they will learn that they have been mistaken. This last incident was one of the chain of incidents which has occurred from the time the Labor Government took office, from the time there was recognition of the Russian and Chinese supported government of North Vietnam, from the time at which 3 Ministers criticised the United States Government and its President and therefore clearly aligned this Government with an attitude which was anti American. We have had a constant series of incidents ranging from the recognition of East Germany to the support, under the guise that it was an even-handed stance, of certain activities in the Middle East, all of which if taken in isolation could be justified on objective grounds but when taken together represent a certain attitude. In the last 2 months we have seen, as it would appear, an out of hand rejection of the American proposal to maintain a base in the Indian Ocean which is surely designed to protect America's strategic position and which would be of benefit to Australia also. </para>

              <para>-That is the first of the 2 incidents. The second incident was this proposal by Russian scientists that there should be a joint installation in Australia. If one is to accept what was rumoured in the newspapers, or leaked to the newspapers, if we had gone ahead with this it would have meant the end of the ANZUS treaty and an end to the alliance with the United States as we have always known it. On the basis of that we ask: Why was the Government not prepared to reject the Russian proposal out of hand? We are not given any answer which would indicate that there was an a priori basis upon which this Government was proceeding to act. What has happened in the course of the week? We now find, fortunately, that the Government is not proceeding any further with the venture. But the reason is not that there is any belief or commitment along the lines that the Minister has now stated. The reason, quite basically, is that there is to be an election. It is another of the gimmicks a straightening out of the position- to put the best possible impression upon the Labor Government's stance. All I say is that the people of Australia will not be deceived. This Government has shown its hand in so many instances that the deceptions it has practised will be brought home indelibly to it in the next few weeks. </para>

            <para>- It is very difficult when one is dealing with people suffering from paranoia. As I understand it, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> says that I should have rejected this out of hand but that I have examined it too quickly, that somehow or other I have examined it too quickly but that I should have done it without any consideration at all. I have brought this statement in here because I always take the angle that while Parliament is sitting I should report to Parliament first, if it is at all possible. If I had wanted to play a political stunt, as I am accused by these paranoid people, I would have kept this for the next 48 hours until Parliament got up and then issued it on Easter Sunday night or at some such time or used it at the time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>What did I say about this thing from the very start? Firstly,, an article appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald. Then, when I was at a Cabinet meeting in Melbourne on Monday last, I was approached by, I think, representatives of the entire media to appear on TV and radio and to give Press interviews. I said that this matter would be examined. I will not have the Press of Australia make up my mind for me or demand answers off the cuff from me. Neither will I say to a friendly power, much as our paranoid friends opposite may hate it because it has a communist government with which they and we have had friendly relations, that I reject something out of hand before I have had a look at it. The honourable senator is complaining that we did not look at it. We have had a week to look at it. The instruction to my Department was that I wanted some sort of report within a week and, if that was not sufficient time, that it was to go back and examine it further. However, we were able to examine it within one week. This Government cannot understand the attitude of the Opposition. It is like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood's</inline> attitude to the Croats. He let that situation go on for years without doing anything about it. He knew perfectly well that there were bombs exploding in the street. But that was all right. He took the attitude; let us wait to do something about it. What the Opposition does not like about this Government is that it acts. It does something about it. Involved in the examination of this matter were people who know something about science, people trained in defence and in foreign affairs. When that sort of ability is applied to the problem one can get a lot done within a week. At the end of that week the Government in the Parliament announced that it was advising that country and this Parliament that our decision was not to do anything about it. </para>
          <para>The Opposition then says that it was a short examination, 'you should go on with it because of the election'. This shows the complete paranoia of the Opposition. As I said the other night, the Opposition takes this cold war angle: If there is a country which is left wing, socialist or communist we must have nothing to do with it; we must treat it as a pariah. It suggests that we should draw a line and say that we Australians on this side are pure and on the side of the angels, and everybody on the other side is completely bad. </para>

              <para>-I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> is a defender of Rhodesia and South Africa. I know of his cold war attitudes. All he wants to do is bomb out of the world countries with whose policies he does not agree. Let him go ahead. He should have mounting arms and nuclear power. The Opposition asks us to reject this out of hand and then criticises us when we examine it for only a week. It says: 'That is not long enough ', but how does it know? When the 2 super powers of the world today, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America, combine in space research I suppose honourable members opposite would say, if they were sitting in Congress, that  President  Nixon would be a communist as also would <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kissinger</inline> and everybody else there; therefore, they are not even to be talked about. What the Opposition grabbed at today was a time-wasting procedure. It does not know what it is about. All it wanted to do was jump on this matter in a state of paranoia. Look at these great parties of principle. The Democratic Labor Party was formed by people who left the Australian Labor Party because of great principle. They were to stand out on their own. Where do we find them now? Firstly, co-operating with the Australian Country Party and then running around, hat in hand, pleading with the Liberal Party: 'Save us from destruction'. Where are their principles now? </para>

Bennett, Professor of Physics (Electronic Computing), Sydney University; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> D. Traill,  Chairman,  Computer Committee, Law Council of Australia; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr T.</inline> P. Purcell, Executive Director, the Law Foundation of New South Wales; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr F.</inline> J. Mahony,  Deputy  Secretary, Attorney-General's Department: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr B.</inline> C.

Carnsew, Director, Automatic Data Processing, Attorney-General's Department. </para>
          <para>The terms of reference of the Committee required it to report on the logistics, time-scale and finance necessary for the computerisation of legal data, especially in relation to the statute law of the Australian Parliament. </para>
          <para>The use of computers has enabled great advances to be made in the storage and retrieval of many kinds of data. In establishing this Committee I was confident that computers could be made to play an important role in the implementation of the Government's policy of steam lining legal processes and of making the law more readily available. </para>
          <para>If our legal system is to be effective and respected it is essential that the legal information upon which the system depends should be readily available. Access to this information should be quick, accurate and comprehensive. </para>
          <para>The Committee on Computerisation of Legal Data was particularly well qualified to conduct this important task. </para>
          <para>The Committee conducted a full inquiry into the existing and proposed use of computers for legal purposes, both in Australia and overseas. In the light of this inquiry the Committee has proposed the establishment of a computer-based system for the storage and retrieval of legal information. </para>
          <para>As a first step the Committee has proposed the establishment of an interim system in the Attorney-General's Department in Canberra. This interim system is to be designed so as to be capable of extension to a full system, available to all interested persons throughout Australia, embracing all Australian (including State) primary legal materials, both legislation and case law and legal literature. </para>
          <para>The Government has the report under consideration. </para>

        <quote>
          <para>This report on import prices (report No. 2 ), which has <inline font-style="italic">just</inline> been tabled, is the fifth report presented to the Parliament by the Joint Committee on Prices. It covers the commodities of tea, jute, unmanufactured tobacco, fish, textiles and flat glass. </para>
          <para>The Committee has found that for imports of tea and jute landed costs of imports have responded to the up valuations and the consumer has benefited. Tea prices are less by Se a lb as a result. Although there have been benefits for unmanufactured tobacco, these have been considered by that industry's leaders to be insufficient to allow a reduction in the price of cigarettes. However, the benefits may have assisted the manufacturers in restraining price increases to date and hopefully should do so in the future. </para>
          <para>Imports of fish and textiles are similar to a host of other products in as much as they constitute clear examples of how and from where inflation is being imported into Australia. In these cases the Committee finds that world shortages have pushed up prices but that up valuation has lessened these price increases. </para>
          <para>Flat glass is in a different category. Here the benefits of up valuation have accrued to overseas suppliers because they have quoted prices in and received payment in Australian dollars. Currency changes, therefore, have had no effect. The </para>
          <para class="block">Committee traces this to the pervasive effect of restrictive agreements that have eliminated price competition between the local and imported products. </para>
          <para>These agreements have been terminated. But there is the much broader principle that applies not only to flat glass but also to all products protected by the tarin". Furthermore, there is the distinct possibility that the continuation of loyalty' rebates could have the same effect of restricting imports as that of the abandoned agreements. Agreements such as those that existed in this industry and exist in others or practices such as loyalty rebates which still exist in the flat glass industry could restrict imports and thereby usurp the policy function of the Australian Government which has the Industries Assistance Commission to advise it. </para>
          <para>There is no doubt, therefore, that these agreements and practices should be prohibited by legislation. The Trade Practices Act 1972 does not do this. The Commissioner of Trade Practices himself acknowledged this. </para>
          <para>The Committee has therefore recommended that the Parliament should approve restrictive trade practices legislation that prohibits industry agreements and practices which restrict the amount of goods imported into Australia because this is the sole prerogative of the Australian Government and the Parliament. </para>
          <para>I inform the Senate that this is the third report in which the Committee has commented on restrictive practices, lt did so in its first Import Prices Report (timber), in the Meat meal Prices Report and now in this one. In this connection I take pride in informing the Senate that the Committee is the first arm of the Legislature that has asked the Commissioner of Trade Practices, who incidentally has issued 6 Annual Reports on his operations, to give evidence to it on the effectiveness of the existing legislation. Of course this evidence was limited to the restrictive agreements in the flat glass industry. The Commissioner's evidence is at Appendix II of this report and the Committee recommends that the Parliament should take note of this evidence when deliberating on trade practices legislation. </para>
          <para>A dissent has been made from the recommendation that there should be new improved trade practices legislation on the grounds that imports of flat glass do not require the implementation of restrictive trade practices legislation and that the Commissioner of Trade Practices believes that there was not the practical effect in the flat glass agreements. I leave it to honourable senators to read the report carefully, particularly the appendix containing the Commissioner's evidence, in order to ascertain whether or not there is a meaning for or a justification of this point of view. </para>
          <para>I commend the report to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- The Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill 1973 first came into the Senate on 13 December last after having been passed in the House of Representatives against the wishes of the Opposition on the previous day. The Government sought a quick decision in respect of this legislation when it first came into this chamber and on that occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> spoke to the measure. He deplored the haste with which this Bill has been brought in and he forcibly condemned the general concept of the Bill. On the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> the debate was adjourned. It came before the Senate again and was debated at length on 19 March. On 2 April it was rejected by the Senate. That is the history of this Bill. As I have said, it has been very widely debated and has been decisively defeated in this place. The Government has no mandate for these measures. It never mentioned them prior to the election. The measures constitute the most authoritarian and dictatorial demand for power, in an area of fundamental interest to the States and the well-being of the nation that I have ever noted. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Bill aims to set up a Petroleum and Minerals Authority to take control from the States, where authority now resides, and transfer it to the central government. It is centralisation in a most undesirable form. Of course, it is quite in keeping with this Government's mania for concentrating all power in Canberra. Further, it would lead to the transferring of all ownership from private investment and private enterprise to public ownership. This is absolutely in keeping with the avowed intention of socialisation of industry. It is anathema to the Liberal Party and contrary to the fundamental attitudes of that Party and to my own view as to where the interests of the whole community and the economy lie. </para>
          <para>Before the election in December 1972 very little was said by the Labor Party about the plank of its platform providing for it to pursue a policy of nationalisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange. My word, that policy was slumbering in the background at the time, but it has been acted upon in a very real way in the last year. But I think that of all the legislation that has been brought before this place for moves into an area of public ownership by the central government this legislation pretty well takes the bun. The Government well knows that we will not accept this legislation. It is in pursuance of its desire to have the country believe that the Senate has been irresponsible in its reviewing of legislation and that it has been frustrating the House of Representatives where the Government has power. In actual fact the Senate has proven to be a most responsible chamber right from the time the present Government came to power. </para>
          <para>We hear a lot of talk about the number of Bills which have been rejected by this place. There has been much exaggeration. The facts are that in 1 973 no fewer than 223 Bills were passed as at the end of the year out of a total of 256 Bills introduced into the Parliament. It has been claimed that this was the greatest number of Bills introduced to a Parliament in any given year. One can say that since the end of last year the Bills which have been rejected have been only repetitions of Bills brought forward previously, and to have only 10 Bills rejected does not constitute frustration. The Opposition would not be worthy of its place as Her Majesty's Opposition were it not to have taken steps which it has taken in respect of legislation for which there was no direct mandate given and no mention made before the election of intention and so on. I believe that this place has shown an extraordinary degree of patience and tolerance in its reviewing role of legislation introduced by the Government. </para>

              <para>- It is typical of the Leader of the Government to say that is one of a stack of them. This has been his attitude all along on all occasions when there have been divisions in this place in respect of certain Bills. On every occasion when the vote could have been taken it has been taken for one purpose. It has been taken for a purpose of window dressing in respect to the number of times that the Government has been defeated on the floor of this place. That is an undeniable fact. </para>

              <para>- It is a record of which I, as a member of this place, am <inline font-style="italic">proud.</inline> Out of the 256 Bills introduced only 10 were defeated. If those 10 Bills were categorised it would be seen that three of them were electoral Bills, two were constitution alteration Bills- legislation which in any event should have awaited consideration by the Constitutional Convention- and two were two health Bills. The conciliation and arbitration Bills were later passed with amendments. Consequently Bills relating to only 5 subjects were defeated. There have been more recent rejections but this is the general position. </para>

              <para>- There is no holding up of any salary in respect of the Governor-General. It is worth while for the people of Australia to know what the functions of the Petroleum and Minerals Authority will be. They are to explore for minerals on the Australian continental land mass and elsewhere, to recover minerals from their natural site on the continental land mass or from any other place, to treat minerals for the purpose of extracting metals and other substances in Australia or elsewhere, to refine metals and other substances obtained as a result of the treatment of minerals in Australia or elsewhere, to crush, screen or otherwise treat or prepare for sale coal and construction materials in Australia or elsewhere, to buy and sell minerals, refined substances and manufactured materials and substances, whether in Australia or elsewhere, and to transport minerals, refined substances and manufactured materials and substances on the Australian continental land mass and between Australia and other countries. What a wide range of functions for a State authority to undertake. </para>

              <para>- Sure, but I am emphasising the wide scope of interest and activity proposed for this Authority, activities which can best be left to private enterprise, as has been proven through the years. Australia at present is in a not so strong position. I am sure that at the end of 1967 we had a degree of advancement economically that was the envy of the whole world. It was not achieved through socialistic programs, but was achieved through the initiatives, the ingenuity and the drive which comes from encouragement of private enterprise. The Authority is able to enter into agreements on such terms and conditions as the Authority deems fit with any person or body for or in relation to the performance of work, the provision of services or the doing of other things. The Authority will be able to acquire, upon such terms as it deems fit, an interest in a mining undertaking that is being or is to be carried on in Australia or elsewhere and can acquire any undertaking other than a mining undertaking that is being or is to be carried out in Australia by another person or body and so on, but at the terms and conditions as the Authority deems fit. </para>

It is to be a body of 5 men consisting of a chairman who is to be appointed by the Governor-General, the secretary to the Department of Minerals and Energy, an executive member and two other members. These 5 men are to be entrusted with this fantastic area of responsibility which is one of the most important aspects of governmental or national interest, that is energy.

            <para>- Yes. I wish to speak very briefly in support of the amendment because Western Australia is a State which is probably more affected by legislation of this kind than any other State, although I acknowledge that Victoria, Queensland and the other States are affected to a greater or lesser extent. This is a typical example of legislation which was introduced not because of any electoral mandate but because of the dictatorial and socialist attitude of an incompetent and arrogant Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> who wishes to take over the whole of the minerals and petroleum industry in Australia. In support of his case he gives misleading and inaccurate information. For example, in an article by David Solomon in the 'Canberra Times' which was quoted by the spokesman for the Opposition in another place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fairbairn,</inline> it was stated that only 40 off-shore wells had been drilled in the previous 10 years." This appeared under a heading of 'off-shore boom'. The article stated that 54 wells were to be drilled in the coming year. This is big stuff. But what are the facts? The simple facts are that in that 10-year period 189 wells were drilled off-shore from mobile platforms and another 100 wells were drilled offshore from fixed platforms. So in the vicinity of 300 wells were drilled and not 40 as the Minister would have us believe in an attempt to mislead the people of Australia and to gain support for this legislation. This is an example of the actions of this incompetent Minister who will go to any lengths to mislead the people. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>He misled the people as to the amount of foreign capital or foreign control involved in our mineral resources. The whole of his case has been built upon misleading and inaccurate information. But one of my main objections to this legislation is that it takes away from the States areas, which by right, are their responsibility. If the Senate has a major function it is that of protecting the powers of the States and not supporting legislation which diminishes those powers or takes them away altogether. If the lessons of the past are any example- I believe that they are then the off-shore program of drilling and search for oil in Australia under the previous Administration was a very successful one. The record under this Government has been lamentable. It has destroyed confidence. The Government has driven away capital which is so urgently required. Of course this has been going to other countries where the guidelines and the rules are known. Here the guidelines and the rules are a day to day decision of a dictatorial and arrogant Minister. The reintroduction of this legislation after one week is the action of a frightened and frustrated Government. The Minister has shown his contempt for the States and for industry. Nothing illustrates the frustrations of State governments better than the comments of Ministers of the previous Government in Western Australia. I refer to the attack made upon the Federal Government by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bickerton</inline> who for the first time was defeated in the Pilbara seat. I ask the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> not to point a finger at me or I will point one back at him. </para>

              <para>- If the Leader of the Government wants to challenge this statement I suggest that he have a talk to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tonkin</inline> because he is on record as saying this. I support the amendment. I believe that it puts the facts clearly on record. The Government cannot claim to have an electoral mandate. When it suits the Government it makes great play of some matters but, when it does not suit, it conveniently forgets. It did not have an electoral mandate to reduce defence expenditure from 3.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent because the Prime Minister, in his policy speech, promised not to reduce expenditure below 3.5 per cent. Promptly the Government reduced the expenditure to 2.8 per cent. So I think we have to be very careful about accepting any Government claim that it has an electoral mandate. It certainly does not have an electoral mandate to socialise the oil and gas industry. Therefore I support the amendment and I defend the right of the Senate to throw out this legislation or, in this case, to defer it for another 6 months. I support the amendment on one major ground and that is in order to defend the rights of the States which, under our Constitution, to a very large degree have powers and responsibilities in this matter. </para>

            <para>-That will be as soon as they come into the Senate. In the meantime, perhaps we could proceed with the other matters on the notice paper. They are the Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill, the Trade Practices Bill and the Customs Tariff Validation Bill. Perhaps it would be preferable to deal with a Bill upon which there would be a short debate rather than become involved in a longer debate. Therefore, I move: </para>

            <para>-Perhaps it is. We do not know. Nobody has been prepared to disclose what is really going to happen. What I wish to say is that I can give no undertaking from this side of the Senate that the Bills will be dealt with as fast as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> would like them to be dealt with. Whilst Government senators or even honourable senators on my side may think that they are mere machinery Bills, some honourable senators in the tradition of the Senate may feel that if they want to make a contribution they are entitled to make it. That is not to say that that should shift to filibustering or obstructionism. I just put that caveat on. I say to the Government: Do not be surprised if some honourable senators on this side of the Senate feel that they have something to say. I would hope that they would not say it at length. But no undertaking can be given that the Customs Tariff Validation Bill will be passed by the time the Appropriation Bills are presented to the Senate. </para>

          <para>- I want to say on behalf of the Australian Democratic Labor Party that we do not want to delay these proceedings. I think that it is farcical to introduce the Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill and the other Bills that it is proposed to introduce when the Senate is about to be dissolved for an election. Any Australian citizen who is listening in to the debate would simply say one thing: Why do not they put those issues aside and let the new Parliament determine them? That is the obvious thing to do. Therefore, I object to the farcical way in which the Government is delaying the Senate from undertaking the task which we are all here to undertake. Everybody knows what we are here for. We have our axes ready. Why does not the Government bring in the chickens? </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MURPHY</inline>(New South WalesLeader of the Government in the Senate)- by leave- It is very easy to answer what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> has asked. The Government does not need to bring in the chickens because they are already here. They are sitting opposite. A number of them are about to lose their heads in the coming election. It seems that we will not be able to finish the business by 5 p.m. As I have indicated, there are certain measures which need to be put through. The Customs Tariff Validation </para>
        <para class="block">Bill is one of those measures which, in any event, has to be passed because in accordance with the usual practice, moneys have been collected in anticipation of such legislation. This is a time honoured practice. There is the Governor-General Bill which, if it is to be adopted, needs to be adopted before the commencement of the term of the Governor-General, because effect cannot be given to those provisions during his term of office. </para>

            <para>- I refer to the incoming Governor-General. Changes cannot be made to affect a present incumbent. There are also the matters dealing with flood relief and the distribution of moneys to the public servants. I know that some members of the Opposition may not care about the conduct of government in an orderly fashion. But the Government has a responsibility and we propose to see, as far as we can, that that responsibility is discharged. I have indicated that as soon as the Bills are available we will endeavour to have them put before the Senate. Referring to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus,</inline> I would say that I know that he wants to refuse to pass the Bills. The sooner that is said, the better. I do not know why it is necessary to have a repetition of speeches that have been made before when the Opposition has made up its mind that it will not pass this legislation. </para>

          <para>-by leave- We are now having quite a deal of talk about legislation coming before the Senate and about the sitting hours for today. I consider that honourable senators came here this week with the intention of meeting during certain sitting hours. Those hours have been extended. If further legislation is to come before us and if legislation is to be debated properly, why cannot we come back in the week after Easter and finish it off? I do not think that the legislation should be put through the Senate like sugar cane tossed through a chaff cutter. I think that we should have proper deliberation, irrespective of whether the Bills have been before the Senate previously or whether they are new legislation. Certainly, we do not want to make a farce of the Senate. We want some time for this legislation to be passed through the Senate. We have not yet received the Supply Bills. I think that they are Bills to which some time should be devoted. Rather than jam everything in and extend the hours of sitting this week when everybody has made arrangements, I think that it would be much better if we came back the week after Easter. </para>

          <para>-by leave- I felt that the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> made it quite clear that the Appropriation Bills were not ready to come from the House of Representatives yet. Until the House of Representatives has passed the Bills, the Senate cannot move on them. Probably many honourable senators have booked their plane tickets to Perth and other places. They should cancel those reservations and return to their States tomorrow, if necessary. We are here to do a job. Until such time as the Bills are debated in the right manner, we should be prepared to remain here. If the honourable senators want to return tomorrow, let the Senate sit all night. But there is no necessity to rush through legislation. I feel that the nature of the vote on the Supply Bills, when they are presented to the Senate, will be so serious that we should not treat it lightly. We should be able to debate those Bills if we want to do so. Therefore, I suggest that we be prepared to sit longer and, if necessary, carry out <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood's</inline> suggestion that the Senate meet after Easter. </para>

            <para>- This Bill provides for the validation until 31 August 1974 of duties which have been collected in pursuance of customs tariff proposals which have not yet been enacted. So, in effect, it provides a time scale so that the revenue can be accumulated against the day when these measures will finally become law. A great list of them is set out in the Bill, and I do not propose to refer to them, but I wish to make one or two brief observations in passing. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This Bill also validates the Government's revised system of tariff preferences for imports from developing countries. It was the LiberalCountry Party Government- and I can remember the debate in the Senate some years ago when the initiative was taken by that Government- which attempted to help the lesser developed countries by allowing imports to come into Australia more freely in order to aid the developing and infant industries in those countries. We will need to deal later in more detail with a part of this question, that is, the 10 per cent preference which, in a mechanical style, could perhaps in some ways cause damage to Australian manufacturing industry. I will give an example. After 4 years of deliberation the Tariff Board, as it then was, recommended a duty of 35 per cent in respect of certain printed products where the main source of competition was identified by the Board itself as coming from developing countries. Yet the Government, in giving effect to the Roam 's report on 4 January last, provided for a tariff of only 25 per cent. So the Government has discounted, to that extent, the 10 per cent margin or leeway. </para>
          <para>We in the Opposition would say in the broad that because of the present tariff policy of the Government it is very difficult for manufacturing industry to determine what its level of support or protection is. There is certainly developing in the Australian manufacturing industry in some areas very great concern about what might happen if a flood of imports came towards Australia. We believe that the warning should be given to the Government that there is a potential danger to quite a wide area of Australian manufacturing industry because the tariff situation is neither clear nor resolved. We in our Party have a clear view, which is that manufacturing industry is extremely important. It employs more than 25 per cent of the Australian work force. It produces about one-third of our gross national product. But it is suffering from a cost disability as against other countries because of the Australian cost structure which, of course, has accelerated markedly over the last 12 months. We can see trouble coming in the electronics industry, the white goods industry and the textile industry. While we approve of the Bill and agree to it, we say to the Government that we have very distinct reservations about the whole of its tariff structure and its support for manufacturing industry which, we believe, is at the point of being put in a position of very great potential danger. The same thing will apply to Australian living standards and to Australian employment if manufacturing indus- _ try is put at hazard. </para>

            <para>-The debate upon this Bill was adjourned last night because the Bill was introduced into the Senate at 8 p.m. and I for one wished to have some little time to consider it. On consideration I think there are some important matters to be raised. I agree entirely with the desire of the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> to discuss this Bill on a purely non-party basis, but that does not absolve the Senate from exercising its functions as a proper chamber of review. The second reading speech states that the Constitution provides that the salary of the Governor-General should be $20,000, until the Parliament otherwise provides. The Constitution provided that the salary of a Governor-General should not be altered during his continuance in office. Acting in pursuance of that provision this Bill is expressed to operate only at the expiration of the office of the present Governor-General, and that is as it should be. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>But then it is necessary to advert to the fact that the person who has been designated to succeed <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Paul</inline> Hasluck is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr, the Chief Justice of New South Wales. I would be wanting in my duty if I did not refer to the fact that judges who accept executive office or the position of being publicly designated for executive office cease thereafter to enjoy that degree of independence which is absolutely inalienable from judicial office. I wish it to be clearly understood that I think that the involvement of the judiciary in executive office is a matter that needs to be carefully scrutinised on every occasion and a strict line of demarcation should be insisted upon. It seems to me to be quite impossible for a judge who has been designated as a Governor of a State or the Governor-General, thereafter to have that independence of the executive and of the government that is essential to the discharge of judicial office. Some confusion on that point whether here or elsewhere- be tokens, I submit, the inadequacy of this Bill in <inline font-style="italic">certain respects.</inline></para>
          <para>The Bill confers a salary of $30,000 upon the Governor-General. With that I have no quarrel at all; I do not question it. But lest those who put forward the proposition for an increase be misunderstood, it ought to be understood quite clearly that whereas the Governor-General's salary has remained unaltered at $20,000 since the Constitution, the appropriations that have been made to relieve him of expenditure which at that time he bore and to provide for his establishments have increased enormously. In 1925-26 the appropriations made for his establishments and office amounted to $38,150. In 1972-73 similar appropriations amounted to $708,047. It would be a complete piece of deception if we took the simple view that the Governor-General's salary has remained unaccompanied by parliamentary appropriations increasing as the ambit of expenditure grew, because an appropriation for his office and establishments in 1925-26 of $38,150 had grown to an appropriation last year, 1972-73, of $708,047. 1 have had a table compiled by the Papers Office in that respect, and in order not to delay the matter too long I ask for leave to incorporate it in Hansard. </para>

              <para>-The next point is that the Bill deals not only with the salary of the Governor-General but also with the pension that is payable to the Governor-General or to his widow. It is pointed out that this is novel legislation. Hitherto no pension has been provided by law for the Governor-General or his widow, except as an act of grace in those instances in which the Government thought that a pension was appropriate. We are assured that those cases will be continued as ex gratia payments, adjusted from time to time. But to such a degree has the draftsman of this Bill confused the Governor Generalship with the judiciary that there is a link between the pension to be payable to the Governor-General and the Chief Justice's salary. I point out that it is proposed to link the pension not with the Chief Justice's pension but with the Chief Justice's salary. The Bill provides in clause 4 that an allowance is payable to the Governor-General during his life at the rate stated, which is 60 per cent of the rate of the salary payable to the Chief Justice of Australia. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>When I turn to the Judicial Retiring Allowances Act I find that a judge of the High Court is not entitled automatically, when he ceases to be a judge, to a pension of 60 per cent of his salary for life. We passed that legislation in 1973. I hope to be corrected if I am wrong in thinking that this is the current legislation. To my knowledge, it has not been altered. In 1973 we provided that, where a judge who has attained the age of 60 years retires after serving as a judge for not less than 10 years, he is entitled to a pension at the rate equal to 60 per cent of the appropriate current judicial salary. In the case of a member of the judiciary who retires, it is provided that he receives his pension only if he has reached the age of 60 years and if he has served not less than 10 years in office. By the nature of things, having regard to our knowledge of judicial tenure, most judges who retire- unless it be for ill health- retire at a late age in life, usually over age 60. Provision is made for retirement before age 60 on the ground of ill health. I think the position is that there is an almost pro rata provision. But, whereas a judge holds office for life, usually for about 20 years, and terminates his office late in life, a Governor-General may take office at any time in his career without any previous special qualifications and retires usually after a brief period of service of 3 or 5 years. </para>
          <para>We are confronted with a Bill which provides that a Governor-General who retires at the age of 45 years shall receive, whatever be the period of his service, a pension equal to 60 per cent of the Chief Justice's salary for the rest of his life. I illustrate this by reference to some people whose names have been bandied about as candidates for the office- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kenneth</inline> Myer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lance</inline> Barnard, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bob</inline> Hawke - </para>

              <para>-I have not heard of that suggestion until now; and I laugh at it, as does the Leader of the Government in the Senate. The point is that the office of Governor-General is a temporary executive office where retirement is likely at any time of the career. It is a wholly false equation to compare it with that of a judicial personage who is likely to retire late in life. I point out that in the case of a judicial person we stipulate that there shall be 10 years of service and retirement later than age 60. It seems to me to be wholly inappropriate that wealthy persons who may be appointed should go out on a pension of 60 per cent of the Chief Justice's salary after 3 or 5 years of executive service, or that political favourites appointed to an executive office should go out with this handsome pension which a Chief Justice earns by very different considerations. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Therefore, in the Committee stage I shall ask the Committee to consider a specific amendment making the pension payable to the Governor-General and his successors dependent upon his attaining the age of 60 years and having served in the office of Governor-General for a certain period. I have copied the period of 10 years from the Judicial Retiring Allowances Act, but I indicate that I think 5 years would be more appropriate. </para>
          <para>There is one other point I wish to mention. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> was reading his speech rapidly last night, as soon as the Bill was introduced, when I said that I wanted to examine, the Bill to ensure that no more than 60 per cent of the Chief Justice 's salary was being provided for by way of pension. I was almost rather shortly rebuked for questioning the proposition. On looking at the Bill I find that the amount of the allowance in respect of any period shall be reduced by the amount of any pension or retiring allowance payable to the Governor-General 'whether by virtue of a law or otherwise, in respect of that period out of moneys provided in whole or in part by Australia, a State or a Territory'. 1 interpret that to mean that, if a judicial personage is appointed and he has a judicial pension, that pension is offset against the 60 per cent pension for the Governor-General. So, too, if a parliamentarian is appointed and is entitled to a parliamentary pension, whether a Federal pension or a State pension, it is offset. I also understand that, if a public servant were entitled to a superannuation pension or retiring allowance, that would come within the meaning of that clause. I wish to have confirmation of that in Committee. But on that assumption I remind myself that senior public servants- I am told, though not authoritatively, that some State parliamentarians also- have converted their pensions into lump sums. I recall one instance in New South Wales where the sum exceeded $200,000. 1 want to make sure that the lump sum equivalent of a pension payable over a period to a retired personage of that sort, if he becomes Governor-General, shall also be offset against the pension. </para>
          <para>These are matters which, with the greatest respect both on a point of principle and from the point of view of fairness and equity, I submit the Committee should take into account. We must beware in parliamentary appropriations of slipping into the assumption that high personages automatically are entitled to very high appropriations. If we allow a disparity between the influential and powerful in high office too great as compared with other people we will do the constitution great disservice. </para>

            <para>- I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has focussed the attention of the Senate on this measure. I am well aware of and fully support the maintenance of the Standing Orders of the Senate. I am a very keen upholder and supporter of the high office of Governor-General, just as I am a supporter of the retention of the Australian flag, our present national anthem and our ties with the mother country, Great Britain. But I do not believe that we are doing a duty if we allow ourselves to be persuaded on this reference to the salary and allowances for a Governor-General in these terms: You must not show Party politics, you must not criticise or question. You just sit there and say "Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir" and</inline> let the Bill be passed'. We have a duty as a Parliament, as has this Senate as a house of review, to look at every piece of legislation that comes in and to see whether its provisions are fair to the top echelon as compared with those in lower echelons on the salary and income scale. We have a duty so to do because there is no doubt that when a measure like this becomes law, all of us- everyone in Australia- is entitled to have a look at it and to say: 'If that office is entitled to those emoluments, retiring allowances and conditions, what about upping ours a bit according to our importance on the national Australian scale?' </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline>analytical mind and forthrightness of character has got the Senate to this position today when we can in a sensible way raise the query: Is this measure designed with the right wording, amounts and effect? Once we put it on the statute book no government, I think, would bring in legislation to amend it, to make more harsh the provisions or to lower the emoluments. Therefore it would stand, as it were, as a pacesetter for this type of legislation. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has done a job in bringing this to our notice. Look at what has transpired in the appointment of an ambassador designate. Look at the way it has come about- the fact that we do not know yet whether the man has resigned, whether he has been appointed, whether he is overpaid or whether he has committed a criminal offence by drawing emoluments from this Senate. These answers are not given to us. Under this Government anything could be done in the appointment to a high office. Nothing could be lower than what has happened with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair.</inline> I do not criticise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> in this because I do not know what part he played except that he said yes. But if a Government will appoint a person to a position of trust and then carry on after the supposed appointment as this Government has behaved, anything goes. Therefore we ought to pay every attention to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> amendment which appears to me to be able to stop in the future something else that might be bad. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Governor-General on precedent, is likely to be in the position for a period in excess of 10 years. The normal period is 5 years. The words of the amendment 'similar to qualifications in the Judges Pensions Act for the payment of a pension to a judge' relate to a person over the age of 60 years and with 10 years service. This, however, relates to voluntary retirement. There are provisions for payment of lesser amounts if the retirement is due to disability. The effect of the amendment therefore would be not only to make the conditions impossible but to make them stricter than apply in relation to judges. There are provisions about the lump sum payments which can be dealt with in Committee. </para>
          <para>Basically I think there is a fallacy in what the honourable senator is putting forward. He is saying that a Governor-General should be treated in some lesser way than judges. In reality if one wants independence in these spheres, the judges are more protected by the constitutional provisions than is a Governor-General. The judges are irremovable except in the procedures of which the honourable senator is aware; that is a redress through both Houses. As for the Governor-General, one would think that it is better to have provisions relating to a pension which would provide this measure of independence. I think it is not really appropriate that these proposals should come from here. Certainly, the initiative on the lump sum payments, one would think, ought to come from the government and be presented to the Parliament. The Government would not be prepared to accept either of the amendments. </para>

              <para>- I have advanced the view in the second reading stage that an executive officer appointed to the high position of Governor-General in all sorts of circumstances in life should not receive a life pension upon retirement, irrespective of age and irrespective of period of service. I pointed out that a judge receives a retiring allowance only if he retires after 60 years of age and has served for 10 years unless his retirement is caused by ill-health or invalidity in which case an adjusted pension but certainly not a full pension is payable. A man in the position of a judge is not entitled to a pension, ipso facto, for service of 3 years or 5 years, whereas a man such as a Governor-General, who has not spent his lifetime in acquiring a skill that fits him for the office, as most Governor-general have not, is so entitled. It is quite absurd that in the case of the judge we provide for a conditional pension but in the other case provide a pension without any conditions whatever. It should be noted that the pension payable in each case is non-contributory; that is to say, the occupant of the office bears out of his salary no contribution whatever towards the pension. In those circumstances I ask the Committee to accept the proposition that a Governor-General should qualify for this pension for the rest of his life only if he has reached the age of 60 years and has served for a period of 5 years. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> made some remarks about judges being more protected in their office under provisions which I would know of. He refers, of course, to the provision that no judge shall be removed from office except in the case of misbehaviour on an address from each House of Parliament in the same session. Under the Judges Pensions Act, if a judge is removes from office for misbehaviour he gets no pension. We will not stay to discuss either that case or to contemplate that a Governor-General may be asked to retire for misbehaviour. I do not wish to occupy the Senate's time by discussing a contingency of that sort. All I say is that the protection which the judges have for a life tenure is not relevant in any one iota to his entitlement to a pension by reference to the age or period which qualifies him for an allowance on retirement. </para>

          </continue><para>I submit that we will be doing the Constitution a great disservice if we introduce on different grounds and different conditions for a Governor-General a pension which is expressed to be the equivalent of 60 per cent of the salary of the Chief Justice for the time being, unless we make it comparable in the conditions of entitlement to those to which the judges conform.

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSON (New South Wales) (4.10)- I was not here during the second reading debate on this Bill but I listened to some of it in another place while examining some other papers. Speaking in the Committee stage with a certain degree of tolerance from the Chair, because perhaps I will advert to matters covered in the second reading stage, I find it an unhappy experience to be here in the Senate in a debate of this nature in relation to the position of Governor-General. I know from my own knowledge of the sheer tragedy of situations in the past, in fact since Federation, when inadequate provision has been made for Governor-general on retirement in this country. They have been men who have given magnificent service to their country. In the culmination of that service they have accepted the high office of Governor-General only to find on their retirement that they are in a situation almost of poverty. </para><para>I am sorry that this debate is taking place. However, there is one thing I should say. In my view, when a person accepts the office of Governor-General of a nation and retires later- I was happy to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> at least reduce the period in his amendment to 5 years, although at present I do not intend to support the amendment it is almost axiomatic that, having been the Governor-General and having held the highest office in the land, he should not upon his retirement be returning to his profession, taking up a new profession or business, or having to do other things. It seems to me inevitable, natural, normal and appropriate for a man- it could be a woman in the world in which we live today- who accepts this highest office in the land and who serves the whole of the people of this nation to be able on his retirement to keep at that high level thereafter as one of the elder statesmen of the nation. It is assumed to be normal and natural that he will not be returning to some revenue producing activity. Therefore, it is appropriate that he should have thereafter a pension, whatever the figure is, for the remainder of his life. I think it is singularly unfortunate that we should be arguing, even at a fairly high level, or discussing this matter on this unfortunate occasion on this particular day. I appreciate that it cannot be done during the term of appointment of the present incumbent of the office of Governor-General but I think that there would be more appropriate ways of finding an answer to the problem than having this debate in this chamber. </para><para>Progress reported. </para></speech>

          <para>This Bill seeks appropriations totalling $100,480,000 for expenditure in the current financial year on administrative expenses and other services in addition to the appropriations made by the Appropriation Act (No. 1) 1973-74. Although additional appropriations are being sought for the services specified in the Bill, it is expected that savings of about $ 104.2 m will be available in other appropriations under Appropriation Act (No. 1). Honourable senators will be aware that, as a matter of law, moneys appropriated by Parliament for specific purposes may be used only for those purposes and expected savings under existing appropriations cannot be utilised as an offset to reduce the total of new appropriations sought in this Bill to a net figure. To the extent that any annual appropriation is unexpended, it lapses at 30 June in accordance with section 36 of the Audit Act 1901-1973. </para>
          <para>For the information of honourable senators, a separate document has been provided listing the estimated savings in existing annual appropriations. I emphasise that these are estimated savings- the final expenditure under those appropriations cannot yet be predicted with certainty. Nor is it intended to imply that there will be no savings under other appropriations. The information is provided by way of background to senators' consideration of the additional amounts now being sought. Honourable senators will note that this Bill does not provide for salaries and allowances. This year the additional amount required for salaries and allowances- $ 168.575m- was sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3). The additional requirement for departmental administrative expenses is $29.4m. This includes $ 1 . 1 m for the Department of Housing and Construction for fees of private architects and other consultants; $2. 8m and $4.5m for the Department of Services and Property for elections and referendum and for rent, respectively; $700,000 for the Department of Social Security for postage and telephone services following the easing of the means test; and $700,000 for the Department of Transport for payments to the State railway system for services rendered in connection with interstate passenger and freight traffic. </para>

These include $2.4m for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to provide for award wage employment of Aboriginals formerly employed under the training allowance scheme in the northern Territory; Department of Education, including $ 1.1m Tor secondary grants to Aboriginals and $1.3m for assistance to isolated children; $ 1 1 .5m for the Department of Foreign Affairs for payment under the National Wheat Agreement- Food Aid Convention; $5.1m for the Department of the Media for increased costs of the Australian Broadcasting Commission; $1.5m for the Department of Minerals and Energy for oil search subsidies; $600,000 for the Department of Primary Industry for emergency adjustment assistance to the apple, pear and canning fruit industry; $2. 2m for the Department of Repatriation for pensions to widows and other dependents of deceased ex-servicemen and for maintenance of patients in non-departmental institutions; and $6.5m for the Department of Services and Property for rent, property maintenance, furniture and fittings and running costs at overseas posts; and $900,000 for the Department of the Special Minister of State for expenditure on the international exposition to be held in Spokane, United States of America; this year. </para>
          <para>Further appropriations totalling $23. 4m are sought for the Defence Services; $5. 7m of this amount is required for maintenance of defence production capacity in government factories and industry. Deliveries made earlier than expected of stores and equipment for the Navy and increased costs of fuel for Royal Australian Navy ships and the Air Force require the provision of $4.2m. A further $4.2m is required to meet increases in general administrative and operational expenses. Production development requires $230,000 and repairs and overhaul of aircraft and military weapons $1.8m. Payments on new aircraft for the Royal Australian Navy and Air Force previously not expected to be made in 1973-74 require $l.lm and maintenance of Air Force elements overseas $ lm. Other increased costs and miscellaneous activities require $3.1m. Estimated savings in other Defence appropriations amount to some $41. 3m and are due mainly to slippages, cancellations and re phasing of a variety of equipment projects. I commend the Bill to honourable senators.. </para>

          <para>I know that there has been a lot of speculation around the Parliament, in the public area and in the media, as to what would happen when the Appropriation Bills were introduced. There has been continual talk of what we would do. As I recall it, when the parliamentary Liberal Party Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden,</inline> first made an announcement on this matter he said that the Liberal Party would do all in its power to make certain that this Government got no more money until it submitted itself to the people. It has been said that the course upon which the Senate is now embarking is unprecedented, unusual and all sorts of things. But those of us who live in the Senate, who understand why the Senate was created by the founding fathers and who know the powers which reside in the Senate, know that we are doing nothing unusual. Let me put it this way: We are doing nothing that is unconstitutional. It might be a good theory for those who say that it is improper for an upper House to send a lower House to the people and not go itself, but that situation does not operate in the present situation. </para>
          <para>Last night at approximately midnight the Senate, full knowing that it was giving the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> an absolute and complete instrument on which to ask for a double dissolution, for the second time with a 3-months lapse defeated the health Bills. We knew that if we embarked upon the course of action which I have outlined, namely, the refusal of any more money by the Senate to the Government, and it were successful, the Government would take out either the House of Representatives with half the Senate or the House of Representatives with the whole Senate and we too would face the people. So I hope that the argument which has been canvassed that it is improper for an upper House to do this because it does not risk its neck is clearly shown to be not valid in the present situation. If we succeed in the operation on which we have set out, 60 honourable senators will face the electors as well as 125 members of the House of Representatives. I think this ought to be made clear from the outset. I hope that we will not have any more of these pseudo-constitutionalists writing odd sorts of articles. </para>
          <para>Why do we take this course of action? The Opposition and the Opposition parties- I hope my friends and allies will not object to my including them in this statement- when the Electoral Bill first came before the Senate last year decided to vote against it. We knew full well that we were embarking upon a course which could lead to a double dissolution. This became even more pertinent and even more an issue when that Bill came back again during the Budget session. Again the Bill was defeated. So ever since that date there has been the capacity for the Government to take both Houses to the people. But in spite of the noise, flag waving, grandstanding and all the rest of it the Government has not been prepared to do that. As I said last night, this is part of a situation of whether the Prime Minister is prepared to jump or whether he must be pushed. The whole purpose of this exercise is to push him because we want an election. We are not afraid of a double dissolution. We have not been afraid of one since the Electoral Bill was introduced last year. We want one now for the good of the nation. One could talk at great length at to why this ought to be done. </para>
          <para>I shall make some very brief comments as to why the Government must go back to the people and why we must also go back and give account of our stewardship since 2 December 1972. Of course the first thing is that this country no longer has good management. We all know that inflation has increased at an alarming rate from 4.5 per cent in 1972 to about 14 per cent today. The rate of inflation in Australia is one of the world 's worst for an industrial economy. The Government has done nothing to stop this wage price spiral and the reckless public spending instanced by the unprecedented growth of the Public Service. In one year 1 50 new branches and divisions of the Commonwealth Public Service cost the Australian taxpayer $150m in wages alone. What about the so-called taxation reforms? We accuse this Government of being incompetent, bad managers, cynical, devious and prepared to manipulate Parliament for mean political purposes. I shall just run through a list of broken promises. This is not the whole but a list of those promises which spring readily to mind. The Prime Minister, in his policy speech in 1972 stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The most pressing need in the tax field is to retard the trend by which inflation has forced lower and middle income earners into the high tax brackets. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The fact is that in 1973-74 taxes will increase by some $ 1,500m, which is an average of $200 per person. The tax on private companies was sharply increased in the first Budget despite a policy statement that tax on companies was already high enough'. This Government imposed a new tax relief scheme on elderly people. It placed them in a higher tax bracket. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> in his policy speech stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">Our first step towards revising the tax burdens at the lower and middle levels will be to require the Treasury to produce and publish forthwith the 'comprehensive review' which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> as Treasurer said in August 1969 would be urgently acted upon'. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I ask: Where is the review? I come to that delightful subject of interest rates. The Prime Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">Labor will deliberately plan to reduce interest rates wherever practicable. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Interest rates have risen to an all time high. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> in his policy speech also promised 'to delay no longer in the introduction of uniform building codes throughout Australia', claiming that this would drastically reduce building costs. I ask: Where are those codes? The Prime Minister said that there would be a limited tax deductibility scheme on housing interest rates. We know what a dead flop that turned out to be. One of the great broken promises was in relation to defence policy. In the policy speech the Prime Minister stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">A Labor Government will allocate not less than 3.5 per cent of Australia 's gross national product for defence in each annual Budget. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Defence expenditure in 1973-74 is estimated at 2.9 per cent. I now turn to education. The Government promised that no child would receive less from the Government for education than he was receiving from the then government. What happened to that promise? It was discarded in only 6 months. The Government promised 4 weeks annual leave for public servants. Then it tried to wriggle out of that promise. It tried to grant 4 weeks leave to public servants providing they were trade unionists. The list is almost interminable. One can go on and on and on. But those are the broken promises. What about the incompetence of the Government? In this chamber need one advert to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation bungle? We all know about that. It is part of the folk lore of the country. What will happen on 14 March? In the area of Aboriginal affairs- turtles and that whole operation- we now have the head of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs telling the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts that on many occasions the first the Department knew of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bryant's</inline> decisions on funds was when the bills arrived. I think that somewhere there is an expression about the mire. I now turn to increasing industrial unrest. We remember the promise under Labor that there would be less industrial trouble. What a situation we are in in Australia. We cannot rely on letters arriving in the post. We cannot rely on planes being ready to fly, that there will be petrol for motor cars, that garbage will be collected, that mail will be delivered or even that beer will be brewed. One cannot even rely upon the fact that children will be taught at school. The only thing we can rely on is that the Public Service will continue to grow. </para>
          <para>We see other wastage of money. There has been the waste of money in setting up numerous committees and commissions when the Government has no intention of acting on their reports. For example, the other day we saw the Henderson report. But what is the Government going to do? It will do nothing because it is both too expensive and too politically damaging to implement. What happened to the famous health scheme of Scotton and Deeble? It was shelved. It turned out to be a phoney. As to the contradictory statements between the Government and its Ministers I ask honourable senators to remember the famous Galston affair. On 15 September the Prime Minister said: 'You are getting Galston'. On 19 September his  deputy  said: 'No decision has yet been made on an airport at Galston'. Who does one believe? Then there is the great issue of federalism versus centralism which has raged over the last 1 5 months. We have seen this Government deliberately set out on a course of confrontation with the States rather than seek their co-operation. It is well known that this Government is a central government, that it wants to take all power to the central government and to roll over the States. For the first time in 70 years it has been able to create an atmosphere in which many people are starting to have doubts about the wisdom of Federation, and that is damaging to the nation. </para>
          <para>If one talks about deceit and deception, where should one look to find instances of deceit and deception? Just look at the 4 constitutional Bills which were trotted up and which one assumes will be part of the next election. In not one of them does the title spell out the intent of the Bill. Democratic elections, simultaneous elections and the rest of these phoney questions are deliberately put out to deceive the elector when he goes to vote. Then we have the claim made by the Prime Minister, as I understood him, that the State Attorneys-General had agreed to the text of the Constitution Alteration (Inter-change of Powers) Bill and the contrary statement by the Attorney-General of Queensland in the Parliament of that State denying that an agreement was ever made. Who can one believe? There has been administrative bungling. Remember the divorce rules which came into this place- the hotch-potch, the bungling and the botch that nobody could understand. The country ought to be grateful to the Senate for throwing them out. There has been incompetence in framing legislation. I have adverted to the divorce rules. I refer now to the trade practices legislation. Remember when it was introduced. It was introduced as the Government's piece de resistance. What happened? The Senate, in its wisdom, did not proceed immediately with it. Three months later it was re-introduced with over 100 amendments, and that was to the Government's perfect Bill. </para>
          <para>We come now to the Gair affair- the final bungle. I will give some quotations to show the extent to which this Government knew what it was all about. In the Senate on 4 April <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> said: </para>

But nobody has been prepared to bite the bullet. This is the opportunity for the Government to bite the bullet. If it does not, there is no more money. It can take its pick. It is as simple as that. As far as we are concerned, the sooner the Prime Minister sees the Governor-General and obtains his double dissolution and this matter is resolved by the people, the better because, as the Prime Minister and all of us agree, we cannot go on as we are. This matter must be resolved by the electors. They are the people who ought to resolve it. It ought not to be resolved by the Prime Minister abusing a chamber of this Parliament at a Press conference. That will solve nothing. Let us go back to those who sent us here.

              <para>- If after 16 months in government the honourable senator does not understand who is the Opposition, I will ignore him. We have had a criticism of the Prime Minister that he and his Government have reached the stage at which they are frustrated by a Senate which is deliberately trying to hold up Government legislation. What sort of Government do we have? Western Australia had a Labor Government which for 3 years worked with a hostile upper House. I think, from the election results, despite that Government's defeat, it must have worked pretty well judging by the support it got in the last State election. It did not cry out that it was hindered and could not get its legislation through because of a hostile upper House. It got on with the job. That is what this Government should have been doing. This is only a small part of it. When we look at what the Government has done, we see nothing but broken promises. The last time I did a count of the broken promises, I think there were about 30 which the Government put before the people and which it has forgotten. </para>

          <para>One only has to remember what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby,</inline> the Labor Party spokesman on primary industry prior to the 1972 election. He promised the people engaged in primary industry that a Labor government would make available loans at very low rates of interests. He said that such a proposal would cost only $18m to implement. What is the result? We have not heard from the Government one single thing about low interest rates. In fact, interest rates have been increased so much that an ordinary person who tries to buy a house these days has to pay from $20 to $30 a month more in interest charges alone- not in the capital cost of the house but just in interest charges- and a person who wants to buy a car on hire purchases has to pay $300 to $400 extra for that car. Yet we were told that we would have low interest rates. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators should look at how the Government has plundered and abandoned rural industry. The primary producers in Western Australia showed what they thought of the Government by their vote at the election in that State a few Saturdays ago. The Government will see what the primary producers think of it when it goes before them again very shortly. Inflation in this country has run unchecked and has now reached a rate of 14 per cent. Yet when the Labor Party came to government the inflation rate was just over 4 per cent. Before the Labor Party came to government it said, when questioning the Government of those days about inflation, that it was the responsibility of government to overcome inflation. Today, when the present Government is questioned about the increased rate of inflation, it says: 'It is a world problem. What are we to do about it? How can we act?' The Government has no answer at all to this problem. </para>
          <para>The strike situation in this country has been crippling industry and disrupting essential services, and all this has been done with the Government's encouragement. That is a great thing, is it not? I have said already the interest rates applying at present are the highest that this country has ever known. Before coming to power the Labor Party said that as a government it would reduce interest rates for the people of this country. The housing situation is hopeless. The Labor Government said that it would house the people of this country, but we find today that a young couple trying to set up a home have to pay more and more to do so as the days go by. Why has this situation been brought about? It has been brought about because of the crippling rates of interest and the inflation in this country. </para>
          <para>Let us have a look at defence. Today we heard the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Bishop),</inline> who represents in this chamber the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard),</inline> talking about what the Government has done for the defence of this country. He spoke about how the Government has increased the pay and allowances of servicemen. I ask the Minister whether there were not four or five Kerr reports. Did this Government accept the recommendations contained in the Kerr reports, or were those recommendations accepted by the previous Government? The Minister does not mention that. He talks about how the Minister for Defence went to America and saved $30m. Let me remind the Minister that all Ministers for Defence in the previous Government indicated, when answering questions, that when the final cost of the Fill project was arrived at- and it could not be arrived at until the aircraft came to Australia- there had to be an accounting between the Australian authorities and the American authorities, and it was believed that that accounting would be in our favour. This great saving that the Minister for Defence obtained on his trip to America is the result of the difference in the 2 accounting systems. Or is the Minister going to tell me that the Government has obtained a $30m saving in the cost of the aircraft and that we can expect a further refund because of the difference in the 2 accounting systems? I expect the Minister to tell us any day now how the Government achieved this saving. </para>

              <para>- Well, I do not know. I have mentioned some of the deficiencies that we have found in this Government's handling of the economic situation in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition mentioned such shameless situations as the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation affair which we debated in this chamber, the siege which took place at the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and, lastly, the Gair affair. I do not want to mention those matters again, but I believe that all of the things that have been mentioned here give the Opposition every justification for taking the extreme measure that it is taking. My colleagues in the Country Party and I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. </para>

            <para>- The Australian Democratic Labor Party will vote against Supply. We disregard the contention of some speakers on the Government side that there is some constitutional reason, some traditional reason, why an Upper House should not vote against Supply. The principle upon which these complainants act comes from Great Britain, and it was based on the fact that the House of Lords was not an elective House and that therefore it should not thwart. the will of the elected House of the people. That tradition was brought to Australia because in most, if not all, cases the Upper Houses were Houses of property and again it was contended that the Houses of property should not thwart the will of the fully elected Houses. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The founders of our Constitution realised that that principle did not apply in the case of the Senate, which is just as much a House of democracy as is the House of Representatives. They included in the Constitution a provision which permits us to take the action we propose to take tonight. They would not have put that provision in the Constitution had they felt that it ought not to have been availed of. In this place I have listened to eloquent defences by the present Attorney-General and Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> of the right of the Senate to take action on money Bills. I pay tribute to him for that defence of the rights of the Senate, a defence of the rights of the Senate which did not please his leader in another place, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam).</inline> The Prime Minister used that defence as the occasion for rebuking <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> because he said that the Constitution permitted us to do what we propose tonight. </para>
          <para>The attitude of my Party is that an election must be held on the issue of whether all power shall go to Canberra. That is the issue of the election. It is whether all power shall go to Canberra and whether supreme power over State rights, family rights, workers rights and every other right in the community shall be dominated by Canberra and the bureaucracy. The Australian people are not fertile soil for ideas that their country shall be dominated by an executive Cabinet and also by a bureaucracy. If this is the issue of the election- I believe that it will be- I have no doubt as to its result. The necessity to take this action was triggered off because the Government embarked upon a course of bribery and corruption to obtain control of the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">There can be no exception taken to your acceptance of the post if you take it after the Senate election when it will not affect the standing of the Parties'. He said to me: 'Whitlam made it clear that the job was available only if I resigned at such a time that he would be able to have an election in Queensland for 6 senators'. I challenge any honourable senator opposite to deny that that was corrupt and was a bribe. The man who offered it is guilty. </para>
          <para>I refer to the standard work on Senate practice in this country, Jr. Odgers' 'Australian Senate Practice', fourth edition, which states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As far back as 1695 the House of Commons resolved that The offer of money or other advantage to a member of Parliament for the promoting of any matter whatsoever depending or to be transacted in Parliament is a high crime and misdemeanour'. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Therefore, I say without hesitation that the Prime Minister of this country is guilty of high crime and misdemeanour. He is unfit to be Prime Minister and the country must be given the opportunity to remove him from office. </para>
          <para>What are the means that have been adopted to gain control of the Senate? They are means which make it essential that we should take action here and now to stop what has been, as I have said before, a course of bribery and corruption for the purpose of obtaining parliamentary power. We all know of the offers of diplomatic posts and trips abroad that have been dangled in front of honourable senators who it was thought could be influenced. We know of the positions which have been dangled in front of honourable senators with a view to influencing their votes. In another direction, we know of the attempt to bring in a system under which the Commonwealth could make available to local governments sums of money for expenditure as the Commonwealth determined. That represented an obvious attempt to set up a system of bribery under which the people in those electorates who were prepared to vote for the Labor Party would receive the cream and those who did not vote for the Labor Party would not. 1 point to what has happened in the western suburbs of Melbourne. This is an area dominated by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr J.</inline> F. Cairns, an area in which obviously Labor voters are to be found in larger numbers than elsewhere. An organisation has been set up and funds and other things have been provided for this organisation. A former member of Parliament who will be a candidate at the next election and a relative of the Minister have been placed in charge of this organisation which can make arrangements for large amounts of finance to be made available and patronage to be given in that area. </para>
          <para>I want to say this: There were disadvantages for my Party to take the course that it will take. But it was necessary to take action before this system of bribery and corruption could achieve its purpose. One has only to look at the set-up and at the series of Electoral Bills which have already been introduced by this Government and which are to be submitted to the people following a victory in the election, if the Labor Party achieves that victory. It has been said that the Government will alter the preferential system of voting in a way which will aid the Labor Party by introducing a first past the post system or an optional preferential system. Therefore, the Labor Party proposes to alter the electoral system to ensure that it retains office. It will then propose a system under which the number of people, not the number of voters, in each electorate shall be the same. The Labor Party is aware that the figures show that in Labor Party held electorates the number of children is infinitely greater than in Liberal Party or non-Labor Party held electorates. Therefore, the Labor Party proposes to initiate an electoral system, if it wins this election, under which a vote cast in a Labor Party electorate will carry with it infinite advantages over a vote cast in a Liberal electorate. So we have a complete system of corruption designed to get control of the Senate as it now is and, in the offing, we have proposals to alter the electoral system to ensure that if the Labor Party cannot get its way by bribery, it will get its way by altering the electoral system in a way which is a gerrymander and an insult to democracy. </para>
          <para>Finally, what are the members of the Labor Party proposing? They dislike small parties. They have made arrangements with the Australia Party that it will direct its preferences any way that the Labor Party asks for the purpose of destroying the Australian Democratic Labor Party. They are making arrangements, if they can, with other parties. What they have in design is this: They will make it very difficult for the small parties, for a start, by substantially increasing the deposit required by a candidate to stand for Parliament and by substantially increasing the percentage of the vote necessary for a candidate to retain his deposit. In other words, with this Government, electoral justice goes out the door. There is a bid for power, naked and unashamed in Canberra, bolstered up by a system of bribery, corruption and patronage and bolstered up by a deliberate design to alter the electoral system to benefit themselves. </para>
          <para>I repeat: This election must be fought on one issue- the issue of all power to Canberra, the issue of the defence of the rights of the States, the defence of the rights of the family and the defence of all the other rights which are essential in any community such as ours. I regard this Government as an authoritarian Government which has been kept in check to date only by the power of the Senate. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> spoke in Hobart he said that the big obstacle in the way of his plans for power was the DLP in the Senate. He said that in this election there would be a campaign by the Labor Party to destroy the DLP. He said at the Conference of his Party in Melbourne that the DLP was the obstacle to his plans and that it must be destroyed. He has made an agreement with the millionaire hobbyist who controls the Australia Party, so that whatever way the ALP asks that Party to direct its preferences, it will do what it is told. I say again: This Government is a Government of corruption and authoritarianism. I repeat the words, which I quoted only a few days ago, of Cromwell when he marched into Parliament. He pointed to the members and said: 'You have been here too long for any good that you do. In the name of God, go'- </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>what is happening in this chamber today is what has been happening over the period of office of almost 18 months of this Government; the Opposition is putting in question and undermining not merely the Government but the system of government in Australia. The Australian Country Party, the Liberal Party and the Australian Democratic Labor Party went to an election in 1972 and they were defeated. The Australian people accepted the program which was put before them by the Australian Labor Party. The Opposition parties would not accept the verdict of the people, and we have seen during the last 18 months that again and again they have endeavoured to frustrate the Government by defeating important parts of the Government's legislation, because they simply will not accept the system of government that prevails. After 23 years- and they had their own way during that time- it was time that the people were entitled to have a new government carry out its policies which had been carefully formulated, widely publicised and accepted by the people. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Some honourable senators opposite think that they have some divine right to govern and that when they are not in government they have some divine right to prevent those who are in government from governing. There is no such right. When the Prime Minister of Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> put to the people that we would have a national health insurance scheme and set out the details of that scheme, the people were entitled to have the Government enact the legislation to implement those promises. When we said that we would bring the petroleum and mineral resources of Australia under proper governmental control and regulation in the interests of the people, the people were entitled to have the Parliament implement the policies that were put to them by the Government, but those in the Opposition felt that they would deny that right. We turn to smaller matters, such as the Superior Court Bill which had been proposed in the first instance by those in the Opposition and which was a specific part of the Australian Labor Party's policy at the election. We find that honourable senators opposite would not allow even that Bill to go into the Committee stage; they would not even give it a second reading in this chamber a week or so ago. </para>
          <para>I turn to trade practices. Here is a subject matter which is the concern of everyone in Australia. These trade practices had been exposed early in the 1960's by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick, by royal commissions and by all sorts of investigations. It was agreed on all hands that those trade practices were pernicious, that they were a potent factor in the inflation which was occurring in the country and that legislative measures were necessary against them. One of the sorriest passages in our history is the way in which the great pressure groups were able to prevent the LiberalCountry Party Government from bringing in any effective legislation. Yet when our Party spelled out before the last election the kind of legislation that we would bring in- at the election we promised to bring it in and got the endorsement of the people and brought it in, what have we seen? We have the situation where in September of last year trade practices legislation was introduced and this Senate refused even to consider it. The legislation was introduced again into the House of Representatives, it was introduced into this chamber and again the Senate refused to consider it. </para>
          <para>We brought the trade practices legislation in after saying that we would listen to every interest in the community. I personally offered the members of the Democratic Labor Party the assistance of departmental officers in confidence to give them any kind of assistance that they required over the whole of the vacation period. Throughout industry and commerce suggestions were made which did not touch the basic principles of the Bill. Every one of those suggestions was listened to and a large number of minor amendments were put forward. A lawyer could have gone through those amendments in two or three hours and understood them, as they did; they were able to discuss them in learned articles. We circulated the amendments and we came into this chamber and put the amendments to the Senate. What do we find now? After all this time an endeavour has been made- and honourable senators can see this on the front of the notice paper- not to have the legislation debated, but to have it put over until some time after April, meaning in the context of our program that it would not be dealt with in the first half of this year. </para>
          <para>Whose interest was that serving? It was serving those who are perpetrating these rackets, those who were feeding the inflation by getting money unfairly from the people by all sorts of restrictive schemes and price-fixing arrangements. The consumers were being left unprotected. Why? It was because of the action of the Opposition parties. Every day that they were able to delay the introduction of effective laws meant that millions of dollars were going into the pockets of those who were operating these practices at the expense of the consumers. Why? It was because honourable senators opposite are only the puppets of those outside who are operating these rackets against the community. </para>
          <para>We have heard what has been said by the Leader of the Opposition in the other place <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden).</inline> He said it publicly. He has given an indication that the Opposition does not want what the Australian Labor Government has been doing. Members of the Opposition do not want welfare schemes. They do not want money being spent on health and education in a myriad of ways in order to overcome 23 years of neglect. They do not want full employment. They do not want the prosperity that exists in Australia. Their answer to what the Labor Party is doing is to say: Let us have a credit squeeze. Let us have a pool of unemployment', or to put forward the absurd nonsense that there should be some voluntary price restraint for 3 months. We know what was done in this community before the Prices Justification Tribunal was set up. Right throughout the community the great corporations raised their prices in anticipation. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators opposite serve the interests not merely of ordinary business but of the great corporations which dominate this community by their economic power. Therefore, when the Opposition is in power these great corporations hold the economic power in this community. Each member of the Opposition knows it. We have the first taste of it here. They are not concerned about the fact that refusing Supply will mean that social services will be cut back, that repatriation pensions will not be paid, that the money set aside for overseas aid will not be provided, that widows and other dependants will suffer and that public servants will not be paid. This is only a small taste of what the community will get if Snedden is able to have his way; but he will not get his way. </para>
          <para>We have before us a measure for the provision of urgent Supply. In the House of Representatives Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and Appropriation Bill (No. 5) were opposed by the Opposition Parties. Appropriation Bill (No. 3), which has been here for some little time, was not opposed there, I understand; but it is opposed here now in the Senate. Instead of outright opposition to the Bills, which one could understand, we have this schoolboy trick on the part of the Leader of the Opposition of moving an amendment to the motion. Instead of saying directly, honestly and straightforwardly what the Opposition has in mind, Opposition members are trying, by some hypocritical device, to stand over the Prime Minister of the country and to say that they will not debate this measure now and they will do so at a later hour of the day only if the Prime Minister agrees to submit himself in some way. What kind of nonsense is this? We know what the Opposition did in the House of Representatives and we know what it intends to do here. In no way will the Opposition escape the consequences of a refusal to give Supply. So that the Opposition's device will be exposed and the Opposition will not be able to rely on that device, I intend to take certain action. The position is that a number of Bills have been dealt with by the Senate after they have been passed twice by the House of Representatives, with the interval of 3 months which is referred to in section 57, and the Senate has rejected or failed to pass those Bills. Therefore, the Government is entitled to a double dissolution if  His Excellency  the Governor-General takes the view that there ought to be one. </para>
          <para>There are other measures in respect of which manifestly the Opposition has obstructed the Government in carrying out the policies which it put forward in the last election campaign and undertook to implement. On top of that, the Opposition again and again has made threats, both inside and outside both Houses of the Parliament, about refusing supply. No government can be subjected to this kind of blackmail whereby an Opposition says, not on account of any principle but simply because it suits it at the particular time, that it is going to drive the Government to a dissolution and then try to escape the consequences itself. The Government, aware of this, has kept the position that if the Senate Opposition were foolish enough to undertake that action the Government would be able to drive it to a double dissolution. That stage has been reached and any endeavour by Opposition senators to avoid it, by having some kind of slick motion passed which will say that they are not really refusing Supply but are asking that it be deferred conditionally upon the Prime Minister agreeing to submit to a dissolution, will not be tolerated. In order to precipitate this position it is clear that the Opposition again, by this ridiculous and hypocritical device, is endeavouring to avoid voting on the measure. This absurd device relates to when the debate should be undertaken. One can understand why members of the Opposition have undertaken this course. They sit back there and think about how they can salvage their consciences and how they can vote on these measures in some way that will enable them to pretend that they did not really refuse Supply. They have come up with this absurd amendment. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>to put an end to this matter I will tell you that I intend to move 'That the question be now put'. If that motion is defeated, the Government will treat that as a denial of Supply. If that motion is carried and this absurd amendment is carried, the Government will treat that also as a denial of Supply. In either event the Prime Minister of Australia, who is conversant with the absurd proposition which has been put here, will call forthwith upon  His Excellency  the Governor-General and tender him certain advice not only in regard to the denial of Supply but also in regard to certain other measures to which I have referred. Therefore, I move: </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- It should not be forgotten by this Senate or by the people of this country what the Senate is determined to do: That is, to invite the people of this country to express their judgment upon the performance of this Government in the 16 months that it has been in office. We do not shirk from taking that challenge and giving the people of Australia the opportunity to vote upon the question. No matter what sophistry, legalisms or deceptions the Attorney-General of this country <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> is prepared to practise, we shall not be dissuaded from the task which we have set ourselves. The Attorney-General said in the early pan of his speech that we were denying the verdict of the people which was given in December 1972. We in the Opposition rebut that allegation. But if it be thought that the allegation does have substance, let the people be asked to give their verdict again. That is the purpose of what we are doing. It ought to be recalled that when in the House of Representatives the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden,</inline> first spoke on this Bill, he said the Opposition would oppose it because if the Opposition were successful it would mean that the Government would have to go to the people and face an election. He said that if in the Senate the Appropriation Bill was denied, then after the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> had indicated that he was prepared to face on election, we would pass the Bill forthwith to ensure that the moneys were granted by the Parliament. That is the position in which we are now situated. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>After the course which the Opposition is following was made clear, the Prime Minister, in his accustomed manner, sought to have it both ways. He threatened a double dissolution. How many times had he threatened it in the past and never carried out his threat? Throughout last week newspaper headlines have been full of the Prime Minister's assurances, promises and intentions that he would not wait for the Senate to reject Supply; he would go the Governor-General and ask for a double dissolution. We have facilitated the steps by which he could go to the Governor-General. Yesterday, with full knowledge of what the decision meant, the Opposition Parties in this Senate rejected for the second time within 3 months the health Bills and thereby gave unchallengeable constitutional grounds for the Government to seek its double dissolution. Why did the Government wait until we had indicated our attitude on those Bills before it brought the Appropriation Bills into this Senate? The Appropriation Bills have been in the House of Representatives for well over a week. They could have come here at any stage within the last 7 days but they did not come here within that period for the obvious reason that the Government desired to have its grounds for a double dissolution clearly established. </para>
          <para>The grounds are now clearly established. This Bill is before the Senate and the Opposition has clearly indicated by the terms of its amendment that when the Prime Minister announces that he has secured the double dissolution for which he is looking it will give consideration to these Appropriation Bills and will pass them. But the amendment is designed to ensure that there is an election. Why should anybody challenge the action of a democratically elected chamber if the result of its action is to ensure that the verdict of the ultimate judges, namely the electors, is thereby secured? That surely is what representative democracy is essentially concerned with. The right of the Senate to reject a Bill ought not to be questioned. The Constitution gives that right to the Senate. When the Constitution was established over 70 years ago, two of those who established it- the 2 persons to whom I refer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran, were intimately involved with the writing- said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Senate has co-ordinated power with the House of Representatives to pass all Bills or to reject all Bills. Its right of veto is as unqualified as its right of assent. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That view is a view which the Attorney-General of this Commonwealth, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy-</inline> a leader in the Labor Party- asserted in this chamber when he was in Opposition. Indeed he tabled in this chamber a list of 168 measures in which he asserted the Labor Party had given expression to that principle. In Victoria in 1952 the Labor Party actually acted upon the principle and sent a government to the people. In 1965 it threatened to do the same thing, and it secured its objective by reason of the government complying with its wishes. When a democratically elected chamber does it, and when it will submit itself to the people to have its conduct judged, why should any democrat cavil at what is being done? Those who would deny to the Senate the right to act as we are now doing have some fear for themselves of the voice of the people. If our democracy is to be meaningful let us use as many opportunities as will present themselves to let the people have their say. This is the direct consequence of what we are doing. </para>
          <para>Why, essentially, is the Opposition in this Senate taking the whole of the Parliament to the people? Why is every Opposition senator in this place prepared to put to the people the seat of every- senator and the seat of every person in the House of Representatives? I say simply it is because we in the Opposition parties believe that the people ought to be given the opportunity to make the choice whether they want the Liberal way or the Labor way. People have had a fair experience with the Liberal way because for 23 years Liberal-Country Party Governments in this country created a climate in which every individual was able to lead a meaningful life, an improving life, a life in which he was getting more than he might have got in any other country. He was living in a prosperous, affluent and free country, the like of which was the envy, I believe, of people in every country throughout the world. Whatever drawbacks might have been pointed at the Government in this country over those years, for 23 years it was sustained. I use that point merely to say that people have had some experience of what that Government was. </para>
          <para>In 1972, under the charm and the attraction of a slogan which in itself promised no policy but simply said 'It's Time', the people made a change. They were entitled to make their change. But we have seen 16 months of dismal performance and we on this side of the House believe that the people ought to have a choice as to whether they will continue on the line they have been shown. We in the Liberal Party believe that the path Australia is now moving along is a path fraught with peril. We cannot see what the end will be. Are we to have an inflation rate in this country of 14, 15 or 16 per cent each year and a Treasurer who says that that is tolerable? What will be the position if we are to have tax rates so that if one is kept abreast of inflation one has to have a 25 per cent increase in salary in order that one's real purchasing power is maintained at the same value it was when the year began? That is the situation that we are in in this country. The Fabian Treasurer of the Labor Party believes that this is tolerable and that this country can sustain this position, but I believe that he is leading this country on the path to ultimate certain disaster. </para>
          <para>We believe that the people of Australia ought to be able to hear what we have to say and ought to be able to make the decision whether they want to go along that path. We will do our utmost to ensure that we get Australia back to a level on which people 's purchasing power will be meaningful so that the person who receives a pension, a person who is on a fixed income and those who have not got the ability to act for themselves, as is always the case with a few people, will at least be protected in what they have and what they aspire to. We will look to see that people when they engage in activities, employment and business are able to reap and enjoy the benefits of their labour and efforts. They cannot at the moment see what their prospects are. We believe that in this country, which has the greatest rate of home ownership in the world, people should be able to buy their own homes and contemplate that they have the basic deposit, that they have the ability throughout life to pay off the asset and to be able to give something to their children when they die. If this is the type of conservative outdated ambition which is so often castigated and criticised by the Labor Party, I and the Liberal Party believe that this is what most people in this country feel they ought to be able to secure. It is the sort of objective which we have. </para>
          <para>What we have seen over the past 16 months is uncontrolled inflation, excessive tax burdens, unacceptable interest rates- the highest interest rates we have ever had in this country- under a Labor Party Government, the so-called workers' Government, which said that it would do its utmost deliberately to bring down interest rates. What do we have? We have interest rates at an unacceptable high level. We have critical shortages. I do not know how many people care to read the finer print in the newspapers, but only last Saturday in the 'Australian' I noticed on page 3 that washing machines and refrigerators are in short supply. There are so many items of ordinary every day use which are in short supply. We find this day in and day out. If we talk to our wives and our children we find that there are so many things that we want but cannot get. The last I heard was that even shoe laces were in short supply. All this is happening in the sort of society which the Labor Party has created. </para>

          <para class="block">The Prices Justification Tribunal is so busy approving price increases that it cannot keep abreast of all the applications that are being made. This is the situation which we are in at the moment. We have had the experience of spiralling housing costs, over-expansion of the public sector, unnecessarily rapid growth- enormous growth- in the Public Service and, alarmingly, we have a lack of defence preparedness. Is it any wonder that we in the Liberal Party feel that the people of Australia ought to be given the choice as to which government they prefer? </para>
          <para>What has precipitated this action being taken at this stage? It is the final culminating act in a series of deceptions, misrepresentations and untruths which, I think, has plumbed the depths of political cynicism. We have a Prime Minister and a Government to whom principles, truth and morality are of secondary importance. We have seen at first hand in this chamber an Attorney-General who conducts a raid on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and who to this day has not explained what it was that prompted the initial raid. We had him introducing divorce rules, briefing barristers, concealing facts and finally saying what has been abundantly clear when there have been inquiries about the reasons for these matters: 'It is none of your business'. We have a Prime Minister of whom it may properly be said, as he said of his predecessor, that he is a person who has lowered the standing and standards of the Parliament, the probity, integrity and responsibility of Australian public life. I say to the Prime minister what he himself said of his predecessor. These are the words he used in the House of Representatives in February 1972. They apply to him in real measure: </para>

            <para>The present Prime Minister believes that he can get away with anything because of his great office. He never saw <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies contradicted or exposed and he thinks immunity goes with the office. He believes that citizens or colleagues will never contradict or expose him even if his misstatements damage their interests or their reputations or the country 's interest or reputation. </para>

          <para class="block">What have we received from the Prime Minister? My Leader, when he introduced this amendment, gave the list of broken promises as taken from the policy speech of the Prime Minister. But what are the statements which the Prime Minister has made- not casual slips of the tongue but quite deliberate statements of which truth is no part. I recall when the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia was here at a formal dinner our Prime Minister said: 'I have to state as a cold fact that every known act of grave violence on political grounds perpetrated in Australia in recent years has come from the extremist right.' This is a totally unsubstantiated statement and one which cannot be substantiated. We know, and during the time that I was Attorney-General I knew, of the damage which was done to properties through sources which, however unidentifiable they were, were clearly not of the extremist right. I speak of such damage as was done to the Honeywell Australian General Electric premises and hosts of others. When the Prime Minister is asked a question about the basis for his statements, and a question is asked on notice, he delays for 3 months and then refuses to answer the question. He stated in an address to a formal dinner of the Chamber of Manufactures: 'The facts remain today that the true party of competition, of modernisation, of freer trade, even perhaps of free enterprise in its most genuine sense, is the Labor Party.' Who does he think he can persuade? This is the same Prime Minister who today acknowledged in the Parliament quite proudly that his Party stands for the socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange? He went on to say: 'And also for the nationalisation of a host of industries ranging from banking to transport and any other anticompetitive business monopoly. ' </para>

              <para>- Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I had been instancing why it was that the Opposition parties felt that it was time for the people of Australia to be given the opportunity to express their verdict on the performance of this Government. I had said that my leader, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers),</inline> had instanced from the policy speech the promises which had been made and the promises which had been broken. I had been instancing some of the cold calculated statements made by the Prime Minister of this country which were demonstrably false. I had been using those examples because we have a Government, a Ministry, to which truth is relatively meaningless. If political advantage is sought it does not matter what the truth is. It does not matter what the facts are. One could illustrate that by a host of examples. A number of those examples have been given in recent times. </para>

          <para>As I said, the highlight of this whole charade came with the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gairprobably</inline> the most bitter political opponent which the Labor Party and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> have had- to the position of one of this country's ambassadors. That was bad enough. But I think what sickened me most of all was the way in which, after the whole question was exposed and the infamy of the appointment revealed, there was an attempt at concealment, at lying in an endeavour to make the facts fit the legal situation, which indicated what little regard for probity and morality this Government has. It is not only that which is objectionable. It is the way in which the Senate's position has been misrepresented over the months. I have here a record of the Press statement which the Prime Minister made on Monday of this week. It is the Press conference at Parliament House on 8 April 1974. The Prime Minister castigated the Senate. What did he say? I think it is useful to look at this statement because it indicates the way in which he is prepared to say virtually anything to gain some political advantage. I only hope that the people of Australia know that we have a Prime Minister who will stop at nothing in order to get his own political advantage made. For example, he said: </para>

          <para>Referring to the Opposition Parties-  have prevented us introducing universal health insurance. </para>
          <para class="block">It is a fact that we have. We decided to vote against the Bills last November and we voted against them again yesterday. The reason we did so is that we believe the present health insurance which is based upon the principle of choice, the right to choose your own doctor and your own hospital and to insure so that you can meet costs, is a far better system than one in which compulsion and the one service of a government health scheme is the epitome. We then have the Prime Minister saying: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>They have prevented us enacting industrial legislation designed to reduce industrial disputes. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>What a farce that statement is. The legislation introduced last year which we in the Opposition opposed was legislation which said: 'Let us do away with fines altogether. Let us give collective bargaining an open go. Let us allow the power of the unions to be able to determine what shall be the result in any industrial disputation. It does not matter what the inconvenience to the public might be.' We in the Opposition voted against such a proposal. The Prime Minister went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>They have held up our legislation on restrictive trade practices and monopolies and consumer protection. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What I have said about that matter I repeat. The present Attorney-General, as the Minister in charge of this legislation, has set back the course of effective, strengthened trade practices legislation by 3 years by the course he has followed. If he was genuine he would have accepted our proposals, which we initiated in government, and legislated for them as soon as the Labor Party came into power. We had introduced the Bills in the month before we went out of office and obviously we were committed to support them. The Attorney-General was not prepared to accept those measures. He waited virtually a year and then introduced his own proposals. If they are ever to be effective and ever to pass this Parliament it will be a year or two hence. I say that the Attorney-General and the present Government have been responsible for any defects they  see in our existing legislation. Of course the Prime Minister instances a host of other matters. </para>
          <para>These are questions of course in which we have a point of view and the Government has a point of view. I think people appreciate that this is what politics are involved with. All that I think should be said, because it is important to make the point and to make the point stick, is that the Opposition has said, on each of the occasions when it has voted against these matters which the Government has said have been important matters, that we are prepared to go to the people and to let the people judge whether we are right or the Government is right. These decisions which we have made as an opposition have not been callous decisions exercising a majority which we have here, simply for the sake of exercising that majority. We are as concerned as anyone else in Australia to have the best sort of Australia that we can. We feel that these are sufficiently important matters to give the people of Australia a chance to determine and to vote on. That is the issue which is before us now. </para>
          <para>May I recapitulate to make the point abundantly clear. The Prime Minister, for over 12 months, has been threatening the Senate with a double dissolution. We, from the Opposition, have been saying: 'If you want a double dissolution we are prepared to have one'. But the Prime Minister has refused time and time again when he has had the opportunity to ask for that double dissolution which would involve an election. The last time he did so was within the last week. The course which we have followed is a course which puts the ball directly in the Prime Minister's court. He could ask for a double dissolution and we will welcome it. We believe that the people of Australia should have the opportunity of saying whether' they want to go further down this perilous path along which the Labor Party is leading us or whether they want to look ahead to that light which is the ultimate achievement of those who will follow- the Liberal Party. I stand, as do all my colleagues, behind a Liberal Party which does believe in individual freedom, which does believe in the opportunity of every individual to make his own life in his own way so long as he does not offend or deny to others the rights which he claims to himself and who seeks to ensure that this will be a self-reliant nation in which individuals will be proud of. themselves and their achievements and proud of what the nation, as a nation, has achieved. This is what we, as Liberals, endeavoured to establish over some 23 years. </para>
          <para>I believe that when the people are given the chance to say whether they will go ahead with a Liberal government of the character which I have outlined or go further downhill with an irresponsible, corrupt and authoritarian Government which this Government has displayed itself to be, I know what their decision will be. Tonight we are giving the people the opportunity to decide. </para>

However, I shall refer briefly to a matter about which he is quite- if I may use a word which has been alleged to be a favourite of mine- paranoid: The suggestion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy's</inline> performances in relation to the Croats were in some way reprehensible and that this is to be counted against this Government when it is being judged by the people. I would like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> to contemplate this one point which has been made very frequently in the last few days. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> made his historic disclosures on, I think, 14 March last year. I ask honourable senators to think: One of the consequences of those disclosures is that no bombs have gone off in the ensuing year. </para>

These gentlemen opposite- the geese to whom you have referred, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Presidentrealise</inline> the folly of the course of events which they have set in train. Tonight they indicate that they are a very glum and gloomy lot. As 1 look around this chamber I am persuaded that the gentlemen on the opposite side realise that they will stay on the opposite side. They regret the rashness which let their stodgy, mediocre leader, the Leader of the Liberal Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden),</inline> into being pushed into this precipitate action by the ambitious and much tougher leader of the Australian Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony),</inline> who I am afraid will turn out to be the real leader in the campaign which we have ahead of us. </para>

              <para>-No, that is not the way we are going to campaign. It is the way you are going to campaign. It is very interesting to see the alleged charismatic Leader of the Country Party looming up with his little innocent boy smile, which is really much more like the smile on the face of the tiger if one looks at it closely. Behind him is what looks like a little lap dog. He happens to be the aspirant for the leadership of this country, the leader of honourable senators opposite, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden.</inline> If we are to have any sort of foretaste of what is ahead of us I think that honourable senators opposite should feel very uncomfortable. It so happens that I was down near the door of Parliament House yesterday when the Leader of honourable senators opposite, this man, this little mediocrity who aspires to be the Prime Minister of Australia, was cornered near the front door of Parliament House. </para>

              <para>-To buy? I think that the DLP would be wise not to stress that point at all. What are honourable senators doing? They are denigrating a man whom they put forward to this country as a worthy leader of a party, a man with the loftiest moral principles. But what are they telling us now? They are telling us that throughout that period they had been sold a pup, that this was not really the quality of this man. </para>

I shall refer to the catalogue of alleged shortcomings which we got from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> when he was talking about the Government's 30 broken promises. Surely the public of Australia will not be fooled into thinking that what has been frustrated in this place is to be classified as a broken promise? We came here with the Trade Practices Bill as we promised. We were not allowed to pass it. We come in with the Superior Court of Australia Bill. That also has been swept under the rug. As to the Bill for the implementation of human rights which have been accepted by the United Nations, even though it has not been discussed here that great upholder of law and order, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> indicated in advance that it also would be opposed. So to suggest that we have broken our promise is the greatest travesty of the truth that one could imagine. To be accused of not keeping our promise when the Opposition in the Senate has dedicated all its endeavours to seeing that we are not able to pass the Bills which we have introduced into this Parliament is the greatest messing around with language that I can imagine. One of the oddest things of all about the debate is the suggestion that we are a devious government which trifles with the truth. </para>

              <para>- It is very easy to handle. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> suggested that this Government is a devious one. But when it comes to dealing with a couple of Supply Bills this honest straightforward Opposition, this Opposition which eschews and deplores deviousness, is not even game to advocate straightforwardly and honestly in the chamber the refusal of Supply. It moves an amendment which is designed to dodge the awesome responsibility which it knows it has if it denies Supply. The amendment is an attempt to persuade the people of Australia that it did not deny Supply. I suggest that it will not fool anybody. I will not go through the tedious detail of the amendment, but if anybody imagines that it had any purpose other than to deny Supply I suggest that he does not understand the meaning of words. </para>

There is nothing we want more. There will be no quibbling about this. When the chips are down the people of Australia will understand that we gladly accept the challenge to go to the country, because this election is not about this piddling quibbling amendment. The election is about whether the people of Australia, who elected a government on 2 December 1972 to fulfil a certain program, wish to see that Government have the opportunity to fulfil its program. The idea that this has not been a frustrating Senate and an obstructing Senate is a totally untenable idea. The figures prove that almost 80 per cent of the motions which have come before the Senate have been resolved in favour of the Opposition. </para>

              <para>- It is very reassuring to find that devotion to the truth comes naturally to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott.</inline> I accept his withdrawal in the spirit in which it was given. I would suggest to honourable senators opposite who gather any comfort from the present political situation that they should examine the conflicting statements which have been made by the junior and senior partners in their coalition in the last couple of days. Their proposition is that the great problem confronting the country is inflation. There can be no argument about that. We accept that proposition. It is only when we look at their proposals for the solution of this problem that the sheer vapidity and flaccidity of the Opposition becomes obvious. On the one hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> who, I suppose, according to the Liberals, is the putative Treasurer suggests that there should be a $600m tax concession to people in certain brackets. If we can plough our way through the turgid prose of the putative Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden,</inline> there is a sort of reluctant, half hearted and mixed up agreement with that proposition. But another man who considers that he will have impeccable credentials for the position of Treasurer, the alleged charismatic Leader of the Country Party, the junior or is it the senior partner in the coalition, says that he does not agree with this proposition. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>So what we have been given so far by way of policy from the people who aspire to return to the Treasury benches on which they loafed for 23 years is a very conflicting picture. We have as a recipe for the solution of inflation from the would-be Prime Minister, firstly, the injection of another $600m into the purchasing power of the community. That is an odd recipe for a cure for demand inflation. We have a suggestion that more money should be spent on defence. Where is that to come from? That question was asked by one of the commentators in this morning's Press. There is a variant on the old question: Where is the money coming from? The new variation of that is: Who is the money to be taken from? So we have totally conflicting versions of an answer to this problem coming from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden, Mr Lynch</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony.</inline> There is not much doubt that their Leader is so stodgy and so unappealing that a man who is thought to have more appeal- the representative of Gunns' Gully. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony-</inline> will be pushed forward as the real leader in this coalition. He will give us a return to pork barrel politics, a demand for the restoration of all the bounties which, I suggest, is in great conflict with the propositions which are put forward by the junior partner, the Liberal Party, to give relief from taxation and at the same time to spend more money on defence. </para>
          <para>So the foretaste which we have had over the last couple of days, I suggest, is the real explanation of the glumness that we see on the faces of honourable senators opposite. I have no doubt that if they could have it all over again they would not have pitchforked themselves into a struggle which, on all the indications, will be fatal to them. That goes especially for the DLP. I have a certain grudging regard for some of the people opposite who have been here for some time, and I think it is quite clear that what we are witnessing, among other things, are the death throes of the DLP as a political identity in this country. I think it is welcomed that the DLP is about to disappear from the Australian political scene. </para>

              <para>- I am afraid that the bell is finally tolling. If one good thing emerges from this election it will be the disappearance of a party which has been an excrescence on the body politic in this country for so many years. Although I feel supremely confident that as a result of this constitutional turmoil we will get a government which will have not only a majority in the House of Representatives but also in the Senate, we will also have a simplification and a cleansing of Australian politics by the disappearance of this Party which I believe has for so long been a blot on Australian politics. </para>

No one will argue with the constitutional provisions, and I will come back to them later. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> is, I understand, toying with the idea of having a double dissolution. This was mentioned a little earlier in this debate. He is very found of likening himself to Napoleon, for some reason which completely escapes me. I recall that, when it was announced that the date of the last Federal election would be 2 December, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> said that that suited him because that was the date on which Napoleon overcame a ramshackle coalition at Austerlitz. Of course, what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> had forgotten was that, despite Austerlitz, it was the - </para>

Only the Senate has prevented a total dictatorship from existing in this country. I remind you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that in fact it was the Russians who prepared the downfall of Napoleon in 1 8 1 2, and it could well be the Russians and their desire to set up a base in Australia in 1974 which will bring about the downfall of this modern Napoleon. We know that Napoleon was destroyed at Waterloo.

          <para>In the circumstances of a certain condition having been attached to the decisions that were communicated, I suggest that it is appropriate that the Senate deal with the business which is before it in the sense of messages that have been received by the Senate. Honourable senators will be aware that there is certain business which ought to be dealt with before the elections. There is the Governor-General Bill 1974 and the matters of Supply, and I understand that the messages have been received. There are certain other matters also. I think we should deal with the flood relief matter and the matter of the distribution of moneys from the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund, which fit in with the message which I have just announced to the Senate. I ask that the Senate proceed in an orderly way to do what the Government has determined ought to be done in the light of the delay and denial by this chamber, as intimated by the vote taken earlier this evening, of the necessary Supply for the Government. Therefore, I suggest that we proceed immediately to deal with the matters which need to be dealt with. If honourable senators wish to pursue other matters or to explain their position, no doubt they will be able to do so by speaking to the motion for the adjournment of the Senate or elsewhere. What has occurred is something which does not happen very often in one's lifetime. I ask that the Senate co-operate to enable us expeditiously to get to the point at which the Parliament, including this half of the Parliament, may proceed to a simultaneous election </para>

            <para>- by leave- I must say, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, how delighted we are that something has happened. Whether the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> jumped or was pushed will be a matter for argument for years to come. The Opposition set upon this course publicly when our Leader, the future Prime Minister of Australia, made a statement last Thursday in the House of Representatives. It has taken some 6 or 7 days to drag these reluctant people opposite to the polls. We have wanted for a long time to go to the polls. We are delighted that we are about to do so. </para>

          <para>Let me now talk about what ought to happen for the remainder of the night. I can understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy's</inline> desire to do certain things, but I think he ought to be a little more frank and outgoing. As I understand it, the Leader of the House in another place <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> just moved that the House of Representatives adjourn until 10.30 a.m. tomorrow. Indeed, I just heard the 3 bells ring for the rising of the House of Representatives. If the House of Representatives is to sit tomorrow, why is not the Senate going to sit tomorrow? I understand that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> has said that he needs to be assured in regard to the 3 Appropriation Bills and the 2 Supply Bills. I take it that the Bills to which he refers are the 3 Appropriation Bills at present before the Senate and the <inline font-style="italic">2</inline> Supply Bills which have now come into the Senate. </para>

              <para>-In addition to that, I can well understand that there are good reasons why 3 other Bills ought to be passed before the Parliament is dissolved. They include the Bill which affects the salary and retiring allowances of the Governor-General. I accede to that. Of course, the flood relief legislation must be passed. As far as I am concerned- I trust that 1 speak on behalf of most if not all of my colleagues- the Bill to distribute the superannuation payments to the Public Service should also be passed, because we are responsible in this direction. I can hear a wind whistling behind me. I suppose that I ought to thank the Senate for allowing me to make this statement because the Leader of the Opposition in another place <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> was denied a like opportunity. I think that this rather points up the difference where one party has too great a majority in one House of the Parliament. I think that the Leader of the Government in the Senate ought to tell us a little bit more. If tonight the Senate passes Appropriation Bills 3, 4 and 5, the 2 Supply Bills, the Governor-General Bill, the flood relief legislation and the Superannuation (Distribution of Surplus) Bill, does the Senate rise tonight and finish its work? I think that we are entitled to have some indication of when the writs will issue, when nominations will close and when the poll will be held. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to walk into another place and throw his weight around. But he is not going to have his will in this place. We ought to be given further and better particulars. The position is as simple as that. We want an election. We have been demanding it, and we have pushed the Government into it. The Governor-General has said that we can have it on terms. We are prepared to grant the terms, but the Government has to come clean with the whole information. I can give an assurance on behalf of the Opposition that if there is a full disclosure, if I may use that term in that sense- </para>

              <para>- Ye sin the legal sense, in the moral sense which is even more important and in the parliamentary sense. There should be full disclosure. We know that the Leader of the Government has said that the Parliament will be prorogued tomorrow. But the Senate this night must comply in regard to the passage of these 8 Bills before it rises. In my view, as far as the Opposition is concerned, it will fulfil those conditions only if and when the Government discloses the date of the issue of the writ, the date of the close of nominations and the date of the poll. Give us full disclosure and the Senate can rise tonight and the Government can have its 8 Bills. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MURPHY</inline>(New South WalesLeader of the Government in the Senate)- by leave- It is interesting to see the arrogance of power. First of all the Opposition refuses to acknowledge what the people have done. During the past 18 months it has tried more and more, and harder and harder, to tell the Government what it is to do and what it is not to do, thereby denying the mandate of the people. Today, when the Government asks for Supply, the Opposition has the impudence to put forward a proposition that it will not even debate the Supply Bills until such time as the Government has agreed to send the House of Representatives to a dissolution at the same time as the forthcoming Senate election. </para><interjection>

              <para>-There is only one forthcoming Senate election- an election for half the members of the Senate. The Opposition says that the members of the House of Representatives must go to an election at the same time as the forthcoming Senate election. That having misfired, and the Government having refused to submit to such dictation from the Opposition, the message of the Governor-General has been announced to this Senate.  His  decision is that on a certain condition there will be a simultaneous dissolution of both Houses of the Parliament. Not half of the Opposition senators will go; the lot of them will go to the next election. </para>

              <para>- You can say that again. The Prime Minister goes to the Governor-General and says: 'I want a double dissolution', and the Governor-General says: 'Yes'. Then the Prime Minister goes into smoke and he says: 'I will now have to look into my crystal ball to find out when I am going to hold the election'. With great respect, this is not boys' week. I say to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, who does not seem interested in my remarks, that this is the Government which came to power on the boast that it was going to give us open government, that nothing was going to be held back, that we were going to hear everything that happened. Then he comes in and says: 'There is going to be an election. We are going to adjourn'. Then he said: 'The Government is going to know when the election is, but the Opposition is not allowed to know it'. Surely we have not reached the stage in a democracy where the Government announces: 'There is going to be an election, but we are not going to tell the Opposition because we want to book all the halls and make all the arrangements first. They are not going to know anything, so that we will get that advantage'. I want to say to my friends in the Government, who may be my ex-friends very shortly - </para>

              <para>- I would merely ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> to talk to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Billy</inline> Brown before he lays any bets on whether I will be back. The other thing that we are told on behalf of the Government is that the Governor-General said that he would grant a double dissolution on condition that the only business dealt with was the business of Supply. The Prime Minister said that. The Leader of the Government has said that we will deal with Supply and a couple of other Bills, too. What is the position in regard to the commission that the Prime Minister has from the Governor-General? He has a commission to have an election on condition that he deals with nothing else but Supply. But the Leader of the Government says, in defiance of the Governor-General's statement: 'I propose to deal with other business '. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>All I want to say is this: My Party is here rearing to go. Bring on the Supply Bills and we will pass them and that will be it. But do not run around saying that the Government is going to have an election and its supporters will know the date but the Opposition will not. Do not tell us that the Government proposes to put through extra business which the Governor-General has said cannot be dealt with. All he said was that the Government can have an election, but it must be on the condition that no other business is dealt with by the Parliament. But the Leader of the Government says: 'Forget the Governor-General, I am going to put through other business.' I have a lot of sympathy for the Governor-General. He deserves sympathy because of the people he has to deal with at the moment. The other day the Government put the Governor-General in the position where he had signed a document appointing a man as an ambassador and he had to sit back while that man came into the Senate and voted on 9 occasions. The Governor-General had to sit back and bear it. I have great sympathy for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Paul</inline> Hasluck. He must look at this Government on occasions and say: 'My God, what am I associated with?' </para>

We on this side of the Senate have seen the arrogance of power for the last 18 months. We have seen the Government come into this chamber and state that it has a mandate from the people to do this and to do whatever it wants to do without any opposition from this side of the chamber. All I want to say to the Leader of the Government is that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> had a mandate to form a government, and that is all he had. The Australian Country Party is willing to support the Government and grant it Supply. Let us get on and do that. </para>

              <para>- I propose that we proceed to deal with the appropriation matters. My understanding is that Appropriation Bill (No. 3), Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and Appropriation Bill (No. 5) ought to be passed in these circumstances; Supply ought to be made available. The flood relief matter should be dealt with, and so also should the matter relating to the distribution of superannuation money. The Government has indicated its views as to what ought to be done. Now that a decision has been made to have a double dissolution, it is necessary that proper arrangements be made for the payment of persons. Whatever might have been the motives which forced us to a denial or postponement of the Appropriation Bills, that ought no longer to be persisted with. I suggest, with great respect, that in the exigencies with which we are faced these measures should be given a speedy passage, as also should the other measures. </para>

The Opposition parties have brought the Government to the point where we have asked for a double dissolution, and this has been granted. It is no longer the time to flog dead horses and argue about the rights or wrongs of the Government or the Opposition or anything else. I implore the honourable senator as a man of great understanding, and I implore the  President,  that it is time for us to deal expeditiously with the business necessary to go to a double dissolution and not any longer to engage in these polemics, which might have been appropriate before the announcement but which are no longer appropriate. Let us get through the business and let us have the election. It is not seemly to protract these proceedings in the light of the announcement which I made by a discussion of the defaults of one side or the other. </para>

            <para>- Because honourable senators opposite will not give him the time to do so. That is why. Ignoring, the Watergate aspects of the Gair appointment, I want to say that my decision is arrived at on one single, solitary point of policy, and that is this: In 1951 <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies initiated the ANZUS pact which to me is the most significant and important document in Australia's archives. On 2 occasions I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee)</inline> for an assurance that the present Russian approach for a base in this country would be rejected out of hand. On 2 occasions the Minister said it would be investigated. He did not say whether it would be rejected or not. I understand that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> also has failed to give such an undertaking. In all the circumstances I feel that any government which is prepared to put the ANZUS pact at risk is not worthy of support and the situation warrants the use of the emergency powers which the Constitution gives the Senate to defer Supply, as we had intended, if necessary. Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> for your courtesy. </para>

He said that no assurance had been given by either the Prime Minister or me that the request by the United Soviet Socialist Republic that we share an establishment in Australia had been rejected. I made the statement this afternoon that the Government, after a week's consideration, had decided to reject it. In fact, quite a de- . bate took place on it. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline> did not know, I forgive him for that. If he did know, of course, then he made his momentous statement on a false premise. </para>

          <para>- Addressing myself to that question, in view of the events that have intervened, the first thing is to notice the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> It is of such importance in its terms that I suggest that a request should be made that it be circulated for consideration of every honourable senator. In the meantime I shall address myself to it on the basis of my recollection and understanding of it as it was heard. It was to the effect that the Governor-General had acceded to the recommendation for an immediate simultaneous dissolution of Parliament on the undertaking of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> that Supply and nothing else would be transacted in ParliamentSupply until the conclusion of the elections. I am not so concerned with the matter that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> emphasised- that is to say, that one of the stipulations of  His  Excellency's decision was that nothing else but Supply should be considered. But I am concerned with the stipulation that Supply should be considered. My interpretation of that as advised at present is that it does not include Appropriation Bills (No. 3), (No. 4) and (No. 5) but that it does include Supply not until 30 June but for a proper period to encompass an election. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is a piece of impertinence, presumption unparalleled and impulsiveness quite characteristic of what has led <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> to destroy the Government's business in the short time it has been in office that he would suggest that he should not tell the Senate his program for the elections as a mere matter of courtesy, as an obvious right and entitlement of the Senate before it is asked to consider the Bill for Supply for the period which the Governor-General has stipulated, namely to the conclusion of the elections. I regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy's</inline> attitude in denying us the information as to the program before we resume debate upon the Appropriation Bills and Supply as a denial of the fundamental rights of this chamber. How can we consider the propriety of Supply unless we know the period that the Government, after being advised administratively, says will be required to complete the election? It is for that period, to complete the election, that the Supply is appropriate nothing more and nothing less. Therefore I wish to indicate that before I shall vote for the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) to come on as an order of the day for this day or any other day I shall want to see with great particularity the statement that has emanated from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> purporting to be the conditions of the Gove norge neral. On my present understanding of them, I insist that the Senate is entitled to know and is obliged to know the period of the program of the election before it can sensibly consider the Supply that is appropriate to be voted. </para>

            <para>-We now have before us Appropriation Bill (No. 4) which is a Bill for the appropriation of $ 100.4m for expenditure in the current financial year on administrative expenses and other services in addition to the appropriation made by Appropriation Act (No. 1). The Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee),</inline> who introduced the Bill, said that although in this Bill he was asking for an appropriation of $ 100.4m he had to credit, by way of offset against that, $104m which would not be taken into account because under Treasury proceedings that credit offset would not lapse until 30 June. But if we are considering the question of Supply, we need a new Bill- not for a new appropriation of $ 100.4m but for the net amount that will finance the administrative purpose of the Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am not interested in that or any of the other details now because this is a dead Parliament. We are now authorised constitutionally to deal only with those matters which the third arm of the Parliament, the Governor-General, requires the Parliament to deal with as a condition of his executive act to dissolve Parliament. I am waiting to know whether I am wrong in any respect in asserting that His Excellency has made it a condition that we shall deal with supply for such finances as are required to carry on the services of government until the completion of the election. It that is so, and I think that every member of the Senate has that understanding, it is essential that we be advised of the program of the election and of the period proposed to be occupied by that election as well as details of the writs, the nomination, the poll and the return of the poll. </para>
          <para>It seems to be completely presumptuous that the Government will not volunteer that information. It is presumptuous in the extreme that the Government withholds it. I urge that the whole of this Senate recognise the fairness of the requirement that, before we pass money for appropriation in compliance with  His  Excellency's condition we know the program of the election and the period over which we are required to finance the administrative services. I would not recall other circumstances like this because I believe it is unprecedented for the Governor-General to indicate that he will issue a dissolution of Parliament while both Houses are actually sitting. In those circumstances the impact that that makes upon the parliamentary proceedings should properly be considered after we take time to consider the proprieties of the situation. I am here only to advance a proposition that before I vote for any money Bill I wish to be satisfied that I am acting in accordance with the authority of the Governor-General and know the period to be occupied by the election. That seems to me to be so obvious that I would expect that we will have that information before the Bill is passed. </para>

As this chamber is just as much involved with the coming election as another place, surely it is a reasonable proposition that we should know all the factors concerning it, such as the issue of writs and everything else that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> enumerated. Furthermore, it was only a day or two ago that it was stated in the Press that there was division in the Ministry over whether or not the election should be held a week sooner than 1 8 May. There are factors which I think we should know. This seems to me to be a paltry attitude for the Government to take. In effect Senate Murphy says: 'We are going to sit on this knowledge and we are not going to divulge it to you people who are just as much involved in it as the other place.' </para>

            <para>-I listened to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> had to say during the course of the debate on the second reading of this Bill and I noticed the nature of the request which he made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is a senator of this chamber, and we in the Opposition have objected many times in the life of this Government to the churlish abrasive way in which requests from Opposition senators have been brushed aside without any explanation by Ministers of this Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> made a request and indicated the nature of his request. What we were greeted with from the Government side was the motion for the gag. We did not oppose the gag because we all have a common interest in seeing these Bills through tonight. But I urge upon the Minister that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and any other senator is entitled to have some response to the questions which have been asked. I rise on this occasion simply to indicate that there is a basic right in this Senate which I think transcends other considerations, and that is that the ordinary courtesies of questions being asked and responses being made by Ministers of the Crown should be acknowledged. In a sense, this is what the election is all about. I do hope that on this occasion tonight we can have an answer. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Wright's</inline>motion is obviously flaunting the Government's direction from the Governor-General. The Governor-General has instructed the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> to ensure that the business of the country can be carried on, that there is a supply of money to carry out the ordinary works and services of this country. The Governor-General instructed the Prime Minister to come back to the Parliament and carry out that instruction. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> starts these delaying tactics, of which we have seen so much over the last few days, obviously he is defying what the Governor-General has said. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that it is one thing to use such tactics in the context of the normal operations of this Parliament. He may think he is quite smart and clever. But now we are in a situation where we are trying to carry out the instructions of the Governor-General by getting these Bills through before every member of this Parliament submits himself and herself to his or her masters. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is obviously trying to delay, frustrate and defy what the Governor-General has said. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The other point was that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> was demanding to know the schedule, the issue of writs and the rest of it for the election. I have not replied to that question up until now because I have been trying to obtain some information for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> As I understand the position, until this Parliament carries out the directions of the Governor-General and the final act is carried out and we go to a double dissolution, those dates cannot be fixed. If I find anything different from that I shall inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> The way we are going at the moment it looks as if there will be some sort of defiance of the Governor-General 's decision. If we do not pass these Supply Bills we cannot have a double dissolution. As I understand it, Opposition members have been wanting a double dissolution and this is what we would like to give them. If they are to continue frustrating and delaying, it does not seem that they are very genuine in the first place. </para>

            <para>- A lot of things were said in the heat of the moment some time ago by myself and others when we were talking about full disclosures and other things. Since that period I have had the opportunity to have a look at the precedent which was set in 195 1. 1 understand from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy's</inline> statement, and as far as I recall, we are basically in the same situation as we were in 1951. At that time the dates were not disclosed on the night that the then Prime Minister announced the various procedures for each House of the Parliament. Therefore the official Opposition will not oppose the Bills this night to grant Supply. We wish to bring about the condition which the Governor-General has laid down as precedent to granting a double dissolution. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If we did not grant Supply the situation would be rather farcical. We embarked on a course some 12 months ago- I am not trying to be provocative- to bring about a House of Representatives election. That has now been achieved. As I said earlier, we ought to carry out the necessary procedures which will allow the Governor-General to grant a double dissolution. Not to do so would be somewhat dishonest on our part. Therefore, as I see the situation, the sooner we get to the people and have an election the better. We can quarrel about dates and all sorts of things, but we know that there are certain cut off points and certain periods which must be allowed for the return of writs and so on. Whether the Government decides to hold an election the week before 18 May, on 18 May or on 25 May will not mean very much in the long term. Even if we knew the answer, we could not affect the dates. We could have no effect on the advice tendered as to what the dates will be. We would have knowledge but we could not bring about a change of dates. I think it is as simple as that. It is now just after 9.30 p.m. I believe that the 3 Appropriation Bills, the 2 Supply Bills and the 3 or 4 other Bills which are before the chamber ought to be concluded so that at least I can get up, go home and start electioneering, because that is what I want to do more than anything else. </para>

            <para>- Addressing myself to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> said, it is ironical to think that he should attribute to me any attempt to be smart. I am simply here to try to fulfill what the proceedings of the Parliament this evening have initiated- a dissolution of Parliament on the terms authorised by the constitutional authority which has authority to decree a dissolution. I have asked for a copy of the terms and I have been promised one. I am only concerned that I protect the position first of myself and secondly of my Party with regard to this election. Having given support to the proposition that we take parliamentary action to enforce a dissolution, it is a short-sighted view in the extreme, in my book, to say that we take the dissolution on any terms however brief may be the periods for the election. By manipulating the dates, all sorts of casualties might be incurred in the nominations and the endorsements. For instance, the member for Huon, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Michael</inline> Hodgman, a member of the Legislative Council of Tasmania, last night resigned his seat so that he could stand for the Federal seat of Denison. We know that unless his resignation precedes his nomination by 14 days the Government will exclude him from the poll. I speak tonight to protect his position. I will not be dissuaded by any intervention whatever so long as I have parliamentary authority to proceed to ensure that the program of the election will not exclude him from the poll. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe that the very purpose of this secrecy and smother-up is calculated to exclude State members who are in that position and who have to resign 14 days before the date of nomination in order to be considered at the poll. I am sure that no Governor-General in this country would ask us to approve the appropriation of finance until the completion of a poll knowing that this chicanery was under consideration and would not believe that we did not have the fortitude to defend the rights of all candidates to include themselves in the poll. Therefore I think there has been some miscalculation on the part of those who have said that our only duty is to get through our business tonight so that we can go to the poll. If by taking that precipitate course- that ill-advised and ill-considered course- we exclude one of our candidates from the poll we will be the very last syllable in stupidity. I hope that everybody on this side of the chamber will make sure that this debate is carried on so as to ensure that that chicanery shall not succeed. </para>

We know that all this facade of appropriations not being altered has been built up to prevent the Public Service and the Ministry from scrutiny in respect of the estimates that they put forward. But at least the theory still is that the Schedule is to be scrutinised by the Parliament.

            <para>-I want to be very brief on this matter. I see the point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is making. I believe that we can appeal to the spirit of fairness of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> who is in charge of the chamber. The facts are that around about Wednesday, 3 April, it became known that there would be a double dissolution of Parliament. One or more members of State Parliaments in Australia evinced interest and were endorsed to stand for election. Naturally they did not want to take action to get away from the House of Parliament of which they were members until it was sure that the election, which was due to be held in 1975, would be held in April or May 1974. Therefore, 14 days will need to elapse from last night in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Michael</inline> Hodgman. I understand it is traditional that a Prime Minister does not announce the dates concerning an election until he has to do so. That is one of the tricks he keeps up his sleeve. In my experience of politics I would not expect that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> would be able to give those figures tonight He knew about the double dissolution only at 8.30 p.m. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe that the Australian Government and the Party of which it is made up would be forever ashamed if they purposely called on the date for an election to stop a person who had given a prior indication of his intention to stand and who had been endorsed by a major political party from legally nominating. I believe that tonight all we want from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> whose word I trust, is an assurance that there will be more than 14 days from tonight before nominations for the Federal election of 1974 close. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> will agree with me that if we get that assurance tonight we can go on and put the measure through. I make no threat but I say that if any action were taken by this Government to stop Michael Hodgman from being a candidate for Denison by any underhand move the Government would more certainly lose the seat of Denison than it will now. Dumb Dora would win the seat from the Government if there were any dirt. I do not expect there to be any dirt. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> has paid attention to some of my remarks. I think he could give us a reply which would satisfy the situation. </para>

          <para class="block">State Parliament before the decision was even arrived at here? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Negus</inline> did not desire an election and he desired to speak on Supply tonight but he was denied that request. Is everybody to wait perhaps an extra week because somebody somewhere in some party demands the right that it all should be held up because he is caught in a position like many other people are? If he had designs to nominate for Parliament and died, would the whole election be cancelled? It is preposterous that honourable senators here on the Opposition benches who have brought about an election- whatever party we belong to- should now demand a postponement or something because of decisions of parties or individuals to resign to contest an election which may or may not have taken place. What if a person 's judgment had been wrong and there had been no double dissolution of this Parliament? Would we have had to have an election so that he could nominate? This is preposterous. We do not propose to go along with the suggestion that has been made. We want to see the decision in which we played a part carried in the only way it can be carried and that is by passing this legislation. </para>
          <para>I have had many differences with the Government. 1 appreciate that this is a snap decision. The Government may not know all the things that we want to ask. I believe that it will be sufficiently honourable about this- although I have had great reason to question its honour in the last fortnight- that when it has the information it will follow the usual precedents established in this Parliament, will not seek to gain an unfair advantage but will let us know. I would not support the idea that it should run around Australia and find out what everybody has done. There may be somebody who may not resign from the State Parliament until tomorrow. Must we hold up the matter for them? Maybe he will not want to resign until the last minute. Will we have to hold it up again? We cannot accept that as a precept in making a decision on a question of this magnitude. We will support the proposition as it is. </para>

I feel- I must say this-that the Opposition, in my opinion, carried out a hijack worth something like $330m not only on the Government but on the people of Australia. It had no right to do so. It exceeded its power. I have been a senator for some time, and I say that the admission by the Leader of the Opposition only a few minutes ago that over 12 months ago the Opposition set out to get rid of the Government in the House of Representatives is an admission that the Opposition cannot take a licking. It was beaten fairly and squarely by the vote of the people of Australia who put the present Government into power. The Opposition set out to put the Government out of power before that Government even had a chance to show its paces. The Opposition could not take a licking. </para>

              <para>- You keep your mind where it should be. For the benefit of the people who are listening to the broadcast, it is quite obvious to me that party politics have entered into the Senate in a disgusting fashion. It is disgusting that decisions are made in this chamber on party lines. Honourable senators opposite are not game to cross the floor. In the very clear words of a man whom I consider to be the best Prime Minister that this country ever had, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies, who started off the Liberal Party, the Senate, if it did what it is doing now, would be doing a very improper thing. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> said that it would be very rarely that a Liberal senator, a Country Party senator or a Labor senator would feel himself free to vote against giving effect to a measure propounded by his own Party in the House of Representatives. No matter what is said by any leader of any Party, although he told his members that they could vote freely, they would not be game to vote freely because they would run the risk of not being re-endorsed. </para>

              <para>- I am referring to what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies said, and you do not query him, do you? He said that it would be a falsification of democracy on a matter of Government policy approved by the House of Representatives, possibly by a large majority, if the Senate, representing the States and not the people, could reverse the decision on a Bill passed in the House of Representatives. That is precisely what the Senate has done tonight. Fancy the Leader of the Opposition having the hide to say that until the Government says that there will be a double dissolution we will not pass the Appropriation Bills. What a hide to say that in a House of the Australian Parliament. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>For the information of the Leader of the Opposition and for the information of the people listening, the Appropriation Bills provide money for salaries and wages and for other necessities including money for the States. When they are passed the money goes into Consolidated Revenue. If there is a double dissolution, Consolidated Revenue is controlled only by the Governor-General. I would not say that anyone would query the Governor-General 's motives in paying out any of that money. Fancy the Opposition saying that it would not pass the Supply Bills unless the Government told us when there was to be a double dissolution. On its own admission it started from the jump, right from the last election, to see that this Government was put out of power. When I was in the motor racing game, if a man beat me and I could not take a licking I would have been a very bad sport. Since the present Government has been in power the Opposition in this House has not set out to debate reasonable amendments on behalf of the people. Members of the Opposition have forgotten that they were elected by the people. They have only been talking for and on behalf of their political party, which I think is a disgraceful situation. </para>
          <para>I appeal to the people of Australia to remember this night and never forget it. I sincerely trust that they will fill this House with Independents, because they are the only ones who are capable and game to vote on behalf of the people the way they truly feel. I ask this chamber to get down to tin tacks and remember that tonight, if honourable senators think they have time in an hour and ten minutes- and I do not think they have, because I think it will take a week or perhaps a fortnight to do this properly- we have to pass Bills appropriating something over $339m. </para>

              <para>- The point I am trying to make is that the aim of this country should be to give everybody the opportunity to nominate for this election. If a man who is a member of a State parliament wishes to nominate and he is required to resign from that Parliament a certain number of days before he submits his nomination, I think that is a special consideration. In an emergency election such as this, one probably is not given enough notice of the election. Whilst the possibility of a double dissolution or the dissolution of the House of Representatives was being talked about, there was no guarantee of an election. I think that that aspect ought to be taken into consideration. </para>

          <para>A great deal of nonsense has been talked about the Senate's lack of power. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> demonstrated very ably this afternoon the reason why the Senate has the power that it has. When the Constitution was written and the Senate was created, it was given power to do certain things. The fact that that power has not been exercised does not mean that that power should not be exercised. If a special circumstance arises, there is no reason why that power should not be used if this chamber feels that it should be used. Those who are elected to the Senate are elected by the voters in the same way as are the members of the other chamber. The Constitution is really wrapped around the Senate in that, if the creation of the Senate had not been agreed to in order to satisfy the various States, there would not have been an Australian Parliament. The establishment of the Senate enabled the Australian Parliament to be created. </para>

              <para>- That does not matter to me. As far as I am concerned, the Liberal Party at home has always been true to the core. When my name has been submitted for re-endorsement I have always been re-endorsed overwhelmingly. So has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> One of the cardinal differences between the senators on this side of the chamber and those on the other side is that we are free to vote according to our conscience; and I will never sell that right. Throughout my 24 years in this place- I am now into my twenty fifth year- I have always exercised my right to vote in accordance with my conscience. I want to make this clear, because when statements such as that made by Senate Negus are made I think it is necessary to clear the air. Although some people may not be prepared to vote against the decisions taken by their party, I am not one of them, and I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is not one of them. The Opposition Whip, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young,</inline> can confirm that on a number of occasions Liberal Party senators have deviated from the party line. I have no doubt that that comment applies also to our partner, the Australian Country Party. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Negus</inline> probably made those remarks in the heat of the moment, I want to make it clear that what he claimed is not the case. </para>

              <para>- I think that there is a little confusion. I have no objection to the postponing of it until after consideration of the Schedule, which is on the next page and which itemised the various items. I do not think that it would be possible to refer this matter to a committee, as we generally do in normal times. As I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright-</inline> I do not quite know what his purpose is- I do not see any great problem in it being postponed until after the consideration of the Schedule, which is on page 2 of the Bill. It is being called a postponement of the whole item. I do not know what that means. It might be forever. </para>

              <para>-The reason why I did not make this statement before is that it would have been completely out of order to do so as it has nothing to do with the Bill before the House. I try to keep some things in order. When we were talking yesterday about the question of dates I said that it was impossible to give the dates as we did not know when the election would be, but I promised <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that I would do my best to have this information supplied to the public and everybody concerned as soon as possible. That has been done. We are now getting a little closer to the situation and it is still not a final act. By the way in which we are going on we are not carrying out very expeditiously what the Governor-General has suggested. I have asked for a note on the 2 questions. They are the questions of the date of the elections and whether or not this would be of some detriment to a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hodgman.</inline> The Prime Minister has advised that the reason he has not announced the date of the elections is that he must consult the Chief Electoral Officer before advising the Governor-General of the possible dates and also that there are formalities which need to be worked out. For example, there are pending State elections such as the election for the Legislative Council in Tasmania which require careful examination as to possible dates. Also, because each State has an </para>

          <para>The other question, that involving <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hodgman,</inline> caused some interest and some accusations were made in relation to it. I am advised that because of the provisions which need to be met in respect of the South Australian Senate Elections and probably the Electoral Acts of other States, there will be a timetable which will enable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hodgman</inline> to nominate for the seat of Denison should he wish to do so and provided he acts promptly upon the calling of nominations. </para>

          <para>This Bill seeks appropriations totalling $70,362,000 for expenditure in the current financial year on items of capital works and services, payments to or for the States and certain other services, additional to those made in the Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1973-74. Although additional appropriations are being sought for the services specified in the Bill, it is expected that savings of about $68. 1 m will be available in other appropriations. As I explained in relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 4), it is not possible to utilise such savings to offset additional expenditure under other appropriations. When introducing Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1973-74 I informed the Senate that savings expected in amounts appropriated by Appropriation Act (No. 1) 1973-74 has been listed in an information paper for the benefit of senators. The information paper likewise contains details of savings expected in amounts appropriated by Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1973-74. </para>
          <para>Of the $45. 4m now sought for capital works and services, the major requirements are $2m for emergency classroom accommodation for the Department of Immigration, $l.lm for the purchase of residential properties at overseas posts, $33m for the Postmaster-General's Department to meet the cost of new wage rates and improved conditions of service together with increases in the prices of materials, $7.2m for the Department of Services and Property, of which $ 1.7m is for acquisitions of freehold properties in the Australian Capital Territory and $4.1m for acquisition of properties for overseas posts. </para>
          <para>Additional appropriations of $ 14.3 mare sought for payments to or for the States. These include $9m for pre-school and child care centres, $1.7m for health services, of which $0.5m is for blood transfusion services and $0.7m for the school dental scheme, $lm for grants to the apple and pear and canning fruit industries, and $ 1 .  1 m for assistance in relation to natural disasters in previous years. It is proposed that assistance to Queensland and New South Wales in respect of recent floods in those states will be appropriated under special legislation. Further appropriations of $ 10.5m are sought for other services of departments, including $6m to enable the National Capital Development Commission to meet contractual obligations under rise and fall clauses in current construction contracts. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to seek the appropriation of sums totalling $168,575,000 for salaries and payments' in the nature of salary, including the appropriation to specific divisions of a block sum of $32. 5m appropriated in Appropriation Act (No. 1) 1973-74. Honourable senators will be aware that it is normal practice to seek appropriations for salaries and payments in the nature of salaries in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) which are based on rates current at the time. That normal practice was followed with Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1973-74. Since that Bill was introduced, rates of salary, pay and allowances, of both members of the defence force and civilian employees, have been extensively affected by a variety of new awards, determinations and related decisions. The major part of the additional appropriations in the present Bill- in fact, approximately $ 100m- is required to meet these changes. The need to introduce the Bill at this stage, prior to the time the Additional Estimates are normally introduced, arises essentially because of them. </para>
          <para>Of the total appropriations sought, $4 1.3m is for pay and allowances payable to members of the defence force and $ 127.2m for salary and payments in the nature of salary for civilian employees of the Australian Government. The additional funds for defence Services are to meet increased rates of pay, re-engagement bonuses and other allowances for members of the force. The amount of $ 127.2m for civilian employees includes the amount of $32. 5m provided as a bulk provision in Appropriation Act (No. 1) 1973-74 for the payment of salary increases to officers of the Second Division and the Third Division. The amount was appropriated on the condition that particulars of the allocation of it would afterwards be submitted to the Parliament. The Bill provides for specific appropriation, department by department, of that bulk sum already appropriated. It also includes some $58.7m required to meet salaries and payments in the nature of salary for civilian employees as a result of awards and determinations made since Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1973-74 was introduced. </para>
          <para>The remaining amount of $36m covers other increased requirements for salaries and payments in the nature of salary arising from increases in staffs and additional overtime. Appropriation Act (No. 1) 1973-74, in accordance with normal practice, made no provision for increases in staff of civil departments beyond establishments already formally approved at that time. Funds to cover increases which have since been approved are required by a number of departments. In several cases, the increases have resulted from transfers of functions subsequent to the introduction of the Budget- for example, the transfer to the Department of the Special Minister of State of payment of personal staffs of Ministers and transfers to the Office of the Australian Development Assistance Agency of staff positions from the former Department of External Territories and from the Aid Branch of the Department of Foreign Affairs. In the case of the Department of Education, teachers in Australian Capital Territory schools have been employed by it since 1 January 1974 whereas they were formerly employed, on a reimbursement basis, by the New South Wales Department of Education. Savings in a number of existing appropriations resulting from such changes total approximately $llm. Bringing the foregoing items together, and allowing for the savings to which I referred, they add up to a net additional requirement of $125m. While it has been possible to meet the increased requirements so far from existing appropriations, these now need early supplementation if a number of departments are to have sufficient funds to continue to meet salary costs. </para>
          <para>The present Bill also includes a provision similar to that contained in section 4 of the Supply Act (No. 1) 1973-74, the purpose of which was to enable the Treasurer to determine and issue funds to enable salary increases arising out of awards, determinations and like approvals to be paid from the due dates, even though specific provision had not been made in the appropriations. Because of the substantial amounts involved, it has become increasingly difficult to fund such increases from the Treasurer's Advance. One commitment that will need to be funded from this provision is the recent 17.5 per cent recreation leave loading. The Treasurer will report to Parliament after the close of the year particulars of amounts issued under clause 5, in a manner similar to that in which the Parliament is advised of the final charges to the Advance to the Treasurer appropriation. Finally, I emphasise that this Bill seeks appropriation of additional funds for salaries and payments in the nature of salary only. As is invariably the case, additional appropriations will also have to be sought for administrative expenses, other services, payments to or for the States and items of a capital nature. Additional appropriations for these purposes will be sought in further Bills which we expect to introduce early in April, which is when the Additional Estimates are normally introduced. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to make interim provision for the appropriation of moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government for the first 5 months of the financial year 1974-75. The total amount sought in this Bill is $1,804,284,000 for the following services: (a) Civil Departmental Services, $1,156,869,000; (b) Defence Services, $587,415,000; (c) Advance to the Treasurer, $60m. Estimates for salaries and payments in the nature of salary are based on current rates of pay and existing staff numbers.

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the payment of up to $66m to assist the State of Queensland in financing the cost of measures designed to alleviate the effects of the disastrous floods which occurred in that State between January and March of this year. This figure is based on the latest estimates of costs supplied by the State; it represents a reduction of some $ 14m on earlier estimates. In terms of hardship and damage, the floods were one of the largest, if not the largest, disasters that has occurred in this country. </para>
          <para>It may be of assistance to honourable senators if I outline here the response of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> to a question put to him in another place on 5 March. The Treasurer said that the assistance which the Australian Government was providing to assist those who had suffered as a result of the flooding and to restore damage to public assets was on a far more extensive and liberal scale than on any previous occasion. He referred to the praiseworthy work of the defence forces in helping with evacuations, providing emergency supplies and in other ways assisting to minimise or alleviate hardship. He referred also to the special services which were being provided by the Department of <inline font-style="italic">Social</inline> Security, the offer of temporary accommodation help by the Minister for Housing and Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson),</inline> the assistance from other departments and the donations totalling $600,000 that the Australian Government had made to public relief funds. The Treasurer mentioned, in addition, that private donations of $2 or more to these and other public funds are allowable deductions for income tax purposes resulting in a significant pan of such donations falling on the Australian Government Budget. However, by far the largest call on government funds will be made by measures which the Queensland Government has implemented with the agreement of the Australian Government, and which the State is administering. </para>
          <para>At the onset of the floods, the Australian Government offered to provide financial assistance to the Queensland Government to enable appropriate relief and restoration measures to be undertaken by it. The measures which have been agreed between the government include grants for immediate relief and emergency house repairs, grants and loans for major repairs or rebuilding of private homes, loans to flood affected primary producers and business firms, and expenditure on the restoration of public assets destroyed or damaged in the floods. </para>
          <para>The Bill provides that the conditions of the Financial Assistance which the Australian Government is providing are to be as the Treasurer determines. The Australian Government's financial assistance to the State will be provided by way of grants where the expenditure by the State on the agreed relief and rehabilitation measures takes the form of grants, and by way of interest-free loans where the expenditure takes the form of loans. With the indulgence of the Senate, I shall have details of the various categories of assistance, showing estimated expenditures on each, incorporated in Hansard. </para>

              <para>- Total grants are estimated to amount to $56. 9m and loans to $ 12.75m. The Queensland Government's share of this expenditure is expected to amount to $3. 65m, a very small fraction indeed of the funds required for the measures I have mentioned. The amount that the Australian Government expects to provide, $66 m, will dwarf any previous expenditure on assistance provided in the case of any single disaster. Loans by the Australian Government to the State will be interest-free. It has been agreed that the State may charge interest on loans at concessional rates, the interest thus received being available to cover administrative costs and to assist the State in meeting any losses arising from bad debts. </para>

          </continue><para>The BDI provides for assistance extending over a period of 3 financial years, including 1973-74. The measures which the Australian Government is supporting are both wide-ranging and liberal. In agreeing to these measures, the Government was actuated by the extent of the Queensland disaster which affected a very large number of people, many of whom were inadequately covered by insurance. The Government welcomed offers from insurance organisations to discuss the inclusion of cover for natural disasters in housing insurance policies. Preliminary discussions for this purpose have already taken place between officers of the Treasury and representatives of the various insurance organisations concerned. Officers of the Treasury will take up with representatives of the banks, insurance companies and other financial corporations that provide finance for housing the question of their lending policies and insurance cover in relation to houses constructed in areas affected by natural disasters. An examination will also be made of questions relating to insurance of crops and livestock against natural disasters. </para><para>These disastrous floods have focused attention on the need for an adequate approach to the question of flood mitigation and the Government is examining this problem as a matter of urgency. </para><para>To sum up, the Government is providing assistance on an unprecedentedly generous scale to those who have suffered loss as a result of the floods. It is urgently examining ways in which protection may be increased against future occurrences of a similar nature. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para></speech>

            <para>- I wish to say only a few words on this legislation because I know that the hour is late. I commend the Government for the action it has taken in providing money to Queensland for flood relief purposes. I think that people are only just beginning to realise the extent of the disastrous floods in Queensland. We must pay a tribute to the people in the emergency services, the police and members of the Royal Australian Air Force who did such a wonderful job in rescuing people in many parts of Queensland. Houses simply disappeared in the cities of Brisbane and Ipswich and other cities. It will be a long and difficult job to re-house these people. The fishing town of Karumba on the Gulf of Carpentaria was almost destroyed by the floods. It will take a long time to get this town, which .is an important outpost in the southern part of the Gulf and which in normal times has a thriving fishing industry, back into order. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Some of this money will be allocated for use in restoring public utilities and the railways in particular and the roads of Queensland have suffered greatly from flood damage. It will take a considerable time and. very large sums of money to restore them to the condition they were in before the floods. Many other things have been damaged. For instance, all the telephone services in the Brisbane area have not yet been restored. A great deal of work will be needed to get this service back to normal. One does not realise how many other things need to be done even weeks and weeks after the flood unless one has been involved. 1 could say more on this matter, but bearing in mind the late hour I would just like again to commend the Government for the action that it has taken. </para>

            <para>- I desire to intervene in this debate because I think that all Queensland members of Parliament are conscious of the enormous disaster that struck Queensland and subsequently struck the northern part of New South Wales. At the time the flood struck Brisbane I was overseas. I flew back from northern Pakistan to Brisbane. I asked the captain of the international aircraft on which I was travelling whether he would be good enough to make a circuit of Brisbane. He obtained permission to do so and made 2 circuits of the city. The extent of the devastation that I saw was appalling. One was unable to recognise suburbs which are normally easily identifiable in that city where the convolutions of the river make it easy to establish where the suburbs are. At the weekend I took the opportunity to go around the various suburbs of Brisbane which were badly affected. On the Sunday I went to Ipswich where the devastation was enormous. I went to one section where a bank of the Bremer River was as bare as the floor that is now before me. It was pointed out that 7 houses had stood in this spot but they had completely disappeared. Not even a <inline font-style="italic">stump</inline> was left from those houses on that bank of the river. </para>

We paid a tribute to the generosity of the aid which had been given through the Federal Government, the Queensland Government and the Lord Mayor of Brisbane and the work that these 3 bodies had done in accumulating aid and distributing it in an efficient manner. HoweVer, I indicated at that stage that a further meeting of all Federal members, when those from the more far distant parts of the State were available, and senators similarly situated, would be called. That meeting was called in Canberra when the Parliament resumed and as a result we took the matter up with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam).</inline> That meeting had called for certain matters to receive attention.

            <para>That some formula of equalisation be adopted to allow the import of materials in short supply, required for rebuilding, so that imported materials would be available at comparable prices. ' </para>
            <para>That sections 75 and 76 of the Taxation Act, which were repealed, be restored. </para>
            <para>That non-governmental institutional buildings (hospitals, nursing homes and schools) be considered for relief assistance for restoration. </para>

          <para>I would say merely this: The Democratic Labor Party has as part of its Federal policy, and always has had, that there should be a Federal secretariat to handle the questions of natural disasters in Australia. We have seen these things come and they are always taken as if they were unexpected and sporadic. In fact, natural disasters in Australia are epidemic. There is either a natural disaster by way of flood, drought or cyclone or, perhaps, where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> comes from on the Gold Coast, by substantial beach erosion. They always seem to take us by surprise. I do not mean that in the actual physical sense but in the financial and organisational sense. Therefore, we in the Democratic Labor Party have suggested- it has been in our policy for years- that there should be a permanent ongoing secretariat. I think that this matter has now received some attention from the present Government. If that is so, it is very good. But we were the first in the field to put that proposition forward. </para>

              <para>-Senator McAuliffe, this has been in the policy of the Democratic Labor Party and it has been espoused in national policy speeches for some years. It is a very reasonable and proper provision and one which I hope every government and any government would take up, because natural disasters in this country must be treated as of regular and expected occurrence. Then we can move to meet them without these ad hoc methods which now characterise all our approaches to natural disasters. Having said that, I support the Bill. I am sure that the moneys which have been provided- I do not underestimate the generosity of those moneys- will be put to the necessary purpose for which they are devised. </para>

            <para>- I had no intention of entering into this debate until honourable senators on the Opposition side tried to parade their virtues in relation to what was done in the calamity which struck Queensland recently. I feel it necessary for me to do so now because of the statements that have been made by the representative of the Democratic Labor Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne.</inline> One would think after listening to him that he was the only person in Queensland or Australia who had done any work at all. While he was running around the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics people in Queensland were doing all the work. When he came back, that representative of a rump group suggested that something should be done. The fact remains that when this disaster struck, a meeting of representatives of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland was organised very quickly and the respective areas were allocated to all members to do work of a humane nature. Each and every one of us ploughed through mud almost up to our knees helping people in those areas who were stricken. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline>has told us all the things that he had done. Everything that the DLP suggested should be done had been done in the first place principally by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Manfred</inline> Cross, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Rex</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Patterson, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brendan</inline> Hansen and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> from north Queensland. These people were in constant touch with the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> and the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard)</inline> to arrange all the facilities that the Federal Government could provide in the way of relief for the people of Queensland. All the facilities of the armed Services were made available. I want to pay tribute to the wonderful work done particularly by the servicemen of the Royal Australian Air Force and the Army during those terrible days. I believe that other aspects of the work should be made known. The legislation provides for a substantial amount of money. Personally, I do not think that it will be sufficient. </para>
          <para>Tragic circumstances were associated with the flood. Four servicemen lost their lives. We immediately contacted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean</inline> to ask that money be made available for the distressed widows and children of those servicemen. This information has never been released but I am going to say here and now that the Government generously made money available to the extent of $14,500 to the widows and $5 a week for each child. The widows have now applied for benefits under the Repatriation Act. The Repatriation Department is currently considering their entitlement. These are things for which the Government has never received any commendation. I would say that the breweries would be very pleased with the generous treatment provided by the Government, at the instance particularly of the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy),</inline> when the Government refunded all the excise duty that had been paid on all the bottled beer that had to be destroyed under the provisions of the Health Act. The amount of revenue lost by the Government does not appear in this amount of money that is to be provided. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean</inline>and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard</inline> not only were on the job immediately but also visited the stricken people in these areas to see what they could do for them. I arranged personally for Ministers to come up and go through the University of Queensland and as a result of that the Government has made $lm available to the University of Queensland to restore that university, particularly the grounds, to the condition it was in prior to the flood. I believe that the Australian Government can take great credit for what it has done in all the circumstances. The Service personnel played a wonderful part. </para>
          <para>The only difficulty experienced arose from the failure of the Queensland Government to declare a state of emergency. Had it done so, there would have been a lot less loss and lives would have been saved. The fact is that the servicemen and civil defence workers went to homes and asked people to leave. The people said: 'No, a flood has never got up this far yet. We will not go'. The same personnel had to go back again to try to encourage the people to leave their homes because the water was rising. Again the people, particularly the elderly, said that they would not leave. That meant that the civil defence workers and Service personnel had to return again, and it was then that lives were lost. Because a state of emergency was not declared, the civil defence workers were powerless to compel people to leave their homes. It was a sad reflection on the Queensland Government that it did not have the foresight to do that. However, that is merely a comment. </para>
          <para>I commend the Australian Government for the humane work it did in providing all the Army personnel, the Royal Australian Air Force personnel, helicopters, planes and other facilities. I pay a special tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Rex</inline> Patterson, who did a marvellous job in north Queensland where the flooded areas were far more extensive than they were in Brisbane and Ipswich. He was among the people in that area all the time. This flood was an unfortunate occurrence. I believe that it was one of the worst disasters we have seen since the white man first inhabited Australia. I trust that we will never see the like of it again. I commend the Bill and the generosity of the Australian Government. </para>

            <para>- I take this opportunity to say something that I intended to say earlier. I hope that some tolerance will be extended to me if my remarks appear to be those which should have been made during the second reading debate rather than at the Committee stage. I pay a tribute not merely to the Army and other Service personnel generally but also to the citizens of Brisbane and the service clubs in Brisbane, such as the Rotary, Lions and Apex clubs, and other bodies of that nature. The way in which the citizens of Brisbane rallied to the assistance of their less fortunate neighbours and friends was amazing. It was the greatest outpouring of spontaneous generosity that I think Australia has ever witnessed. I recall one incident involving a Rotary club in a suburb of Brisbane. There were 2 doctors. One was the  president  and the other was either the secretary or vice-president of the club. They organised relief and the provision of furniture and gave 3,000 inoculations against infection and disease. They did a tremendous job in organising meals for thousands of people and matters relating to furniture, health and other things. This was only symptomatic of the total relief work mobilised by the generosity of the people of Brisbane and I take this opportunity to put on record in this Parliament the appreciation of the people of Brisbane who were affected by the floods for the assistance given to them by those who were fortunate enough not to be directly affected by that tremendous disaster. 1 think the national Parliament should recognise the work carried out by these people, because in an age of materialism and of some cynicism it shows that the heart of the Australian people beats warmly and rapidly when others are unfortunately affected. It manifested itself on this occasion and I think Australia should be proud that this is still the spirit of the Australian nation. </para>

          <para class="block">As honourable senators will be aware, the severe flooding which occurred in the early part of the year affected New South Wales as well as Queensland. The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the payment of up to $5.5m to assist the State of New South Wales in financing the cost of measures designed to alleviate the effects of the floods. The damage caused by the flooding in New South Wales, although not as widespread or as devastating as in Queensland, nevertheless caused considerable hardship and suffering to those involved and the Australian Government expressed its readiness to assist the New South </para>
          <para class="block">Wales Government in providing aid to those affected. </para>
          <para>The assistance authorised by this Bill is considerably less than that authorised by the Bill relating to Queensland. This can be ascribed to 2 factors: Firstly, because of the lesser extent of the disaster, the range of measures for which the New South Wales Government sought financial support from the Australian Government was not as extensive as in the case of Queensland, and, secondly, the expenditure on relief measures which the State Government is meeting from its own resources is greater in New South Wales than in Queensland. Particulars of estimated expenditure have been supplied by the New South Wales Government authorities and I ask that they be incorporated in Hansard. </para>

          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision that there should be a distribution of the surplus of $70,015,000 as at 30 June 1972 disclosed by the tenth quinquennial investigation of the Superannuation Fund, into which are paid the contributions under the Superannuation Act made by Australian Government employees. Honourable senators will recall that on 21 November 1973 I tabled the Superannuation Board 's report on the investigation, which was undertaken by the Australian Government Actuary. The Board's report included the report of the Actuary. The surplus of $70,015,000 as at 30 June 1972 included the undistributed surplus as at 30 June 1967 of $14,779,000 which by 30 June 1972 had accumulated to $ 1 9,749,000. The Actuary stated that $52,525,000 of the total surplus was attributable to contributors and $17,490,000 to pensioners. </para>
          <para>The surplus arose principally because the Fund had earned at a higher rate than the future long term average earning rate of 5 per cent assumed by the Actuary for the purpose of his previous investigation and by the Actuary's assuming a higher future long term average earning rate, 5.5 per cent, for the purpose of the tenth quinquennial investigation. It follows from this that members contribution rates are now higher than necessary to finance their shares of the benefits provided under the existing scheme but no adjustment of contribution rates is contemplated pending a final decision by the Government on the new superannuation scheme proposed by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean).</inline> I should add that the Government does not pay contributions into the Fund concurrently with members. The Government meets its share of the cost of benefits when the benefits are paid. </para>
          <para>The principles adopted in the Bill are similar to those followed in the 1965 legislation covering the distribution of the surplus in the Fund as at 30 June 1962. As on that occasion, the total amount distributed will include an additional amount in the nature of further surplus that has accrued in the Fund since 1 July 1972 in respect of the surplus of $70,0 1 5,000. Subject to passage of the legislation, the Superannuation Board expects that it will be able to make payments to pensioners during September-October and to contributors before the end of this Year. The payments will, of course, be made from the Superannuation Fund and will not be a charge against Consolidated Revenue or the Budget. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill deals with remuneration and allowances for certain statutory office holders. Honourable senators will recall that in 1971 the then Minister for Health, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson, gave an undertaking that remuneration and allowances paid on an annual basis to various statutory office holders would be specified by Act of Parliament. This was in accordance with the wishes of the Senate. This Government followed a similar practice when it introduced legislation dealing with the establishment of new statutory offices. The practice has been for legislation to provide for the determination of remuneration by regulation until a specified date, after which the remuneration must be specified in an Act of Parliament. The need for this policy has been overtaken by the establishment of the Remuneration Tribunal last year. That Tribunal is now responsible for undertaking reviews of the remuneration of statutory office holders and others. It will do this at least once a year. Its determinations and reports will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, in accordance with the terms of the Remuneration Tribunal Act. </para>
          <para>This Bill is necessary to cover certain statutory office holders established before the Remuneration Tribunal Act was passed. Without passage of the Bill there will be no provision by which salary payments may be made after 1 July 1 974. All the Bill does is allow existing remuneration to continue to be paid in accordance with regulations until a determination is made by the Remuneration Tribunal. This will ensure that the existing rates of remuneration continue to be payable should there be no determination by the Remuneration Tribunal before 1 July 1974. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

It is, I think, fair to describe it as a tidying-up measure to take account of some officers who previously had not been accounted for in earlier legislation relating to the Remuneration Tribunal. On that basis the Opposition offers no objection to the measure. </para>

            <para>- It will be remembered that when the Legislative Drafting Institute Bill was before the Senate last week I raised a question of whether the Senate had been wise in relegating to the Remuneration Tribunal its power to supervise directly the remuneration of holders of certain statutory offices. It will be remembered that through the last several years the Senate has striven to get the Parliament to take out of the hands of the Executive the fixation of the salaries of the most important of the holders of statutory offices and of the officers controlling departments. We succeeded and we exercised that power for a couple of years. Of course the difficulty of the Parliament, in its procedures, being in any way effective as well as fair arid wise in the relative salaries which were fixed, immediately became apparent. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>My recollection of the Remuneration Tribunal Act of this year is that that Tribunal has power not merely to recommend to the Parliament but tofu. In that respect I think the Parliament has gone too far. I regret very much that the Parliament does not retain by way of specific consideration the right to set the ceiling of the most important salaries in the parliamentary service. I express the view that it is probable that we have given too much power to the Remuneration Tribunal in giving it power to fix directly those salaries. When the salaries which it fixes come before the Parliament we are faced with a proposition which still has to be penetrated, namely, that on an Appropriation Bill we should not interfere with either the whole of it by way of rejection or parts of it by way of amendment, request or review. The difficulty of supervising a ceiling for these salaries I think has become such that the Parliament has unwisely relegated that power to a mere administrative tribunal. I say 'a mere administrative tribunal' because it consists of 3 members. We do not yet know its procedures. It is presided over by a judge, and includes 2 others. It has yet to prove its stability from the point of view of retaining a proper measure of restraint upon these salaries and upon the ceiling of these high salaries of important officers such as those enumerated in the Bill. </para>
          <para>I realise that tonight there is no point in taking issue on the matter. The Bill having been presented to us, I indicate that I am interested to know why it is provided in the sub-clauses of clause 3 that the salaries are to be fixed by regulation. It was my understanding that the statutory office holders would have their salaries fixed by regulation up to 1 July 1974- it may have been 1975 but it was for the first initial period of the office- and that after that the salaries would be fixed by Act of Parliament. If there is something in the Remuneration Tribunal Act which now means that the salaries for all time are to be fixed by regulation, I would be obliged if the Minister would explain the position either in his reply or in Committee. </para>

He acknowledged that fact and pointed to the difficulties associated with an appropriation Bill.

            <para>- With the concurrence of the  Deputy  Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> who is in charge of the Bill, may I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that clause 3( 1 ) deals with remuneration, that is, salary. Clause 3(2) deals with allowances other than remuneration. Those allowances are to be prescribed by regulation. Certainly that feature of the provision is permanent. But the regulations are liable to disallowance by either House. As far as I can recall, this procedure is consistent with the practice set by the Senate and adopted by the House of Representatives. It has become the practice of Parliament that allowances shall be prescribed by regulation until replaced by remuneration provisions. So this provision sort of fits into our pattern. The salary will be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal and the allowances will be prescribed. That regulation is subject to disallowance. I see some affirmation from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> side of the chamber that my statement is in accordance with the scheme which we set out, as it has been adapted to the Remuneration Tribunal. </para>

          <para>In sub-clause (4), at end of sub-clause add 'or, if such pension or allowance has been converted into a lump sum, by the amount of the actuarial equivalent on a periodic basis of such lump sum'. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I feel particularly outraged by some of the extravagant lump sums that are being extracted both from the public purse and in private industry in the form of non-taxable superannuation funds. We are creating a new aristocracy which, unless Parliament modifies it, will create a resentment such as was created in 1789. If the allowance of the Governor-General is to be reduced by the amount of periodic pension payments he receives, it follows as the night the day that it is logical and fair that if that periodic pension is converted into a lump sum, then that lump sum should be subtracted from the 60 per cent of the Chief Justice salary that is payable to the Governor-General. I cannot see that the slightest question of policy arises in this matter, and I would expect that every Labor man would support such a proposition, that is to say, that under the Act a retiring Governor-General is to be provided with a pension equal to 60 per cent of the Chief Justice's salary, and if he is receiving a periodic pension either from the State or the Commonwealth or the Territory, whether it be a judicial pension, a parliamentary pension or, as I interpret it, a superannuation pension- as to that I ask the Minister to confirm my understanding the amount of the periodic pension is deducted. Under the system that applies to New South Wales public servants and, I believe, to members of the Queensland Parliament, a contributor can convert his pension of, say, $ 1 5,000 a year into a lump sum which in one case in New South Wales amounted to $200,000. The point of my amendment is that if such a person should become Governor-General and enjoy the conversion into a lump sum, he should suffer a deduction of the equivalent of that periodic pension that would have been deducted if it had remained a periodic pension instead of being converted to a lump sum. </para>

          <para>- Federal, yes. It seems to be accepted in principle that lump sum payments ought to apply to superannuation and that periodical payments also should apply under various provisions, especially of State law. But the honourable senator is really suggesting that the benefit proposed in this Bill should be reduced by an amount which has been received in a lump sum or by the equivalent amount of a periodical payment, if such moneys had been provided by a State or a Territory. It is true, as the honourable senator says, that this aspect is not covered in the Bill. There are some private schemes under which people can receive a superannuation pension as well as some other benefits. Such a person might become a member of Parliament and qualify for a parliamentary pension, but no one would suggest that one of those payments should be written off. Certainly if that person had received a lump sum payment as well, this would be moving a step further. For example, someone might have gained a windfall or received a capital payment. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>All I can say to the Senate is that no such principle is embodied in the legislation. Such a provision would have to be given further consideration if it were proposed to include it in the legislation. The proposition put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is reasonable in this regard. He has suggested that a retiring Governor-General should not, in effect, receive the benefit of 2 pensions. I think it is reasonable at this stage to leave it at that. I can see a certain amount of force in what the honourable senator is putting but a decision has been made on this matter. I suppose some sort of engagement has been made on the basis of the Bill as it now stands. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> proposition may be a matter for future consideration. I suggest it may be wiser simply to leave the matter at that. If the honourable senator thinks he should pursue his notions, which I concede have some consistency and some logic, I suggest it should be on another day. It may be wiser to leave the Bill stand as it is. </para>

          <para>-My experience of parliamentary proceedings always prompts me to think that this is the day on which a matter should be pursued. Once legislation with an omission of this sort is passed, it will never be corrected. We will find to our dismay that by reason of our default advantage is taken of it. I ask for a confirmation of my understanding that the words 'pension or retiring allowance ' as used in sub-clause (4) of clause 4 of the Bill include a superannuation payment to a public servant of the Commonwealth. That is provided in part or in whole by Australia. I ask for confirmation of the view that it is intended that a periodic payment of that sort should be deducted. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>We have been told that it is intended to provide that retiring public servants may convert their pensions into lump sums. Are we being really faithful to the purpose of our representation if we allow that to happen and then allow a complete pension to be paid to the Governor-General? I submit that we are not. I submit that the periodic pension or, if it is converted into a lump sum, the actuarial equivalent of a periodic allowance or pension should be deducted from it. I ask not for the Committee to postpone the matter but for the Government to accept my proposition. If we have made any blunder it will be easy for the Government in the next half of the year to alter it back. But it will never be possible for anybody but the Government to initiate the correction. So tonight is the night. I ask for acceptance of the proposition I have put forward. </para>

He is a man who is not without experience of the law. He would know that what is in the Bill is what is going to be held to be the law. Since it involves the rights of other persons, if he is trying to draw some fine point on the Bill it would not matter what 1 said; it could not take away the rights of any person. I think that we should simply , deal with the matter as the Bill stands. There it is. Let there be no gloss upon it. The Bill as it stands is as it is going to be properly interpreted.

            <para>-I think that is right. For once we have the honourable senator conceding that in this country there is to be a rule of law and the law is as it is stated in the statute book. It is not for the law to be determined upon what might be said by the honourable senator from Tasmania or any other honourable senator in this chamber at 1 1.30 on the last night of the sitting but rather upon what is formally enacted in the Act of Parliament itself. That is what the law is and we have the tribunals to interpret it in the case of differences of opinion. We on this side of the chamber would prefer the law to be conducted in that manner rather than by some tortuous interpretation of a dialogue between the honourable senator opposite and myself. </para>

          <para>- This may or may not be a matter of interest to honourable senators. However, it is a matter of great substance. I bring up the report of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary proceedings on the televising of parliamentary proceedings. A statement relating thereto will be incorporated in Hansard, if there is no objection, and I assume that there will not be. (The document read as follows)- </para>

          <para class="block">The Committee commenced its inquiry in May 1973 and since then has taken evidence from some 56 people and has met on 20 separate occasions, lt was the hope of the Committee that the report would be debated in both Houses during the Budget sittings. The present political situation has confused our aims. But I would hope that we can revive the report and that the Houses can vote on the recommendations of the Committee when the Parliament reconvenes. The principle recommendations of the Committee are as follows: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) The Committee has found that it is desirable, in principle, to televise the proceedings of the Parliament; </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>The Committee has recommended that there be a 2-week trial period of closed-circuit televising to enable members to evaluate televising before making a decision on the Committee 's other recommendations. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>The Committee has recommended that there be a telecast of question time on the evening of each sitting day and that there be a weekly summary program produced. The Committee has recommended that these programs be telecast on a national basis by the Australian Broadcasting Commission and that they be produced by a special unit to be known as the Parliamentary Television Unit; </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>Other recommendations of the Committee relate to providing access to Parliamentary video-tapes to all television networks for inclusion of material in news, current affairs and documentary programs; to permitting the televising of committee proceedings and to the liberalising of the present rules governing access to the radio broadcasts. The Committee has laid down draft guidelines which are appended to this report. These guidelines carefully prescribe the manner in which any television program might be produced. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">A dissent has been added to the report by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poke.</inline> If this Parliament or future Parliaments decide not to accept the Committee's recommendations I would still hope that this report together with the evidence which has been accumulated will provide the blue-print for planning for the new Parliament House and for planning for television when it eventually does come. </para>
        <para>Finally, I would like to re-assert my earlier statement. I trust that the Parliament will vote on our recommendations and I would hope that this would be a non-party vote. </para>

              <para>- And very great courage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harry</inline> Cant also will not be standing ibr re-election to the Senate. It is very difficult for any honourable senator who has put so much into his work on behalf of his Party and who has thrown himself with very great enthusiasm into the work of the Parliament and the establishment of the Committee system as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> has, not to seek re-election. As well as being a very great parliamentarian, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> has had a great sense of the institution of Parliament and the way in which it should work. Also from the State of Western Australia is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie</inline> Wilkinson who, I remember, when under much attack at one time showed himself to the consternation of honourable senators opposite to be a great farmer. He has worked quietly and assiduously in the best traditions of this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poke,</inline> who we thought was leaving us, may have the opportunity through the turn of the wheel again to serve in this Parliament. He is held in very high esteem in the State of Tasmania. We on this side of the chamber hope that he returns. I have spoken only briefly about those honourable senators who are leaving the service of the Senate. I hope that I have not left out anyone who is certainly leaving. </para>

              <para>- Yes, and his ministrations. He has given us very great help and wise medical counsel. We will miss him also. We will miss perhaps not so much the other honourable senators who have high hopes of returning. I will not dwell on that aspect. It will not help the smooth passage of the evening. We say to the Opposition as the Senate is to be dissolved and senators are to chance their arm: 'You sought it; you got it; and you will have to put up with it'. I will say no more than that, lest I might be thought to have departed from my usual tolerant self and become provocative. We have spoken in this chamber about what has happened. I deliberately do not want to pursue the remarks which were made earlier. It has not been a very satisfying period for many of us. I will not say any more than that. </para>

          <para>I must say that there has been a great deal of dissatisfaction with the working of this Parliament. Be that as it may, we wish the officers and staff of the Parliament well. I think that we all thoroughly sympathise with the staff who have not been serving us in the last week or so. It is a great pity. Every time we come to the break-up of the Parliament we speak of the staff; yet through some dreadful bureaucratic bungle the staff has been caught up in a way which I am sure you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> the  Speaker  and others would not want. We know that they have not been well treated. We know that has not been the desire of our officers. We hope that this matter will be resolved, because we have a very great regard for them and the way in which they have served us throughout the years. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>again I thank you and wish you well, as I do those on my side, who will return.

I remind them that, due to the beneficence of the Labor Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Cameron has been working on a retraining scheme and he will be willing to supply them with the details of it in order to tide them over the first few months of their new careers. </para>

To those honourable senators going out- be they my own colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Nancy Buttfield or my erstwhile opponents on the Government side, including two from my own State- I just say this: 'Even if you do not think kindly of us personally, please think kindly of the Senate as an institution as you leave us'. </para>

Our usual thanks go to the Clerks and to Hansard. </para>
          <para>I cannot let the opportunity pass without adverting- not in a partisan political sense- to the fact that there has been a reasonable working relationship between the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> and me. We will see him back, but where he will sit we know not. We have had our ups and downs in Opposition as he has had in Government.

              <para>-That is why I had to get glasses. We all this night embark upon the great adventure. I think it is a good thing for democracy that we all go back to the people. We go not unafraid but we welcome it. We will most likely be seeing each other somewhere, perhaps not on the same platform, during the election campaign. I hope that in spite of the political arguments we have here that even during the election campaign we will have the same sort of friendliness and respect, one for another as people, which most of us have in this place. I hope we will maintain this respect during the election campaign no matter for which Party we are campaigning. I think that if we do not go out with that spirit we do not do the Senate much credit. I trust that whomever I meet, no matter where they come from or what policies they espouse, that we can still treat each other like civilised human beings. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I have spoken long enough. It will be interesting to see the view from the other side of the chamber. </para>

            <para>- As a member of the Joint House Committee I am prompted to rise and say a few words because of a remark that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> made when he was thanking the kitchen staff for being- I shall say on strike, but he did not use that word. He went on to say that his reason for thanking them was that he was better fed outside. I take strong exception to those remarks of the Leader of the Opposition. As a member of the Joint House Committee I am one of those persons who feels a certain sense of responsibility for the refreshment room staff. The kitchen staff does a mighty job in this Parliament looking after the people who dine here. I want to say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> that in the future, if he comes back to this place, if he is not satisfied with the fare that is available in the dining room there are plenty of other places for him to go. He does not have to eat there.  His  remarks are quite in keeping with the sentiments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and the feeling of his Party against the people on the lower wage standards in this country. I very much regret that he had to make those remarks. </para>

Also, to the staff who serve us, to all the members of the Senate, particularly the leaders in the difficult job that they have had over the period, we in the Country Party, as one of the minor parties, know the difficulties that are found in a Senate such as this. As one who has been here for some years, I recall with most honourable senators, the most interesting of times that we have had in the last half dozen years in this Senate. It surely has been one of the most interesting times in the history of the Australian Parliament. For those who may be returning, for those who may leave us, the Country Party extends its good wishes to all of them and wishes them well in the next months as they go to the election. It is our wish that as many honourable senators as possible return to this place. </para>

            <para>-On behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> and the members of the Democratic Labor Party I wish to make a few remarks. Firstly, I wish to express our appreciation to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> for your kind kindness and understanding at all times and for the manner in which you have conducted the proceedings of this place. We who sit in this corner are in rather a unique position. We watch the ebb and flow of Government and Opposition. Now the whistle has gone, it is half-time and the parties will probably change ends. We still stand here in the centre to watch the play as it goes in front of us. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This has been a unique Parliament. It has been of very short duration and we have witnessed the advent to government of a party which sat in Opposition for many years. We have witnessed in this period a continuation, under some difficulties, of the committee system which was embarked on with such success and which has played a conspicuous role in the functioning of the Senate. It has given it a new significance in the nation. In that regard I wish to pay particular tribute to 3 retiring Labor senators who have served very conspicuously on committees- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilkinson, Senator Cant</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poke,</inline> who may be leaving us. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> particularly has been a most assiduous committee member. He has been a most competent member and a magnificent organiser. As  Chairman  of the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Ownership and Control, after taking over from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> he has been extremely assiduous in what has been a difficult task. That the report of that Committee has not been presented was because, in many ways, it was beyond his ability to do anything about it. It has not been as a result of any lack of stimulus or enthusiasm on his part. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilkinson</inline>also is a member of that Committee and by his particular interest in the matter under examination has been a most valuable contributor. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poke</inline> joined the Committee after the reconstruction of the Government. These gentlemen, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Nancy Buttfield, who is retiring, and all others carry our very best wishes. There will be some from both sides of the House who unfortunately will not come back. It has been an honour to serve in this place and it has been an honour to be among you. I am sure that whatever may be the outcome everybody feels that it is an honour which cannot be taken from any person who has been a senator in the Parliament of Australia. </para>
          <para>On behalf of the Australian Democratic Labor Party I pay a tribute and express our thanks to all the officers of the Senate and to the staff of the Parliament whose constant attention and assiduousness have made the functioning of this institution possible. Very often we forget that it is due only to the functioning of people such as these in more humble positions that it is possible for others to carry the responsibility of discharging their duties. To them I express our very warm thanks and appreciation. I look forward with confidence to the result of the election in the next few weeks. I am sure that the strength of this Party in this corner will not be reduced. </para>

I think it would be remiss of me if I did not pay a tribute to her 1 8 years of faithful service to South Australia and to Australia in this Senate. I am very proud to associate myself with my Leader in his remarks in her favour.

In addition to commending the work she had done on the committees to which my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> has referred, I want to place on record her contribution to the well-being of public life in South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Nancy Buttfield comes from a distinguished South Australian family. During her representation of the State in this Senate she has applied herself not only to Senate committees concerned with health and welfare, to which references have been made, but also to the total field of political activity. I think that we should take a moment now to recognise that which she has contributed by way of her intellect, her brain and her continued endeavour as well as her constant attention upon the work of committees and the operation of the Senate. I take this opportunity, because I have been her colleague over a number of years, to express my appreciation of what she has done. </para>

            <para>- I will not keep the Senate for more than a few moments. As once again in my political career I have heard predictions of my political demise I feel it is obligatory upon me at least to thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> for your courtesy and your patience with me in particular. I do not suppose I have been a very easy member of Parliament for a  chairman  to deal with. I never have been. But we are all going to an election. We seek the will of the people, and I think we all accept what is happening in that spirit. To those who gaze into crystal balls and seem to find some satisfaction from what they consider to be the certain political demise of their opponents I say this: I would not be happy to know of the involuntary non return of any member of this House. Knowing the facts of politics in this place, such members will probably be replaced by someone who thinks politically very much the same as they do. I have learnt to like most of my associates in this place whatever have been our political opinions, because we are all Australians seeking, I hope to serve Australia and to achieve those things which we think are good for Australia. As we are men- I think that we would not be here unless we were men of some capacity- we do not all think alike. But I do not think that we should learn to dislike one another personally for that. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I issue a word of warning for those with crystal balls who predict my defeat. I have been listening to those predictions for the last 20 years, but somehow or other I am still around. Whilst some people may get some satisfaction out of these predictions let me say that they leave me with no depression at all. I am thoroughly confident. I offer my thanks to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and extend my good wishes to the rest of the Senate in the forthcoming election campaign. I will be back here to bid them welcome when the new Senate is gathering after the forthcoming election. I hope that my colleague, George Hannan, whose involuntary retirement also has been predicted, will be back here amongst us as well. </para>

            <para>- Before I put the question I would like to say on behalf of all honourable senators- I know that I am speaking on behalf of all honourable senators- that it is with an immense amount of regret that the Senate acknowledges that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant, Senator Wilkinson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Nancy Buttfield will not be returning after the election. I was going to include <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poke,</inline> too, but I understand that he is going through a form of levitation. We have all marked the iron courage that has been shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> over the last 1 8 months in the face of the disabling illness from which he has suffered. I went across to Western Australia to see him. He was in great pain but he neither winced nor appeared to complain in one way or another. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have never served on a committee with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilkinson</inline> but I have learnt since he became one of my temporary chairmen to regard him as a man of impeccable manners and as having an impeccable knowledge on how the Senate should be conducted. It is with an immense amount of regret that I note that he will not be back again. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Nancy Buttfield has had a hard road to hoe in what is essentially a male community whose members perhaps do not understand a woman's approach to a problem. Therefore she has had a very difficult task in fulfilling her role. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Nancy Buttfield has not been well either. On several occasions I said that with the consent of the Senate she could speak or ask questions without rising from her seat, but she refused to do so and always said:  No, I am a senator and I will stand on my feet '. </para>
          <para>Next I turn to my old friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald.</inline> I have known him for more years than I am prepared to admit to in the Senate. He also has suffered his disablement with tremendous courage, as has his wife. Therefore I take leave of those four senators tonight with an immense amount of sadness, but I shall carry with me some of the influences that they have exerted on me. I thank honourable senators for all the pleasant things that they have said about the anonymous people who serve the Senate in the Secretariat and those who serve the Parliament in the kitchens, refreshment rooms, bars, barber shops, libraries and printery- the whole combination of people whom perhaps most honourable senators never see. As I remarked on another occasion on the eve of leaving, we do not perhaps understand how much we owe to them. We owe a great deal too- I think that I should make this public acknowledgment- to the difficult role that is ably and honestly fulfilled by the Clerks at the table. </para>
          <para>Finally, I would like to say that I was hoping that I could find some suitable expression in the Book of Exodus, but I could not, because no one knows where the promised land lies. I came to the conclusion that all I can say to honourable senators is: 'Farewell, and I shall see you on the fields of Philippi'. </para>

            <para>-On 14 March 1974, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> a series of questions without notice concerning the history and operations of the Australian Loan Council and the implications for local government bodies of access to the Loan Council arrangements. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Treasurer has advised that the Financial Agreement between the Australian Government and the six State Governments, which formally set up the Loan Council and defined its functions, was agreed on 12 December 1927. Subsequently, the Australian Constitution was altered by the insertion of section 105 A, which was approved by referendum dated 17 November 1928 and was assented to on 15 February 1929. The Agreement was subsequently validated by each of the seven Parliaments. </para>
          <para>The Loan Council comprises representatives of the Australian and State Governments. At its annual meeting, usually in June each year, it determines the amount that can be borrowed by the Australian Governments during the ensuing financial year (except borrowings for defence purposes) on reasonable terms and conditions and divides this amount between the member Governments. It also decides the terms on which loans are raised under the approved borrowing programs of the Australian and State Governments. </para>
          <para>Under the Financial Agreement, all such loans (with limited exceptions) are raised by the Australian Government- both on its own behalf and on behalf of the States. The avoidance of competition between Governments in raising funds and the high credit rating established by the Australian Government as a borrower in both domestic and overseas markets have helped to minimise borrowing costs. </para>
          <para>There is also a voluntary arrangement, known as the Gentlemen's Agreement, between members of the Loan Council designed to regulate borrowings by semi-government bodies and local authorities. </para>
          <para>It is not possible to forecast with any precision the effect on the amount of loan money available from the market of giving local government direct access to the Loan Council arrangements. However, in so far as borrowings which would otherwise have been undertaken direct by local government borrowers were to be undertaken by the Australian Government on their behalf, the cost of these borrowings could be expected to be lower. </para>

            <para>-On 8 April 1974, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> asked me for details of arrangements which are in operation to interview officers of the Department of Customs and Excise in Canberra concerning applications for ad hoc by-laws. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Department receives a large number of such applications. In 1969, when the arrangements referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> came into operation, 33,600 applications were received. Because of the <inline font-style="italic">necessity to make decisions</inline> without delay to meet the needs of the commercial community it was decided that some limitation had to be placed on the time available to interview applicants, to enable a definite part of the day to be set aside to consider these applications. As a result officers split their day so that they conduct interviews in the morning and have the rest of the day undisturbed to finalise these matters. </para>
          <para>At the present time over 13,000 applications a year are being received. The reduction has been achieved by the procedure also introduced in 1969, to issue standing by-laws so far as possible, so that once a by-law has been granted other people desiring to import the same equipment automatically receive by-law. Even with these reduced numbers, the previous arrangements of releasing officers from interviews in the afternoon has been found to be most appropriate and enables the by-law system to operate with the minimum of delay. </para>
          <para>I might mention that very few complaints of these arrangements have been received in the last five years. </para>
