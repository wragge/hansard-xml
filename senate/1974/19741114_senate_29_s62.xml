            <para class="block">To the Honourable the  President  and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: </para>
            <para>That the reduction of the allowable deduction of education expenses under Section 82 J of the Income Tax assessment Act from $400 to $150 is $50.00 below the 1956/57 figure. </para>
            <para>That this reduction will impose hardships on many parents who have children attending school, whether non government or government; and particularly on parents with more than one child at school. </para>
            <para>That this reduction will further restrict the freedom available to parents to make a choice of school for their children. </para>
            <para>That some parents who have chosen to send their children to a non-government school will have to withdraw their children and send them to government schools already over crowded and understaffed! </para>
            <para>That the parents to benefit most relatively from educational income tax deductions, in the past and even more in the future, are the parents of children in government schools and this has a divisive effect in the Australian community. </para>
            <para>That parents should be encouraged by the Australian government to exercise freedom of choice of the type of school they wish for their children. The proposed reduction means an additional financial penalty is imposed on parents who try to exercise this choice and discourages them from making an important financial contribution to Australian education over and above what they contribute through taxation. </para>
            <para>That an alternative system, a tax rebate system, could be adopted as being more equitable for all parents with children at school. </para>
            <para class="block">To compensate for the losses that will follow from the proposed reduction and to help meet escalating educational costs faced by all families your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should take immediate steps to restore educational benefits to parents, at least at the 1973/74 level either by increasing taxation deductions or through taxation rebates. </para>

After all, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate may believe that when his Government was in power it had only one breath and that was its last. We believe that there will be one breathing space, as the Prime Minister has said; that there will be another after that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cameron</inline> has said; that there will be many more and that the community will go on breathing and living under this Government. The honourable senator&#39;s Party has breathed its last and will not get back into power until it has changed its constitution, its policies and even its name. </para>

            <para>-The answer to the first part of the question is no. We have had great cooperation from and satisfaction with the Queensland Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders Legal Service which is operating throughout Queensland. We have received the final audited accounts of the Service and the audited accounts contain no qualifications. Last year a grant of some $325,000 was made to the Legal Service in Queensland. So far this year we have issued an interim grant of $174,000 to take the Service up to the end of October. At present the Legal Service in Queensland has 8 offices, one each in Brisbane, Rockhampton, Mackay, Townsville, Mt Isa, Charleville, the far northern and the south-eastern areas. We have received and perused its audited budget for 1974-75 and it appears to be reasonable considering the wide area traversed by that Legal Service. Last year in Queensland 730 legal cases were handled by the Service and some of these involved the employment of outside solicitors. There were some 766 further cases handled by the Service which never proceeded to court hearings. After considering the audited accounts of the Service and its budget for 1974-75, some $523,000, less the $174,000 which has already been granted by way of interim grant, will be made available to the Queensland Service. </para>

            <para>- There were discussions between the Prime Minister and the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and the Leader of the Country Party in the Senate is well aware of them. I am not able to say, and even if I were I do not know whether I would, what were the precise agreements or understandings reached. The honourable senator wants to know who will be responsible, the Government or the trade unions, if there is some deterioration in the economic position. That illustrates his outlook, and that of his Party; if something goes wrong it is the fault of either the Government or the trade unions. I remind the Leader of the Country Party in the Senate that the Government took some very strong action last year in cutting the tariffs and the result was not what the Government hoped it would be. Despite the fact that the Country Party was a great advocate of cutting tariffs, it did not complain when the result that was expected did not flow. One of the tragedies was that when the tariffs were cut there was a great inflow of imported goods which ought to have been made available cheaply to the Australian public. We know that in many cases the benefits of the tariff cuts were not passed on to the community, thereby contributing to and enhancing inflation. The Leader of the Country Party in the Senate has not condemned those in the community who profited unfairly from the tariff cuts. He has not turned to others who have made excessive profits. All he wants to do is to blame either the Government or the trade unions. That is the reason he is sitting where he is sitting now. </para>

            <para>-I am not aware of the statement allegedly made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hill</inline> and, of course, that does not come within the ambit of my portfolio. However, the general question of Australia as a market for dairy products certainly has been a bone of contention for many years. Because New Zealand was able to produce its dairy products more cheaply than they could be produced in this country these products, particularly butter, could be supplied to the Austraiian market at a cheaper price than if they were produced in Australia. This Government changed the ridiculous attitude that had applied in the past in this country towards assistance for the Australian dairy industry- a policy which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> has defended in this Senate on so many occasions knowing full well that it was dragging the Australian dairy industry down over the years in most States of Australia and creating inefficiencies which made it impossible for it to compete with the New Zealand dairy industry. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The action taken by this Government to redirect the assistance to the dairy industry in this country is the greatest safeguard the industry has against competition from overseas countries. We recognise that the New Zealand dairy industry is an efficient industry. We endeavour on all occasions, as did the previous Government, to maximise our trade with New Zealand under the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement. I have no doubt that this will continue to be the case under this Government. In respect of the particular statement referred to, I will check to see whether it was made, but I am quite sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> would not wish to add anything to what I have said. </para>

            <para>- I would like to ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Education. It concerns retraining grants. Will the Minister advise whether it would be possible for, say, the wife of a university professor earning about $28,000 per annum, she being in receipt of a sizeable private income, to apply for and receive a retraining grant? If the answer is in the affirmative, will the Minister say what means test, if any, is applied to such a person and indeed to anyone else? How much study has to be undertaken by the recipient? Over what length of time can a grant be received? What would happen if, at the end of such a retraining period, the person changed her mind? Would she be eligible to apply for another grant? Does she have to do any work in the field in which she is retrained? </para>

            <para>- I am sure that the honourable senator will appreciate that the information he seeks does not come immediately to my mind. Frankly, I doubt very much that any of the criteria on which he is basing his question are correct. He said that the salary of a university professor is about $28,000 a year. If my recollection is correct, the basic salary of a university professor is about $ 19,000 a year. So I suggest that the honourable senator should check that fact first before he hypothesises all the other matters. I also suggest that the honourable senator place his question on the notice paper so that I can obtain a reply from the Minister for Education. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Carrick</inline>suggests that the general grants are up 22 per cent. The information that has just been given to me by one of my colleagues is that, in general, the grants are up. That covers more than the general purpose grants. It covers specific grants as well. The grants are up by about 30 per cent. In any event there has been a very substantial improvement in the allocation by the Australian Government to the States through Parliament. I think it is proper that the specific question raised in relation to South Australia be answered by the Treasurer and I will refer it to him. </para>

              <para>- It is very difficult if we are going to say that they should not respond even to proper pressure. If there is anything wrong with the pressure then it is not proper. This is getting into a foolish hair splitting of words. The substance of the question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is a suggestion, which I think is improper, against those who compose the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the Prices Justification Tribunal. The fact is that these men have been appointed to carry out their duties and they will carry them out. I think that everyone, with the exception of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, would have confidence in the ability and integrity of these men. </para>

Until that announcement was made yesterday there was a total of 42 projects which had been approved. The total cost of these projects will be $2m. Of that amount almost $ 1.75m was provided by the Government. The measures are designed to assist not only local councils but also sporting bodies etc. </para>

The Government&#39;s policy is that consideration should be given to the conducting of a feasibility study to consider the establishment of an Australian newspaper commission along the lines of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. As I understand it, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> has said that he is in favour of consideration being given to the establishment of a newspaper commission.

            <para>- My question which is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer refers to the various financial measures taken by the Federal Government in the 8 weeks since the announcement of the Federal Budget, including the latest mini-budget, specifically the devaluation, and the additional expenditure announced late yesterday afternoon, belatedly, on sewerage, and various other items. I refer also to the statement yesterday that the Budget deficit is now expected to be $ 1,300m. I ask: Does the $ 1,300m projected record deficit include provision for the substantially increased cost due to devaluation? Is the Minister aware that the estimated additional costs for one Department alone- the Department of Foreign Affairs- as supplied to Senate Estimates Committee B is of the order of $14m? Do not the latest figures for current government expenditure, as announced today, showing a 39 per cent increase on the previous year, challenge all the basic assumptions, particularly on inflation, embodied in the Budget? Finally, will the Government submit to the Parliament as a matter of urgency, by the resumption of the sittings next week, a full statement of proposed expenditure and revenue for the year 1974-75, revised to include all additional expenditure commitments and revenue forecasts since the Budget, and indicating the specific additional costs, including devaluation? </para>

In view of the fact that there are only about 6,000 such licences and that many of these licences are held by either elderly or handicapped people, and as the extra revenue derived from this source would be only $36,000 a year, I ask: Will the Minister give consideration to reverting to the $6 licence fee, especially in view of the points that I have mentioned and also because of the sterling work undertaken by many of these people in times of emergency without their receiving any pecuniary reward? </para>

            <para>- The recommendation of the Post Office to me was that the cost of servicing and of setting up the various administrative, training and examination personnel to do the job was of such magnitude that there ought to be some increase. The increase is not massive. I accepted the recommendation for those reasons. I do not know whether it is possible to consider special cases. If the honourable senator will give me particulars of what he considers to be special cases I will see to what extent I can advocate any change in relation to them. </para>

          <para>- I direct my question to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. I draw the Minister&#39;s attention to the low placement on the Senate notice paper of the further consideration of the Family Law Bill and the higher priority to be given to some other Bills of lesser urgency recently received from the other place. In view of the results of a recent public opinion poll reported in this week&#39;s &#39;Bulletin&#39; which showed overwhelming support for the major principles of the Bill, will the Minister give an assurance that the continuance of the debate on the Bill will receive high priority on the notice paper next week? </para>

            <para>-No, there is not. I assure the honourable senator that I was hoping that the Appropriation Bills would not have taken the length of time that they have taken to debate. I was hoping that, had the Appropriation Bills been dealt with on Tuesday of this week, we would have had yesterday to deal with the Family Law Bill. However, my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> assures me that so far as his administration is concerned there is quite some urgency involved in the Government&#39;s having the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill and the Aboriginal Loans Commission Bill passed. Therefore after the Appropriation Bills have been dealt with and as in the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> urgent consideration is required of these measures by the Parliament, those 2 Bills have been allotted next priority. </para>

        <para>I am given to understand in discussions with the Leader of the Opposition that there will be very little debate on orders of the day Nos 5, 6 and 7. Because it was understood that there would be very little debate on those Bills we decided to give them their present position on the notice paper. I assure the honourable senator though that, so far as I am personally concerned in my role as Manager of Government Business in the Senate, it is my earnest desire to accede to the wishes especially of the Leader of the Government in the Senate. As soon as it is possible, having regard to Government legislative priorities the Family Law Bill will again be brought to the Senate for debate. </para>

I refer to the new guidelines affecting the operations of the Prices Justification Tribunal and I ask: Will the Tribunal be placed in a dilemma by having on the one hand to permit higher profit levels and on the other to honour its statutory responsibility to control the level of price rises? Does the Prime Minister&#39;s announcement support widespread criticism by companies and business organisations of Tribunal decisions? </para>

            <para>- I do not accept the simple way in which the honourable senator has stated the position of the Tribunal and the criteria to which it will pay account. I think the various factors that have to be considered are ones which the Tribunal can well consider, as it is specially skilled in dealing with such matters. It is not a matter of higher profits that was spoken of by the Prime Minister. As I recall it, it was a question of taking into account the capacity of businesses to engage in investment. I do not think there is anything in the Prime Minister&#39;s statement which would give support to any criticism of the Tribunal. I think the community has been pleased at the way in which it has operated. That we can have a tribunal which is able to make decisions which, while not carrying any sanction, have been observed by the community has been a singular experiment. We hope that this kind of procedure will continue successfully. I think that the Tribunal, with the special talents of its members, will be able to continue to operate. As its operations extend I think it will help to counter in Australia the effects of the world wide inflation. </para>

            <para>-I understand that the Prime Minister has spelt out some details on this matter in the last few days. He indicated that that amount of money had been made available to various local authorities throughout Australia. I believe the amounts range from as low as $3,000 to as high as $2m, the sum paid to the Brisbane City Council which received the largest amount. I also understand that no strings are attached to these payments- that the local authorities can use them as they see fit without any directions being given by the Australian Government. I think that is evidence of the fact that this Government is pursuing the policies which it initiated of providing finance for local government in this country. </para>

What form will this food aid take? Will it be solely wheat or mixed grains or will it involve meat in processed form? Is it true that the Minister now asserts that our commitment made at the World Food Congress was only approximately $ 1 9m? If that is the case, why was a note bearing the Minister&#39;s letterhead pinned on the Press gallery board this week saying that the commitment was $30m? Did the Minister in an interview on Sunday last say that the commitment was $30m? In view of this disparity, will the Minister advise the Senate of the true position, re-check his figures and recheck the price he recently paid for a pair of gumboots? </para>

            <para>- As the honourable senator would be aware, sugar does come within the responsibilities of the Minister for Northern Development. But it is true that the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement will expire and it is my understanding that the 2 Governments are still negotiating for a renewal of that Agreement. Insofar as it affects the FISCC prices for fruit, that is a matter which also is under consideration as various suggestions have been made both by the sugar industry and by the canned fruits industry. The Government will be making a decision this week on the question of rebates. </para>

Is it correctly estimated, as published in today&#39;s &#39;Canberra Times&#39; by that newspaper&#39;s aviation correspondent, that the cost of the Prime Minister&#39;s trip to Europe in the near future in a chartered Qantas Boeing 707/32 1C jet airliner will approximate $500,000? Is this the type of extravagance in which the national Government should indulge in view of the prospect of Australia suffering a record deficit of over $ 1,300m? </para>

            <para>-The ways in which one can work out the cost of VIP aircraft or chartered government aircraft are quite extraordinary. Apparently one can juggle figures and do whatever one wants to with them. In respect of VIP aircraft we on both sides of the chamber now know what the facts are. The planes are there. They would be consuming fuel in training exercises and all sorts of other things that have to be done. The use of Qantas aircraft involves payment to a government instrumentality and largely, whatever else might be done, it amounts to a transferring of accounts. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There are some very important considerations to which the honourable senator has not referred. When a leader of a nation is travelling around the world at a time when there are terrorists and when the hijacking of aircraft is occurring the protection of the leader- in this case the Prime Minister- and of those who go with him has to be considered. Another extremely important consideration is the protection of other persons if a Prime Minister or a leader of a nation travels on an ordinary aircraft. Not only is there the question of protection; there is also the question of the disruption of affairs if a leader of a nation travels in that way. I think the honourable senator ought to realise that there are a great number of considerations- extremely important considerations- that touch on such a matter. </para>
          <para>To dismiss this as some kind of extravagance and to try to work out what it will cost is wrong. I would ask the honourable senator to reflect on the matter and to suggest what he would do when the leader of a nation has to travel overseas. In view of the circumstances and the very serious considerations which are put to a government by those who have the responsibility, does the honourable senator really think that the leader of a nation should travel in some other way? It is true the Prime Minister&#39;s predecessors travelled in the same way as leaders of other nations travelled. The Leader of the Opposition ought to know that circumstances have changed. There has been a necessity to change modes of travel and other practices all over the world. </para>

            <para>-The honourable senator has put to me a question on the basis of his being the Prime Minister of Australia. I remind the Senate that I should not answer hypothetical questions. Let me stress what I said recently, although it ought to be quite evident: The Prime Minister of this country and the other Ministers must travel in the interests of Australia. We are one of the great trading nations of the world. A great deal of the prosperity, stability and security of Australia depends on the arrangements that are made with other countries. Australia, perhaps more than most other countries, is intimately tied up with the affairs of other countries. The decisions that are made overseas, whether on the purchase of sugar or meat or other arrangements with Australia, greatly affect the prosperity of this country. If the Opposition&#39;s sole contribution to the solution of Australia&#39;s problems is to say that we ought to cut off these international contacts and that our Ministers should not be trying to meet leaders of other nations or trying to enter into beneficial arrangements, whether for the purchase of our minerals or other products, and making reciprocal agreements to deal with a multitude of problems which arise from trading arrangements, from financial arrangements, from the various dealings with currency and the various problems and frictions which arise, I think it is an illustration of its incapacity to understand the problems of modern Government. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">This Bill comes to the Senate in a form which is somewhat different from its original form. It now includes amendments which were inserted by the Government in another place in an attempt to clearly spell out the Government&#39;s intentions with this measure. These intentions have been the subject of some misunderstanding, to say the least, in recent weeks. The Government, by this legislation, basically is seeking to remove any legal doubt about whether or not the Australian Broadcasting Control Board has power to carry out its functions and to exercise its powers under the existing Act. </para>
          <para>I think it is fair to say that the Opposition in another place, through the form of amendments it moved to this Bill, has indicated an awareness that it is universally accepted practice throughout the world that the privileges granted to licensees of radio and television stations are subject to regulation by Government or Government bodies in the public interest. Certainly that practice has been accepted in this country ever since the establishment of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in 1948. </para>
          <para>Unfortunately, however, the advice tendered to the Government, and also tendered to the previous Government, is that the instrument by which this regulatory process was initiated- that is, the Broadcasting and Television Act- contains several defects of major significance. The major purpose of this legislation is simply to remedy these defects. As is the case with many pieces of legislation brought before the Parliament, it is possible to achieve the general intention of the Government in a number of different ways, but it is important that the method which is decided upon by this Parliament to remedy defects in existing legislation should be a method which minimises the possibility of further legal doubts being raised. </para>
          <para>With legislation of this kind the Government accepts that it is important that the method chosen to amend the legislation should be one which offers the best safeguards against possible abuse of power. To this end the Government will be proposing a further amendment to the legislation to ensure that any rules or standards determined by the Broadcasting Control Board, or the Australian Broadcasting Authority as it is to be known, will be subject to scrutiny by the Parliament in the same way as regulations. This is a matter on which I would like to go into more detail shortly, but at this stage I think it is important to make it clear that the Government believes that if this amendment is accepted there can be no valid justification for any suggestion that the Bill opens up the possibility of dictatorial control of the media. On the other hand, I should also make it plain that the Government believes that if the defects in the existing Act are not remedied, the Australian community faces a serious situation. </para>
          <para>The problems I am referring to arise from two particular points which in the opinion of the Government require urgent attention. The first concerns the powers of the Broadcasting Control Board to regulate appropriately the programs of commercial broadcasting and television stations. This power existed in the Act until it was amended in 1956. Prior to that time it was provided that stations must present programs &#39;to the satisfaction of the Board&#39;, but in 1956 this was amended to provide that stations&#39; programs must comply &#39;with standards determined by the Board&#39;. In recent years some stations have challenged the Board&#39;s powers in the programming area by relying on a narrow legal definition of the word &#39;standards&#39;, and the Government&#39;s legal advisers have confirmed that this approach may have some validity. The Board has consistently drawn attention to this lack in its powers of the past 7 years, but no action was taken by the previous Government to correct the anomaly. The relevant section of the Act is section 16, which sets out the powers and functions of the Board. The major function of the Board is stated in that section to be: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To ensure that adequate and comprehensive programs are provided by commercial broadcasting stations and commercial television stations to serve the best interests of the general public. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Unfortunately, however, the Act does not provide the Board with a power comparable to that function. The proposed amendments to section 16, which are included in clause 6 of the Bill I now present, specifically provide the Board with a general power to carry out all its functions. Further, it inserts two new specific powers. The first will become paragraph (e) of sub-section </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>of section 16, and provides that the Board shall have power to determine rules and standards to be observed by licensees in relation to commercial broadcasting and television programs. The second new power is provided by the new sub-section (3A) which specifically provides power to the Broadcasting Authority to determine, subject to the Minister&#39;s approval, requirements with regard to programs of Australian origin. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Under amendments moved by the Government in another place it has now been spelt out in the Bill that any rules laid down by the Broadcasting Authority shall be of general application and may not unfairly discriminate against a particular station or particular stations. The two new powers I have referred to will place beyond question the powers which, I think it is fair to say, the general public, and indeed the Parliament, have always thought the Board to have. I believe they should be generally welcomed within the industry itself as putting these matters which have been the subject of disputation beyond doubt. </para>
          <para>Under section 16 of the present Act it is provided that representatives of commercial broadcasting and television stations shall be consulted by the Broadcasting Control Board in the exercise of its functions and powers as outlined in that section. This, of course, is one safeguard that licensees have and will retain under the present Bill. The Bill also provides, however, that the Broadcasting Authority shall consult such other persons as it considers appropriate. The intention here is to extend consultation to representatives of the trade unions in the media industries and to other organisations that might be interested in radio and television services. Some concern has been expressed in recent years that the only consultation required under the Act has been consultation with the licensees or their representatives. This obviously could result in a one-sided approach to the industry and the Government believes it is certainly more consistent with democratic principles to amend the Act to ensure wider consultation. </para>
          <para>The second important matter which is dealt with in the Bill is contained in clause 1 1 which has been amended at the Government&#39;s request in another place. The clause now provides that instead of the present licence renewal period of 12 months, licences may be renewed for variable periods ranging from 6 months to 3 years. An identical proposal for variable licence renewal periods was put forward by the previous Government in 1972. In the circumstances, the Government believes this proposal as amended naturally should be acceptable to both sides of the </para>
          <para class="block">Senate. The amendment by the Government of the lower limit for licence renewals follows discussions I have had with representatives of the television industry since the Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives, who suggested that the 3-month period would raise some practical administrative difficulties for them. I accept that point of view, but would simply point out at this stage that a variation in licence renewal periods will hold considerable advantages for the overwhelming majority of licensees who comply with the requirements of the Act. </para>
          <para>I think honourable senators will be aware that the majority of other amendments proposed in this Bill are largely of a machinery nature or are amendments complementary to the measures I have outlined. Detailed discussions of such measures are perhaps best dealt with at the Committee stage of consideration of this Bill. At this time, however, I want to deal with an important amendment the Government will propose in the Committee stage. This amendment was foreshadowed by my colleague the Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morrison)</inline> in the debate in another place. He indicated that the Government saw some merit in the apparent intention of an amendment proposed by the Opposition in that debate. The intention appears to have been to subject the powers of the Broadcasting Authority to the scrutiny of the Parliament, insofar as they deal with the regulation of the hours of transmissions, of programs and of advertising. Certainly, this Government&#39;s policy has always been to provide for adequate Parliamentary supervision of the activities of Government bodies and agencies. My own personal philosophy as a parliamentarian has prompted me to seek adequate provision for Parliamentary responsibility wherever this is possible. In this Bill, I believe this is both possible and highly desirable. </para>
          <para>The program and advertising standards of the Broadcasting Control Board have never been subject to full parliamentary scrutiny in the past. The previous Government made no provision for this in the Broadcasting and Television Act on any of the numerous occasions when it sought to amend the Act in its 23 years in government. The Labor Government, however, accepts the desirability of such a measure, and will propose it in debate on this Bill. In the Committee stage, I will move an amendment that will require that the determinations of the Broadcasting Authority relating to hours of transmission, rules and standards for programs and conditions for the broadcasting or televising of advertisements will be subject not only to Parliamentary scrutiny, but also to disallowance by either House of the </para>
          <para class="block">Parliament. The amendment will require the Authority&#39;s determinations to be tabled in both Houses of Parliament and subject to the same treatment as regulations. I believe that this amendment will provide genuine safeguards for freedom of expression, by providing an ultimate appeal for all individuals to the Parliament itself. The activities of the Australian Broadcasting Authority will be properly open for inspection and discussion by the Parliament to which it is responsible as a statutory body. </para>
          <para>The Austraiian people have always believed that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board should be clothed with adequate powers to ensure that the highest possible standards are maintained by commercial broadcasting and television stations. Likewise the Government believes it has a responsibility to ensure that those who have sought to employ their creative, technical and performing talents in the media industries in Australia should have continuity and security of employment and expanding opportunities for the use of their talents in their own country. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">The main purpose of this Bill is to authorise the payment in 1974-75 of special grants of $24.7 5m to Queensland and $23.5m to South Australia. These payments are in accordance with the recommendations of the Grants Commission contained in its forty-first report on Special Assistance for States, which has been tabled by the Special Minister of State <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen).</inline> The Bill also seeks the usual authority for payment of advances to the 2 States in the early months of 1975-76, pending receipt of the Commission&#39;s recommendations for that year and enactment of legislation to provide for the grants to be paid in that year. The Australian Government makes special grants to certain of the States to compensate them for such factors as lower capacity to raise revenue from their own resources and higher costs in providing government services of a standard similar to those in the financially stronger States. </para>
          <para>When special grants were first paid they constituted the only regular form of general revenue assistance paid to the financially weaker States for this purpose. For many years now, however, the main way in which special compensatory assistance has been provided has been through the higher per capita financial assistance grants paid to the 4 less populous States. The financial assistance grants are, of course, the main general revenue grants to the States. The special grants may, therefore, be regarded as supplementing the financial assistance grants, and as having the special characteristic of being independently as well as expertly assessed by the Grants Commission. In arriving at its recommendations, the Grnats Commission makes an assessment of the financial needs&#39; of the claimant States. To qualify these needs, the Commission compares in detail the finances of each claimant State with those of New South Wales and Victoria, taking into account differences in revenue-raising capacity and differences in the cost of providing comparable services. </para>
          <para>This year, the Commission has used a new method for assessing the appropriate amounts of special grants and for presenting its results. This matter is referred to in detail in paragraphs 3.16 through 3.30 of its report. Very briefly, however, this new method- which the Australian Treasury has been advocating for some years- involves a more direct, and it is believed more easily understood, approach to the assessment of the grants. The method is also consistent with that adopted by the Commission in reporting on claims for financial assistance by local governing bodies. I should mention, however, that this change in method does not reflect any change in the basic principles on which the Commission operates. They remain as first enunciated in the Commission&#39;s Third Report. Nor has the change in method affected the size of the grants. It is, nevertheless, an important development in the </para>
          <para class="block">Commission&#39;s work, and one which the Government warmly welcomes. The Commission has continued to refine and improve its procedures in other respects. These are referred to in its report and I shall not attempt to summarise them here. </para>
          <para>The recommendations of the Grants Commission for payment of special grants consist of 2 parts. One part is based on a preliminary estimate of the claimant State &#39;s financial need in the current financial year, and is treated as an advance payment subject to adjustment 2 years later when the Commission has compared in detail the finances of the claimant and standard States. The other part represents the final adjustment to the advance payment made 2 years earlier and is known as the completion payment. This adjustment may be positive or negative and therefore may result in the final grant in respect of that year being higher or lower than the original advance payment. </para>
          <para>The Commission has recommended that an advance payment of $15m be made to Queensland in 1974-75- an increase of 50 per cent on that made for 1973-74- and that a completion payment of $9.75m be paid to the State in respect of 1972-73. For South Australia, the Commission has recommended the payment of special grants totalling $23.5m, made up of an advance payment of $15m for 1974-75- the same amount as in 1973-74- and a completion payment of $8.5m in respect of 1972-73. The 1974-75 advance grants to each of the 2 States will, of course, be subject to adjustment, if necessary, in 1976-77. </para>
          <para>Since a similar Bill was presented last year, Tasmania, which had applied continuously for special grants on the recommendation of the Commission from 1934-35 to 1973-74, has withdrawn from the special grants system following the Australian Government&#39;s agreement to pay the State an additional financial assistance grant of $ 1 5m in 1 974-7 5 , to be built into the &#39; base &#39; for purposes of calculating the State&#39;s formula grants in 1975-76 and subsequent years. This increase in the State&#39;s financial assistance grant has been provided for in the States Grants Bill 1974, which has now been passed by both Houses. In accordance with arrangements agreed between the Australian and Tasmanian Governments, the Grants Commission has not recommended a completion payment in respect of the advance grant paid to the State in 1972-73 and has agreed not to recommend a completion payment next year in respect of 1973-74; as a consequence, there is no provision for a payment to Tasmania in this Bill. </para>
          <para>Finally, I wish to take this opportunity to refer to the retirement of the  Chairman  of the Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Leslie</inline> Melville, on 30 September last and wish to place on record the Government&#39;s appreciation of his services in this and other spheres during a long and most distinguished career. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Else-Mitchel will replace <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Leslie</inline> as  Chairman  of the Commission. The Commission&#39;s recommendations have been adopted by Parliament each year since the Commission&#39;s inception and the Government considers that they should be accepted on this occasion. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the payment of capital grants to the States in 1 974-75 totalling $326,618,000. This amount represents the grant component of the State governments&#39; Loan Council programs for 1974-75 and is equal to 32. 1 per cent of the total programs excluding the temporary allocation of $9,919,000 for Queensland for flood restoration purposes- the same percentage share as in 1973-74. The Bill also provides for the payment of capital grants in the first 6 months of 1975-76 up to an amount equal to one half of the 1974-75 amount pending passage of similar legislation in that year. Payments authorised under this Bill may be made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or from the Loan Fund, and appropriate borrowing authority is included. </para>
          <para>Following arrangements settled at the June 1970 Premiers Conference, the Australian Government undertook to provide, on a continuing basis, a portion of the State Government&#39;s </para>
          <para class="block">Loan Council programs in the form of interestfree grants in lieu of what would otherwise be borrowings by the States, in order to help the States finance capital works, such as schools, police buildings and the like, from which debt charges are not normally recovered. The savings to the States in debt charges arising from the capital grants are estimated to have totalled $74.8m. to the end of 1973-74, and to amount to $59m. in 1974-75. </para>
          <para>At its meeting in June 1974, the Loan Council approved programs for the State Governments totalling $934,919,000, consisting of a basic program of $925,000,000 and a temporary borrowing allocation of $9,919,000 for Queensland to finance the additional cost of restoring flooddamaged assets to above their pre-flood standard and to cover the cost of re-siting and constructing new assets to replace old assets destroyed or abandoned because of flood damage. In September 1974 the Australian Government proposed and the State Governments agreed that the basic program should be increased, by 10 per cent, to $1,017,500,000. This increase is to be formally approved at a subsequent meeting of the Loan Council. </para>
          <para>The basic program for 1974-75 takes into account estimated capital expenditures of which the States would be relieved in that year as a result of the Australian Government&#39;s assumption of full responsibility for financing tertiary education from 1 January 1974. The reduction for 1974-75 agreed at the June 1973 Premiers Conference /Loan Council meeting is $65.4m. These arrangements complicate comparisons between 1973-74 and 1974-75 but when adjustments are made to take these differences into account the 1974-75 basic program for each State is 20 per cent greater than the 1973-74 program. The basic program of $1,017,500,000 is made up of borrowings totalling $690,882,000 and capital grants to be provided by the Australian Government of $326,6 1 8,000. </para>
          <para>At its June 1974 meeting the Loan Council also approved an increase of $70m, or 12.4 per cent, to $636,084,000 in the borrowing programs for State authorities classified as &#39;larger&#39; authorities for this purpose. In 1973-74 these were semigovernment and local authorities whose individual borrowings for the year exceeded $400,000. For 1974-75 the Loan Council agreed to increase this amount to $500,000. There is no overall limit on borrowings of authorities whose individual borrowings amount to $500,000 or less. The larger authorities program includes a permanent addition of $10,000,000 to the New </para>
          <para class="block">South Wales allocation and temporary allocations of $9,584,000 for Queensland for restoration of flood-damaged assets to above their pre-flood standard and $6,000,000 for Western Australia under arrangements made between the Australian and Western Australian Governments. </para>
          <para>Overall, the funds available to the States and their authorities in 1974-75 for capital purposes from Loan Council borrowing programs, Australian Government general purpose and specific purpose payments and from estimated borrowings by smaller authorities are estimated to amount to over $3,390m or about one-third more than in 1973-74. Of this amount, the Australian Government will provide or support more than $2,579m or over 40 per cent more than in 1973- 74. Further details concerning the Loan Council programs of the States and their authorities for 1974-75 may be found in chapter III of the Budget document &#39;Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities </para>
          <para class="block">1974- 75&#39;. </para>
          <para>Turning to the details of the Bill, clause 3 authorises the payment of grants to the States totalling $326,618,000 in 1974-75 and clause 4 authorises the Treasurer to make advance payments in the first 6 months of 1975-76 at the same annual rate as in the current financial year. The amounts for each State are set out in the Schedule to the Bill. Under clause 5 of the Bill payments may be made either from Consolidated Revenue Fund or Loan Fund and clause 9 provides for the necessary appropriation of these funds. The extent to which the payments will be met from Loan Fund will depend on borrowings during the year, which cannot be estimated in advance. Clauses 6 and 7 of the Bill authorise the Treasurer to borrow funds in the period from the commencement of the Act to the end of December 1975, up to the total of the amounts of the grants payable in 1974-75 and in the first 6 months of 1975-76. This borrowing authority will be reduced by the amount of any borrowings made before the commencement of this Act, under the authority of the States Grants (Capital Assistance) Act 1973, which may have been used to finance grants made in the first 6 months of 1974-75. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para>This Bill will give effect to the Budget proposal to increase the rate of pay-roll tax in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. The present rate of 4Vi per cent will be increased to 5 per cent from 1 December 1974. Since the transfer of the tax to the States in September 1971 pay-roll tax has been payable in respect of salaries and wages related to the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory under legislation applying only in the Territories. Since 1 July 1974 the Territory rate has been 4Vi per cent, the same rate as levied by the States from 1 September 1973. </para>
          <para>Following the Premiers Conference last June the Premiers foreshadowed an increase to 5 per cent in the rate of pay-roll tax in the States. This rate has been operative in each State as from 1 September 1974. There is no good reason why Territory employers should not be called upon to meet taxes and charges comparable with those borne by employers in the States. Accordingly, this Bill will bring the Territory rate into line with the rate applying in the States. The increase to 5 per cent will apply first to wages payable on and after 1 December 1974 and included in pay-roll tax returns due for lodgement on 7 January 1 975. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

Before we give permission for the second reading speech on this Bill to be incorporated in Hansard, I should like to lodge a complaint. A moment ago I wanted to speak on the first reading of the Pay-Roll Tax (Territories) Bill 1974. This Bill, together with the second reading speech, has just now been placed in front of me. I believe that we should have these documents in our hands before the first or second readings take place or before we give permission for the second reading speeches to be incorporated in Hansard, otherwise how are honourable senators to know whether it is a tax Bill and whether they have the opportunity to speak on the first reading? Will the Government please take some action on this matter so that in future we will know and will have the opportunity to speak when we want to do so. </para>

              <para>- I will read the second reading speech. The purpose of the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill is to authorise the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> to pay to the States this year the sum of $3 10m for welfare housing in accordance with the provisions of the 1973 Housing Agreement. It will be distributed among the States as follows: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>New South Wales, $96,411,000; Victoria, $81,159,000; Queensland, $27,410,000; South Australia, $45,360,000; Western Australia, $35,440,000; and Tasmania $24,220,000-a total of $3 10,000,000. </para>
          <para>Taking into account that approximately $25m of the $218,650,000 advanced to the States in 1 973-74 was not spent, this allocation will permit an increase in expenditure this year of $1 16,350,000, or 60 per cent, over 1973-74. </para>
          <para>The Bill also authorises the Treasurer to pay to the States in the first 6 months of 1975-76 the sum of $ 1 55m, which is half the allocation to be appropriated for 1974-75, and it will be distributed on the same basis as the advances for the current year. This authority will enable the Treasurer to continue payments to the States for welfare housing in the period from 1 July 1975 until an appropriation measure for 1975-76 is passed by the Parliament. </para>
          <para>The advances to be authorised by the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill are repayable over a period of 53 years. The rate of interest payable on advances during the full 5 year term of the Agreement is fixed at 4 per cent per annum in respect of advances allocated to the State Housing Authorities and 4% per cent per annum in respect of advances allocated to the Home Builders&#39; Accounts of the States. The repayable interest bearing advances will, as circumstances dictate, be made either from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or the Loan Fund and will be on the terms and conditions set out in the 1973 Housing Agreement as amended. Provision is made for any payments out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for this purpose to be reimbursed in due course from the Loan Fund when the Treasurer considers this appropriate. I commend the Bill to the Senate. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> has taken notice of the second reading speech. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of the Housing Agreement Bill 1 974 is to obtain Parliamentary approval to proposed amendments to the Housing Agreement that was negotiated with each State last year. The Minister for Housing and Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> has been keeping in close touch with State Housing Ministers by correspondence, discussion and by means of 2 formal conferences this year. This constant communication has permitted exchanges of views on the operation of the Agreement and has facilitated the identification of features of the Agreement that warrant variation in the light of experience since its adoption. The 3 amendments that are proposed in the Schedule to the Bill have all been agreed with the States. The first varies sub-clause (3) of clause 9 of the Agreement to permit the allocation to a State &#39;s Home Builders &#39; Account of more than 30 per cent of the total advance to that State. Advances to a State are made for the purposes of its housing authority and for payment to its Home </para>
          <para class="block">Builders&#39; account for onlending to prospective home owners through co-operative terminating societies or a lending institution of the State approved by the Minister. </para>
          <para>The Senate will recall that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> at the June Premiers Conference drew attention to the effect of the limitation on the percentage of advances payable to a State for Home Builders&#39; Account purposes. It prevented the allocation of additional funds for private home purchases by needy persons at a time when housing authorities were unable to let contracts for dwelling construction in the numbers hoped for because of excessive demands on the building industry. The Prime Minister announced our intention to discuss with the States the amendment of the Housing Agreement now proposed by clause 4 of the Schedule to this Bill. As I have already said all States have agreed to that variation. </para>
          <para>The 1 973 Housing Agreement provides for the application of needs tests based on income to determine eligibility for access to State housing authority dwellings and for loans from funds allocated to Home Builders&#39; Accounts. Overtime has been included in an applicant&#39;s income for the purpose of determining eligibility for loans through Home Builders&#39; Accounts. In response to representations from State Housing Ministers and the co-operative terminating society movement the Minister has agreed to the exclusion of overtime from a person&#39;s income in determining his eligibility for a Home Builders&#39; Account loan. This variation is proposed in clause 6 of the Schedule and shall be deemed to have come into effect on 1 November 1974. </para>
          <para>The proposed amendment will remove an inconsistency between the means tests for housing authority accommodation and for Home Builder&#39;s Account loans, and will avoid anomalous situations that have arisen in the past. It will, however, have the effect of increasing competition for Home Builders &#39; Account loans which are available at the highly concessional interest rate of not more than 5% per cent per annum. I emphasise that the Government expects the terminating society movement to continue to give due consideration to the need for home finance of these needy families whose incomes are lower than others who will now be eligible for loans. </para>
          <para>At the June Premiers Conference the Government agreed to advance $235m to the States for welfare housing in 1974-75. At the same time, however, the Prime Minister stated that we stood ready to consult with the States on the provision of additional advances this financial year in the light of developments in the housing industry, the availability of resources for housing construction and the ability of the States to put further funds for welfare housing to productive use. Honourable senators will be aware that the Minister for Housing and Construction has since had discussions with the States about progress on their welfare housing programs in the current year. At a conference in Canberra on 1 1 October, he announced to State Ministers that the Australian Government would provide an additional $75m to the States for welfare housing in 1974-75. These additional funds will enable the States to take advantage of the present situation in the housing industry to increase their welfare housing activity in a substantial degree. </para>
          <para>The 1973 Housing Agreement was drafted in the expectation that there would be a single determination of the amount to be allocated to each State for housing purposes in any year. Clause 5 of the Housing Agreement Bill 1 974 is to amend clause 10 of the Housing Agreement to permit the determination of supplementary advances during a financial year. As I have already mentioned, a supplementary advance of $7 5 m is proposed in the current year and is included in the following figures of amounts being made available for housing authority purposes and for the Home Builders&#39; Account in each State in 1974-75: </para>

          <para class="block">These figures do not include an additional advance of $8m to Queensland for the activities of its Housing Commission that was announced by the Prime Minister on 12 November. Parliamentary authority for the payment of this amount to Queensland will be sought separately. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman.</inline> On 12 November during the debate on this Bill 2 matters were raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> referring to the estimates for the Department of Health. I undertook to obtain some information from the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Everingham)</inline> concerning these matters and to make a statement to the Committee on them. I now have the information from the Minister. The first matter concerns Rauwolfia and breast cancer. The statement reads: </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <quote>
          <para>The association between Rauwolfia derivatives and breast cancer was first drawn to the Committee&#39;s attention late in September 1974 following publication in the &#39;Lancet&#39;- 21 September issue- of the results of 3 epidemiological studies, one based on United States hospital admissions, another on Finnish data, and the third on United Kingdom data. The stated risk of breast cancer in women taking Rauwolfia derivatives ranged between about two to four times that for women not taking those agents. </para>
          <para>Australian medical practitioners were advised of this association by circular letter on 8 October and the matter was discussed in detail by the Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee (a sub-committee of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee) on 1 1 October 1974. Doctors were advised by circular letter dated 25 October of the Committee&#39;s decision. In summary, it was felt that while there was some evidence of an association between taking these drugs and developing breast cancer, the validity of the methodology of all 3 studies was not yet verified. </para>
          <para>The Committee accordingly agreed that a long term prospective study would be required to substantiate the claims of the 3 groups of researchers before regulatory action was warranted. A positive correlation such as this did not necessarily indicate a cause and effect relationship. Doctors were asked to review the need in their hypertensive patients for continued use of rauwolfia derivatives in the light of availability of suitable alternatives. The Committee&#39;s investigations are continuing. The results of further overseas studies are being awaited, particularly those of the FDA expert panel. As rauwolfia and its derivatives are available in this country only on a doctor&#39;s prescription, there seems little risk of a patient inadvertently taking the drug without adequate supervision by a doctor who has been pre-warned of the risk. </para>

        <quote>
          <para>The Australian Drug Evaluation Committee discussed the matter of septic abortion alleged to be associated with the Dalkon shield at its 59th meeting on 2 August 1 974. At that time the Committee had no reports of septic abortion following the use of intra-uterine contraceptive devices in Australia. Accordingly, it was agreed to seek details in Australia of any similar cases to those reported in the US but to broaden the survey to include reactions to the various types of intra-uterine contraceptive devices available in Australia. During its examination of the available data the Committee noted: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman">
            <item label="(i)">
              <para>the Dalkon shield is one of a number of intra-uterine contraceptive devices which have been available in Australia for several years; </para>

              <para>mortality rate for the Dalkon shield is claimed by the company marketing the products to be 0.5 per 100,000 woman years c.f. 1 .5 to 3.9 for oral contraceptives; </para>

              <para>other intra-uterine contraceptive devices had been implicated in septic abortion. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The Committee agreed that if the problem proved to be device specific, the product should be withdrawn since other effective intra-uterine contraceptive devices were available. It was further agreed that temporary market suspension of the Dalkon shield was not warranted on the present evidence and that the company had acted responsibly in advising Australian doctors of the situation. </para>
          <para>A circular letter from the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee, dispatched to all doctors on 25 October 1974, advised them of the specific problem with Dalkon shield and requested information on the use of all intra-uterine contraceptive devices and possible association of septic abortion and/or death. </para>
          <para>The response to the request for details of cases so far has been nearly 40 reports on reactions to various types of intrauterine contraceptive devices used in Australia. Of these 40 reports, there has been no instance of death from complications following the use of the Dalkon shield. It is understood that the Dalkon shield is likely to be reintroduced onto the US market in the near future. </para>

            <para>- I must say that I am very grateful to the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wheeldon)</inline> for the prompt way in which an answer has been sought and given in relation to matters which I raised 2 days ago. The Minister makes several points which I think should be answered briefly at this stage. Firstly, he states that one of the overseas studies concerning rauwolfia suggests an increased risk of the order of two to four times in the incidence of breast cancer. I submit that we are not in a situation where we are looking for scientific proof of the correctness or incorrectness of the suggested association. We have a situation where plenty of alternative agents are available. If a doubt has been raised about what, up to now, has been an excellent drug surely the correct thing to do is not to seek scientific, irrefutable proof but to take the appropriate action. We should not use the drug until we know what the situation is. The Australian Drug Evaluation Committee thought the position sufficiently serious to circularise all doctors. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I reiterate that it is appropriate in my mind that the drug should be voluntarily withdrawn. It is not a question of knowing with 100 per cent certainty that this association actually occurs. What we do know is that 3 groups, in a reputable way, have raised this doubt. I am concerned all the time that there could be another thalidomide disaster around the corner tomorrow, next week or at some time. The lesson which we got from the thalidomide disaster was not to do with that drug alone; it had to do with our methods of reacting to suspicion. If there is one thing that went wrong with thalidomide it was that we did not act sufficiently quickly when suspicion was first raised. I am not saying that rauwolfia does cause breast cancer. No one can say that. All I can say is that some reputable people have raised the possibility. If at this stage my wife was being treated with rauwolfia I would make damned sure that she was not being treated with the drug after today until I knew for certain. I appreciate the scientific view taken by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee, but personally, I do not think that is the appropriate response in view of the evidence offered. </para>
        <para>With regard to the Dalkon shield, I simply say that A. H. Robins Pty Ltd was kind enough to supply me yesterday with a considerable amount of data. The information suggests, as the Minister has told the Committee, that it is likely that the product will be released again for use on the American market. But the point I make once more is that the product was removed from the American market in June this year. Again I say that if suspicion arises the correct thing to do is to withdraw the product since we know that good alternatives are available. If that is a bit hard on the manufacturer, I am sorry, but it is probably not hard on the women of Australia who may unwittingly be using a product which might just possibly be dangerous. It appears that the Dalkon shield might be cleared of the suspicions which have been raised against it. I have here a letter sent to me by the managing director of A. H. Robins. He states that the Food and Drug Administration in America is in receipt of its subcommittee report which it expects will clear the product. But there has been some delay in releasing that report and allowing the product back on the market in the United States. I am not disturbed at all with the factual answers I have received. I think the facts speak for themselves. But I am concerned about the principle of action which has been established and about our proposed course of action in the future whenever doubts are raised about any therapeutic substances. </para>

          <para>- Yesterday I commenced to speak about the provision of $12m for legal aid; $10m of it is in the estimates of the Attorney-General&#39;s Depart*ment. I think I should advert to what Senate Estimates Committee A said about the question of legal aid. It was a very short note but I read it. It states: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>The Committee received considerable assistance from the Attorney-General in response to questions seeking information as to the scope of operations of the Australian Legal Aid Office, and also as to the distribution of other moneys proposed to be appropriated for legal aid. The Committee notes the increasing number of agencies dispersing legal aid and is concerned at the possible duplication, inefficiencies and waste that unco-ordinated development may produce. It considers that a full scale government sponsored inquiry into the services providing legal aid is desirable. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">On the terms of that comment the Committee was united. I appreciate that differing members of the Committee had differing approaches to this whole subject and what I hereafter say may not have the support of the other members of the Committee. But there was a view- this is why I emphasise it- held by the members of the Committee that there was need for some rationalisation in a somewhat confusing and worrying pat: tern of legal aid being disbursed throughout the community at the present time. No one questions the need for a society such as ours to ensure that people are able to take advantage of the basic equality before the law which exists in Australia. We recognise that all persons should be able as far as possible to have access to the courts, and people should not be denied access because of lack of means. There are some people who have always had the ability to secure the legal advice and access to the courts which they wanted; there are other people who have not been able so easily to secure that advice and access. </para>
        <para>The purpose of legal aid is to make that advice and access available, as far as possible, to persons who because of lack of means might not be able to have the legal advice and appearances before the courts which from time to time they may need. The real question is how this advice is to be implemented. I say right at the outset that it should be able to be provided through an independent legal profession. I think that is the foremost fundamental of the requirements. One could stress why an independent profession is important. I mention just 2 considerations which I think stand in the forefront in the justification for legal aid being provided through an independent profession. </para>
        <para>The first is that much and indeed an increasing amount of litigation is these days concerned with complaints of the citizen against the State or prosecutions by the State in which the individual citizen is the defendant. It is therefore highly important to have a profession which can give representation to bodies and persons who are in conflict with government and with authority. The cause of the individual is the cause of the individual&#39;s freedom being maintained constantly against encroachments by the State. We will not be able to secure and maintain that freedom, that right of the individual unless there are in the legal profession independent persons with no twin allegiances who are able to devote their cause to the individual. We will not be able to achieve that unless, as I have said, there is an independent legal profession. We will certainly not be able to achieve it if it is found that the place to which people who need legal aid go is a government office with salaried employees paid essentially out of the public purse because there must be at some stage a conflict of interest. It is tremendously important that whatever be the role of the Government in the provision of legal aid it does not undermine or reduce the effectiveness of the independent.legal profession. </para>
        <para>The second aspect which is important is that where there is any form of adversary litigationas far as the provision of legal advice and aid is concerned in Australia it will be in that area- it is important that the individuals concerned have a choice as to the type of legal representation which they want and which they need. They will not be able to have that choice if there is only one legal aid office to which they can go because where there is a government legal aid office it is perfectly feasible for that office to finance assistance for the plaintiff and to finance assistance for the defendant. But there is always sitting over the provision of that finance the Treasurer of the day who has some concern as to how much money could be dispensed. We do not want to reach the situation which is becoming notorious in the United Kingdom where litigation is financed by the Government for both plaintiffs and defendants, and counsel and solicitors are being financed by the Government as they act for parties on each side. It is becoming an increasing part of the general conduct of litigation in that country. That is a situation which we want to avoid as far as possible. If we provide legal aid we ought to provide it on a basis that allows a person entitled to receive it to go to a solicitor and to retain counsel in the same way as he would have been able if he had his own funds and did not have to have legal aid. That, to my way of thinking, is a second substantial reason why we must ensure the maintenance of an independent legal profession. </para>
        <para>I say that what is happening at the present time since this Government has been in office is that we are implementing a scheme of legal aid in a way that is calculated to undermine and to reduce the influence of an independent legal profession in this country. It is a slow process and much has already been done without, I believe, the legal profession being aware of how it is being undermined. It is not only, I believe, the economic circumstances which find solicitors for the first time in many, many years registering at the unemployment offices of this country. What we are seeing is the development of a system under which a salaried legal service will perform a role which has hitherto been performed by the independent legal profession. </para>
        <para>The Attorney-General made a statement on 1 3 December last year in this Senate. Unfortunately the prorogation of the Parliament precluded any debate upon the development of legal aid and indeed this is the first occasion that the Senate has had an opportunity to discuss the whole question. I desire to take advantage of that opportunity. The Attorney-General in his statement made last December said something the implications of which I think ought to be considered by all persons who believe in and want to retain an independent profession. He said: </para>

          <para>The service that the Office - </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That is, the Australian Legal Aid Office -  will provide, broadly stated, will be: first, a general problem solving service of advice and assistance short of litigation to persons with an element of financial need- this will, in my view, take care of some 90 per cent of all problems that worry the ordinary citizen; and secondly, the conduct of litigation, particularly family law, environmental and other litigation in areas of special concern to the Australian Government, on behalf of persons who cannot afford the cost  of representation  in court. </para>
        <para class="block">The legal aid, therefore, is to be provided in 2 areas, firstly, legal advice and assistance short of litigation, and secondly, other forms of legal advice. As far as advice and assistance short of litigation is concerned, I would have thought the ordinary meaning of the Attorney-General&#39;s statement is that he anticipates that his Office will take care of some 90 per cent of all the problems that worry the ordinary citizen. That must involve a replacement of areas where the independent profession now operates. </para>

            <para>- No. Let me clarify this now. That meant- if the honourable senator had read the context reasonably he would understand this- 90 per cent of the problems that had come into the Office. It does not suggest taking care of 90 per cent of the problems of the whole community which did not come into the office. It means 90 per cent of the problems of the people who had come into the Office. Surely that is a reasonable meaning of the statement. If it is not clear or if it was not clear before, I am clarifying it for you now. </para>

            <para>- I am grateful that the Attorney-General has said what he has just said because I have made the comment which I made earlier- referring to that passage in his speech- on other occasions and there has been consternation in some quarters. When the words are looked at and given their ordinary meaning, they have the interpretation which I have placed upon them and it has been put to me on behalf of the Attorney-General that they do have the meaning which he claims they have. I hope that he will make it clear and take the steps to ensure that the profession generally has a clearer idea of what this Legal Aid Office is to do. He probably saw in yesterday&#39;s Melbourne &#39;Sun-Pictorial&#39; a statement- I believe a long overdue statementwhich came from the  President  of the Law Institute in Victoria.

        <para class="block">I believe that what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dawson</inline> said would be echoed by a vast number of solicitors in independent practice around the country. I suggest to the Attorney-General that this concern is felt because this great Office is growing, with enormous sums- millions of dollars- being spent upon it and no one quite knows what it will be when it is finally operational. I believe it is calculated to undermine the independent legal profession. The whole distribution of legal aid- at present a hotch-potch which is unregulated and unsustained by the parliamentary enactment systemis again an area in which patronage can be engaged in, in a manner which we have never experienced in this country in the past. This area of developing Government patronage ought to concern everybody who believes in parliamentary control and supervision of public expenditure. As I recognise that my time has almost concluded, I indicate to the Attorney-General my concern. I will raise some other matters in due course. </para>

          <para>- I wish to make some remarks on the same subject. They are supplementary and additional to what has already been said. I wish to say, so there will be no misunderstanding, that I support very strongly the concept of legal aid. I have supported it since in started in Victoria. I played an active part in helping to get it off the ground, with the profession&#39;s support. I have supported it in a practical way for a number of years by taking action in accepting assignments and dealing with legal aid matters. I recognise not only the desirability of the profession being actively involved in legal aid, but also the deficiencies which it has had for a number of years and which of course need to be remedied. I think that one should take that general stance. I agree very substantially with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> statement about the necessity for the private profession to be most heavily involved in the legal aid system and that it should not be a matter of government service. There is perhaps a distinction. Probably I do not go quite as far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> goes, because I see a role for an Australian Legal </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Aid Office. I see it operating in remote places where the profession is perhaps not strong or even non-existent. I see it operating also perhaps in areas where there is an additional need to bring the knowledge of law facilities to the people where it may be that the profession is not able to do it adequately. Basically I think the legal profession is best able to deal with such a scheme. In my years of practice I have seen a public solicitor-type activity in which a charity is performed and people wait in queues and have great difficulty in getting service. I think that this is not the desirable way in which legal aid should be provided. It is best provided in a system whereby the people are dealt with as ordinary clients of a solicitor and are treated as equals of any other client, with financial provisions being made from the legal aid service. </para>
        <para>Attention must be drawn to the discussion that took place in Estimates Committee A. It was a fairly long discussion during which much helpful information was provided for the members of the Committee. But if one reads the Hansard record of that debate it is still impossible to determine the way in which the $ 12.5m, if one adds the Aboriginal legal aid to the $10m which is provided generally for legal aid, will be spent this year. This has the seeds of a great problem. A massive payment is being made. It was admitted in the course of that discussion that we could not be told precisely how the money was to be spent. A sum of $3,600,000 will be paid by the Legal Aid Office to private solicitors for work which it will brief them to do. The principles and policies under which this will be done should ensure that it is done in a regular way to provide work for the people who are best qualified, with no real possibility of elements of patronage. Those principles should be laid down. They are not laid down at the moment because there is no legislation on this subject. </para>
        <para>The question of legislation provides a very interesting situation because during the consideration of the Estimates I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> a number of questions, and there was discussion as to how the policy of legal aid was to be determined. I put it to him in this way: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I take it that there will be no legislation, no ratification of any agreements or anything of that nature which will give the Parliament an opportunity of saying: &#39;This is not the best way in which is should be split up &#39;. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In reply <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> referred to a number of statements that he had made in the Senate and to the fact that there had been a meeting recently with representatives of the Law Council. I took it from those answers and the fact that there was no suggestion of legislation that there was not to be any legislation. I think that legislation is highly desirable. I believe also that an inquiry is desirable. That inquiry could be set up, as a result of legislation, to consider the way in which this $10m is to be invested by the Government. In the annexures to the report of Estimates Committee A, which is before the Committee of the Whole, a very useful review of legal aid has been submitted. This is shown just after Attachment D, in the middle of the document. Part of this annexure states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>On 25 July 1973 the Attorney-General announced the establishment of the Australian Legal Aid Office incorporating the Legal Service Bureaux. Establishment of the Office is the major step the Government has taken to make sure that legal aid is readily and equally available to all persons in needparticularly disadvantaged persons- throughout Australia. Legislation will be introduced to create it as a statutory office. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">So far as I know that is the first- I think very welcomestatement, but rather tucked away in the records, that there will be legislation. I think it is highly necessary not only to establish the Office but also to establish the principles under which we can examine it. In the consideration of the Estimates it was impossible to examine the principles or the details of the way in which these moneys should be expended. In addition to this one must determine what policy should be adopted in the distribution of these moneys. </para>
        <para>I refer in a different way to the matter which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> raised. When the AttorneyGeneral made his statement to the Senate on 13 December 1973, he said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>There are 4 major problems that, I believe, need urgent attention. First, the need to provide on an equal basis throughout Australia legal advice and assistance that will fill the gap left by the Law Society or Legal Aid Committee schemes for aid in litigation and to see that advice and assistance reaches disadvantaged people; second, the need to provide legal aid in divorce cases and in proceedings ancillary to divorce; third, the need to provide legal aid for representation in magistrates courts; and fourth, the need to avoid the bottomless pit&#39; of ever increasing costs of providing legal aid. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I draw specific attention to the fact that it was to fill the gap, and it must be recognised surely that the filling of the gap surely does not mean a tremendously expensive scheme nor tremendously expensive offices. </para>
        <para>One has to recognise that there is a great deal of variation between the State legal aid schemes. In some there is a much more highly developed method and much more enthusiasm for the scheme. The State schemes provide different things. For example, in Victoria there is a considerable contribution to divorce litigation. In New South Wales last year that was not included in the scheme. One would want to see firstly whether the gaps were being filled and, secondly, what efforts were being made by way of discussion with the profession to see whether the gaps could be filled. Then the legal aid office no doubt would cover the gaps that could not be filled. </para>
        <para>Overall I suggest there is a need for some body which is co-operative, which has representatives of the profession, of the Government, of social welfare groups and of people who are involved in this area to ensure that these things are done on a regular basis and that the gaps are filled. There is no provision yet for such a body to exist. </para>
        <para>There are usually 2 parties to litigation and it might be highly desirable for one party to be represented by a member of the profession who is engaged by the legal aid organisation in the State and for the other party to be represented by the Australian Legal Aid Office because, as the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> pointed out, there is always the problem of the bottomless pit that could be involved in legal aid. There are examples known to the legal aid committees of cases in which they have given representation to both sides, and the solicitors of course have had no worry about the extent of the proceedings and the elaboration to which they might goperhaps unnecessary elaboration- in the proceedings because there is not a problem of someone having to pay. I think the Australian taxpayer has an interest in ensuring that unnecessary embellishments do not occur in litigation causing a great deal of cost to the community. </para>
        <para>One must recognise that there is a decrease in money going to the existing schemes this year, from $2m to $1.3m. I doubt whether this is desirable although I imagine that part of the reason is that the Legal Aid Office will deal with divorce matters more than it has in the past. But I would suggest that that reduction stands rather curiously against a great increase in total expenditure. This increase comes from a very small amount last year which makes it impossible to measure the figures of last year against the proposed figures for this year. They just do not match up in any way. There will be a lot of money spent this year. </para>
        <para>I suggest it is high time that we had legislation before us. It is high time that we had further discussions which will lead to a rationalisation of the scheme and enable the bulk of the operations of the scheme to be performed by the legal profession which has pioneered this area. I hope that we will have such an inquiry as the Committee recommended and a Bill which, I trust, we can examine as to its principles and application so that this matter will not remain in its present amorphous state. </para>

At least so far as I am concerned as a member of Estimates Committee A, what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> last night is a misrepresentation of the true position. I refer to page 2360 of the Senate Hansard which records <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> as having said: </para>

          <para>In the space of 2 years the Government is expending a sum in excess of $12m on the Australian Legal Aid Office, and I believe that the pattern of that expenditure is marked by waste, inefficiency and duplication. That is the view of Estimates Committee A. </para>

        </continue>
        <para>On the substance of the matter under debate I want to say that, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen,</inline> I played a part in the institution of a scheme in Tasmania at a time which now seems long ago. I was one of those in the profession who was willing to be on what was called the legal aid panel a long time ago and I remained on it I think it is true to say, and this has been acknowledged in many areas, that the Tasmanian legal aid scheme, due probably to the smallness of the State, has been one of the most effective in the western world. This was acknowledged as recently as some 1 1 days ago at a seminar in Hobert by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Roy</inline> Turner,  Chairman  of the Legal Aid Review Committee. The answers to the questions posed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> and to some degree supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> today, are to be found in an answer which the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> gave to a question I asked yesterday in the Senate. I asked what the situation was so far as the Australian Government and the Tasmanian Law Society were concerned with respect to a rationalisation of the 2 services which they conduct. </para>
        <para>The Attorney-General was able to state- and this is within only a few weeks of the conference in Canberra between the Australian AttorneyGeneral and representatives of law societies of all States- that complete agreement had been reached between the Law Society of Tasmania and the Australian Government with respect to the rationalisation of the services. The broad basis of that agreement was that the Australian Legal Aid Office now established in Tasmania, in Burnie and in Hobart and soon to be established in Launceston, would handle matters which arose under Federal law and also matters in which the Australian Government considered that it had a special responsibility, such as in relation to ex-servicemen, Aborigines and the like. If that agreement can be reached in Tasmania it can be reached between the Australian Government and any other State. It is a matter of goodwill and a desire to reach agreement. </para>
        <para>I wonder whether some States desire to reach agreement because when I read- I have seen no refutation of it and therefore regard it as correctthe recent article on the New South Wales scheme I can describe it only as a scandal that I hope would not be repeated anywhere. What do we find with respect to the New South Wales scheme? This legal aid scheme, the basic concept of which ought to be to help those who need it, is making a profit, a profit so great that the legal aid scheme has $2m invested. Fancy a legal aid scheme having money invested to that degree. </para>
        <para>Of that sum Sim is in short term deposits and the rest is in other investments. We find- this has not been refuted as yet- that a profit was made last year of over $lm. That is the State which, until last year at any rate- I am uncertain of the precise present position this year- would not give one cent under its scheme towards the resolution of those acute personal problems that arise in relation to matrimonial matters; not one cent. I wonder who is trying to kid whom in this situation? The Law Institutes or Law Societies of the mainland Australian States have the opportunity to follow the arrangement reached so far as Tasmania and the Australian Government are concerned. That rationalisation can be achieved. If it is not, I feel it is a safe assertion that the fault lies not with the Australian Government but with the Law Societies, some of those who run them and some of those with vested interests in them. </para>
        <para>The second point achieved so far as Tasmania and the Australian Government are concerned is that a figure has been agreed upon as the approximate proportion of the $1.3m by way of subvention to State legal assistance schemes that Tasmania will receive. The Law Society has said to the Australian Government, and acknowledged, that it is satisfied, that with the subvention it gets from the State Government plus its share of the $ 1.3m it can continue to run a highly efficient and satisfactory scheme within the rationalised areas of responsibility which have been agreed upon. If it can be done in Tasmania why can it not be done elsewhere? I take this opportunity to mention <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> &#39;s criticism of the reduction in the sum of $2m which was granted from 1 July after the present Government came to office. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> complained of the reduction from $2m to $1.3m. I suggest, with respect, that he does not acknowledge in that criticism that for the first time there is an Australian Government subvention to the private profession, through the Australian Legal Aid Office, of $3.7m. </para>

            <para>- I suggest that the definition of the terms was not the gravamen of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> &#39;s criticism in this respect.  His  complaint was that the $2m had been reduced to $1.3m. I suggest that that is not a valid criticism because so far as the totality of legal aid is concerned throughout the nation, the situation is infinitely better this financial year than it has been in the past. I found <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> &#39;s strictures of the scheme, especially his reference to patronage and his other criticism that the scheme was calculated to undermine the private legal profession, strange indeed when it is remembered that year after year the previous Government refused requests through the Australian Law Council that it should even take an interest in the question of legal aid in this nation. </para>

            <para>- I am not suggesting that they were made during <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> time as Attorney-General. They may have been. At the seminar in Hobart held 12 days ago a former  president  of the Law Council, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> B. Piggott, strongly criticised the previous Federal Administration for not conceding to the Law Council&#39;s requests that it should involve itself to any degree in the provision of legal aid. The seminar was told that those requests were repeated many times during the period of office of the previous Government. How should any criticism from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> be interpreted in the light of the history of the Government of which he was a member? </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I believe that when the cameras of history are focused on the first 2 years of the present Labor Government, its attitude towards legal aid will stand out as one of the most compassionate achievements of its record. I believe that to be so. Whatever else the present Attorney-General may achieve, despite the Australian Senate, I believe that he will be able to look back- hopefully we will never turn the clock back- on the fact that this national Government recognised that if justice was to continue to have the connotation which it has had in the past it would have to go hand in hand with a liberal legal aid system. That was recognised in the Trade Practices Act. It is recognised in the amendments to the Family Law Bill that are before the Senate. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> with all the respect due to him because of his past office as AttorneyGeneral, that no criticism from him can obliterate the fact that the Government of which he was a member had no interest in the question of legal aid. Further, his criticisms are of no validity because this Government has shown that it cares. I concede that there has to be rationalisation but it should not be unilateral rationalisation; it has to be bilateral rationalisation. The professions in the various States, other than Tasmania where it has been accomplished already, as I have said, will have to get round the table and ensure that the best rationalisation is achieved. </para>

            <para>-No. I am perplexed about that. I was surprised- I speak with frankness in reply to the interjection- when the extract that the honourable senator read today was given because I cannot see how legislation would achieve anything in this respect. I have tried to consider the form that the legislation would take. We do not want legislation simply to confer a high-sounding title by way of a statutory office on the existing administration. What would it do? I do not know. I have tried to draft the Bill in my mind but I have no idea what form it would take. I think there is a danger that we have legislation in many areas where probably it is not needed. </para>

He said that the profession wanted a clearer idea. I suggest that if the profession is unclear about this, the way to get rid of any obscurity it has is to get round the table with the Australian Government&#39;s officers who are implementing this scheme. That achieved success so far as Tasmania is concerned. From there it is only a question of degree. Consider the Victorian position. If Victoria were to do what has been done in Tasmania and say: &#39;Yes, let the Australian Legal Office&#39;- this is on a broad basis -&#39;take over responsibility for matters arising under Federal Law- &#39; </para>

            <para>-Senator Missen says that he hopes it will not do that. I do not know why we compartmentise our law in the manner apparently suggested by the honourable senator. If the Office took over responsibility for matters arising under Federal law, also Family Law matters, or Matrimonial Causes Act matters, as the title now stands, and matters in relation to persons for whom the Australian Governmet concedes it has a special responsibility, and if Victoria got a fair share of the cake so far as the $1.3m is concerned, where would there be any continuing basis for obscurity? Some people, especially lawyers, can create obscurity where it does not properly exist. </para>

          <para>- I think that most honourable senators on this side of the chamber would agree with the comments that have been made earlier, that the Government is to be congratulated for the additional emphasis it has placed on legal aid. This is one of the fields- there are more than one- in which the Government has, in a very healthy manner, added emphasis to community trends. I believe that there was a trend in the community before this Government came into office that was providing wider and better legal aid services. But to congratulate the Government for the fact that it has paid some attention to the area is not to say that in every respect what it has done is correct. I am sure that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> would agree that in breaking new ground there will almost invariably be mistakes and areas which will need attention and rectification in the future. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is my view that the Government is making a mistake in the emphasis which it is placing in its program on the Australian Legal Aid Office. I do not think there is any need to argue in this chamber the position of the private profession. Let me refer briefly to the speech of the Attorney-General, which has been referred to earlier in this debate, made on 13 December 1973. 1 think that his words summarised the position aptly. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I have said that I see private legal practitioners, through their Law Societies or Legal Aid Committees, performing the major work in the legal aid field, that of litigation in the various courts. I hold firm views about the necessity for a strong and independent private legal profession that can stand between the Government and the citizens, not least in the fields of human rights, civil liberties and criminal matters generally. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I agree with the Attorney that it is essential for the citizens of Australia that there is a free and independent legal profession. But the fact of the matter is that this Budget indicates a turning away to some extent from the existing avenues of legal aid. </para>
        <para>I do not accept the analysis of the situation that was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett</inline> with respect to the reduction in aid to existing legal aid services from $2m to $1.3m. As I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett&#39;s</inline> point, this will be offset by the additional moneys which will flow to the private profession through the Legal Aid Office. A sum of more than $3m is allowed for there. The members of the profession in Australia cannot be certain at this time just how and when those moneys will be made available. But, even more importantly, the existing legal aid systems which by and large around Australia work very well, are having an effective reduction in the amount of subsidy which is being provided direct to them by the Government. </para>
        <para>The Attorney said that the Law Societies or Legal Aid Committees will be performing the major work in the legal aid field. I believe that the Government is going against those words if it reduces the . amount of money which is made available to those organisations. There are very great practical reasons why we ought to keep the emphasis on the private profession, quite apart from the need to retain a strong private legal profession for the reason which the Attorney outlined. For a start, there are almost always 2 sides in any legal matter. Notwithstanding that administrative arrangements may be made which ensure that the 2 sides are kept apart physically in a single legal aid office, I believe it is undesirable for the 2 sides in any dispute or even in non-litigious transactions to be represented by the same office. Also, in the interests of the economy, I suggest that the Government could achieve its social objectives much better by supplementing the efforts of the private profession rather than by bureaucratic solutions. </para>
        <para>I refer the Attorney to the work of the Legal Advice Bureau in Perth with which I was involved before coming to this place. It provides the sort of preliminary legal advice which it is envisaged the Australian Legal Aid Office will provide. That advice is provided at the cost of $2 a client. I suggest to the Attorney that there is no possibility that he could rival that sort of economy in providing legal advice. I concede that in that case the professionals providing the service are not paid. I do not believe that an Australia wide operation could be financed on that type of voluntary basis. I am sure that any sort of financial analysis of that type of storefront operation will compare more than favourably with the Australian Legal Aid Office even when wages are taken into account. </para>
        <para>I commend the Attorney&#39;s attention to the operation of that scheme. I suggest that it is a much cheaper way of obtaining his objective than by the financing of the Australian Legal Aid Office. Even more importantly, if we want to guarantee high quality legal aid for indigent persons or persons of limited means I do not believe that we should be providing it through a bureaucratic service. All people who are entitled to legal aid are entitled to a good standard of service. I believe that that standard will be achieved if the Government uses the private profession with its wider experience and if it does not segregate the needy cases from the rest of the community. So in the interests of the quality of service that is being provided I again urge the Attorney to look to fostering solutions through the private profession rather than having a separate professional bureaucratic office. </para>
        <para>Notwithstanding the example of New South Wales which has been cited- I do not have the facts either to defend New South Wales or to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett-</inline> I suggest that experience around Australia shows that the profession will co-operate with the Government. Let me refer to my own State and to the progress made in the last few years. We have been operating a legal assistance scheme which provides a full legal service on a free or subsidised basis. The only restriction on the expansion of that scheme is lack of finance. We have the Legal Advice Bureau which, for $2 a head, provides preliminary legal advice without means test. We have several offices operating under that scheme. We have a person providing part time service in the north-west. We have travelling solicitors in the more remote areas of the State. These people are financed by our legal assistance scheme. We now have duty solicitors in some of the lower courts. All these efforts are being provided by the private profession with some supplementary assistance from the Government. The only thing that prevents that wide range of services being expanded is a lack of money. </para>
        <para>I commend to the Attorney-General the proposition that if he wants value for his legal aid money he should finance the expansion of those schemes rather than add an office to them. However, I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> that in a country the size of Australia the private profession probably will not be able to do the whole job. As a stopgap there may be a need to establish an office of the type of the Australian Legal Aid Office. But I ask honourable senators to accept the point of view that that should be done only where the private profession cannot provide the service. </para>

          <para>-The matter of legal aid is obviously one of very great complexity. I am indebted to honourable senators for the contributions they have made. I indicate that there are some misconceptions. For example, a few moments ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> suggested that the Australian Legal Aid Office might be acting for persons who are opposed to one another. Unless there were some very exceptional circumstances it would not happen, for the very reason he gave. It would be quite unsatisfactory. There may be some special cases where it could happen but I think that in general the matter would be referred out to practitioners. The $3.7m that has been referred to is already being spent in anticipation, I think, of the Budget being accepted by the Parliament. It is flowing out already to the private practitioners. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I should indicate that the view which I am taking is not shared by all members of the Government. I was asked the other day why moneys were not being paid to local government. My colleague, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren),</inline> said that the moneys will not be paid to local government until the Budget is passed by this Parliament or the Government is given an indication that it will be passed. The longer delays occur in the passage of the Appropriation Bills the longer it will be before local governments receive the grants which the Opposition have requested should be made without delay. I assure honourable senators that the length of delays in this place is not without its consequences to the community. </para>

            <para>- The estimates have been discussed in the Estimates Committee. I should indicate again to the Senate that during the Committee discussions I invited the members of the Estimates Committee- it was a general invitationwho required any information on any matters to inform my office either by telephone or by note and I would see that the information would be made available to the Committee. No member of the Committee availed themselves of that o ffer then or since. </para>

        <para>The question of legal aid is obviously very important. I would like to have a discussion in some depth on it. I do not think it is appropriate to have such a discussion today. I do not want to avoid a discussion on the question of legal aid. There have been lengthy discussions with the various representatives of the profession. I would like to deal with the matter more closely. I have the feeling that if we start to engage upon a discussion on legal aid now it will not be possible for me to deal with it in an adequate manner. I am prepared to make a statement to the Senate before the end of the year, if necessary, and I am prepared to adopt the suggestion made by the Estimates Committee. Because of the possibilities pointed out by the Estimates Committee, with which I would agree, of duplication, inefficiencies and the waste that unco-ordinated development might produce, I think a full scale Government sponsored inquiry into the services providing legal aid is desirable. I should point out that the Legal Aid Review Committee has been considering the topic of legal aid for more than 12 months. That Committee has done a very valuable service. Members of that Committee were present when I discussed the various aspects of legal aid with the representatives of all the professions a month ago at the Parkroyal Motel in Canberra. </para>
        <para>In addition Professor Sackville has been conducting an inquiry into this topic in relation to poverty generally in Australia. He has made a very valuable report. I am not sure whether it has been released but I have read it. There is no doubt that honourable senators who have spoken on this matter would have to revise some of their views on the adequacy of the State legal aid systems. I think that it is still not sufficiently understood that the State legal aid systems were satisfactory and were in no way coping with the problem of insufficient legal aid. The advice given to me is that this would not have been met by the provision of more money through those systems. That was not the answer at all. There were needs in a large area of legal aid which were not being met and which would not have been met simply by an increase in the subsidy- if one can call it that- to existing legal aid schemes. </para>
        <para>These are matters which ought to be investigated in detail. I do not think it is appropriate for me to deal with them in some passing way here. I think the opportunity ought to be given to the Senate, if it so wishes, to discuss legal aid in some depth. In any event, I propose to adopt the recommendation of the Committee. If there is an opportunity to have a full scale discussion on this matter in the Senate before the end of the year we will do so. But as I stand here I think that in view of the legislative program it will not be possible to have such a discussion. If some means can be found by which we can discuss legal aid I will be only too anxious to assist. However, discussions are continuing with the profession in various ways and also with the States. I am only too anxious to have more discussions with the profession and the whole of the Senate so that we can ensure that there is a proper system of legal aid. I am quite sure that if we spent some time in eliciting the facts of the matter a lot of the differences of opinion may disappear. As in many other areas, it is the lack of knowledge of the facts and the real problems that leads to the difficulties in reaching a decision or to differences of opinion. I think that the report of Professor Sackville and some of the other conclusions which have been reached about the factual situation will help to clear away many misapprehensions. Together, we may be able to evolve a reasonably satisfactory system of legal aid. </para>

          <para>-I think that the attitude which the AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> has adopted in welcoming a discussion is certainly an approach which appeals to the Opposition. I think that the Attorney-General must acknowledge that there are real difficulties in finding time for such a discussion, having regard to the projected legislative program. It is important that these areas be canvassed because I think it is fairly clear from the attitude which Opposition speakers have adopted to the Estimates that there is no degree of satisfaction with the operation, current or likely, of the Australian Legal Aid Office. There is apprehension and fear as to the consequences of a widespread salaried legal office such as is comprehended by the Australian Legal Aid Office. There is a desire to place greater reliance upon schemes in which the profession has a controlling voice and to use salaried services only where there is a need which cannot be fulfilled by the existing profession under the State Government aided schemes. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is important, I think, that this distinction be noted. Growing up at the present time, with a projected 60 offices, right throughout Australia is the Australian Legal Aid Office. People are being recruited for that Office at the present time. I imagine a number of younger lawyers are looking ahead to this sort of work as a career. Yet, it may be that in time a different sort of scheme will develop and there may not be the need for these salaried lawyers in the Public Service. Whether or not that is to be the case depends essentially on what type of legal aid scheme ultimately succeeds. The Government is obviously placing all its eggs in the basket of the Australian Legal Aid Office. </para>

            <para>- I am interested to hear the Attorney-General say &#39;That is wrong&#39;. Maybe the picturesqueness of the phrase conveys an impression which he wants to correct in some way but there is little doubt, surely, that the Austraiian Legal Aid Office is the prime area on which the Government is relying for the development of what it sees as the appropriate legal aid provision in this country. I find it difficult to see how that proposition could be contested. But if that be the case the Opposition&#39;s view is different and I suspect that the legal profession&#39;s view also is different. It is only slowly that the legal profession is emerging to express its voice about this Legal Aid Office concept. </para>

        <para class="block">Australia, which has indicated very strong criticism of the present developments. This committee, I think, had a membership well versed in legal aid matters because, as I recall it, the South Australian Law Society has operated a legal aid scheme since the 1930s. The scheme has operated very well over the years and is regarded, I think, with satisfaction throughout South Australia. </para>

          <para>Although the Turner Committee has catalogued the types of assistance now provided by existing schemes, it has only referred to the deficiencies and inadequacies of existing schemes and, with respect, entirely ignored the not inconsiderable and vast voluntary and financial assistance already provided to the community in varying degrees by the legal profession through the existing schemes. The Turner Committee appears to have proceeded on the basis that the existing schemes are &#39;no good&#39; and some entirely new structure must be established. This Committee is of the opinion that, from an economic and practical standpoint, attention should be first directed at improving and extending the present operating schemes. </para>

            <para>-Well, I say again that if the Government wants to have only one point of view expressed, let it disclose that attitude to the country and do away with an Opposition altogether. But there are 2 points of view to be expressed on most questions. There is certainly a different point of view to be expressed on this question. I am simply referring to a report of a committee of some standing on this whole question of how legal aid should be provided, because it does indicate a completely different approach which could be adopted and which the committee prefers. We of the Opposition, without identifying in detail our attitude, would generally prefer the approach which is recommended by this committee. When we have something like $12m being allocated for legal aid this year, it is important that we should recognise the different approaches which can be adopted, with a view to ensuring that those who are interested know what the alternatives are. The only other part of the committee&#39;s report to which I refer states: </para>

          <para>The Committee is of the opinion, that the views expressed at the Seventh Annual Conference of Law Societies, that legal aid should be provided on a co-operative basis by the profession and the State and Federal Governments working together, are correct. The example of the South Australian Law Society&#39;s Legal Assistance Scheme is positive proof that this is the proper means of the provision of legal aid, in that it is effective, economical, and comprehensive and is one which is actively supported by the legal profession. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I hope that weight can be given to what that committee recommends and that the effort be made to secure the co-operation of the legal profession in providing a scheme in which the profession has a voice. It is not so much the matter of who controls the scheme which is important; the fundamental question in regard to legal aid and advice is the quality of the service and the way in which a client gets from his solicitor what he pays for or what the State pays on his behalf for him to receive. I believe that we weaken the whole standing of the legal profession if we adopt the concept of a salaried service. </para>
        <para>I should be grateful if the Attorney-General could refer to one other aspect of the Legal Aid Office. In the course of the hearings of Estimates Committee A I asked: Was any investigation undertaken to determine whether or not a particular area required a legal aid office before a legal aid office was established? I asked: Was there any assessment of the needs of an area and of the adequacy of the existing legal services in that area? </para>

            <para>- I was told in the course of the hearings of the Estimates Committee that the answer was yes and I was told that I would be supplied with a statement indicating what work had been done. A statement is provided in the material, but it does not set out in any way what sort of an investigation took place. It simply makes the assertion that there are certain offices which have to be established, and it seems to be a matter of carrying through the proposal in the light of an ordained or pre-established proposition without any regard being had to the needs of the area. </para>

            <para>- I am grateful to the Attorney-General for that promise. One looks, for example, at the Canberra situation where a legal aid scheme is operating, with the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s Department co-operating with the legal profession in the Australian Capital Territory. The profession makes some contribution to the costs of legal aid. At the present time a legal aid office is being established in Canberra. As I understood the figures which were supplied, during the course of the last week of October, 2 lawyers were involved in the office in dealing with some 80 items of work. If you work it out on a daily basis, it means that there were 4 items of work per lawyer- maybe 3 interviews and one item of correspondence, because apparently there were no telephone inquiries during that week. In those circumstances there is an obvious question: Why was the legal aid office set up? What function is it serving? </para>

        <para>I wonder also whether the Attorney-General could provide some information regarding an item which appeared in the Press this morning on the subject of legal aid. It referred to the appearances before the Royal Commission into Alleged Payments to Maritime Unions. The item states that the Seamen&#39;s Union is now represented by counsel sustained through legal aid. It reads:   . . the Royal Commission was told the Seamen&#39;s Union, currently under investigation by the commission had been granted emergency legal aid by the Federal AttorneyGeneral, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline></para>
        <para class="block">I would be grateful if we could be told on what basis this legal aid was granted, and in what way is it to be justified. Further, with regard to an earlier question which I asked the AttorneyGeneral, I would like to know whether any application has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mundey</inline> regarding his appeal against the judgment which was given against him in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, or is there no change from the position which the Attorney-General indicated to me earlier. </para>

I ask the Minister first of all whether he can give a bit more information as to how it is determined that the imported brandy has been, in fact, in the wood for 2 years and whether it consists of grape fluid.

          <para>- I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> is referring to the letter of 13 November. I am not sure of the technical details of how the ascertainment is made, but I know that there were some considerable difficulties in carrying out this procedure with great precision. My recollection is that I informed the Senate that I had instructed that every endeavour be made to improve these methods. I requested that a proper scientific assessment be made in order that we may get the best possible technique. It is obvious to everyone that there has been a great deal of passing off of very inferior products in the wine and brandy industry. It ought to be possible, I would think, to devise some skilful method of detecting the inferior products. We have scientific advisers and I have requested that the best scientific advice be obtained as to how the methods of detection can be improved. I will make a statement to the Senate on what is happening in this regard. I am aware of the honourable senator&#39;s interest and the great concern of the brandy producers all over Australia. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>On the other matter, the amount of the excise on imported brandy, we will find out the precise figure for the honourable senator. He also asked whether it would be possible to increase the excise on imported brandy and in effect have some differential between the imported and the local brandy. Speaking for myself I think that would be a good idea. I understand there are some problems. The honourable senator will appreciate why I do not go into the problem of the international arrangements. Australia would not want to be in breach of international arrangements although, I understand, they are regarded somewhat elastically by other countries. I indicate that there is some sympathy with the viewpoint which has been put by the honourable senator. Some consideration will be given to it. I think that answers in substance what was asked by the honourable senator, except for the exact amount of the duties and I will obtain that for him. </para>

          <para>- In view of the very drastic reductions in the clearance of brandy in the last 12 months and bearing in mind that brandy production is a very important outlet for grape production, there are fears in the industry at all times because of past experience that there should not be ready release of production of grapes. This is a major industry in Australia but one which fears for the future. I ask the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> whether in light of the reduced clearance of Australian brandy in the last 12 months he will look at the situation. It was said before the 1972 election that the remaining excise of 25c on wine would be removed and that no alternative taxation would be imposed on the industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> has just interjected that the Premier of South Australia knows all about that. He was the man who promised on behalf of the Party now governing that there would be no replacement of the charge when the excise on wine was taken off. Now we find that a much more severe imposition has been placed on the industry with the result that the sales of locally produced brandy have fallen drastically. I now ask: In view of the general situation in respect of the industry&#39;s future arising from governmental action, will the Government now consider reducing the excise on Australian brandy? </para>

          <para>- Generally in relation to this matter, honourable senators will be aware that very many considerations have touched the responsibilities of other Ministers as well as my responsibility as Minister for Customs and Excise. Primarily, the Department of Customs and Excise carries out the policy determination. That is why I was quite cautious in my statements as to what should happen in areas other than in the administrative areas. This matter was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop.</inline> I shall refer the observations made by all honourable senators, insofar as they do not come within my area, to the Ministers responsible. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir</inline>MAGNUS CORMACK (Victoria) (3.2)- I rise to address myself to the question of Parliament. I do so on the basis that, in the second instance, this emanates from the report of the Senate Estimates Committee A. At page 9 the Committee deals with the question of appropriations for Parliament. It points out that this matter was previously referred to in the report from the Committee appointed by government senators, and so on. It has a fairly lengthy history. It originated as a matter of constitutional importance in 1963 when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> sat somewhere near where I sit at the present moment. Such are the changes which take place in Parliament that he now sits at the table and I sit here. But the subject matter which he raised at that time is quite pertinent. It comes out quite clearly in the report of Estimates Committee A with which we are dealing now. There are references to the fact that the estimates for the Parliament are a non-amendable item of the estimates in the Appropriation Bill. In other words, the Senate is subjected to a financial opinion which states that the Senate cannot look after its own appropriations. If the Senate does not approve of the amount of money which is allocated for Parliament, all it can do is request the House of Representatives to reconsider the matter. Therefore the Senate is not master of its own business. I well remember- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> will not object if I remind honourable senators of the essence of his argument which was put at that time and with which I agreed; I have agreed with it more firmly as the years have gone by- the argument that the appropriations for Parliament are not an ordinary appropriation and certainly not an annual appropriation. Parliament, which is the source of money being extracted from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, should be in the position of determining what its own appropriation should be because, conversely, one can easily imagine circumstances in which a government of the day could decide to inhibit the Senate by cutting down its appropriation. For example, the Government could consider that a select committee was examining something which was uncomfortable and it would certainly not provide money. </para>
        <para>This matter was raised during the hearing of Senate Estimates Committee A. I read the transcript with a great deal of interest. Notwithstanding that I am talking of a constitutional issue, the facts are that during the time that I have had the responsibility of asking the Department of the Treasury for money I have never had any difficulty on behalf of the Senate in obtaining the money required. But that is not the problem. The problem is that the Senate at the present moment is constitutionally pinioned by putting all the appropriations of Parliament into the ordinary annual services of the Government. Having said that I go on to raise other matters to which I think I should make the Senate privy. The parliamentary systems all over the world are under pressure of one sort or another. Yet under a Westminster system of government, such as we have in Australia, or in the States of Australia New Zealand, Canada, or the United Kingdom, the parliamentary institution has a great cloth of history with its own warp and woof. But in the cloth there are threads which are permanent. </para>
        <para class="block">The pattern of the cloth is changed by the horizontal threads. It changes with the needs of the community which parliament represents. </para>
        <para>Here in our country we live under a constitution which happens to be written. Of course the written Constitution is not the all determining factor. We are also involved in three other elements of the Constitution because, constitutionally, applications can be changed by the judicial judgment of the High Court of Australia. The Constitution charges the High Court with that authority. The Constitution practice can be changed by fiat. I give an example. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> has determined that the Bills in the House of Representatives should be described as Bills of the Parliament of Australia and that the parliamentary offices in the capital cities where we have our representatives will be know as the Australian Parliamentary Offices notwithstanding that the Constitution refers constantly to the Commonwealth of Australia. But I am not arguing that point. I am merely illustrating that there exists a capacity to change traditional elements, nomenclatures and attitudes by fiat. There is a fourth method by which constitutional practice can be altered. I use the word practice&#39; quite deliberately because practice is the warp and woof of parliamentary history. We constantly find ourselves involved in it. We are involved in it this afternoon as a Committee of the Whole debating the reports of the Estimates Committees. This is practice. We have inherited this practice and it exists wherever there is an effective Westminster type parliament. But practice can be changed by administrative processes. </para>
        <para>I wish to cite as an illustration an incident which happened only this week. On Monday there was a memorial day service at the Australian National War Memorial. In accordance with the Table of Precedence, which is a table issued by the hand of the Sovereign, the representative of the  President  of the Senate was designated in the program issued by the Prime Minister&#39;s office to take a certain seat. When the representative of the  President  went there to take his seat he found that the cards had been changed and that the chair that was normally occupied by the  President  or his representative had been switched and that he was put below the representative of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> This is an illustration of practice being changed by administrative intervention. I understand that a letter from the Prime Minister&#39;s office came on the morning of the service instructing that this miniscule change should take place. </para>
        <para>The Constitution begins in this sort of way: There shall be a Parliament of the country which will be composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and traditionally in the Westminster system the  President  of the Senate, in this case, or the  President  of the Canadian Senate or the  President  of the Legislative Council of South Australia, for example, would take precedence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> This is part of the historical fabric of parliament. I raised this matter on, I think, 4 October this year, when I mentioned to honourable senators that the Table of Precedence is not a matter that lies within the competence of the Prime Minister to alter. The Table of Precedence is approved and authorised by the Sovereign. All my investigations indicate that there has been no change in the Table of Precedence in Australia. Yet by administrative practice the Table of Precedence has been altered. I have the gravest objection to this. I have the gravest objection to it as a senator. </para>
        <para>I have the gravest objection that the  President  of this Senate who has honourably served the Senate should be put in a position where he is constantly, by administrative decision, placed below a place that the Sovereign herself accords to the  President  of the Senate. I object to this traditional and historic pattern being upset by some clerk in the Prime Minister&#39;s office. As far as my investigations indicate, a letter instructing the trustees of the War Memorial on this was not signed by the Prime Minister. I do not even know whether it was a letter or a telephonic communication. But the facts are that the historical Table of Precedence has been altered by administrative practice. Therefore I wish to inform honourable senators, because this is not a matter than can be decided here in an intervention by myself on a debate on a report of Estimates Committee A, that I shall seek an opportunity next week if the Senate will accord me the opportunity to give notice that I shall address myself to the Senate and move a motion in the following terms: </para>

          <para>- I make this dramatic intervention in this debate by rushing into the chamber because I just heard the utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack and I wanted to dwell on another point. The honourable senator talked about the dignity of this Senate. I had occasion last week to be in north Queensland with members of the Standing Committee on the Environment and Conservation. I had occasion to read the Cairns newspapers in which reference was made to the forthcoming State election. In a newspaper was an advertisement by the National Party referring to a meeting and mentioning the people who would address the meeting. The list showed the name of the  Hon.  D. Anthony and the name <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Mr R.</inline> Maunsell&#39;. If we are going to be honest with ourselves I think that if the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> Maunsell is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> of this Senate he was entitled to be addressed and described as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell.</inline></para>

        <para>I have just raced into this chamber to say that if we are going to have even-handed justice in this matter I hope that the  President  of the Senate will inquire into this and look at the Cairns newspapers and National Party advertisements. We should ensure that even a member of a party different from my Party is not sold short. We should make sure that this person is called <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator R.</inline> Maunsell&#39; and not <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Mr Maunsell&#39;.</inline> It is not a laughing matter. We are dealing with the dignity of this Senate. People are claiming that my Party is trying to denigrate the Senate. I know that the Premier of Queensland has a sinister attitude towards this Party and to the Parliament of the Commonwealth. I think I have made my point. I hope that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> will convey my message to the  President  of the Senate. 1 hope a scrutiny will be made of the Cairns newspapers published over the last fortnight. The fact that a Country Party senator or a National Party senator is just called &#39;Maunsell&#39; and not <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator Maunsell&#39;</inline> I think compounds the offence about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack was complaining. </para>

          <para>To disclose publicly a list of works in which we are interested at the present time would certainly raise the eyebrows of my colleagues working in other museums throughout the world and make them rather wonder about our processes.

        <para class="block">The point I make is that the concern which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mollison</inline> expresses is a reasonable concern. I do not think anyone would say otherwise, whether it be in this area or whether it be in any other area. Where there is a degree of confidentiality to be preserved by a Government officer the matter is prudent to be raised. Ought there not be some means by which an inquiring senator, an inquiring Senate or an inquiring House of Representatives can ascertain the purposes for which the expenditure is sought? What if the amount is not $4.6m but $400m? Are we to say that because some confidentiality is involved no information is to be given as to the areas in which the money is to be expended? I raise this point because I think it is important. On the day preceding the discussion of the Estimates the Senate had passed a resolution in terms which confirmed an earlier resolution of the Senate when a different government was in power. Part of that resolution states: </para>

          <para>That whilst it may be argued that Statutory Authorities are not accountable through the responsible Minister of State to Parliament for day to day operations, they may be called to account by Parliament itself at any time and that there are no areas of expenditure of public funds where these corporations have a discretion to withhold details or explanations from Parliament or its committees unless the Parliament has expressly provided otherwise. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That principle has the unanimous acceptance of the Senate. I think it applies not only to statutory corporations but also to departments, to Ministers who have the responsibility for the departments and to those persons who have information which is the subject matter of an inquiry. </para>

            <para>- I do not question that the Attorney-General would argue that way although I have no recollection of him doing so. The point I make is that if a committee in its discretion says that this matter ought not to be looked into we are opening the way to the complete negation of that principle which has been upheld by the Senate. On this occasion a committee decided that it did not wish to find out how the money was to be spent. It is the principle which I think is of fundamental importance. Once it is accepted that the committees will have some discretion to prevent questions being asked in an area the committees can do it for all purposes. I think it is a matter which ought to concern the Senate because if we are to have this type of questioning it seems to me we should be able to get the information which is sought. It was not as if the person directly concerned was seeking to withhold information. He was concerned only not to prejudice his position publicly. In the course of the consideration of the proposed expenditures the Attorney-General stated that although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mollison</inline> was prepared to give this information it should not be givenfull stop. I simply ask the Attorney-General whether on reflection he has changed his mind. Why should this information be withheld? Why should we not be told? Having regard to the willingness of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mollison</inline> to give the information and having regard to the willingness on the part of everybody to have regard to his position, why should not this information be forthcoming? </para>

I would like to point out to him that the <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> of the 1974 Estimates debate is in total head-on collision with the <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> of a previous Estimates debate. He has totally misrepresented, as he did before the Estimates Committee, the debate which established the principle on which he seeks to rely today. We are becoming used to misrepresentation from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> Last night he completely misrepresented what the Committee said on the matter of legal aid. In fact he used words which were in total conflict with what the Senate Committee was saying. I would like to refer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> to the 1971 Estimates Committee B discussion on the matter which gave rise to the enunciation of the principle about which we are talking today. </para>

        <para>I acknowledge that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mollison</inline> said he would not mind giving the Committee the information in secret. I acknowledge that the AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy),</inline> who was in control of the evidence being given to the Committee, advised that in his view, even though <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mollison</inline> was prepared to give the information in secret, the information should not be given at all. On consideration, even though I had at first said I thought it desirable that we should be given it in secret, I ruled that although the Committee undoubtedly had the power in terms of the 1 97 1 resolution to compel <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mollison</inline> to give the information if it were of that mind, the Senate also had a discretion not to require him to give that information. This ruling was upheld by the Committee with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> the only dissentient. </para>
        <para>Let us look at what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is attempting to achieve. He is not attempting to enlarge the powers of the Senate or its Committees; he is seeking to limit them, because if our power in this regard is confined to the interpretation for which he contends, it means that where we have the power we are compelled to exercise it. Let us take this view to its logical conclusion. Suppose some honourable senator considering the defence estimates asked some departmental officer who came before a Committee for information of a highly confidential nature, the sort of information which might be considered to be of some advantage to potential enemies of this country. There is no question that under the resolution on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> relies the Committee would have the power to compel an answer to that question, even if it were given in secret. We all know the limitations of secrecy in this place. We all know that once a bit of information is given anywhere in this Parliament it soon becomes public. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> mean to tell us that this Committee or the  chairman  of this Committee would not have a power to rule, subject to being overruled by the rest of the Committee or later by the Senate, that that information should not be given at all? It is not to limit the powers of the Committee or the Senate to say that it is to have this discretion; it is to give reality to such powers. </para>
        <para>I suggest that the gross inconsistency between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> attitudes when he was attempting to cover up and his present attitude is shown by the fact that now he believes that any exposure of facts or events, no matter how embarrassing, no matter how damaging to this country, is to be encouraged in the interest of an attack on this Government. He has asked me to quote what he said in a debate in the Senate when a Committee came back with a recommendation for the adoption of the principle on which he relies, that is, the power of Senate Committees to compel witnesses to give evidence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> moved the motion which had been embodied in the Committee&#39;s report, and, of course <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was not game to oppose it. Let us see how enthusiastic he was about adopting this proposal. As reported at page 2314 of the 1971 Senate Hansard, he said while giving a sort of mealy-mouthed appearance of support for the principle that had been put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy:</inline></para>

The ABC would be required to negotiate completely out in the open. Of course it would always be at a disadvantage. Presumably, it would have to pay more than other persons. In these circumstances one can only suppose that the Opposition - </para>
        <para class="block">That is, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> and senators who were then on the Opposition side -  has no concern as to whether there ought not to be some confidentiality simply to protect the expenditure of public funds. </para>

One may well ask that question. Speaking at least for myself, I am not left in any doubt as to the answer. I think we can say on a careful reading of the speech in the Senate which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has been so insistent on my referring to, that he gave reluctant, equivocal and qualified support to the principle upon which he now relies. Of course he has in his own interests completely misread this principle. The principle is not that the Senate or a Senate Committee must on all occasions use its power to compel a witness to give information which it wants. There is no doubt about that power. There was no doubt that I ruled that the Committee had that power. The power was conceded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> but the Committee, which upheld my ruling, said that even though it had this power there must be occasions when it may use its discretion not to use that power. That is what we did in this case. </para>
        <para>I am confident that the Committee did the right thing. In his dissent which is contained in the report of the Committee <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> misrepresented the position once again when he said that on this occasion a discretion was exercised to protect a Minister who did not wish to provide information even though there was a willingness on the part of the person having custody of the information to provide the material in private session of the Committee. Are we to say the same about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> back in 1971? Did he want to withhold this information merely to protect himself? The curious double standard of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> in this matter stands exposed to the whole Senate. I do not think he has a feather to fly and the sooner he resiles from this position and forgets all about this incident the better it will be for his reputation. </para>

          <para>-The matter we are discussing has been the subject of a considerable amount of public comment and adverse criticism at a time when the economy is in a turbulent state. It is quite natural for people to question whether we should be paying millions of dollars for paintings for the national art collection. I think it is a proper subject to be fully discussed. It was for that reason that I initiated the question to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mollison</inline> with respect to what art works were contemplated under this Une of the estimates. He gave me, I believe, a thoughtful answer to my question. Although this was a public hearing and he preferred not to divulge the precise nature of the paintings he may have in mind for the national art collection, he pointed out the dangers of giving the Committee specific details and the effect that it could have on the purchase of such paintings. He pointed out that it may result in the withdrawal of certain works or them being placed beyond the reach of the national collection. I was satisfied with that and did not pursue that line of questioning any further. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>But I was very keen to find out whether any other advice was obtained or whether he was the only person to decide what art works should be purchased. I learned that there was some consultation carried out and that there was an item of expenditure to cover that consultation. It was item 05 for the sum of $94,400. 1 wanted to find out just how much of that sum was paid to consultants and who the consultants were. Also I was anxious to determine the commissions that were paid in respect of such purchases and to whom these commissions were paid. I think it would be helpful if the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> could give us an example. We have purchased 2 paintings, &#39;Blue Poles&#39; and &#39;Woman V&#39;.I would like an idea of the proportion that is allowed for commissions on these purchases. What are the details in respect of those 2 paintings? How much were the commissions and to whom were they paid? I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mollison</inline> told me that commissions varied considerably. The commission for dealers promoting a painting by a famous artist could be as low as 2 per cent or 3 per cent, but in the case of an unknown artist the figure could be up to 80 per cent. I think this is significant and I would like the details to be provided. </para>
        <para>If information concerning which paintings are being considered for the National Art Collection was provided in committee there could be a possibility of its being leaked and that could be of detriment to the Government. That is the attitude I adopted. Unfortunately <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> initiated a similar line of questioning and took a different point of view. That is his business and I respect him for that attitude if he cares to take it. I certainly would have no wish to protect the Minister. I certainly did not take that line in order to protect the Minister; I took it purely and simply as a businessman. Having said that, I hope the Minister can help me by providing the details I have requested. I think it proper that this information be provided in view of the public interest in this subject. </para>

            <para>- It is my recollection that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was absent during the early part of this discussion when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> and I raised the question of the extent to which we could ask questions about this area. It is correct, as the  Chairman  of the Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, has said, that at first there was a willingness on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mollison</inline> to disclose the information. In fact generally he was very helpful to the Committee when he was before it. In the course of the problem which the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> raised, it was pointed out- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mollison</inline> also referred to this point- that there was a very grave danger of money being lost to this country as a result of the disclosure of information as to what paintings were to be purchased in this year. That is obvious and it does not need to be reiterated. </para>

          <para>CHAIRMAN-There is no doubt that members of the Committee have a right to ask questions of the nature that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> has outlined.

        <para class="block">Referring to the reservation which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has expressed, I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> in saying that it certainly was not in my mind, nor was it my intention, that there should be some protection of the Minister. The Minister seemed to be able to protect himself. I do not think the Committee was concerned in any way about any protection of the Minister but it was concerned about protecting information, the disclosure of which would have been undesirable. I take as an analogy a situation in which an honourable senator might well have a vested interest- I am not saying that this is the situation in this case- and might seek information which could be damaging if it were given. I would have thought that the  chairman  of such a committee had some discretion to determine whether questions are proper and whether they require an answer. </para>
        <para>As I read the resolution of the Senate which dealt with this matter, I do not take it as justifying in any way the contention which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has put because it says that there cannot be a withholding from Parliament or its committees unless the Parliament has expressly provided otherwise. I suggest that this was not a case of withholding information from the Committee. The Committee ruled that this question should not be asked and should not be answered. I do not accept that an individual member of a committee is entitled willy-nilly to seek any information he wishes. If the  Chairman  makes a ruling and it is upheld, it is quite proper because it conforms with the requirements of this resolution. I regret that this incident occurred but I think the  Chairman  of the Committee acted properly, in the interests of gathering works for the National Collection and in the interests of the country generally, in not allowing the question. </para>

            <para>- I do not come out of them, fortunately. These things are put forward as art. I do not know how many average parliamentarians take a real interest in art. It is the same with architecture. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> has taken an interest in architecture. I have also. However, I am sure that in the art world there are a lot of people who would not know very much about this so-called contemporary art.

        <para>I remember after we bought &#39; Blue Poles &#39; that I spoke of it as shickery art. I said then that the person who developed that particular painting must have been on the shicker. I was rather interested to see a few days later that a cobber of Pollock came out with a statement in the Press that he and Pollock were on the booze, on the shicker. Pollock started to throw paint around and he threw paint around and as a result we got the development of &#39;Blue Poles&#39;. This indicates how we can be taken for a ride. We paid US$2 m for this concoction and it was supposed to be a great piece of art. I know that the AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> mentioned some friend or partner of his who talked about our having a Pollock. The other Pollock items might have been done under less bleary conditions. However, this cobber of Pollock told us this publicly. It was clearly indicated that we were a bunch of suckers in Australia for having bought Blue Poles&#39; for $2m. It was indicated that it could have been bought for a lot less. </para>
        <para>I know that all sorts of things are said. I have talked to people about art and have been told that what I see is what the artist sees and eventually develops. When artists see these sorts of things it makes one wonder at times what sort of mental conceptions they have. What we have to think about in buying works for a national art gallery is that we are buying something for people to enjoy. Do not tell me that the people of Australia will receive a great thrill from seeing Blue Poles&#39;. I would be amazed if that were the general feeling of the people. We have just sunk US$2m into a work of art for which nobody else would have paid the price. I know that it is easy for the people handling the sale to tell us that lots of others wanted it. We obtained it for US$2m and it is generally conceded that we could have purchased if for a lot less. Since then we have bought another abortion of a thing called Woman V. Honourable senators must have seen reproductions of it. Have they ever seen any woman looking like that? </para>

            <para>- It is a boom place. It is really on the go. As a matter of fact, it is one of the few places that have not been affected by Gough &#39;s catastrophic treatment of Australia. If one looks at this second concoction that we have bought it makes one wonder where we are being led. In our national art gallery let us think of the money that we are spending on a few so-called works of art and how many people will see them in this city of Canberra. This year we are spending $4,600,000 for works for the art gallery. That is a very big expenditure. I am convinced that we could purchase lots of paintings- works of artthat would be more attractive to look at and would be better received by the people of Australia instead of spending all this money on a few abortions. When people look at them they must go away with a strange feeling about human nature generally. </para>

        <para>The time has come for us to stop being led up the garden path by these so-called art experts. They will lead us anywhere. They will give us all the stories imaginable. They will kid us. We will find that here in Australia we will have a collection of items and in the years to come people will wonder what sort of people we were to buy them. In speaking like this I am not speaking from a political point of view; I am speaking as an Australian. If we are to build an art gallery let us have an art gallery that will be of some real treasure and worth to us, something that will be worth while for people to look at and enjoy. Let us go past this mad age of contemporary art into the days of the great artists. One can understand their paintings but one cannot understand what these things are. Let me illustrate the drift that is taking place. In Kings Hall there is a painting of the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam).</inline> If one looks at it one would think that he had just come out of a delirium. It certainly does not look like him. </para>

We should not be kidded along by these socalled arty people. They will take us up the garden path as quickly as possible. Let me give an instance of the pretence and the snobbery that is to be found in the art world.

            <para>- It does not do any harm to repeat the story. Some of the Australian Labor Party supporters, some members very prominent in the Party and the Executive have said what they think about the art works that are being purchased. As a matter of fact, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jack</inline> Egerton said something about it in one of his bursts. This is not a political matter. I remind honourable senators of the great art competition that took place in this city of Canberra. The contemporary piece of art that won was called a great work of genius. It was said that the artist had wonderful possibilities. The judges&#39; faces were red when they found out what happened. A child at home had got hold of a paint brush and had thrown paint on a board. As a joke the parents entered it in the competition. It won. It was called a great piece of genius. It was said that the artist had wonderful ability. A joke won the competition in this city of Canberra. </para>

        <para>In my opinion, we have had a great joke played on us with the type of things that are being bought with Australian money at a terrific price, far greater than should have been paid if we had wanted to buy them at all. I think it is time we woke up, just as the people woke up to the Canberra art competition. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> said, let us investigate how these things were purchased, where the money was passed, who received commission and who received side commissions. Then I think we would know a little more about the story than we know now. For heaven&#39;s sake do not let us remain suckers in this world of art snobbery. </para>

          <para>- The distinguished senator from Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood,</inline> is well known for his lifelong abstinence from alcohol and anything containing alcohol. As I listened to him I was wondering what masterpiece he might have created had his habits been different through his lifetime. It may be that there is still time and that we could have another &#39;Green Poles&#39; from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> if only he would taste that which delights so many of his countrymen. I am sure that neither in this chamber nor in any other legislative chamber will we ever solve the problem of what is good and bad art. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The main subject that has been raised in this debate is the application in Estimates Committee A of the decision of the Senate on the accountability of statutory authorities. Let this be plain. Originally I moved the motion which the Senate adopted in 1971 arising out of a recommendation by an Estimates Committee. Again, a few weeks ago, as Leader of the Government in the Senate I moved an identical motion. It was adopted by the Senate, and properly so. Before Estimates Committee A I adhered to the support of the Senate for that resolution. I accepted, and I do accept, that it applies not only to statutory authorities but also to departments and agencies of the Government. Perhaps it would be better if we put that formally on the record. There is no doubt about that. Before the Estimates Committee I indicated that, if the Committee required it, the answer would be supplied without any doubt, but I asked the Committee not to require the answer for the reasons that have been indicated. The  Chairman  ruled. Dissent was indicated and the Chairman&#39;s ruling that the answer would not be required was upheld. That is an exercise of discretion by the Committee. </para>
        <para>What is really in question here is not the estimates for the Prime Minister&#39;s Department but whether the Committee has acted properly. I suppose that the question ought properly to have been raised under the estimates for the Parliament. Be that as it may, the Committee made a decision. I think it was a correct decision. Certainly, all except one member were in accord with the decision. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> in his dissent, said that the function of Senate committees in seeking explanations of items of proposed expenditure will be completely thwarted if the committee can frustrate a unanimous opinion of the Senate by deciding that it has a discretion. I suggest with great respect that that is a complete misunderstanding of the resolution of the Senate. It. is quite clear from that resolution that the Committee has a discretion. In no way was it implicit in that resolution of the Senate that the Committee was to be deprived of a discretion and that it would have to insist upon an answer to every question that might be put by any senator. That conception is a complete misinterpretation of the resolution of the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> then went on to say: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>On this occasion the discretion was exercised to protect a Minister who did not wish to provide information even though there was a willingness on the part of the person having custody of the information to provide material in private session of Committee. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That is an imputation to the Committee of improper motivation. The Committee decided, I believe properly, that the question should not be answered. But whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter, I believe it is not correct to attribute any improper motivation to the Committee. </para>
        <para>It was not mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Geenwood</inline> but it has been mentioned here previously that he was the only one dissenting from the ruling of the  chairman.  The suggestion that the motivation was to protect a Minister has already been rejected by the other members of the Committee. In no way did I put to the Committee that any action was necessary to protect myself as Minister. I am not in charge of the department concerned. This was the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I find it really difficult to see how in this instance there can be any justification whatever for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> saying that the Committee was acting to protect the Minister- myself. Sometimes there may be differences of opinion. There may be some tenuous basis upon which such an allegation can be made. In this instance, I can see none whatever. </para>
        <para>Then the suggestion is that if the foregoing view is accepted a government majority on a Committee may prevent any real examination of the Estimates. This would be done simply by determining that questions need not be answered. This is far fetched and in no way related to the circumstances of the case. The fact was that only <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was disagreeing. A decision was made which, whether right or wrong, was the decision of the Committee. I believe it was right. The Committee was exercising its discretion which had been given to it by the Senate. I believe it is important to maintain the principle as set out in the resolution of the Senate. I think it is also important to retain the discretion which resides in the Committee. I believe that the dissent of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> which really amounts to an attack upon the Committee is not justified. I believe that his interpretation of the resolution of the Senate and his observations about application in this instance are quite unsound and completely unjustified. </para>

          <para>-I rise at the first opportunity after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland made his remarks some time ago, briefly to say 3 things. The first is that when I raised this matter initially, I raised it on the general issue of principle related to whether or not a committee by exercising a discretion, might completely destroy a right which that discretion obliterates. I simply say with regard to that, that if the Senate confers upon a committee a right to have information available to it and, at the same time, concedes a discretion to that committee not to exercise that right, then if in any particular case the committee exercises that discretion there is absolutely nothing left of that right except the empty shell, unused and without any function. Therefore, if a committee so exercises a discretion that any controversial question does not have to be answered then what is the use of saying there is a right to get information from the committee? </para>

            <para>-No. I am coming to that. Apropos of that point I can only regret that for the political advantage which appeared to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, the proceedings of a private session of an Estimates Committee- I have not had a chance to recall the rules under which the Estimates Committees have been established- were revealed first of all to the Press the day after the incident took place. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland chose to reveal the proceedings of a private session of a committee to the Senate today, doubtless he did so for the political advantage which it secures for him. I think it is a deplorable state to have private sessions of a committee- sessions which are held in camera and from which everyone else is excluded- and for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland to come into this chamber and talk about what happened in order to use it for whatever political advantage can be secured. I can only say that it is a deplorable innovation. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The second point I wish to make relates back to 1971. All I say is that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland refers to the Hansard of 1971 and reads all the debates he will know 3 things. Firstly, that there was a point taken as to whether or not information should be supplied to a senator who asked for that information; secondly, that when the point was taken the right of the senator to have the information supplied to him was accepted in the Estimates Committee by the relevant officer of the department and by the Senate; and thirdly, the distinction between that situation and the present situation is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> of the Labor Party was able to get his information from a Liberal Government yet, on this particular occasion, when I seek information I am not able to get it from a Labor Government. So that the record is clear, may I refer to the page after that to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland referred, page 2315 of Hansard of 2 December 1 97 1 . 1 was speaking and I was quoting what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gifford</inline> who was a senior officer of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the  Chairman  of the Estimates Committee. The  Chairman  stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>As I understand the position, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gifford,</inline> the information could be obtained. You have taken the point that full disclosure could result in information being made available publicly which would adversely affect the business negotiating position of the ABC. Therefore you wish to refer the question to the management before giving an undertaking that the information will be supplied. Is that the position? </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Then it goes on: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gifford</inline>agreed that that was the position. The  Chairman  then went on: </para>
          <para>Subject only to that proviso, if the information is to be supplied it will be supplied to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> as soon as possible so that if possible it will be available when the Estimates debate takes place in the Committee of the Whole of the Senate? </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gifford</inline>replied: </para>
          <para>That is the case. We will make it available promptly. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">From that, management had no problems in making the information available. It was given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> and when the issue came into the Senate the whole Senate, including myself, unanimously adopted the proposition that these committees ought to have the information. </para>
        <para>The third point which I rose on this occasion to make is simply this: During the hearing of the Estimates Committee this year, as revealed by the Hansard record, all <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mollison</inline> sought to do was to give the information on paper, not to give it the widespread circulation which viva voce evidence would give. That was his sole position. That was the position which I thought- and stated so at the time- was completely reasonable. When it came my turn to ask questions, what did I say? I simply said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I would like to know what are the paintings and works of art on which this $4.6m is proposed to be expended. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The  Chairman  said immediately: </para>

Members of the Committee, before I report this Bill I wish to state to the Committee that during the proceedings in Committee last evening an adviser to a Minister presented himself in the official advisers&#39; benches dressed in a manner which I consider inappropriate for his position. I take this opportunity to state that whilst I am occupying the position of  Chairman  of Committees advisers to Ministers who occupy the advisers&#39; benches must come dressed in an appropriate manner and with a sense of the dignity of the Senate. I ask that departmental heads take note of my comment. </para>

            <para>- I have discussed this motion with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> who represents the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> in this place. I indicate that the attitude is that the Government does not really oppose the reference. I suggest that an amendment be made. Perhaps the words &#39;slight variations&#39; could be inserted instead of the word &#39;variations&#39; in fairness to the Government. It may well be that there are no variations. I believe the motion should be altered to deal with that point. If it is not the assumption could be made that there are variations, whereas it may be the Treasurer&#39;s positionI do not want to canvass the matter- that there is not a variation. Perhaps we could insert the word &#39;apparent&#39;. If we use &#39;apparent variations&#39; the question is not pre-determined in the nature of the reference. Will the honourable senator accept that amendment so the matter becomes an open question to be examined. </para>

            <para>-The debate on this matter was adjourned on 24 October last and is now being resumed. Prior to the debate being adjourned I had referred to a number of matters, one of which was the general support forthcoming from the Opposition for the funds being provided in this Bill. I also pointed out our concern in relation to another aspect. A total of $40,790,000 is being provided by the Commonwealth to the States for assistance in relation to Aboriginal people in the various States. A large part of the money is to be spent on housing. Other moneys are to be spent on education, health and other matters. The matter of concern arises because the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cavanagh)</inline> and the Government have seen fit to vary what was projected in the Budget in relation to the State of Queensland and to reduce the amount payable to that State by the sum of $3. 19m. The figure indicated in the Budget, $13,552,000, is to be reduced to $10.3m, which is provided for in the Bill. The Minister has indicated that this is because the Queensland Government- to use an expression, perhapshas not been co-operative with the Federal Government. It appears, however, that the Federal Government&#39;s idea of co-operation is if people do what they are told by the Federal Government then they are co-operating. If they are not prepared to do what they are told they are not co-operating. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This somewhat heavy handed, somewhat dictatorial, attitude of the Commonwealth Government is exemplified in this Bill as it has been in many other actions that the Government has taken. What appears to have been overlooked by the Government is the best interests of the Aborigines in Queensland. We see a situation where the Minister has said, in a somewhat airy-fairy way, that the $3. 19m will be made up in other ways by direct grants to housing associations and by expenditure through the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs and perhaps some other unspecified ways. There is no clear pattern. It has obviously not been worked out to this date exactly how the money will be spent and how much will go to which particular area. In other words people are left in a position of uncertainty as to how, when and subject to what conditions the moneys will be received in Queensland. </para>
          <para>I had also referred to some of the problems which had existed in relation to the gearing up for the expenditure of funds by Aboriginal associations in Queensland. Whilst I do not wish to be in any way taken as suggesting that they should not be encouraged to become fully operative as soon as possible, and subject to certain comments which my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> will make and which I do not pause to make but do support about the question of costs that are involved and therefore the net amount which eventually will become available for housing and other benefits to Aborigines, the fact is that last year some $9m was unexpended in relation to Aboriginal housing in Australia. As the Minister explained, that was because the associations had not geared up sufficiently to be able to spend the money in the way and at the rate anticipated by the Department at the time the Budget had been prepared. I raised with the Minister the question of whether it would be possible to spend this extra $3. 19m in the current year through the other outlets suggested by him as opposed to the certainty that it would be able to be expended by the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs or other Queensland departments such as the Department of Housing. Those departments are geared up to be able to spend the money. They are geared up to be able to make sure that the utmost advantage is taken of the provision of funds by the Commonwealth in the interests of Aborigines in Queensland. We believe and assert very firmly that there is nothing to suggest that the Commonwealth Department is in any better state than the Queensland Department is to ensure the expenditure of the money for the benefit of those people at this stage of their development. Nor are the housing associations likely to be able to expend the moneys which are planned to be granted to them already or a significant part of the extra $3. 1 9m. </para>
          <para>So it appears that there is a likelihood that once again at the end of this year there will have been an under-expenditure of what was deemed by the Parliament to be a just and appropriate amount of expenditure for Aboriginal affairs. This, of course, is clearly to the disadvantage of the Aboriginal people whom the money is intended to benefit. In my speech I had quoted some comments which had been made in a news release put out on behalf of the Co-operative for Aborigines Ltd. As I mentioned then that news release was highly critical of the present Government&#39;s failure. It was pointed out that whilst the Government was prepared to promise all sorts of things when in Opposition it had not done anything effective about those promises. Certainly the history of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is not such as would give people confidence in its having greater capacity than the Queensland Department to act in the best interests of Aborigines. I shall read from an article in the &#39;Nation Review&#39; of 17 October to give some idea of the sorts of things which have been written many times about the Department. The article states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is clear that all is not well within the Department. As reported in &#39;Nation Review&#39; of August 9, the Canberra branch is split into black versus white. Such a split in a very sensitive policy area should be giving the Government forebodings about the Department&#39;s ability to handle the policy: If it can&#39;t keep its own house in order, it is clear that it is ill equipped to cope with the problem of black-white relations on a national scale. And as Cavanagh admitted earlier this year, the implementation of Labor&#39;s policy has been a &#39;disaster&#39;. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Recent events only heighten the concern of those who have doubts about the capacity of the Department at the moment efficiently to act in the best interests of Aborigines in Australia. I do not wish to go into detail about the matter but I simply remind honourable senators of the confrontation precipitated by the Minister from which, I believe, he wisely backed away. It was precipitated by him only last week when he made a confrontation threat to the New South Wales Aboriginal Legal Service that unless it took certain action he was not prepared to grant the Service any further funds. This was at a time when the Service was out of funds and it would have had to put off staff if further funds were not immediately forthcoming. That confrontation could have been quite disastrous in damaging relationships between some of the more outspoken and militant people who have been demonstrating in relation to their claims about what they regard as inefficiency in the administration of Aboriginal affairs in Australia. I am glad to say that the Minister withdrew from that confrontation position. </para>

              <para>- I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> and I have any basic difference of attitude. He is talking about one matter and I am talking about another. My criticism of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh-</inline> if I may direct it through you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President-</inline> is that he confuses 2 entirely separate issues. The separate issues, of course, are firstly in relation to accountability as far as the New South Wales Aboriginal Legal Service is concerned and, secondly, the manner of exercising a right to protest. I do not subscribe to the manner of the exercise of the right of protest by the erection of tents outside Parliament House but I suggest that the Minister is not entitled in any way at all to say to the New South Wales Aboriginal Legal Service: &#39;I will cut off your funds unless you cause those tents to be pulled down.&#39; But of course that is another matter. It is one which is disquieting in relation to the administration of Aboriginal affairs in Australia and one which does not make for any greater confidence that the Commonwealth Department is more capable automatically than Queensland in administering for the benefit of Aborigines in Queensland. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I refer also to the sorry history of the Redfern housing project which, apparently because of the Department&#39;s inability for one reason or another to fund in the way which was promised, has now ground to a halt. This has meant that the employees who were taking part in what I understand to be an excellent development program of housing renovation and the provision of housing for Aboriginal people in that area have been put out of work because the Department has not made the promised funds available. This is just one further part of the overwhelming problem which seems to be besetting the administration of this area of government activity. Bearing in mind all these things and the matters which I mentioned earlier about the interests of the Aborigines in Queensland, I read from an editorial in the &#39;Courier-Mail&#39; of 18 October which states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">Nobody can be certain at this stage whether Queensland&#39;s Aborigines want Commonwealth or State laws. Surely there is a sensible and fair method of finding this out. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I subscribe to the general thought that at this stage nobody can be certain what the majority of Aboriginal people in Queensland want. I do not believe that it is in their best interests to have the Commonwealth Government foist onto them, in the way it is doing in this Bill, or in the way which is proposed in some other legislation to which I shall not refer, the decision that Big Brother knows best, that the Commonwealth Government will act irrespective of what the Queensland Government may wish and irrespective of what the Aboriginal people in Queensland may wish. I believe that the Government&#39;s action is petty. It is not really action which one would expect from a national government. Rather, it is the attitude: &#39;If you do not make me captain I shall take my bat and ball home and will not let you play&#39;. I think it is extremely unfortunate that this Government cannot be a little bigger in its approach to what is a national question and problem and one which deserves proper consideration, not petty action. For those reasons I move an amendment to the motion for the second reading and to draw attention to the attitude of the Senate in relation to this action of the Government because we believe that it should forthwith make this money available to the Queensland Government so that it can be spent expeditiously in the best interests of the Aborigines of Queensland. I move: </para>

            <para>At end of motion add- but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government&#39;s action in reducing the grant to the State of Queensland by $3,190,000 is a petty action which is contrary to the best interests of the Aboriginal people of Queensland and that the Government should take immediate steps to grant to the State of Queensland the further sum of $3,190,000 as promised in the Budget&#39;. </para>

            <para>-I want to refer to a couple of matters. In particular I criticse some of the things which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has said. He has taken an emotional attitude, not a very logical one, to the whole problem. On many occasions before I have said in this chamber that as far as I am concerned the socalled Aboriginal problem is a white man&#39;s problem. We created it in the first instance. We perpetuated it. In many ways we are not doing a very good job of solving the white man&#39;s problem. Until 2 December 1972 the Aboriginal people in this country had no hope, no future and no possibility of ever raising their living standards to that of the rest of the population. I shall touch first on one of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> &#39;s last points. He criticised the fact that there has been a decrease in the housing allocation provided for Aborigines to the Queensland Government. On at least 2 occasions in the last 2 financial years fairly large sums of money have remained unexpended in Queensland when they should have been made available for the purchase or construction of homes for Aborigines. Money has been grossly misspent by the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs. A lot of these problems come back to the Aborigines Act 1972 and the Torres Strait Islanders Act 1972. 1 think this might have been referred to in the article which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> mentioned or in an article published subsequently, probably in the &#39;Courier-Mail&#39;. The author said that there was a subtle miniracism attitude by even dividing the 2 groups of black people and covering them under 2 restrictive Acts. This is the root cause of most of the evils of my State of Queensland. There is no real reason for keeping either Act in existence. But those who are in authority in that State believe that this is the only way in which you can keep black people in subjection. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I raised a question in this House a few weeks ago in relation to expenditure on housing for Aborigines who eventually hoped that they would be able to purchase the homes. At the time I said that the Queensland Government was making a profit at the expense of black people. I have referred a specific case to the Minister which is currently under his scrutiny. It involves an Aboriginal family in my own district which moved into a house some 4 to 41/2 years ago. About $9,000 was paid for that home. The family had hoped, in fact they were told at the time, that when they wanted to purchase the house they would be able to purchase it. They were clearly under the impression that they would be able to buy it at somewhere near the original purchase price. Recently they made approaches to the Department to purchase the home. They were told that they could buy it for some $ 17,000. 1 am not putting up a phoney argument. I have information in black and white in my own office records. In addition, this family had to find some $2,000 for a deposit. If that is not blatant racketeering at the expense of the black people of Queensland by an unsympathetic government, then I ask honourable senators to tell me what is. These days housing is bad enough for the ordinary individual in the community, whether it involves the payment of rent or the purchase of a home, with the current inflationary problems being experienced in the world. But it is doubly hard for Aborigines who almost invariably come within the lowest income group and frequently have to provide for a family larger than average. It is true that we are giving some help by way of secondary school grants and in other ways but we still have a long way to go- </para>
          <para>I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has left the chamber. He would be well advised to cooperate with the Government rather than to adopt a knocking attitude. If this is the way that a State government handles its funds, then it is obviously incompetent to handle additional funds. There are people from one end of Queensland to the other waiting for homes. Queensland has the largest black population of any State in Australia with 60,000-odd people of whom about 7,000 to 10,000 are islanders. There are people in Queensland who are getting a rake-off, apart from the State Government, at the expense of the Aborigines. I saw a contract recently concerning premises to be made available for Aborigines in which an estate agent was apparently getting the rip-off. The person holding the first mortgage was almost identifiable with a section of the estate agency. During the Estimates debate I asked a number of questions about people who are operating in the Northern Territory. 1 have been supplied with that information by the Department. Of all the consultants and the accountants who are listed by the Department I have selected only a few. Let me mention some of them. There is Andrew McPhee and Associates, consultants, whose fee over the period referred to amounted to $15,018; Talbot, Hunt and Partners were paid $41,412; Gutteridge, Haskins and Davey were paid $184,778. I would like to know what they got those fees for. Two groups of people have to be protected in this community; firstly, the Aborigines, and secondly, the taxpayers. I think the taxpayers would be quite happy to be put in second place. But there are groups of people in the community who are getting a rip-off at the expense of the Aborigines. Let me cite a few more names. There is Boehme, Topeny and Partners who were paid $5,926. Now let us look at the accountancy group. Wilson, Bishop, Bowes and Craig were paid $17,412; C. W. Stirling and Co. was paid $8,231; E. J. Shepherd and Associates were paid $1,443, and Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co. were paid $16,969, almost $17,000. The Secretary of the Department went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In some instances the technical consultants are also acting purchasing agents and charge a fee but this component is not readily available as such costs are absorbed under other expenditure headings. </para>
            <para>The figures represent actual cash paid to architectural and accounting consultants. The majority of the associations have incurred liabilities for fees in 1973-74 which were paid in 1974-75. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>I assume that those figures refer to the 1973-74 financial year. It goes further than this. The Minister has very properly made available additional funds this year to assist housing associations. In Queen-land there is quite a number of them. But what has happened? We now find that a whole host of them are being held up at the registration level, so in a direct way the State Government again is stepping in to deprive Aborigines of housing. It is a hypocritical attitude for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to adopt when he knows that this misuse of funds is going on at the State government level while he criticises the Australian Government for reducing the housing quota. It is not even a fair criticism. The honourable senator ought to look deeper into the subject before he starts putting up a phoney argument in this chamber. He is not helping the Aborigines. All he is doing is helping that close personal friend of mine, the Premier of Queensland, in his political arguments in the State election campaign. </para>

              <para>- The Premier and I often have conversations through the &#39;Courier-Mail&#39;. We are not exactly on telephone calling terms. But I will put it in inverted commas to put it on the right side of the ledger. The situation goes further than this. There are people who endeavour to set up their own private business organisations under the capital funding of the Australian Government. In many instances these involve consultants. One of the projects that I am particularly angry about is the famous one at Clump Mountain which, over a period of years, we have tried to get off the ground but there has been that much referring and conferring on the project, with people getting consultancy fees, that finally it was knocked back and it has now come up again for consideration. Who is to blame for this? I am not blaming the people in the Australian Department of Aboriginal Affairs, who in 99 per cent of cases are doing their very best to get over a very great problem. But I think that in a minority of cases some blame must lie there particularly with some senior officials. Not enough Aboriginal people have been taken into consultation. I note that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> did not say this because he probably does not know anything about it as he comes from a State were the Aboriginal population has been virtually annihilated. Aborigines ought to be consulted at every level and they ought to be involved in the decision making. I have heard it said in this chamber that Queensland is an ideal place. It is not. </para>

              <para>- I am saying that in very difficult circumstances <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> is doing the very best that he possibly can on behalf of the Australian Aborigines, so put that in your pipe and smoke it. The situation is that the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has been assailed on all sides but in particular is he being assailed by people associated with the Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs in the State of Queensland in which State the greatest number of black people are congregated. The Minister is not getting a fair go at all. I do not direct criticism in the manner in which honourable senators opposite are hoping, that is, at the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs, because as far as I am concerned many or most of its officers, as I said earlier, are doing the very best they can under difficult circumstances. Honourable senators will note that recently the Minister announced the setting up of a task force in Queensland. It must be done, in the interest of the Aboriginal people themselves. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> would agree with me; it does not matter very much. In spite of the fact that it is said that there is a so-called advisory council in Queensland, the majority of members of that council have been hand picked in various ways by white people in the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs to make sure that the Aborigines say &#39;Yes, boss&#39; every time that a proposal is put. </para>

I know the reserves probably as well as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> does, in spite of my white skin. I have heard people on every Aboriginal reserve in Queensland criticise the Queensland Aboriginal advisory council. On every occasion people- all Aboriginal people and Islanders- have criticised the advisory council in Queensland because it is dominated not by the Minister for Conservation, Marine and Aboriginal Affairs in Queensland, who is only the office boy and who is allowed to take messages between the Director and the Premier, or vice versa, but by the Premier. </para>

              <para>- I will say a few words about him in a moment. I am not criticising the Queensland Minister. He is a very nice bloke, a very pleasant bloke with whom to have a beer and a yarn, but he is allowed no authority at all. If he were allowed some authority one would see a vastly different picture in Queensland. One would see State co-operation with the Australian Government as we have seen it in almost every other State in Australia. This is an area in which people- particularly the Premier of Queensland -are fond of saying that Aboriginal people are making their own decisions. They are not. There is an attempt at the Australian Government level to bring that about, but we have not yet gone far enough. There should be people within the Australian Department of Aboriginal Affairs who are black and who are making decisions on behalf of their brothers and sisters. I have always said publicly and privately that I have great sympathy for the aims and aspirations of people such as Charles Perkins, to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> referred a moment ago. Charles Perkins knows my views in this regard. We need more people of the calibre of Charles Perkins, particularly in Queensland. We need to take Aboriginal people from under the harrow of the Act so they may be able to say things without being worried about whether they will be thrown off a reserve. </para>

              <para>- I do not wish to have an argument with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner.</inline> Things are happening on reserves in Queensland of which I do not approve. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> approves of them either, but for political reasons he cannot criticise them. I can. I hope he knows that the so-called petition that was taken up on the Palm Island reserve was a hoax from the start. It was phoney. The takeover of the reserve by the Townsville City Council was opposed by the previous advisory council, but I am told- I believe reliably- that within 2 hours the new council under white domination carried a resolution agreeing to be incorporated within the boundaries of the Townsville City Council. I fear that if this reserve does not come under the administration of the Australian Government wealthy, multi-national tourist companies will walk in there and take it over. No more black people will be living there unless the companies k eep on a couple of gardeners and dishwashers, because that is all the Queensland Government allows black people to do. It does not allow them any initiative while it can keep them under the control of the 2 Acts and keep them cooped up on reserves. </para>

          <para>I know it has been said that there are now loopholes in the Act- if one wishes to describe them as such- which allow Aborigines to be in charge of their own affairs; and a number of them are. Surprisingly, to those people who favour the Acts, Aborigines handle their own affairs much better than white people handled their affairs for them. For instance, they are now able to have a savings account and to find out that funds do not mysteriously disappear from their savings accounts as happened over a long period of years. There is an Aboriginal living in the Townsville area- I am prepared to make his name available if anybody wishes to know it, although I do not wish to mention it publicly because it might embarrass him or his family- who for a long period of time under the Act was able to put money away in a bank account. When he was able to get away totally from the reserve and be free of the Act, not only was he not able to find the money but he could not find the bank account. We have searched every bank in an area of 300 miles to find that man&#39;s bank account. Because of the lapse of time, we may never find it. It is unlikely that we will ever find it. </para>
          <para>The will of a deceased Aboriginal or Islander in Queensland who remained under the Act is not valid unless it is signed by an officer of the Department. So those estates have gone into limbo. People are trying to claim on the estates of deceased relatives, and they are still unable to claim. Where is that money? Who is holding it? Is it in trust? Is there a hope that somewhere along the line those people will die and that money will go into Consolidated Revenue? Has it already been fiddled with at some level along the road? I know that is a very serious accusation to make, but I make it. </para>

              <para>- What about the hundreds who were not caught? Do they need defending? I will not defend them, and I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> will not defend them. There is a responsibility on this Government to clean up the mess left by years of maladministration at government level and at the Commonwealth level so far as Aborigines are concerned. Our ambitions are to see Aborigines running their own affairs to some degree in the short term- as soon as possibleand totally in the long term. Our ambition as legislators ought to be to ensure that no white people in the community are getting a rip-off at the Aboriginal people&#39;s expense and at the taxpayers&#39; expense. This is happening. I would like to see the figures that I have quoted analysed publicly. This comes back to my public involvement in the Aboriginal Housing Panel. In my view, the majority of members of that Panel should be Aboriginal people. I do not care how good an architect is. Unless he lives with the people, as some of the architects involved with the Panel have, unless he knows their attitudes to housing, he has no right to say how they should live. Just look at the reserves in Queensland. They are neat little boxes built in areas where trees have been ploughed out. That is where we say that Aboriginals want to live. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Look at the Laura episode which I raised not many weeks ago in a question in this chamber. Aborigines did not want one house situated where the Queensland Department built them. But the Queensland Department expended the best part of $250,000 of Australian Government funds to build houses, firstly, where Aborigines did not want them and, secondly, in an area where they will probably have to be shifted because of the type of earth or sand in that area. The houses will probably develop a 45 degree lean in the first wet. If we had taken notice of the Aborigines we would have built houses in an area where they wanted them, where the ground formation would have been good, where they would have been able to have a garden and where they would have been able to live happily. Then we go to places such as Lockhardt. We shift the Aborigines by force from their grounds and put them on a hill- a stoney hill- under the dominance of the white man who is on top of the hill so he can look down on his black subjects. We have done this from one end of Australia to another over the years. If an Aboriginal lived on a reserve in Western Australia- not now; it has been changed in recent times- he was allowed to have  alio  volt lighting system. When it got dark the power was switched off even if there was a refrigerator running on the one point in the house. It did not matter if people had the baby&#39;s milk or the weekend meat in the refrigerator. According to the white masters of the day the Aborigines might have damaged themselves if they had left the power switched on overnight. In the last year or two we have got away from this attitude and it is in this area that the Australian Government Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cavanagh)</inline> is trying to rectify all the things that have been done wrong over the years. </para>
          <para>I could refer to the famous turtle episode. Here a man who was unable to administer a major project is no longer in the country. He disappeared from the country when things got too hot. It is a project on which a lot of taxpayers&#39; money was lost. If there had been proper co-operation at all levels, State and Federal, at that time and if there had been proper administrative practices none of that money would have been lost. I am not saying that it would have been an economically viable industry. Nobody knows. But at least it would have been a decent testing area for us to see what we could do. </para>
          <para>I must reiterate that in most of the Queensland reserves there is soil suitable for growing vegetables and tropical fruit, but this has never been done because the combines which are able to produce at unfair prices are able to make great sales at the expense of the black people on the reserves. This applies to places like Bamaga where the soil is good and where we have spent half a million dollars of Australian Government funds supplying water. Of course the first water connections were to the homes of the white officials. I have said this before and I will say it again because it has to be emphasised. When these water connections were made the first connections should have been not to those homes but to the houses of the black people, the people who have been deprived for so many years. </para>
          <para>I was given an assurance a long time ago that when the water reticulation scheme was commenced at the Palm Island reserve the Aboriginals employed- and there was to be a high Aboriginal labour content, and there has been- were to get award wages. That never happened. An Aborigine driving a sophisticated piece of machinery was getting the top wages of $50-odd a week. If he had been a white man doing the same job he would have pulled down wages of not less than $120 and maybe even more a week. Of course, the labourers were paid on a proportionately lower scale. A statement which had obviously been prepared for the Oueensland Minister for Conservation, Marine and Aboriginal Affairs was reported recently in a newspaper and indicated that around $53 a week would be the average wage paid around the reserves. That is not true because it has not yet reached $40 at the peak and there are very few on the peak wage. The situation is a bit like that of Qantas pilots. About 3 pilots get the peak wage and about 3 people on the reserves get the peak wage. </para>
          <para>This is another area in which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is to be commended. At least he has set in train, slowly though it may be, in the Northern Territory and other areas under the direct jurisdiction of the Australian Government a proper award wage system, and he has provided proper social security benefits for people who are not able to be gainfully employed. But this never happened on Queensland reserves. It has been slave labour there for so many years that it does not matter. Yet this is the sort of system that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> in this chamber this afternoon defended. It would be a good idea if he went out and looked at some of the conditions and searched behind the false wall of respectability for some of the factual things he ought to be able to find behind it. The old Mapoon move has been dreamed of, not by a great number of people but by a hard core of people, for so many years that it does not matter. Do honourable senators know what was said by the Queensland Minister when these people wanted to move back to old Mapoon? He said: &#39;In forty or fifty years&#39; time when your kids are educated you can go back&#39;. Thank God they have taken the initiative and have gone back without his permission. They have gone back with the encouragement and support of the Australian Government&#39;s Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, to his eternal credit. </para>

              <para>- It had nothing to do with it. The hookworm which drove them away was a trinity- the Queensland Government, Comalco Ltd and the church mission. They made a deal over the heads of the Aborigines, and they were the real hookworm in that settlement. They were the ones who drove them out. Finally a few refused to go- and do not believe the story that no guns were used because guns were used to force them off the reserve. They have gone back to the land they knew. Now they are being further harassed by the Queensland Department. There are some clean-skin cattle there which by all accounts belong to the old people of old Mapoon. But they have been taken away by the Queensland Department. These people will not be allowed even a few clean-skins to form the nucleus of a small herd in that area. For God&#39;s sake, let us be honest in our attitudes and not fiddle around making political issues in the way that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> tried to do this afternoon. Do not put out a smokescreen to protect inefficient people. </para>

              <para>- If it is an intelligent interjection I will answer it. The last one was not but I answered it. What is this one? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> does not answer so presumably it was not intelligent and I will not proceed with it. We heard the crux of this matter last night. A number of senators on Estimates Committee G asked some pertinent questions. In the main we got fairly good replies. At least we got frank replies. We might not all have been happy with the replies. But when the estimates for . the Department of Aboriginal Affairs came into the chamber last night they were passed without any discussion at all. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> wanted to pursue his little hate session he had a first class opportunity to do so last night. </para>

His  colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was here. He was dissatisfied with the results of Estimates Committee A and he pursued those estimates here, and he pursued them at the Estimates Committee and held up its hearings for several days to the disgust of just about everybody on the Committee including his own colleagues. He held up the passage of those estimates through this chamber. He again pursued the matter and when he ran out of something fresh to say he read over his remarks from Hansard just to keep the debate going. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is dissatisfied he had his opportunity to come in here last night and utter the criticisms he is uttering today, but he did not do it. So we assume from his nonopposition last night that he is totally satisfied with the way in which the Australian Government is running its Department of Aboriginal Affairs. </para>

An allocation has been made over a period of years to the Queensland Government through the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs. Queensland is the only State which funds Aboriginal housing through the relevant department. In all other States it is done through the housing commission or the equivalent department. For 2 years at least the quota of money for Queensland has not been spent.

          <para>The Australian Government has decided to set up a series of organisations known as housing associations so that the Queensland Aboriginal people will not be deprived of that money. The $3m will go into the housing associations in Queensland and for the first time many Aboriginal people will get an opportunity to have a home, something they will not get under the Queensland Government. I will bet pounds to peanuts now- this has nothing to do with Kingaroy or the Premier- that at the end of this financial year the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs still will have a large sum of unexpended money. The Premier likes it that way. If he is still in power that will be the case. He likes to be able to keep Australian Government funds in bank accounts, trust accounts, jam tins in his backyard or somebody else&#39;s backyard, refrigerators, in anything at all just to embarrass the Australian Government. I saw a cheque which should have been paid many months before by the Queensland Government go to a particular local authority. Interest had accumulated on it because the Queensland Government had hung onto it for so long. Even in the days when the Opposition was in Government at the Australian level money was made available for the repair of the swimming baths at Thursday Island. What happened to it? We never found it again. Money was made available for a kindergarten that was never constructed. The Australian Government has had to provide additional money to build a kindergarten and a swimming pool, things which should have been done four or five years ago, long before the Australian Labor Party came into office. Let us face up to realities and not go chasing political clouds. I believe that some of the things I have said badly needed saying. </para>

I support the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and the amendment he has moved. I am afraid that in the course of my remarks I will be a little critical of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cavanagh).</inline> He certainly is doing his best under difficult circumstances but I believe his choice of advisers as to the Queensland position has not been good. He has been ill advised on many subjects and I will refer to them in the course of my remarks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has taken $3,190,000 off the vote for Queensland under this Bill. He has stated that he cannot get the Queensland Premier and the Queensland Minister concerned to discuss matters with him. The Premier of Queensland has advised this Government, I believe on a Premier to Prime Minister level, that his Government is absolutely opposed to handing over any of the land reservations in Queensland because- I have been told that he has said this- it would lead to a State within a State and he will not have that. Otherwise the Queensland authorities have never refused to discuss matters with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> the Minister. </para>

              <para>and (2) I am aware of the reports and also have seen the Bill, the States Grants Aboriginal Assistance Act 1974 introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> last week which provides for a payment to Queensland in 1 974-75 of $ 10,362,000. </para>

          <para>In his Budget the Treasurer provided an amount of $13,552,000 so that in effect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> proposes reducing Queensland&#39;s allocation by $3,190,000 in spite of commitments in writing given by him and his Department as well as consultation at officer level which indicated the amount as being for housing for Queensland &#39;s Aborigines. </para>
          <para>Although, even based on the Commonwealth census figures, Queensland has at least 34.58 per cent of Australia&#39;s total Aboriginal people, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> is reducing allocation of moneys on their behalf to only 25 .4 per cent of the total. </para>
          <para>I am greatly concerned over this action by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> as it has now become necessary for me to have my Department carry out an exhaustive investigation of total fundings which at this stage appears to require a drastic reduction in the housing programme activity which must be disastrous not only for the building industry generally in the State, but as well dash the hopes of so many Queensland Aborigines for an early relief of their housing problems. </para>
          <para>On the other hand, we have the Federal Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Johnson)</inline> at the weekend stating he was very worried at the low commencement rate for new buildings in Queensland, yet at the time he must have been fully aware of this action by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> which can only contribute to further chaos in the building industry. </para>
          <para>It is futile for the <inline font-weight="bold">Senator to</inline> claim that he proposes reallocating the money so that Queensland &#39;s Aborigines will not be disadvantaged when he is fully aware that his Bill reallocates the amount to other Slates and also that during the past financial year his Department underspent by $9m in the housing section alone, as indicated in the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech. </para>
          <para>I feel, therefore, I must emphasize to honourable members that any further unemployment or slump in the building industry in Queensland will be the direct responsibility of the Federal Government. </para>
          <para>I can only assume that his reducing funds is based on a desire to retard the improvements and developments in Aboriginal welfare in this State which so significantly highlight the failures in the Northern Territory and other areas under direct Federal influences and policies which have been admitted as disasters. </para>
          <para>The previous <inline font-weight="bold">speaker, Senator Keeffe,</inline> mentioned Old Mapoon. I do not think that he stated the facts correctly. Mapoon was finally abandoned. It was not a departmental settlement, except at the very end. It was run by the Presbyterian Church. The population kept dwindling, and when the Presbyterians could not obtain any more missionaries to run the place the Department took it over for a little while and then decided to abandon the settlement. </para>

              <para>-Old Mapoon. The soil there is unsuitable for gardens or for growing anything. There is a lack of water supply in the dry times. The underground water supply has such a high bacteria count as to be almost unusable. The available water is polluted. In the wet time when the river ran, in the previous settlement it ran through the latrines, the kitchen and the dining room. Consequently, there was a high incidence of disease. There was a 25 per cent incidence of hookworm, the highest in Australia. About 10 years ago the Queensland Director-General of Health inspected the area and condemned it utterly. There has been talk about the people being removed at gunpoint. This is absolutely wrong. I am informed that when the last few people were taken away the only guns in evidence belonged to a couple of the old men who took their fowls, dogs and everything with them. The guns had been used for hunting. Statements have been published- I do not know to whom they are attributed- to the effect that the site was cleared for bauxite mining. That is not quite right either, because the Queensland Government has reserved an area up and down the coast and to a certain extent inland which, as an Aboriginal reserve, cannot ever be used for rnining. It is not available to the rnining companies. It is not part of their lease. </para>

In case <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> wants further information on the position I will quote from a letter from Reverend G. L. Filmer of St Paul&#39;s Presbyterian Church, Gordonvale. He was the last missionary in Old Mapoon. Amongst other things, he wrote: </para>

            <para>The only wrong thing with moving Mapoon is that it was not done ten or fifteen years ago. Most of natives who were there 6 years ago were reasonably educated- they could read, write, handle currency, owned motor boats, horses, radios, rifles and all spoke English. They could live in a town as well as any white man (which has been amply proven) and the impression gained will be that such folk ought not to be on a reserve at all. </para>
            <para>It is a reasonable thing however for an uninformed person to ask, &#39; Why not let the people stay on their original place? &#39; </para>
            <para>The Presbyterian Church and the Queensland Government would have been only too happy to do this, only for the fact that the old site of Mapoon is less than worthless- in fact it was a constant liability. The site is on an exposed peninsula; the whole terrain consists of deep drifts of sterile sand which is very hard to cultivate without the addition of huge quantities of humus and water. The sand causes buildings to topple, blows into every nook and cranny under the pressure of high winds, penetrates stationary engines, ruins the mechanisms of vehicles and causes eye troubles among the children. </para>
            <para>The area is impregnated with hookworm, resulting in anaemia and low  resistence  to illness. Plagues of mosquitoes are frequent. I have been all over Queensland and have not seen the flies worse anywhere. Anyone who has been told that Mapoon is a good place has been gravely misinformed,  and it is small wonder that during the 10 years from 1950 to 1 960 there were no fewer than 7 superintendents. </para>

              <para>-I will try to find the date for the Minister. The report was made and a limit was put on the number of houses that could be built each year in Normanton. When I was last in Normanton- not too long ago- I saw the type of houses that the Queensland Government is building for the aboriginals there on the high ground near the old railway station. They are proud of these cottages. They have plenty of room, a good water supply and room for gardens. At the present rate if they can only get enough money to build these houses- not have it cut off- they will have the whole problem at Normanton under control. </para>

              <para>1 ) and (2) From Press reports and a telegram two days ago from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> I understand that he is visiting Weipa at the end of calls at a number of other centres. There is no doubt that the visit is designed primarily to endeavour to create unrest and disharmony amongst Aboriginal people, and I would forecast also for party political purposes in view of the election, but especially as a result of a particularly vitriolic attack on him and his department by a group of Aborigines in North Queensland. I have a copy of the message sent to him, but at this stage must respect the privacy of those who told him they have no trust in him or his department. 1 am sure that the whole exercise is most embarrassing to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> and must have been aggravated by yesterday&#39;s efforts in Canberra when the people his department has been financially sponsoring for so long, finally turned upon their masters. I very much regret having to foreshadow his intent as I have at all times endeavoured to encourage both the Commonwealth Government and others to refrain using Aborigines as political &#39;footballs&#39; and political pawns&#39;. My information on the so-called Weipa conference conveys that it is a determined attempt by radical people in North Queensland, as a result of manipulation by Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs&#39; officers and others, to create distrust and unrest amongst former residents of Mapoon. The vast majority of these people over many years have established themselves in conventional urban society in many towns in Queensland and are raising families of whom anyone could be proud. The Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs through its various agencies, has gathered together numbers of the former residents from Silkwood, Townsville, Cairns, Normanton and other northern centres. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> with an entourage of Canberra officers, is visiting Weipa today in a VIP aircraft, but also there have been at least three special aircraft charters, at public expense, including a DC3, to convey people from Cairns, Normanton and northern centres. There is no doubt that a preliminary meeting at Weipa yesterday, under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Joe</inline> McGuinnes of Cairns, who is well known for his radical left-wing attitudes, is nothing more than designed to tear at the heartstrings and the emotions of such people, who are well adjusted, and are bringing up their children as normal and conventional Queenslanders. </para>

          <para>It can do nothing more than create further emotional and family disruption and probably destroy the painstaking work of years on the part of the families, the Presbyterian Church and my Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs, who have done all possible to assist in the transitional stage of urban living which the people voluntarily undertook. 1 can only express my extreme sorrow that a Minister of the Crown would be associated with such a project. There is no doubt in my mind that the whole exercise is a deliberate attempt designed to force upon Queensland&#39;s citizens, the recommendations of the Woodward Report in the Northern Territory and the objectives of the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs, which are to create black&#39; States inhabited only by Aboriginal people in an apartheid situation, to the overall detriment primarily of the people themselves and secondly Australia as a nation. I must emphasize that the site of the former Mapoon Mission has been preserved by the State Government as a holiday area and people encouraged to visit there from time to time as they would wish and numbers have done so. I have no doubt that the majority of the former Mapoon people are wise enough to see through the obvious manoeuvres of this diabolical attempt to subvert them from being citizens of Queensland and Australia and reject it with the contempt it deserves. 1 am informed that last night at Normanton, the Minister&#39;s response to a simple request by the local authority (the Carpentaria Shire Council) for a few thousand dollars to improve the water supply, to permit extension of services to more Aboriginal homes was a threat to virtually annihilate the town by fostering a separate &#39;village&#39; of Aboriginal people. Surely apartheid in the extreme! Yet at the same time, he must be aware that his department&#39;s secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr 13.</inline> Dexter, and the  chairman  of his Advisory council, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr H.</inline> C. Coombs, have stated that the rehousing program for Aboriginal people at Normanton is more than satisfactory and proceeding at a rate within the absorption capacity of the </para>
          <para class="block">Aboriginal people and the town itself. After his tour of the west and visits to some selected centres, including border camps of refugees from his Northern Territory policies which he himself has described as a national disaster, he claims neglect and underspending. Until he became Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, he probably was never out of a city or into the spinifex and seen Aborigines in real life. I must refute such allegtions by this despicable dealer in despair of his own creation. The facts are that contrary to his claims, his own actions have virtually condemned hundreds of families to despair by his diverting to other States more than three million dollars, allocated by the Commonwealth Treasurer to Queensland in his budget. Surely he will recall his approval of one million dollars, as advised in the following telegram of March 22:- &#39;Your telegram re housing funds stop Minister has just approved of your being authorised to undertake additional commitments up to one million dollars during current financial year against additional funds of this amount being included in next years allocation stop This course being adopted because release of additional funds now would require appropriation by Parliament and would take time stop If however you have savings on other sections which could be utilised for housing this could be authorised with ministerial approval stop Should you favour this course as well please provide details.&#39; He further gives the lie to his words of underspending by his own letter of May 26, 1974, which reads: &#39;. . . I refer to your letter of May 1 1974 detailing the anticipated carry-over of funds as at June 30, 1974 and recommending a further commitment against the 1974-75 program of $1,271,000 to be used to continue the housing program. I am now pleased to inform you that I have approved a further commitment, making a total of $2,271,000 of additional funds available to continue the 1973- 74 housing program. My department will adjust the 1974- 75 request to include the additional commitment . . . &#39; How can anyone have confidence in a Government comprised of such persons! I am sure honourable members would be interested in hearing the attitude of a number of Aborigines as conveyed in a telegram on October 22 to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> a copy of which has been made available to me:- &#39;. . . So far you have done nothing to help Mapoon people except promises stop. </para>
          <para>Yesterday police and DAIA threatened Jerry Hudson in Weipa not to return to Mapoon stop Transport is needed now supplies are needed now stop We are busting our guts to keep supplies going to keep police and DAIA away from Mapoon while your useless mistrusted office &#39;boys&#39; in Cairns write you false reports stop In our books you are just as bad for your braggadocio false promises and time-wasting tactics while the people with the guts are now being threatened and intimidated and you have the gall to say you are waiting and considering a further report stop Just where do you stand? If you stand at all stop Whose side are you on anyway? You shot your mouth off saying you would fund Mapoon as soon as people moved back stop They trusted you and your promises but you have let them down very convincingly stop You have had one month to put your money where your mouth is but again you have failed miserably stop Meeting must be held in Weipa or Mapoon where the real people are where the action is taking place stop Restrictive boycott with the Press and TV and the people will be put on any such meeting in Cairns stop Also this meeting must be organised by one of our North Queensland representatives who is trusted by the people not Grimwade nor Wallace stop Give us Joe McGuinness to organise this meeting stop We won&#39;t accept any other of your stooges stop By the way we used our own money for this telegram. &#39; A report just to hand from Cunnamulla advises many complaints from the Aboriginal people there about the visit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> and more particularly members of his party, who invaded their homes and their privacy for photographic purposes without prior permission or approval. A petition of objection has been delivered to the department&#39;s officer who says the people are particularly irate over the photographing of a young lad standing outside a toilet door. They consider this a gross invasion of personal privacy and are seeking legal advice on possible action against the offenders. I sympathise with the people of Cunnamulla who have been subjected to such intolerable circumstances as a result of the Senator&#39;s visit and can assure them that whatever action my department can take to redress their wrongs will be readily available. </para>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline>has made a statement that he intends, amongst other things, to try to throw open the Queensland reserves to any Aboriginals who care to go to them. I think that he is a little out of touch with the Aboriginal councils which run these reserves. He is not fully conversant with the position. I have been to Palm Island and to other reserves. I have met the members of the councils who have been elected by the people in a democratic ballot. One thing that the Aboriginal people want to keep is this permit system which allows people to come to the reserves only with a permit. </para>
          <para>I will take the position on Palm Island. There is accommodation for about 1,200 people there. All the facilities are there for that number of people. If the reserve were thrown open to Aboriginal visitors from all over Queensland and elsewhere I am sure that as it is such an ideal place to live the population on the Island would probably double in a short time. What would be the position then? The houses would be overcrowded and there would be many other problems. There would be more people than the water supply, power and other services could cope with. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> should respect the wishes of the elected councils regarding this matter of the permit system. Whatever he thinks about other things, about the reserves and about what the Queensland Government has done- he has the right to his opinion on those matters- he should respect the wishes of the local people regarding this matter of the permit system. Every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island reserve in the State has its elected council. Most of the councils are pretty well run. They have asked that this permit system should be continued. They have asked for a few other things. I think the Queensland Government will give them some of the other things they have requested. They want 3 laws changed, but certainly not the permit system. </para>
          <para>I should like to refer to one other matter. Probably it does not directly concern this question, but it concerns the question of grants for Queensland. We know that communication is not good between the Torres Strait Islands. The whole area is studded with reefs, and there are other problems. The matter of communication  between the other Torres Strait Islands and the base at Thursday Island has been looked at for a good while. The Queensland, authorities have come to the conclusion that the most suitable means of communication would be to build strips for light aircraft on the islands which are big enough, which have enough level land and which have suitable materials. The question of a hovercraft, which has received some publicity lately, has been considered. Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has decided to introduce a pilot scheme using a hovercraft. I do not know whether he has actually ordered a fairly large sized hovercraft to communicate rapidly with these islands. </para>

              <para>- I do not know how a hovercraft will operate over the coral reefs that are to be found just on the waterline. There will have to be fairly good navigators. But one matter has not been mentioned, and I know it well. At certain periods of the year the Fly River, which runs out of Papua New Guinea into the Bay of Papua, brings down enormous quantities of rubbish including big logs. The logs are difficult to see because they float just on the waterline. They float right across Torres Strait into Queensland waters. I have seen them in Thursday Island harbour and when making trips to Horn Island to get a plane. I have seen the men who run the ferry for a distance of about 2 miles have to cut back their engine to one-half or one-third speed in order to try to dodge these logs in Thursday Island harbour. I would hate to think what would happen to a hovercraft if it hit these logs. </para>

              <para>- And in breach of faith. We have the position where the Queensland Government is obviously spending all this money, despite what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> said about the Queensland Government being behind in its spending, and it will now have to cut back on Aboriginal housing to the detriment of the Aboriginal people. During the hearings of Estimates Committee G we were told that there were 29 building societies in Queensland run by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, but apparently they have not yet got off the ground. It will be some time before they are in a position to build a substantial number of houses. Even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> refunds this amount of $3,190,000 to those organisations, he will not get many houses built in the 7 months between now and 30 June next year. I recommend that he reconsider this matter and get the Queensland Government to continue its housing program at a greater rate. As has been pointed out, Queensland has one-third of the total number of Aborigines in Australia, and the Queensland Government has been housing Aborigines pretty well in many areas which I know pretty well. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> will reconsider this matter and give the money to the Queensland Government if it can show that it can get on and build these houses. I just want to state quite clearly that we want to see that we get the money for housing for Aborigines. We are not against the legislation in any way at all. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> will get some better advice from some of his Queensland advisers or else change his advisers so that we can get on with the job of housing the Aborigines in my State. </para>

            <para>- Like my colleagues I do not oppose the Bill. As a matter of fact I personally welcome it and particularly welcome the substantial overall increase for Aboriginal advancement in Australia. I have found nothing wrong with, and am not ashamed of, using the words &#39;Aboriginal advancement&#39;, even though the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cavanagh)</inline> seems to find something wrong with them. I personally and many of my Aboriginal fellows find nothing wrong with money being allocated for Aboriginal advancement as the advancement must be taking place in a new environment that is different from what was the Aboriginal way of life before the 1788 invasion of Australia. As I say I welcome the Bill and particularly welcome the increase in expenditure on Aboriginal advancement. Like my colleagues I too am concerned that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has seen fit to take away from my State a substantial amount of money- some $3.1 9m. </para>

              <para>- It is being taken away from the Government of Queensland. It is a breach of faith because in the Budget that amount of money was included in the overall amount that was to be made available to Queensland. I intend quoting from the Minister&#39;s second reading speech. It gives me some idea of the pettiness of taking this money away from the Queensland Government so that it would not have this money to expend on Aboriginal advancement. The Minister said: </para>

          <para class="block">In effect the Minister is saying that he will pick up his marbles and go home. Unless other people are prepared to talk to him and to do what they are told he will take their money away from them so that he will get credit for what the Australian Government is doing for Aborigines. The Minister is not prepared to give any credit for what was done over a number of years before 1967. It was only in 1967 that the Australian Government or the Commonwealth Government, to use its correct title, came into the field of Aboriginal affairs at all in the State. To my knowledge the Commonwealth Government had the responsibility for Aborigines in the Northern Territory. I do not think anyone should boast about what happened in the Northern Territory under the Commonwealth Government or even under the now supposedly Australian Government. </para>
          <para>The Minister, during his wanderings through Queensland, made some very nasty comments in relation to the Government of Queensland. I wonder how many members of this chamber, including the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, really and truly understand the situation in Queensland as it has existed for a number of years. Queensland, as has been stated before, has the largest number of Aborigines of any State in the Commonwealth. There are approximately 60,000 Aborigines there. In Queensland some 27,000 to 30,000 Aborigines are known to live on government communities or mission stations and are regarded as assisted Aborigines. The State Government in Queensland, over a number of years, has accepted responsibility for these Aborigines to the extent that it provides for these communities in every field- education, health, housing, the whole box and dice of what is required. But the balance between the 27,000 to 30,000 Aborigines who live on government communities or mission stations and the 60,000 Aborigines in Queensland- that is the 30,000 Aborigines who do not live on Aboriginal communities- are not being catered for by any government- the Commonwealth Government, the State Government or the present Australian Government, as it calls itself. </para>
          <para>Just recently, after the referendum, the Commonwealth Government decided that it would accept some responsibility by channelling funds into each of the 6 States for Aboriginal advancement. Since that happened Queensland has received not an equal share, pro rata of population, but has received some moneys from the Government in Canberra for Aboriginal advancement. Out of this amount the Queensland Government, through the Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs, has provided a very substantial number of houses for Aborigines. I might add that these houses are a credit to the Government and particularly to the people who work in the Department, who have chosen wisely and have chosen the best houses that the money could provide. Some of the Aboriginal people in Queensland are certainly living in far better houses than I could provide for myself and my wife. They have wall to wall carpets, all modern conveniences and everything that the heart could desire. </para>

I think the Queensland Government has a reasonable record. I am not trying in any way to paint the Queensland Government lily white. It has made mistakes. It has not always done what I thought it should have done or what other Aborigines thought it should have done in relation to Aboriginal affairs. But at least it has tried. We are told by the Minister that he will reduce the amount of money by some $3,190,000. </para>

              <para>- There is no point in the Minister&#39;s saying that this is not what he will do because this is what he is doing. Then the Minister tells us that he will make money available to a number of Aboriginal housing societies. Far be it from me, as an Aborigine, to reject the involvement of Aborigines in Aboriginal affairs. But by the same token, would it not be far better in this instance- if the Minister desires to support Aboriginal housing societies by all means he should do so- not to do this at the expense of the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs which is able to administer this scheme at cost. The administrative cost comes out of the resources of the Queensland Government. It does not come out of the money which is allocated by the Australian Government for Aboriginal housing in Queensland. Consequently, any money which is made available to the Queensland Government for Aboriginal housing is spent by the Department on housing. </para>

          <para>On the other hand, if we take that $3m-odd away from the Queensland Government and give it to building socities, they in turn have to set up their own machinery. They have to pay for expertise. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> read out, they have to get advisers, consultants, architects and the whole box and dice. These expenses will have to be paid out of this money thus reducing the amount which will be spent on actual housing. Again the only people who lose out are the Queensland Aborigines, not the Minister. He will still get his salary. He will still be able to live in his nice home. But a number of Aborigines in Queensland will miss out. It was stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> that the Queensland Government- let us refer more to the Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs in Queensland- did not spend all the money which was allocated to it last year. That is not so. The Queensland Department spent all the money which was allocated to it. As a. matter of fact, the money which is provided in this Bill has already been committed by the Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs. It has been committed to the extent that the Department, from now to June next year, will not be in the market for the purchase of houses for Aborigines over and above the money provided in this Bill. For someone to say that the Queensland Department did not spend the money which was allocated to it is quite wrong. </para>

              <para>-Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> It overspent and the Minister okayed that. He has said that he will reduce the Queensland allocation this time by that amount and that Queensland will get only the normal amount which will have to be allocated out of the money which will be made available to Queensland now. So Queensland spent not only all the money last year but also it has already committed this money which it has not yet received. If that does not show to all and sundry that the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs is trying to do a good job by providing as many houses as possible for Aborigines in Queensland then I am a Dutchman. I  w3l  be the first black Dutchman in captivity. The Minister, in wandering around Queensland, made some very nasty comments about housing in Queensland. The Queensland Department would if it could give every Aboriginal in Queensland a house to live in. But it can only work within its budget. It can only use the money available to it. If honourable senators look at the Bill they will see it shows that this financial year Queensland will get from the Australian Government $10,362,000. This is a very nice gesture. But when we put that alongside the amount of some $7m provided from the Budget of the </para>

              <para>- Before the suspension of the sitting I was referring to matters pertaining to the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs. There was some mention that the Department had not spent all the money which had been allocated to it for Aboriginal advancement. It was, I believe, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> who mentioned this and it was sort of backed up by the Minister. In his reply will the Minister give me proof that the Queensland Department has not spent the money, or will he inform the Senate how much money that Department has spent on Aboriginal advancement out of its allocation from the State Government? I am aware that the Department has used all of the money that has been allocated to it for Aboriginal advancement and, in fact, has fully committed the amount of money that will be allocated to it under the Bill we are now debating. </para>

          <para>Earlier I pointed out the problems faced by the Aboriginal people in Queensland. Queensland has approximately one-third of the total Australian Aboriginal population. I am very conscious of the conditions under which many of my Aboriginal fellows live in the State of Queensland particularly in the outlying areas. The conditions in some areas certainly are not what I would want or what the Aboriginal people themselves would want. But again, it is a matter of finance to provide the kind of housing that is needed in those places. If the Federal Government, the Commonwealth Government, the Australian Government- it is confusing these days- accepted the responsibilities given to it following the referendum in 1967 it would ensure that sufficient finance was made available to the different States, and particularly to my State of Queensland, so that housing can be provided for many of my people who live under pretty shocking conditions, because they do not have the finance to provide the homes themselves. I believe it is the responsibility of this Government to ensure that the indigenous people of Australia live under conditions equal to those enjoyed today by every other Australian. </para>
          <para>I again question the allocation of money by the Australian Government to the various States, and particularly to my own State. I have already referred to the matter of housing. Now let me mention welfare and refer to the amounts of money to be allocated to the States by the Australian Government. In New South Wales some $270,000 is being allocated for Aboriginal welfare. An amount of about $384,000 is being allocated for South Australia and in Western Australia the amount involved is $1,468,000. But when we look at the allocation for Queensland we find that it is a mere $70,000. 1 find this hard to understand. I am hoping that the Minister will clarify this when he replies and that he will give us some reason why the State of Queensland is not getting at least the same amount, as if not more than, is being allocated for Aboriginal welfare in the other States. After all, there are more Aboriginal people in the State of Queensland than there are in any other State of the Commonwealth. I sincerely hope that the Minister will give us a good reason and not the kind of reason that was mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> who said that it is because the Queensland Government is not prepared to do as the Australian Government wants it to do or is not prepared to be dictated to by the Australian Government. Again Queensland seems to be missing out on the kind of finance that is required for Aboriginal welfare. </para>
          <para>I want to comment on some of the issues that were raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> in relation to my State of Queensland. He said that fruit and vegetables were not grown on Aboriginal reserves, and he seemed to blame the Queensland Government for this. I point out that I lived in an Aboriginal community for 17 years, namely Palm Island. All my children were born there, and were partially raised and partially educated there. </para>

              <para>- In relation to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> said, from my experience I think it is ludicrous that he should say that these things were never provided in these communities because in my day on Palm Island I was the assistant settlement overseer responsible for a workforce of some 350 men and women. We had a farm on Palm Island in those days. We milked some 120 cows. Every household was provided with milk; every household was provided with free vegetables. As a matter of fact, I recall many a day when I would send from the vegetable room back to the farm to be given to the pigs dray loads of cabbages, cauliflowers, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, the whole box and dice. But that happened under the bad old Act of Queensland, you know, that racist Act that was talked about in Queensland when there were approximately 1,500 people living on Palm Island and every able bodied man was required to do a certain amount of work to provide those things in the communities. But the Act was changed because various people said that it should be changed and they brought in what was called cash economy and then the people were not required to do this kind of work. They could do as they liked. The farm today is a wilderness. They have completely done away with the dairy farm and the dairy farm now is just a wilderness. Consequently, the people on Palm Island are suffering because of people like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and those who cried for the Act to be changed. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline>mentioned a place called Old Mapoon. This issue is being completely blown out of proportion. I realise that there are many of the old people from Mapoon who have a desire to return there because this is the place where their people lived for perhaps thousands of years, but because of its isolation and because it is almost impossible to service, the Government in Queensland decided that in the interests of the people perhaps another settlement should be established for them. I personally as an Aboriginal, more as an Aboriginal than as a <inline font-weight="bold">Senator of</inline> the Commonwealth, spoke to many of the older people of Mapoon. Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> they want to be able to return to Mapoon but only for short visits. They want to be able to take their children back to the place of their birth, to the old sites and to the sacred sites. They want to be able to show the young people how it was before. They want to be able to take the young people back to the springs. They want to take the young people back and show them what was Aboriginal culture in the old days. </para>
          <para>The old people realise that they can no longer live there as they used to do prior to the coming of the white man. They wish to educate their children. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> they wish to give their children the same opportunities that you, I and everybody else wish to give our children, but the Aborigines still have this desire to go back on occasions. It is on special occasions that they wish to go back to that place, when there are stories that they must relate to the children- stories of the Dream Time and of the culture of the Aboriginal community prior to the white man that they wish to tell to the younger generations. Like you and I, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> they are realistic and intelligent people. They know that they can no longer live there because of the advances that are being made now by the Aboriginal people. They want their children to enjoy everything that every other Australian is enjoying today. So much for the bluster and that kind of thing that goes on in relation to Aboriginal people. </para>
          <para>Much needs to be understood about the Aboriginal people; much needs to be understood of the thinking of the Aboriginal people. Many young Aboriginal people today are becoming educated and more sophisticated. Last week many young Aboriginal people were out in front of Parliament House demonstrating and trying to show to us here in Parliament that all is not well in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. As many of the young men said to me, they were not demonstrating against Government policy. Although I sit on this side of the chamber, I do not condemn many of the policies that have been brought forward by the present Government. I give credit to the Government for many of its policies. I think that it has instigated policies that perhaps my Party when in government should have instigated. But let that be. The people who demonstrated outside Parliament House were demonstrating against the implementation by the Department of some of the policies. </para>
          <para>The money that has been allocated for Aboriginal advancement is not getting down to the grass root levels where it is needed. It is not getting down to the people who are in need. It is being eaten up in administrative costs. It is being administered by people who unfortunately do not understand the Aboriginal people and who cannot understand the feelings of Aboriginal people. As I have said on so many occasions, it is about time that the Department started to employ and involve competent Aborigines. I am talking of the mums and dads who have suffered discrimination and prejudices and who have come up the hard way but who today, because of their hard work and their perseverance, are living in the community in decent homes which they have obtained by the sweat of their own brows. I am talking of those people who are holding down good jobs and who are educating their children. These are the people who can be utilised. They can be employed time and time again at the Estimates committees hearings concerning the employment of Aboriginal people in the Department. We have in the Department an Aborigine who through his own guts and determination got himself to one of the highest positions in the Public Service that an Aborigine has been able to reach. He has done this through his own guts and determination. What is he in the Department? In his own words, he is a lackey in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. He says that he is treated like a lackey. </para>

Why are you, the lone Aboriginal at a high level in the Public Service, not down at the Estimates Committee?&#39; He said: &#39;I was not invited.

In what greater way can we involve Aborigines in decision making than in that Department, which has the responsibility for Aboriginal administration throughout the Commonwealth? </para>
          <para>I wish to comment briefly on what is now called I think, the mission at the front of Parliament House. In 1972 when the Aboriginal people set up what they termed at that dme an embassy I was against what the Government did because I believe that the Aboriginal people have a right to demonstrate. Until such time as a building is provided in the capital of this nation, which used to be their nation, where Aborigines Will have a permanent lobby, they have every right to do what they are doing today in front of Parliament House. If the Government and the Parliament of this nation will not provide a permanent lobby for the Aboriginal people, the Aboriginal people have every right to sit out there on the lawns in front of Parliament House. Yes, it might embarrass the Government. Yes, it might look unsightly. Is there anything more unsightly than some of the things that I have seen around this nation- some of the conditions under which the original inhabitants of this nation are living? </para>
          <para>Is there anything more unsightly than to see the Aboriginal people in a place such as Camooweal? Camooweal is a little town with one hotel, one police station, one general store, a cafe and half a dozen houses. It is out in the wide open plains. There is hardly a tree in sight. When I visited there I saw Aboriginal women and their children, babes in arms, living in a series of constructions which consisted of 2 sheets of galvanised iron 6 feet long and 3 feet in height, side by side, with a sheet of iron over the top. They crawled into them in day time temperatures of 1 10 degrees. People say that what is in front of </para>
          <para class="block">Parliament House is unsightly. They should go and see some of the conditions under which some of the original inhabitants of this country are living. Certainly it is unsightly but so are the conditions under which I see Aboriginal people living. </para>
          <para>It seems to me that the time is fast approaching when Aboriginal affairs will be taken completely out of the political arena because for far too long the Aboriginal people of this nation have been used as a political football. I believe that the time is fast approaching when we will have to set up- I do not care what you call it, a commission or whatever- a statutory body which is completely administered by Aborigines and responsible to Parliament. </para>

          <para>I support the amendment moved by my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> because I believe that in this BUI Queensland has been victimised and the Aboriginal people of Queensland will suffer by being deprived of this amount of money for housing. Certainly the Minister will say: &#39;We are taking it away with one hand and giving it back with the other&#39;. As I pointed out earlier, that is not completely right, because $3. 1 9m, from what the Minister is saying, will not go to housing in its entirety. Much of it will be eaten up in administrative costs. We should allow that amount of money to go back to the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs, which, as I said earlier, has the machinery to carry out this work. If the Minister in his sincerity, and I congratulate him for it, wants to involve the Aboriginal people in housing societies then he should make the extra funds available to the housing societies, but do not deprive the Aboriginal people of Queensland, through the Queensland Government, of that $3. 19m. So I support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> which reads: but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government&#39;s action in reducing the grant to the State of Queensland by $3,190,000 is a petty action which is contrary to the best interests of the Aboriginal people of Queensland and that the Government should take immediate steps to grant to the State of Queensland the further sum of $3,190,000 as promised in the Budget. </para>

            <para>- I too rise to support the amendment moved in respect of the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill 1974. The issues have been covered most completely and it was most heartening to hear our only Aboriginal senator issue a damning refutation of some of the charges that have been laid against the Queensland Premier and the Queensland Government today as being somewhat less than the truth. The facts of the matter are simple. Queensland has approximately onethird of the Aborigines in Australia and for many years has received approximately one-third of the revenue granted to the States for the care of Aborigines. The current Federal Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> allocated one-third of this amount to Queensland this time. This amount was confirmed in writing by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cavanagh)</inline> and his Department and negotiations got so far as inter-officer consultation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Then the Queensland Government refused to go along with the Federal Minister&#39;s plan to take over the Aboriginal reserves in Queensland. In what appeared to be a fit of pique the Minister excised that portion of the allocation that he could excise, the $3. 19m we are talking about now, from the grant to Queensland and thereupon allocated that amount, $3. 1 9m, to the other States. Queensland remonstrated about this and the Minister, apparently realising the extent of his act of discrimination against the Queensland Aborigines, suddenly decided that he could pull $3. 19m out of a trust fund and that is what he is attempting to do now. I presume that the money will come from the $9m he failed to spend on Aboriginal housing last year. It cannot be described as anything less than an act of discrimination against Queensland &#39;s Aborigines because they are the ones who will suffer. The Minister proposed to excise the 16 Aboriginal reserves from Queensland and turn them into 16 separate States. Imagine the vastness of the administrative problems that would create, particularly if white men are not allowed to go on these areas, as was proposed. We would have our own </para>
          <para class="block">Berlin Wall type Australian Labor Party apartheid set-up in Australia. This, of course, was the issue which the Queensland Premier stood on in rejecting the Minister&#39;s proposals- and, I think rightly so. </para>
          <para>The charge that was laid earlier that the Queensland Premier would not speak to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has no basis. The Premier refused to talk to the Minister only about the Woodward report which, of course, recommended that this be done. I was fortunate lately to have been appointed a member of the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory and sent to help write new legislation for selfgovernment in the Northern Territory. The Committee visited many of the Federal Aboriginal reserves in the Territory. Of course, it had a lot of plans that it put to the Aborigines and asked how they would like to be represented in the new Northern Territory legislative assembly and sought thenviews on different electorates, different candidates and different methods of electing members. To a man on all those reserves the Aborigines rejected those plans saying: &#39;That would be discriminating in favour of the black man. If you discriminate in favour of us you are discriminating against the non-Aborigines &#39;. </para>

              <para>- Banyili, Roper River, Nhulunbuy, Yirrkala, Maningrida, Umbakumba and plenty of other places. I was proud of the Aborigines for the way they decided that they just wanted to be Australians. They even said: &#39;We have a body like you, we have blood like you. We are Australians and we want to be treated as Australians. We do not want to be discriminated in favour of or against. &#39; On the subject of discrimination in Queensland, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and another senator in this chamber have said that Queensland provides an outstanding example of racism. I point out that Aborigines can move to and fro on those reserves quite freely. The arrangements are completely voluntary. They seek shelter on the reserves. For an Aborigine, going on to an Aboriginal reserve is something like joining a club. There are rules to follow if one joins any club or association, just as there are rules in this Parliament and rules for belonging to the Australian Labor Party. If one wants to be in those sorts of associations one has to obey the rules. I might say that I think the rules allowing one to belong to the ALP are a lot more stringent than any that apply to Aborigines in Queensland. </para>

Finally I invite the Minister to send a joint parliamentary committee to Queensland to look at these places, to read the relevant Act and to see whether there is anything discriminatory going on in Queensland. I am sure he would find, to his joy, that Queensland has the best administration for Aborigines and that they are happy. Tonight we heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> speak in glowing terms of the Queensland Administration. I assure the Minister that he and his delegation would be most welcome to go around any of the reserves in Queensland. I support the amendment. </para>

            <para>- I do not want to say a lot about this Bill. I have had the pleasure of talking at some length with Aboriginal leaders and I intend to renew those contacts because I greatly enjoyed learning more in this field. The one great factor I came away with after my first real meeting on that level was that those people really wanted to be Australians and to end discrimination in this community. I think that the amendment proposed by the Opposition would further discrimination, not end it. I listened with great interest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner,</inline> and especially to - </para>

A man who has promoted the untruths as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has done is not the man who should lead for the Opposition on this very delicate question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> said very rightly that this should not be a political question. One understands, of course, that there is an election campaign in Queensland at this time and that this is a very political debate in this chamber. As I understand it, in  1967  the Australian people directed that Aboriginal affairs was to become a matter for the Australian Parliament. </para>

As I understand it from the arguments put from both sides of the House, the Queensland Government has not agreed with the Australian Government. </para>

              <para>- I do not agree that the South Australian Government has shirked its responsibilities in this matter. I had something to do with the early stages of this transition. On both sides of politics in South Australia there has not been a disagreement nor an assessment that the South Australian people or the South Australian Government, of either colour, has shirked its responsibility by co-operating with the Commonwealth Government. This legislation is being discussed here by the Opposition as if somehow the Queensland Government is the chief beneficiary of it. I thought we were dealing with the welfare of Aborigines in Queensland rather than the Queensland Government which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is supporting in his amendment. I am not enamoured of the Government led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> in Queensland as far as it represents Australians in that part of Australia. I have no doubt that he will be returned to office on a minority vote in that State but for a number of particular reasons he is not regarded outside Queensland as an estimable leader of Australians. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cavanagh)</inline> outlined in his second reading speech instances of the Queensland Government being unwilling to talk with the Australian Government about Aboriginal affairs. I find that an incomprehensible action on the part of a government which at least has a duty on behalf of the people it represents to consult with the Australian Government. No valid excuse has been given in this House as to the inaction of the Queensland Government in this matter. None has been forthcoming and I cannot envisage that any will be forthcoming which will excuse the laxity and apparent determined intention of the Queensland Government to ignore its responsibility in this matter. </para>

I understand that at a later stage the Minister will assure the House that Queensland Aborigines will not receive less than the amount which is contained in the vote plus the amendment. I ask the Minister if that is to be the case. </para>

We are talking about the welfare of Aborigines in Queensland whom we want to remove, as soon as the Federal Parliament can do so, from a discriminatory area. Therefore the amendment is irrelevant. What we are talking about is the inability of the Queensland Government to accept its responsbility to talk to the Australian Government about the welfare of Aborigines in Queensland.

              <para>- If the Queensland Minister intends to talk to the Federal Minister we can therefore accept the word of the Minister in this House that the Queensland Aborigines will not be affected detrimentally by the sum which is to be provided for them. If that is the case, what are we talking about in regard to this amendment? It seems to me that we have got into the situation which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> says we should not have got into- that is the political arena- in relation to Aboriginal welfare in Australia and particularly in Queensland. I regret that. From my contact with Aboriginal leaders I believe that this is quite the opposite direction from that which the debate in this House should take. I would not support amendments to the motion for the second reading of the Bill. </para>

This time I would like him to tell the truth for a change. I would not like him to rush off, as he did to the newspapers in Tasmania, and put up a story which inferred very great untruths about Tasmanian senators and myself. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> will tell whomever he will rush away to telephone directly- I am sure that he will- the truth as to why at least I did not vote for this amendment.

              <para>-There are other reasons. That is the major reason. Another reason is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is injecting politics into an area in which party politics should not intrude to this degree. He is trying to take advantage by using the Senate in the guise of moving an amendment to the motion, although no doubt he will rush out and infer that it was an amendment as he did with the Bill relating to Tasmania. After seven or eight days a letter was printed in South Australia which went on, in the cold, hard light of fact, to infer that I had voted against money for Tasmania. In fact, the way he put it - </para>

              <para>- I submit that I am doing so because I said, in addressing myself to this point, that I was doing so in passing to give judgment upon the amendment- or should I say the expression of opinion- which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is moving to insert into the motion for the second reading of this Bill. I think it is relevant to illustrate the type of activity in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is engaging. As I said in relation to the Tasmanian Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> tried to insert into the motion for the second reading an expression of opinion but in the South Australian Press- he viciously attacked me on my home ground- the honourable senator said: &#39;This would have honoured a promise made before the  1972  and  1974  elections by the Prime Minister.&#39; It would have done no such thing. It would not have honoured anything. It was an expression of opinion. To the public of South Australia the word &#39;honour&#39; means that it would have voted a certain sum of money to Tasmania. That was a distinct falsehood. I use that example in the hope that the honourable senator will not try to use that very undesirable practice of inferring what did not occur. May I compliment him on his letter? As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> would know, no one could have read - </para>

              <para>- I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> for his point of order because I think the point has been made. I come back to this companion or parallel attempt by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to do as he did before, this time in regard to the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill. I make some matter of this only because I do not want the public to be misled again by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> in similar fashion. I hope that he will at least tell the public- if he intends to rush away to a telephone directly- why some people do not like his particular amendment. It is seen, at least in my case, as an attempt to influence the election in Queensland by putting a clause in the Bill which is against the Australian Government and is for the State Government of Queensland. It is an attempt to use politics. It is an attempt to use this particular Bill, which is for the welfare of the Aboriginals, politically. I will not vote for an amendment which will make Aboriginal welfare suffer because some politician wants to gain some votes from it. For that reason I will not vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> &#39;s amendment. I hope that if he tells people why I do not support his amendment, he will tell them that the first reason is that I do not trust him and the second reason is that  1  do not want the welfare of Queensland Aboriginals to be made a political football as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> himself has said it ought not to be.  1  will hold <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to the responsibility of telling those he informs that those are the  2  major reasons why I will not support his amendment. </para>

          <para>I have little more to say. I would like to indicate to the Minister that I will certainly support him. I will support the Minister in those areas where he can endeavour, by new forms of legislation, to give personal responsiblity to Aboriginals who have not previously experienced it. He will have my support in any moves he makes in that regard. Let me say to the Opposition that it will have my opposition when it tries to stick to the methods of the past and refuses to venture into an area which gives dignity to the Aboriginal people and ends discrimination against them, as has been acknowledged in some areas of administration by the Queensland State Government. I therefore support the Bill and oppose the amendment so futilely moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline></para>

But not one of those honourable senators pressed their point in relation to this matter. I refer honourable senators to page 395 of the Hansard report of the meeting of Estimates Committee G which was held on 22 October 1974. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> asked a question about an Aboriginal who was supposed to be receiving money for a hostel in Queensland. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> was asked to name the person so that the matter could be investigated. He was told that if he did not want to do that he could see the officers of the Department afterwards, give them the name, they would investigate the matter and take it to its conclusion. Whether he has done that I do not know. </para>

It is also important to know the Minister&#39;s reply. It is important to know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil</inline> then said: &#39;Well, I am satisfied about that now. &#39; Yet he has the audacity to stand up here tonight and criticise what this Government and this Minister in particular are doing.

Talking about the housing in Queensland, most of that allocation you maintain is going to be spent through Aboriginal groups in Queensland primarily for housing, and yet in the Treasurer&#39;s speech he said that the housing allocation last financial year was underspent by $9m. </para>

            <para>- When one holds parliamentary office one must face the slings and arrows that are used by one&#39;s fellow members of Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> did not rise to speak on matters relating to Aboriginal affairs but rose in an attempt to slate <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Glen</inline> Sheil. I say that that is his parliamentary privilege and perhaps the honourable senator&#39;s character is revealed by that type of move in a debate on Aboriginal affairs. He is more interested in slating one of his fellow senators than he is in debating Aboriginal affairs. He criticised a building that is owned by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Glen</inline> Sheil apparently because the Brisbane Fire Brigade has not approved a building of some years as having an up to date standard of fire protection. As a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Public Accounts I read reports of the Commonwealth Fire Board on many occasions which showed that buildings owned by the Commonwealth and the Australian Government would not be approved by the Commonwealth Fire Board because they did not meet the up to date standards of fire protection. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> might well take that into account and perhaps be a little truthful when he speaks on matters such as this. I do not doubt that hundreds of hospitals throughout Australia, including my own State of Victoria, which were built years ago could not, having regard to the costs which are applicable today, meet the appropriate fire standards and ratings that are set today. I suggest that the large majority of those buildings are owned by the Commonwealth or the Australian Government. </para>

              <para>- I see. I know there was something that went into Hansard on this matter. If it could be found it would be interesting. The Australian society apparently is willing to have one group within its community which, if that group wishes to declare itself as being of a particular race, will be accepted by the Australian society as being of that race. If that occurs an appropriation similar to the one before the House would then be directed to those people. Aboriginals, at least in the 1971 census, were counted as people separate from the Australian community. The population statistics for Aboriginals in 1971 show that, of some 106,290 individuals, 53,919 were male adults and children and 52,371 were females. I imagine that it would be our aim to encourage all the finance that is available to be appropriated by this Government to assist the less fortunate of the Aboriginal race. Some of us, and I myself, feel that there are instances where persons who have declared themselves Aboriginals over the years perhaps do not require the special race assistance which is being meted out by this Government today. The most important matter which should face us under the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill- this is of particular importance to the Senate- is that the amount of $40,790,000 was allocated as set out by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> at page 74 of Budget Paper No. 7. The volume of money which would be paid to the 6 States is there set out. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> when he spoke this evening prompted the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cavanagh)</inline> twice. I prompt the Minister again because I know him to be an honest man. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> said that he would support the Bill because the Minister had given a promise that the money which had been denied Queensland in the allocation made under this Bill- that is the amount of $3,190,000 which had been taken away from Queensland- would be allocated in Queensland in various forms to assist Aboriginal groups. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> twice got the Minister&#39;s promise that that money would be spent in this year. I hope that if the Minister does not hold to that promise he will have sufficient fortitude to resign at the end of this year. </para>

I do not believe that of the Minister. Perhaps that is the reason why some members of the Labor Party are Ministers and some are backbenchers. But I believe the Minister. He has given a promise to a senator that the $3, 190,000 which has been taken away from the Queensland Government will be applied in other areas of Queensland. I hope that promise will be adhered to. The Minister has said that and he has encouraged an honourable senator to vote with the Government against the amendment. </para>

              <para>- I am speaking on Aboriginal affairs. I am speaking about an allocation of $40m. Nothing could be more closely associated with this Bill. The fact is that an honourable senator has said that he will vote for this Bill provided the Minister gives a promise that the $3,190,000 which has been taken away from the Queensland Government- although promised to it in the appropriate Budget paperwill be expended in Queensland in this year. The Minister has twice given that promise. I draw to the attention of the Senate the fact that the $3,190,000 which has been taken away from Queensland has, under this Bill, been reallocated in other amounts to the other States. The amount of $3,190,000 has been taken away from Queensland. The original grant in the Budget was $13,552,000. It has now been downgraded to $10,362,000 which is a decrease of $3,190,000. That money has been allocated to the other States. I draw the attention of the Minister to that. I hope he will tell us whence the $3, 1 90,000 will now come. </para>

          <para>Under the Bill with which we are dealing an extra $1,877,000 has been allocated to New South Wales, $730,000 has been allocated to Victoria and $583,000 has been allocated to South Australia. That makes a total of $3,190,000. The Minister might well chew the butt of his pen. I think it is a very serious matter that a Minister would encourage an honourable senator to believe that that money which has been taken away from the Queensland Government will be spent within Queensland with various Aboriginal housing societies and other groups. I point out to the Minister that this cannot be done. I believe that he should get <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> to come back into this chamber. Perhaps he is working in his room and listening. I believe that the Minister should say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> that there is another area and point out to the honourable senator from where this $3,190,000 will come because in truth, Minister, you have allocated it to the other States. </para>

              <para>-Senator McLaren, that would be one of the easiest things to do in this chamber. I do not take any pride in it if that has happened. I ask for leave to table the figures which I have mentioned. They are in columns indicating the amount allocated by the Treasurer as shown in Budget Paper No. 7 at page 74. I really believe that this is not new to the Minister. He knows that that money has been reallocated to other States. I know that the Minister will allocate this $3, 1 90,000 before the end of this year. It will be allocated and paid to other areas of Queensland. My interest and the interest of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall is: &#39;From where will the Government get that money? Will the Minister tell us from where it is coming so that we will know? Undoubtedly we will see a new allocation of money for Aboriginal assistance. I think this is an important point. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Another important point is that if ever there were a Bill before the Senate for rejection on constitutional grounds it should be this Bill. I am not aware of another Bill which has come before the Senate during my time here in which the Australian Government in an attempt to force its view on a State has said to that State: &#39;Unless you accept lock, stock and barrel the Federal Government&#39;s policy you will get less money.&#39; I say for those honourable senators who may be listening and for those who are here that the fact is that that is why the Senate was constituted- to protect State rights. If ever there were a reason, not to deny Aboriginals this benefit, but to maintain State rights that is why this Bill should be defeated. I say to honourable senators from other States that this could happen to them. I say to other State Premiers that this will happen to them. They will see this happen under a dominant socialist Labor Government in Canberra. Unless the States agree with what the Government wants them to do- of course we have seen this in many instances- they will be denied funds. We have heard the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> and other Ministers demonstrating the way they feel. I think it is probably their inexperience that makes them act this way. As I have said, this legislation is a disaster for Australia. </para>
          <para>I make the point that constitutionally this Bill should be thrown out. We as senators will not be performing our proper task unless we throw this Bill out. We are all enamoured of the idea of $40m being made available as quickly as possible to assist Aborigines. Because this assistance is to be given, the Bill in general will be supported by the Opposition but an amendment will be moved to indicate that we feel the Government&#39;s proposal to reduce by $3m the allocation which was promised to Queensland should not be implemented because it is contrary to the interests of the Aboriginal people in Queensland. The amendment was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> I have high regard for him and also for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall. But I cannot understand why every time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall speaks on a matter in this Senate the first thing he does is to slate a member of the Liberal Party. I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall, who has been here for some four or five months, that if he can during the time that he is in this place elevate himself to the position and gain the reputation that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has achieved amongst his fellow senators in the time that he has been here, he will be very pleased with himself. The comments made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall do not reflect my view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline></para>
          <para>I have said that the application of the Australian Government&#39;s desire to dominate the States has been a disaster. The word &#39;disaster&#39; is a good word to use when considering the attitude that has been taken to Aboriginal affairs by the Minister. In the adjournment debate on 29 October I raised 2 matters. Honourable senators may recall that I raised the issue of the double standards that were being applied by the Australian Government and consequently we, as Australian citizens, were being carried along with them. We have clothed ourselves with the spite of many people in the world because we voted in favour of South Africa&#39;s expulsion from the United Nations on the basis that South Africa had an apartheid policy and because it practised discrimination. Let me read how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> is reported at page 2095 of Senate Hansard. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I admit that there are sections of discrimination against Aborigines. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I would have thought that the Minister might have conveyed that information to those who were voting at the United Nations. After all, while we have discrimination and indeed apartheid in this country, we wanted to push out South Africa if we could without taking notice of the other black countries in the world today which practise apartheid. To me it seems to be a most unsatisfactory double standard for us to have. I think that the actions of the Australian Government will not elevate Australia&#39;s position in this and in many other spheres. </para>
          <para>Let me turn to the reason that this Government&#39;s POliCY on Aboriginal affairs is a disaster. In the adjournment debate to which I have already referred I mentioned that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> had said that Labor&#39;s policy on Aboriginal affairs was a disaster. In his speech <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> said that it was not the policy that was a disaster but that it was the implementation of the pOliCY that was a disaster. I know that newspapers misinterpret things but I would like to quote a few headlines which appeared in the newspapers in February this year. The Melbourne &#39;Herald&#39; contains an article headed &#39;Disaster, Says Cavanagh&#39;. Another newspaper article is headed &#39;Cavangah lashes policy on blacks &#39;. Still another is &#39;This bungle is a disaster&#39;. </para>

              <para>-Thank you. The implementation of Labor&#39;s policy on Aborigines was a disaster. What is there to which we can turn today to say that it is not? Under this Bill, the Government is taking certain steps. If one likes to re-read and re-quote what I have just said, one will see that some little time ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> was saying that if the Government had stopped and thought it out a different approach would have been taken. I believe that that is what the Government should be doing under this Bill, and not denying Queensland $3,190,000. The Government promised that the housing societies, which in many instances are yet to be formed, will spend this money within six or seven months. With 2 months of close down ahead of us, it would be almost a physical impossibility to do so. I was getting to the point that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> told the people before May that everything was right with the economy. We know that today it is worse than it was before May. </para>

              <para>- I am making a point. I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland has come in to listen. It will probably do him good to hear something about Aboriginal affairs. The point in relation to the matter is that there has been great sorrow over a period. I do not know whether it is the shame of what was brought out at the Public Accounts Committee meeting in relation to the former Minister and the correspondence that he sent to every member of Parliament telling them to take no notice of what the administrative officers of the Department had said on Aboriginal affairs. One can rest assured that Aboriginal Affairs was in a complete mess. I have some confidence in the present Minister. He is a fairly hard handed sort of Minister. He may be getting the Department on to a better basis. I feel that what he is doing under this Bill - </para>

              <para>- I hope to hear from you on that matter because you said that I was totally wrong about the block of houses at Redfern for Aborigines. During the debate on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate on 29 October I said that this Government was pursuing an apartheid policy in Australia. It is very well demonstrated in Queensland where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> and the Government apparently wish to see areas of land taken over and handed to the blacks so that there will be black communities only in that area. Rows of houses will be built, and they will be available only to blacks. It may be the correct policy, but it is an apartheid policy. It is a policy of separate development. I brought this matter up when I was speaking on the South African matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> said: </para>

            <para>Misstatements have been made about the tying up of a group of Aborigines in one settlement in Sydney. In Redfern, where the Aborigines mostly live, there is a row of attached houses which not a government but an Aboriginal community purchased and is in the process of renovating. </para>

          <para class="block">Let me make the point that- the Minister knows he said this- he referred to a row of attached houses. What he meant to say was that there were a few houses. He said to the Senate that there was a row of attached houses. Perhaps he made a mistake. He may be able to correct it, but let me correct it for him. </para>

              <para>- It is right? When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> referred in the Senate to a row of attached houses he meant that there is a block containing 74 terraced houses and 2 factories. To date 34 houses and one factory have been purchased. Grants totalling $907,750 will be available for this separate Aboriginal development project. I believe that that is an apartheid policy which the Government is following in that matter. I believe that it is a wrong policy, but it is a policy which the Government is following. I believe that it will be disastrous for Australia. I believe that the Government should stop and rethink its policy relating to Aborigines or it will be doing as it has done in so many other areasstopping, rethinking and doing an about face on policies, as it did on overseas investment and profits for companies. One could go through the whole ambit. This week this great socialist Labor Party has done a complete double flip. </para>

But he knows that my remarks are appropriate and are very much on the subject of this Bill under which we are spending $40m because, as the amendment which has been moved indicates, the allocation of funds is unfair to Queensland. This is incorrect and the amendment should have the support of the Senate. The point I was making is that one can see this incorrect policy applied in so many areas and I say to the Minister: If the Government is changing its mind in so many areas then it should change it now in relation to Aboriginal Affairs and support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline></para>

              <para>- There is no need for it because there is a multitude of inaccuracies to reply to. This has been a rather interesting debate and I think the accusation is well made that it is not until one goes to Queensland or comes into this chamber that Aboriginal affairs is drawn into politics. That is unfortunate. No matter when I first saw an Aborigine or what I knew about them then and notwithstanding what is indicated in the documents of the Queensland Minister, tabled by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie,</inline> after some 1 3 months in charge of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs working with a department that is knowledgeable in Aboriginal affairs, and after the miles I have travelled and the thousands of Aborigines I have met, I now have some cognisance of Aboriginal thinking, Aboriginal people and Aboriginal affairs. That knowledge is important and what I have heard tonight indicates that there are very few in this chamber who understand Aboriginal affairs. </para>

          <para>I would like to give credit to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner.</inline> It is obvious that he has a knowledge of this subject but it is unfortunate that he cannot do justice to his people because of his political affiliations. And although he has a knowledge of Aboriginal affairs he has no knowledge of government departments and how they have to work or how they should work. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has not opposed Government policy on Aboriginal affairs and confined his remarks to the Bill. He brought in a political element by suggesting that we were not giving sufficient to a certain brand of government in Queensland. </para>

              <para>- I know. I mentioned the brand but it has a close affiliation with the hallmark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> Party. It is said that the Government has adopted this attitude to Queensland because Queensland was not cooperative and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> suggests that my interpretation of &#39;non-cooperation&#39; is that Queensland will not do as it is told, it will not do as we tell it. As he says, the greatest consideration should not be this &#39;I will take my bat home &#39; attitude, it should be the interests of the Aborigines. If that is the only consideration then the amendment means nothing because it is an expression of opinion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall came into the debate and, as a political strategist, said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> had made another mistake. He sought as the opinion of this Senate that the Government was doing the right thing for Queensland and indicated that he would not get support and that the result will be when the question is put to the vote of the Senate that the Senate will express its belief that we are doing the right thing by Queensland. There has been no condemnation of the Government&#39;s policy. Labor&#39;s policy is essentially land rights and Aboriginal self-determination. It is not a question of our saying what Queensland or anyone else should do; it is what Aborigines should do. And the attempt to get this amendment carried has been based on falsehoods and slander from the start. There is no truth in the accusations. Let us look at and clean up first the expenditure in this field last year. Queensland never spent its grant in respect of Aborigines. </para>

              <para>- In respect of housing it exceeded its allocation and got my permission to do so. There was granted $1.2m for Aboriginal health which was not spent, and the grant given to Queensland for education and amenities was not fully spent. So while admitting that Queensland overspent on housing, and this extra amount would be deducted from this year&#39;s allocation for housing, Queensland never spent all the money made available by the Australian Government for Aborigines last year. As I have said before, although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> challenges me on it, there will be no reduction in housing this year as a result of Government policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> said that there must be a reduction if we give this $3.1m to the housing societies because there will be a duplication of administration and therefore less housing. </para>

But is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> going to say that we should not give this money to the Aboriginal housing associations when they want to develop housing? Where is his logic there? He is fighting against his own colleagues in making an emotional and passionate appeal here. He wants this Government to give the money to the Queensland Government which has not done the right thing in respect of housing nor the right thing by his own people, as it was put there to do. It is asked: Where are these associations that are yet to be formed in Queensland? I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a list of Aboriginal housing associations that are already formed in Queensland. That list will show that there are at present 8 housing associations on reserves and 25 housing associations operating off reserves, making a total of 33 housing associations operating in </para>

              <para>- The housing associations have an added benefit. Where they are able to do so Aboriginal labour is employed. They are creating employment opportunities. They are a better avenue. So we have the organisations. The Government believes in Aboriginal participation. It believes in helping Aboriginal societies and that is its motto. It believes in Aboriginal determination and in these people making their own decisions on their own type of housing and in them building their own homes. We are to be condemned because we seek to put the money into co-operative societies and not into an uncooperative government. I want to refer now to the challenge that if the money does not go into housing I will resign at the end of the year. A politician never takes such a risk as offering to resign. However, I am prepared to take this risk if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> who knows I will not do it, is prepared to offer his resignation at the end of the year if I do fulfil the promise which he doubts I will fulfil. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> went on with many other misstatements. He said that we stopped the housing project at Redfern because we stopped the money. The Redfern project has not stopped because the money was not forthcoming. It has been funded on every occasion. There was a stoppage because of a dispute over payment with the builders labourers organisation in Redfern. The Redfern project is going ahead today. </para>

              <para>-That remark demonstrates the honourable senator&#39;s lack of understanding. South Africa has enforced restrictions. These Aborigines have the same rights as the honourable senator&#39;s relatives have of purchasing a property and saying that they want to live in the homestead on it. They have the same right of freedom. They have complete freedom to live in Redfern or anywhere else. These people are not imprisoned behind barricades as they are in South Africa. Because someone wants to live away from someone else does not mean that they are racist and that this is apartheid. This is a stupid argument that the Opposition has advanced. </para>

          <para>I have some sympathy for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> &#39;s approach in regard to the money paid to consultants and architects. These are high fees. The practice relating to Government expenditure is that everything has to be processed and there have to be feasibility studies. We get reputable consultants in our Department and they charge the standard recognised fees for the services. Like all professional services the fees are high. However they are one of the things we have to pay. </para>
          <para>I tura now to remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie</inline> who obviously was briefed either by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hewitt,</inline> the Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs in Queensland, or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Killoran,</inline> the head of that Department. The only thing wrong with his briefing was that there was no truth in it. It was all lies. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie</inline> started off by saying that at no time the Queensland Minister refused to meet me. I want to examine this statement. In accordance with a Cabinet decision I contacted all mainland States. Let me say, firstly, that I have had discussions with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hewitt. Mr Hewitt,</inline> like all Liberals, does not bring politics into Aboriginal affairs. </para>

              <para>- Is he? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hewitt</inline> is happy for there to be discussions between his Department and my Department. The Liberals in Queensland favour doing what the Liberals in all other Australian States have done and give the responsibility for policy planning and coordination to the Commonwealth Government. Only the Country Party is outside. One might guess that the Country Party has a vested interest. The Aborigines have been a cheap source of labour on cattle stations, on peanut farms and other Country Party activities. They built the cattle stations in Australia with their sweat and their slavery. If we can ever emancipate them so that they can get a decent living the Country Party will have lost a cheap source of labour. We will never be able to achieve that unless we can overcome what is happening at present in Queensland. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hewitt, Mr Killoran</inline> the head of the Queensland Department, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dexter</inline> and I have conferred. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hewitt</inline> was quite happy to have a conference with the Department and to hand over Aboriginal affairs to the Commonwealth Government. However, while he was making that arrangement and before I left Queensland that night the Queensland Premier said in a Press statement that the Government in Canberra would get nothing from Queensland. The Premier made this statement while the responsible Minister was making this agreement with me. Our departments did meet following that but they never came to any decision. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hewitt</inline> took the question to Cabinet. He knew he had the Liberal Party numbers in Cabinet but before the Cabinet meeting the Premier started talking about changing portfolios. The Country Party follows the same procedure as the Liberal Party does and he has the right of selection. He talked about changing portfolios and he got his way endorsed in that Cabinet. </para>

          <para>The next matter I want to mention relates to the Woodward Land Rights Commission report. We approached all State Premiers to see whether they would extend to the States what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward recommended for the Northern Territory. Again, with the exception of Queensland, we have complete agreement with all States to set up land councils of some description to hear </para>
          <para class="block">Aboriginal claims to land rights and to make recommendations on those claims to their governments. We asked the Minister in Queensland to meet us on the Woodward report and to discuss next year&#39;s Budget allocation. He said he would not meet us on the Woodward report but would meet us on the subject of the Budget allocation. I then wrote to the Queensland Premier and asked whether it was any use continuing this fight and whether we could meet and discuss this question. The Premier wrote back and said: </para>

As a result of correspondence between the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> and the Premier of Queensland, the Premier said that our Ministers should get together. My office telephoned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hewitt&#39;s</inline> office to see whether we could make arrangements to see him. We received a reply that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hewitt</inline> is in his office on Mondays, he is away campaigning all the week and he is at home at Charters Towers at the weekends. It seemed that it was impossible for him to see us. I said that I would go to Charters Towers at the weekend or would see him in his office on Monday. The appointment was fixed for next Monday in his office in Brisbane. We received a telephone call today informing us that on doctor&#39;s advice <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hewitt</inline> was going into hospital because he is completely exhausted. We have sent our sympathy. So it was a rejection by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hewitt,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie</inline> was wrong. </para>

I released a Press report because I had heard that the Aborigines had been driven off the station as Nabalco Pty Ltd held the mining lease. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bunny,</inline> who is the managing director of Nabalco, telephoned me in great distress and said that this was not so. He said that the company did not have a mining lease at Mapoon but had a  mining  lease over Red Sands which is some distance down the coast. I said: &#39;Why do you not make a statement and correct it in tomorrow &#39;s newspaper?&#39; He said: &#39;Yes, I will.&#39; He telephoned me again the next day, full of apologies. He said: &#39;When I checked up our lease I found that we have a lease over Old Mapoon but the mineral content is of no interest to us and we are not concerned if the people go back. &#39; So there is a lease at Old Mapoon. I have a letter signed by about 20 residents of Old Mapoon- it is available for honourable senators to peruse- appealing to me for assistance for them to return. </para>

              <para>-No. It was a telegram that I received. Again I am prepared to show this to anyone. This telegram is signed by 22 Old Mapoon residents who want to go back and by 25 residents of an Aboriginal community at Weipa. They condemned me because I would not give money to them until I had been up and had a talk to them about going back to Mapoon. I have been criticised because we let them go back. It is claimed that I and my Department would not give them the money and permit them to go back. They are used to support an argument against our condemnation of the Queensland Government. Such people include Mick Miller, Clarrie Grogan and Barbara Russell. Those people are known in the Cairns area for having fought against and condemned the Queensland Government for years. They are notorious for that. Yet today those names have been used in an argument in support of the Queensland Government. Because we will not go far enough they condemn us. They have been used to boost up an argument on this question tonight. We went up to Old Mapoon and met the people. We had a meeting with 150 people in attendance. It is not true to say, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hewitt</inline> said, that 3 aircraft were used. </para>

              <para>-No. We did not use 3 aircraft at public expense. I travelled in a VIP aircraft but we paid no fares for anyone else to travel to Weipa. There were 150 one-time Aboriginal residents of Old Mapoon assembled at the meeting. They applauded us, gave us a midday meal and sang Polynesian songs to us. One could see the mission influence as they sang a hymn of goodbye as we left. It is possibly one of the most emotional scenes I have ever witnessed. They expressed anxiety to go back to Old Mapoon. Some of these people could not go because they had commitments. We do not decide where Aboriginals will live. They have an affinity with the land. Whatever the difficulties are in living on that terrain, it is our job to overcome the difficulties. They make the decision about where they want to live and we come in to try to improve their accommodation. Their land is sacred to them and it means more to them than living in a town like Weipa could mean. The result was that we offered them tents and transport facilities so that they could travel from Weipa. Are we condemned for that? </para>

          <para>When we went to Normanton we saw poverty, distress and suffering. This was emotionally referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> today when he referred to how his people live. The Australian Government is attempting to rectify this position. It has arisen because of 200 years of Queensland Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> has stated that the Queensland Government has done nothing off the reserves. We can prove that that is so. When we went to Normanton we saw how the Aborigines lived in barricades. They are living in big tents, dirty houses and unlined galvanised iron sheds. They have barricades with partitions of unlined galvanised iron. The Aborigines have no ablution facilities. There is a kitchen measuring 10 feet by 6 feet which has to service 30 families -some of which comprise 10 people. People live in a room which is 10 feet by 8 feet. They have to cook their meals in a small annexe out the back on a normal wood burning kitchen stove which serves 30 families. Of course, they are lighting fires all around the place to cook their food. That settlement is a Queensland Government settlement. The Australian Government is trying to rectify that situation. </para>
          <para>Nowhere else are there conditions as bad as those which we saw in Queensland. I have been through the Kimberleys in the Northern Territory and other Aboriginal settlements but I have not seen a settlement as bad as those in Queensland. I have proof of the fact. Objections have been raised to the photographs which have been taken by staff of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I believe that the film will be shown on the television program &#39;This Day Tonight&#39;. It has been stated that the program will bring out, in all its glory, the horrors of Queensland. It has been stated that we invaded the privacy of the Aboriginals at Normanton when we visited their homes. We visited those homes at the invitation of the residents. We were invited to come into their kitchen in order to photograph it. We have been accused of taking a photograph of a boy outside a toilet. We were taken down to the place at which the photograph was taken to see that there was no toilet in existence. (Extension of time granted) I thank the Senate for the extension of time. I will be brief because I would like this Bill to pass through the Senate this evening. I have given an indication of the horror and the squalor that exists in Queensland. I have also given an indication of what the Australian Government is trying to do in Queensland. No honourable senator can condemn us for that. I do not have time to refer to all the matters to which I would like to refer. </para>
          <para>In Normanton about 8 houses have been built for the Aborigines. This is where they have 4 blocks each containing space for 30 families in the barricades. The town council has said that no more Aboriginal houses can be built in the town because they do not have a water supply. It has been said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> will not give them the $ 1 34,000 that is necessary to establish a water supply. To provide the Europeans in Normanton with a water supply is properly a State Government responsibility. The State Government has done nothing for Normanton. The town council, because of its Country Party representation, is justifying everything the State Government has done. The Council has stated that they will not have any more houses built for Aboriginals because they do not have sufficient water. It is said that if more homes are built, gardens will be established and more water will be used in Normanton. </para>
          <para>I have illustrated the life of the Aborigines in Queensland. Time will not permit me to go much further into this matter. The Government wants to overcome the problems of the Aborigines in Queensland. The Racial Discrimination Bill 1974 introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> is aimed at overcoming the differences between whites and Aborigines in some respects. We seek to bring in legislation that will render invalid Queensland law that has the effect of preventing the Aboriginal islander from terminating the management of his property. We want to exempt an Aboriginal islander from the requirement to obtain a permit to enter a Queensland reserve; prevent the punishment of an Aboriginal islander on a Queensland reserve for misbehaviour unless the conduct is shown to be unreasonable; supersede the wide powers of entry into the premises of an Aboriginal islander on a Queensland reserve; render invalid laws requiring compulsory labour on Queensland reserves except reasonable community work where ordered by a court; and provide a right of legal representation before Aboriginal or island courts. The aboriginals have no right to legal representation. They are forced to work and they are not paid the award wages. This is what the great Queensland Government does. This indicates the fight that we are having to improve the conditions of Aborigines. Because a Government of the Opposition&#39;s kind is in office in Queensland, Opposition senators would condemn the Aborigines. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> sacrifices his people for political preservation. It shall not happen. </para>

              <para>- Yes. I claim to have been misrepresented not by the Minister but by a previous  speaker.  Two matters were raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner.</inline> Firstly, he said that I was talking to protesting Aboriginals outside Parliament House whilst the Estimate Committees were sitting and that I was absent from the Estimates Committee of which I was a member. That, as will be shown from the Hansard report of the Estimates Committee meeting of 3 1 October, is not correct. The Estimates Committee report shows that the Committee sat from 12.11 p.m. until 2.52 p.m. The time.at which I was talking to those Aborigines was well after 3 p.m. I was showing to those Aborigines that we were prepared to talk to them and to listen to their matters of concern. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Secondly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> said that I asked no questions in relation to Aboriginal housing in Queensland during the hearing of the Estimates Committee in relation to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. As the Hansard record will show on page 395 that statement also was inaccurate. </para>

As he finished his speech, he claimed that I was using my people for political purposes. I do not believe this is correct. I think the Minister should withdraw those remarks because during my speech I even gave credit to the Government for some of its policies in relation to Aboriginal affairs. At no time have I ever used the Aboriginal people for political purposes in this chamber. I have no intention of doing so in the future. I believe that the Minister should withdraw those remarks because I do not use my people for political purposes. </para>

They will be raised at the next opportunity which presents itself when we are dealing with some general aspects of the administration of Aboriginal affairs.

            <para>- I have indicated to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cavanagh)</inline> that as far as the amendments were concerned, two out of three were amendments concerned with errors in the Bill to which we had intended to draw attention. We certainly support the other amendment. It appears to improve the Bill. The Bill itself takes further a concept which was introduced by the Liberal-Country Parties when in government. In 1968 the Aboriginal Enterprises (Assistance) Act was enacted by this Parliament, and its objective was to enable Aborigines in Australia to obtain financial assistance from a central fund, provided out of public moneys, upon terms which are not the normal commercial terms but which are those likely to assist people to be able to engage in business enterprises which have a reasonable prospect of success and in respect of which people should be entitled to receive assistance on appropriate terms. As a result of the educational background and as a result of the geographical location of many of the Aboriginal people of Australia it is necessary and desirable that they should be given an opportunity to apply for funds which would not be made available in the normal course of commerce and enterprise within our society. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This scheme is now being taken further by the present Government and we support the action it is taking. The purpose of the Bill is to convert what was the Aboriginal Enterprises Fund into something a little more sophisticated in the Aboriginal Loans Commission, which will be a commission dealing with 2 particular types of funds. The first will be the old Aboriginal </para>
          <para class="block">Enterprises Fund and the total concept will be transferred to the new Commission. The second fund, and I believe it a desirable development, will be the Aboriginal Housing and Personal Loans Fund. As my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner,</inline> has said to me there are many Aborigines in Australia who would very much like to be able to have the opportunity to obtain a loan upon reasonable terms to improve their houses, their furnishings and their opportunity for some of the material benefits of life, but who do not want to have a handout and be simply getting something for nothing. They rather wish to have access to loan funds so that they are able to purchase items for themselves as do many other members of our society. </para>
          <para>Part of what will be happening under the Aboriginal Housing and Personal Loans Fund is that funds for both housing and house equipment will be available. I am cognisant of the time of night and of the desire of the Senate to pass this piece of legislation tonight. So I simply take the opportunity to indicate that this legislation is carrying forward and further a concept which was introduced by the Liberal and Country Parties when in government. We support it. We believe it is desirable for the same reasons as we introduced it originally. We believe it is desirable that it be carried forward in this way. One or two small corrections did arise and have now been rectified. There is one question of the power of the Auditor-General which I will raise in the Committee stage only by way of query. Otherwise I indicate that the Opposition supports the legislation as being in the interests of the Aboriginal people in Australia and in the interests of Australia because it is in those interests. We support the Bill. </para>

              <para>-I have asked that he be advised. I believe that the Government, the Opposition and indeed all Australians have a right to expect proper clarification of a matter raised in a responsible substance-filled question asked here this morning and particularly such clarification from one whom I know must be classified as a responsible Minister. Because I do not think this happened I draw the attention of the Senate to this problem. Briefly and very shortly I shall recall the main substance of the question and the chief thrust of the somewhat brief and irrelevant reply that I received. The reply, I believe, did neither justice to the Minister nor to the question. I asked: </para>

            <para>What is Australia&#39;s commitment in food aid as pledged by him at the World Food Congress? What form will this food aid take? Will it be solely wheat and mixed grain or will it involve meat in processed form? Is it true that the Minister now asserts that our commitment made at the World Food Congress was only approximately $A19m? If that is the case, why was a note bearing the Minister&#39;s letterhead pinned on the Press gallery board this week saying that the commitment was $30m? Did the Minister in an interview on Sunday last say that the commitment was $30m.? </para>

          <para class="block">I do not believe that any part of that particular question can be ruled off as briefly as the Minister ruled it off this morning. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the significant matter, and that is the nature of the Minister&#39;s reply. When he rose he described the question as being unworthy of reply, as being facile and stupid. Facile, amongst many things, means easy, fluent or flexible. I am quite sure that the Minister did not intend to be complimentary to the question or to myself so I presume he did not have in mind that sort of definition of the word &#39;facile&#39;. The word &#39;stupid&#39; which was the other adjective involved means, among other things, unintelligent and uninteresting. As far as unintelligent is concerned, I do not believe that the matters referred to required no intelligence. Although perhaps from a somewhat biased angle, I suggest that even the questioner may not have been unintelligent. But be that as it may, I am sure that the Minister can answer this section of the problem merely by saying, as he has on several occasions to me with reference to other questions, that it is just a matter of judgment. Of course, it is a matter of judgment whether this question or the questioner were unintelligent. </para>
          <para>As for the second part of the definition of the word &#39;stupid&#39;- that is &#39;uninteresting&#39;- I think that is incredibly bad. I cannot really believe that the Minister sincerely thinks that the subject matter of this question is uninteresting. Once again let me refer to the major matter of the question. I asked:  . . what is Australia&#39;s commitment in food aid as pledged by him - </para>

          <para class="block">Was it $ 19m or was it $30m? I do not believe that any section of the main body of the question is facile or stupid. I believe that the whole question is of supreme significance to the Australian people. If there is any facile or flexible quality in the Minister&#39;s reference to the question then it can only be flexible with regard to his attitude to mathematics which, in his assessment, seems to vary between a figure of $ 19m and $30m. Surely there is quite a significant area of flexibility there. I am concerned because I believe we should be thinking in terms- my Party, the Australian Country Party thinks in these terms- of a food stockpile around the world to make, in some way, a real contribution to the hungry nations. So I am convinced that no part of this question was facile or stupid. I regret that that should have been the reply of a responsible Minister to what I believe was generally conceded to be a sensible and important question. </para>

I do not contemplate those situations with any equanimity of mind. .In those circumstances I feel that I should explain to the Senate that I am, in fact, a senator from Victoria.

            <para>- It is well known that the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Country Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> made a statement relating to the behaviour of ministerial staff going overseas. Referring specifically to an incident during the recent visit to China of the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns),</inline> the  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party called on the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> to comment on whether a member of the  Deputy  Prime Minister&#39;s staff had punched an exhibitor at the Aus.tralian Trade Fair in Peking, had assaulted the Australian Ambassador <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Stephen</inline> Fitzgerald and had also assaulted an American diplomat attached to the United States mission in Peking. Replying, the Prime Minister stated that he would investigate the situation. Apparently he was unaware of the facts. Since that question was asked it has emerged that the incident which the  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party detailed occurred and that it occurred within the precincts of the Australian Embassy in Peking. It has since been confirmed that the assailant was a senior member of the staff of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns. His</inline> resignation is now pending. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Before going further it is worth looking at the staff of this darling of the left wing. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> has on his staff his son, a former honourable member for Bendigo, a Peking basher, and during the visit to Peking not only did the  Deputy  Prime Minister take his wife but also his daughterinlaw and, it is alleged, his former daughterinlaw. It appears to me that when Labor comes to power not only is it jobs for the boys and jobs for the kids but also trips for the family. Even the Prime Minister, as we know, has offended here. But what concerns me is the nature of the incident within the precincts of the Australian Embassy. Three respectable and responsible men were assaulted. No action was taken by the  Deputy  Prime Minister to send the offending staff member home. No apology was made to the Chinese officials who saw the incident and who, I understand, were appalled by it. From what I can gather about the trip which can be called the Cairns trip to China it apparently was a number of days of pretty straight boozing by a large section of the party which accompanied <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns.</inline></para>

In my submission, you should regard these points of order as completely specious and as an unwarranted attempt to prevent the facts of a matter of public concern to be aired in a house of the Parliament. In the first place, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> has not alluded to any debate which has taken place in the House of Representatives. Secondly, the matter which is the subject of the honourable senator&#39;s remarks tonight has not been the subject of any debate, nor is it a measure which is pending in the House of Representatives. Accordingly, the point made by honourable senators opposite is absolutely without substance. The fact that it is completely without substance indicates what the points of order being raised are really intended to do. They are an endeavour to prevent the embarassment of 2 members of the Labor Party who see in what is being alleged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> something which they would like to have hidden. They are doing what they can to have it hidden. The truth ought to come out. </para>

              <para>- I believe that the man concerned is in receipt of a salary of about $30,000 a year. He resigned in September, went to Peking in October and his resignation does not become effective until the end of this month. In other words, he is drawing a salary of several hundred dollars a week after causing grave embarrassment to the Australian Government. He not only caused offence within the precincts of the embassy but also he caused further offence outside. I am informed that he was travelling in a Chinese cab when he began abusing the driver and, on alighting from the cab, tried to wrench the licence plate from the cab. This almost provoked a riot when the Chinese driver remonstrated in a main Peking street. </para>

              <para>-The letter from which I read, from the Acting Minister for Overseas Trade, was signed by Lionel Bowen. Attached to it was a Press statement which I will table for the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser.</inline> I was saying that a riot was almost provoked in a main Peking street. There was still no action taken after this incident. The entire Chinese trip seems to have been marked with unfortunate and unseeming incidents. In Shanghai a member of the party who had become so inebriated vomited all over a senior Chinese railway official. This has been fleetingly referred to in the &#39;Nation Review&#39;.  His  performance drew no official censure from the  Deputy  Prime Minister. In fact a trophy was presented to the offender by a top Australian official. I do not find it funny that such an incident occurred, and I believe that such incidents should draw rebuke and an apology from the individual. I have detailed three of the incidents that occurred in China, all of them disgraceful and all of them smacking of debauchery.

          <para class="block">I think members of the Government Will agree with me. When a Minister and his party go overseas they go overseas not only to represent the Government of the day but also to represent the Australian people. I cannot think of any one Australian who would hold his head in pride when hearing of these incidents in China. I think that officials who go overseas should demonstrate their best behaviour. This was always the case in the past and it is why personal staffs of Ministers were issued with official passports- not the normal run of the mill passports but passports which emphasised the status and importance of those people within the Australian community. It wil be interesting to find out whether these individuals were on official passports or on diplomatic passports. However, here we have an incident of a person travelling as an Australian official, behaving like a pig and . . . He is not on the Washington trip; he is in Australia. </para>

If any member of this chamber was in employment and had to work out his resignation period he would report for duty until the period ended. This man has not done so but is still collecting his salary. I can only assume that he is not attending work because it has been suggested that he have a few pleasant weeks off. That attitude is not good enough for me or anyone else, particularly when one considers his high salary and the fact that there is mounting unemployment in this community. I believe that the  Deputy  Prime Minister deserves strong condemnation for not exercising restraint on the behaviour of his staff while overseas and this Parliament and the people should be given a full explanation - </para>

Senator Webster</inline> has come into the Senate and said that he has been informed of certain things, certain episodes, which, if true, would indeed reflect very great discredit upon the individual who performed these acts. If true, they would. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> was challenged by me by way of interjection, and he heard my interjection, during his speech to produce some evidence for the serious allegations which were being made. He declined to produce any evidence whatsoever. He has made the remarks in this Senate - </para>

He said that an episode had occurred when some person had vomited over somebody else. He said that an episode had occurred when a person assaulted a taxi driver, when he tried to tear the number plate off the taxi. I challenged him to produce evidence, and he now says that he produced evidence and the evidence was a statement. </para>

              <para>- I can produce no evidence to the contrary. I do not know whether a member of the staff of the Minister for Overseas Trade became drunk or did not become drunk. I cannot produce any evidence. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> is endeavouring to do tonight- he has brought an admiring group from his own Party in another place to hear him- is to say that because a member of the staff of the Minister for Overseas Trade may or may not have done something- apparently his resignation is in hand- the Minister for Overseas Trade should be discredited. I believe that this is reducing parliamentary debates to a level to which they have never descended before. It has been a standing practice in this Senate over a long period that members on one side would not refer to the inebriation or the personal conduct outside this Parliament of another member of this Parliament. Tonight <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> tries to discredit the  Deputy  Prime Minister of this country because of something which may or may not have been done, which he alleges to have been done, and for which he produces no evidence. If we wanted to have discussions on disgusting personal behaviour- this is the first time I have heard them raised in this vein- there are many of us here who could say many things about members of the Opposition and members of the staff of the Opposition. We could have said them but we did not. </para>

              <para>- I do not want to read. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> raised this matter. He introduced it. I ask members of the Opposition, if they are going to make charges of this kind about a member of the staff of the  Deputy  Prime Minister, not just to say that they have been informed but to say by whom they have been informed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> now finds this funny. He has been able to slander somebody and now he has sat down. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> finds it a subject of tremendous merriment. If ever there was an argument for the televising of the proceedings of the Parliament, we are seeing it this evening on the part of Opposition senators. I repeat that I would like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen,</inline> who has a high regard for civil liberties and who apparently supports <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> in what he has said tonight, to stand and give us the evidence about these episodes which are alleged to have occurred. He is nodding his head. Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> does have a statement about the matters that occurred in Peking and Shanghai. In view of the fact that this person whom I do not know has resigned from the staff of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns,</inline> I would be interested to know what connection there is between this matter and the Government. Is it to be suggested that members of the Government or members of the Opposition are responsible for what some member of their staff does while not in the course of his duties, or even within the course of his duties if the person concerned subsequently leaves the staff? </para>

              <para>- Now we hear mention of the left wing. We have moved now from debauchery to Marxism. I hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> asking what is the difference. That is the point of the whole magnificent contribution we have heard from the Opposition tonight. Its members are unable to tell the difference between what they describe as debauchery and Marxism. They think the two are linked. The Opposition would have us believe that it is composed entirely of teetotallers, men of total abstinence in all fields, men who have never experienced the carnal lusts of the flesh, men who never touch a drink at any reception. One of those we have never seen. We must say it ourselves- never once have we seen them touch alcoholic liquor in their lives. Nor, indeed, have they ever associated with or been in the company of anybody who has. They expect us to believe that this is the position they take. So bereft are they of policy arguments that they have to resort to personal abuse. So bereft are they of personal allegations against the  Deputy  Prime Minister to justify this behaviour they have to descend to attacking not only a member of the staff of the  Deputy  Prime Minister but also a former member of the staff of the  Deputy  Prime Minister. I hope that accurate copies of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster&#39;s</inline> speech are distributed to every citizen of this country. </para>

            <para>I am aware that the last performance by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinatra</inline> in this country was telecast throughout Australia and I am very much aware of the exhaustive negotiations that preceded it. In fact <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rigby</inline> of my staff was involved on my behalf in consultation with the unions concerned. </para>
            <para>Arising from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rigby&#39;s</inline> report to me, I wish to place on record my appreciation of the way that officers of the Actors and Announcers Equity, the Professional Musicians Union and the Theatrical Amusement Employees Association, together with representatives of Channel 9 settled this matter. The settlement was achieved in a sensible and, I understand, an amicable manner and this instance clearly demonstrates that goodwill can be achieved. As a result millions of people throughout Australia were able to see the Sinatra concert live on television. </para>
            <para>The union leaders are to be commended on behalf of all their members for the decision they took in what they considered to be the overall public interest at the time. I well appreciate their point of view that the particular circumstances existing in this instance should not be taken by anyone as the establishment of a natural precedent. </para>

            <para>The Government accepted the Commission&#39;s recommendations as part of its Budget measures, and preparation of legislation was put in hand without delay. The Budget was introduced by the Treasurer on 17 September- about a month later than usual because of the double dissolutionand the Local Government Assistance Bill was introduced on 23 October. The grants will be paid to the States for passing on to local government following enactment of the Bill. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline>also asked whether the Government has given consideration to any program to underwrite semigovernment and local government borrowings. The Government at present underwrites the borrowing programs of the State Governments and, under the Financial Agreement, raises virtually all borrowings for them. It lacks the Constitutional power to raise loans on behalf of local government and, earlier this year, a referendum to establish that power was unsuccessful. The referendum was, of course, opposed by the Opposition. </para>

Is the Attorney-General aware that under the common law where a fee for service is paid in advance this constitutes a contract and the fee cannot be altered until the contract expires?

          <quote>
            <para>The Postal Regulations prescribe that the fee ordinarily payable for leasing a private box covers an annual period from 1 April to the following 3 1 March. The increased fees recently authorised by Parliament do not become effective until 1 April 1 975 except in the case of new services let after 30 September 1974, for which the new rates apply straight away. </para>
            <para>In the telephone case, for obvious practical reasons, not all subscribers&#39; bills can be sent out on the same day, so rental charges are not statutorily tied uniformly to specified dates. The Telephone Regulations provide that where rental for a telephone service is paid in advance (this is the normal situation) and the amount paid is greater than or less than that prescribed, the subscriber is entitled to a refund of or is liable to pay the difference between the two. In these circumstances, the Post Office has a statutory obligation to apply to all telephone subscribers services from 1 October 1974 the rental charges authorised by the Parliament to operate from that date. </para>

              <para>The draft zoning regulations to control the land use surrounding the Avoca Street Defence property are Residential Al to the north and west of the propery and Residential B to the South of the property. These zonings restrict construction to single unit dwellings and town house/duplex type dwellings. </para>

            <item label="(3)">
              <para>No. In view of the size of the Defence area, a limited high rise building set back from the boundaries and properly landscaped, would not be out of character with the surrounding area. However an earlier proposal to construct a high rise building for a rank and file barracks block is being reviewed and it is possible the number of floors will be less than the nine originally envisaged. The plan for the development of this area features extensive landscaping, tree plantings, and general aesthetic treatment to ensure that the property will be attractive when viewed from outside the area. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question is as follows: </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>&#38; (2) The following table gives the radiation doses estimated to have been incurred by the Australian population during the past 12 months from natural sources and from fall-out from nuclear explosions in the atmosphere. The radiation doses are expressed as man-rads, that is the product of the dose estimated for each group of the population and the number of persons in the group. The doses include the contributions made during the 12 month period, from fall-out from all nuclear tests to date. However, fresh fission product fall-out is still reaching Australia from the recent series of nuclear tests by France in Polynesia and fallout over Australia of long-lived radioisotopes will continue for some years from the high yield explosions that both France and China have carried out in the atmosphere. </para>

          <item label="(3)">
            <para>(a) &#38; (b) The above table of doses for the past 12 months gives estimates of the doses to the Australian population due separately to nuclear tests conducted by China, by France and by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States. The doses in the table include the contributions made during the 12 month period by fresh fission product fall-out as well as by the long-lived component of fall-out in Australia. Complex analyses of the data obtained from the Australian Government fall-out monitoring programs and of data published by other countries permit apportionment of these doses between the countries that have conducted nuclear tests in the atmosphere. The apportionment in relation to fresh fission product fall-out in the past 12 months in Australia is as follows: </para>
            <list type="loweralpha">
              <item label="(a)">
                <para>Fresh fission product fall-out in Australia has been positively identified with nuclear explosions conducted by France in Polynesia and the French tests are responsible for all of the radiation dose to the Australian population in the past 12 months arising from fresh fission product fall-out; </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(b)">
                <para>No fresh fall-out in Australia has been identified with any nuclear tests by China. </para>

        <para>The Australian Government Fall-out Monitoring Programme has assessed the radiation doses to the Australian population to date in 1974 as a result of fresh fall-out from the recent series of nuclear tests by France in Polynesia. These doses are notably higher than those recorded following the series in 1 972 and the series in 1 973. </para>
        <para>In addition, I would mention that the South Australian Premier has informed the Prime Minister that the Engineering and Water Supply Department of South Australia assesses routinely the level of radio-activity in rainfall and water supply storages and that the results of radio-activity tests on rainfall over the period 1970 to 1974 indicate that significant increases in levels have been detected following French nuclear testing in the South Pacific Ocean. The levels for 1974 show the highest peak for rainfall precipitation ever recorded by that Department&#39;s laboratories ( 1648 picocuries per litre on 13 September 1974). Other readings at the same site were 657 picocuries per litre on 30 July 1974, 868 on 6 August 1974, 742.9 on 4 September, 728 on 19 September 1974 and 738 on 8 October 1 974. </para>
