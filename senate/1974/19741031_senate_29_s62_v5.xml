            <para>- I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Is it a fact that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Department of the Treasury regard weekly tax rebates for interest payments on mortgages as too complicated to be easily workable? Is it also a fact, as rumoured, that the Australian Labor Party Caucus thinks otherwise? What is the source of the superior knowledge which entitled the members of Caucus to know better than Treasury the feasibility of a complex tax deduction program? </para>

            <para>- This question obviously involves policy. It deals with the financial policies of the Government about which the Parliament will be informed in due course. The honourable senator is really asking about the superior knowledge of Caucus. Of course Caucus that is, all the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party, both senators and members would be expected to have an enormous collective capacity to decide questions when it is able to receive the wise advice, not only of the Prime Minister but also of the Treasurer. Honourable senators will recall that not so long ago I said that we have the wisest and most prudent Treasurer that this Commonwealth has had for the last 23 years. </para>

              <para>-I talked to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Soares</inline> in New York and later with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Santos</inline> here. I also spoke with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Adam</inline> Malik who of course is interested in this matter. There is nothing in the attitude of any of those people which is alarming at all. In fact, their attitude pleases us completely. The situation is that for 400 years the Portuguese have been the colonial power in Timor. Of course, Timor is still the prime responsibility of the Portuguese because they are there. Obviously 3 things could happen. Firstly, because of the halving of the island with Indonesia, Timor could seek to be incorporated into Indonesia. Secondly, it could go for independence. Thirdly, it could very well continue on with the Portuguese. What is certain is that whatever it does, changes will occur. If it stays with the Portuguese the changes will be for the better because of the general Portuguese situation. The Portuguese have had a look at their colonial powers and this thing has come to a head. I do not think there is any other way to handle the situation than to adhere quite tightly to what the United Nations has said over all these years. We have been saying as a government since we have been in power that we believe in the self-determination of people. We believe that they should make that decision and that it should be closely aligned with the several decisions made by the United Nations over the years. </para>

            <para>- Honourable senators will recall, of course, that the CT4 aircraft was developed from the Vista aircraft which was formerly manufactured in Australia. Our Government continued the discussions which the former Government had started in relation to the CT4 aircraft and agreed to purchase 37 of them. It was agreed that some of the components would be manufactured in Australia under arrangements of participation. The original project cost, which I do not think has been exceeded, was more than $3m. It is expected that the first of the 37 aircraft will arrive in January 1975 and that the remainder will be received progressively The proposition at one stage was developed between the 2 countries that the delivery of the last 12 aircraft might be deferred. I understand that that proposition has now been rejected. I will endeavour to find out whether there is any other information I can give the honourable senator in relation to the matter. </para>

Is the Minister aware that there are no showers, bathrooms or dressing rooms provided for these senators as there are for other members of the Senate? Is this not another form of discrimination which has been carried on for far too long? In the circumstances will the Government give immediate consideration to providing suitable facilities for the senators and so encourage their innovative endeavours? </para>

            <para>- Yes, I have noted with pleasure how the women senators are coming into the chamber of an evening. I think everyone has enjoyed that. The honourable senator referred to the discrimination which is practised against the women senators. I am not aware of whether any special facilities are provided for the female senators. I do know that the toilets around the place are simply labelled &#39;senators&#39;. They contain, in some cases, showers. I do not think there is any prohibition against any senators using the facilities which are provided. But it is a matter for their own judgment. If the female senators wish separate facilities to be provided, no doubt they will make application to the  President.  I regret that I have not had occasion to focus on these problems. I do not think that any honourable senator would want to practice any form of discrimination against senators of the other sex. May I say that the trend which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> has noticed ought to be encouraged. </para>

I raised this matter with the  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Professor Downing, and the General Manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duckmanton.</inline> As a result, after discussing it with the members of the Commission, they have had negotiations with the Australian Council for the Arts. I understand that the 2 organisations between them have now arranged for a feasibility study to be conducted by a well-known journalist in Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Donald</inline> Home, as to the economic viability of such a proposition. I understand that they are expecting a report on the subject from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Home</inline> in the near future. I am hoping personally that the feasibility study will assert that such a publication is economically viable because I believe it certainly is something that is really warranted in Australia. Time after time I, as Minister for the Media, have received requests from a large number of people and from diverse sections of the Australian people to be provided with scripts of broadcasts or television interviews that have taken place, particularly in ABC programs. I would have thought that such a publication would contribute greatly to the uplifting of electronic media standards and the broadening of knowledge for all Australians. </para>

In the case of children who are double orphans- that is, children who have lost both of their parents- there is a double orphan&#39;s pension of $ 10 a week which is shortly to be increased to $11 a week. Under the legislation which was dealt with by the Senate on Tuesday of this week, a handicapped child&#39;s allowance of $10 a week is to be paid in respect of eligible children for whom child endowment is received. The receipt of child endowment or any other form of benefit of this nature does not in any way preclude the payment of any social service pensions which the grandparents would be otherwise receiving. </para>

I make quite a lot of these tapes and I am afraid I am not quite sure which one this is. I have asked my Department, in conjunction with Treasury, to formulate proposals which may be necessary to assist the beef industry in the immediate months ahead. I am specifically seeking alternative methods which could be used to relieve the position of those producers who are entirely dependent on beef production, especially in the northern part of Australia where they have a sole dependence on beef production and have been hit heavily by the decline in the export market to the United States of America. I hope to have whatever proposals the departments have been able to draw up before me before the end of the year so that in the event of assistance being required for those producers we will be able to implement the necessary plans. </para>

As the Australian grape growing and wine making industries are suffering from heavy importation of brandy, some of which is allegedly of similarly suspect origin, and in view of the desirably stringent regulation and certification requirements applying to the genuine Australian product, will the Minister ensure that all imported brandy conforms completely with our set standards? </para>

I think there was a rather scandalous situation in Italy some years ago and we are all aware of what is alleged to have happened in France. I shall see what can be done to resolve this problem in the direction that the honourable senator suggests. I think it is proper to do so, not merely for the protection of the wine and brandy industries of Australia, important though they are, but also for the protection of the Australian consumer. I will certainly see to it that everything that ought to be done is done to ensure that the Australian consumer is not deceived by any action of those sending goods into Australia or those from whom the goods are derived. </para>

            <para>- In answer to the first question, I do not know whether the Prime Minister said that or not. The treaty of NARA will not be signed during Prime Minister Tanaka &#39;s visit. There has been a long process of to-ing and fro-ing on it. Japan put up a draft treaty and we put up another and so on. I was asked a few weeks ago whether we should speed up the preparation of the treaty and have it signed during his visit. I said no. This is a very technical matter. It is the first time it has been done. This is a new type of treaty. As I understand it, Japan has never entered into this type of treaty with anybody else. My attitude is that it is better to have a good treaty than a fast one. It would be nice to sign it when Prime Minister Tanaka is here but does that really matter when it is a treaty that is going to last for as far ahead as we can see? So it will not be signed during the time that he is here. I have seen a draft and have been in fairly close contact with my officers who are working on it. As the doctors say, it is coming along as well as can be expected under all the circumstances. </para>

            <para>- Firstly, the development of the deposits is the responsibility of a private company, not the Federal Government or the State Government. Broken Hill South Ltd, the company concerned, has of course made its own assessment as to the economics of quarrying or mining those deposits. I understand that initially it was not considered by the company to be economic to mine them, in view of the low phosphate content in the ore, in relation to world prices for phosphate rock which have obtained in recent years. Undoubtedly the very rapid escalation of the price of phosphate rock on the world market has now made a difference to the return factor which Broken Hill South Ltd can expect from its investment. I have no doubt that the company has made a very detailed cost analysis of the development of those deposits and the eventual manufacture of fertiliser. </para>

          <para>As to the matter of the rail link to the coast, I am not sure what the position is. Even if the Queensland Government has not completed it I assume that Broken Hill South Ltd, in negotiation with the Queensland Government and possibly with our own Federal Government, is constructing that rail link. Until such time as it is ready, presumably road transport will be necessary. I cannot give any answer on that. If my colleague the Federal Minister for Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jones,</inline> can provide some further information, I will obtain it for the honourable senator. </para>

I ask: Is it not a fact that Ampol Exploration Ltd is completely within its rights in making an application to the Prices Justification Tribunal, which was set up by this Government? Is it the intention of the Government and, in particular, of the Minister for Minerals and Energy to browbeat Ampol Exploration Ltd in the manner in which the Minister did yesterday, apparently in order to prevent the company going on with its application and exercising its legal rights? </para>

            <para>-As to the first part of the honourable senator&#39;s question, there is no doubt that it is the right of Ampol Exploration Ltd to make an application to the Prices Justification Tribunal. I suppose some might take the view that there ought not to be criticism of anyone who exercises his legal rights. But I seem to recall that whenever a trade union makes an application to a court for an increase in wages all sorts of attacks are made in the Parliament and outside about unions going crazy. We are told that the unions should not do it and are asked what the Government is going to do to stop the unions and so forth. Never do I find members of the Opposition calling for any moderation or restraint by those in private enterprise as employers or profit makers. They are never asked to restrain themselves from making what might be legitimate claims in the interests of the community at large. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I suggest with respect that the honourable senator should look at himself and at what his Party is doing. What does the Opposition mean when it calls for restraint? Honourable senators opposite came in here after an arbitration was made, according to law, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Campbell about statutory offices and they disallowed that arbitration. But when it is the case of large companies which are well able to look after themselves, some criticism is expressed of a Minister I have not read all his words- who obviously is saying that restraint is not a one-way process and that if there is to be restraint, let it be restraint from those who are seeking increases which will inevitably add to inflation. </para>

            <para>- It has already been pointed out that the Opposition often argues that we should spend more and cut back. I have seen the report of the statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> made the other night suggesting that there should be a general Government cutback of 8 per cent. Of course already other Ministers have pointed out what might happen in relation to social services and defence, for example. As for the Post Office, I think that such a cutback would mean not only a reduction of about $30m in capital works expenditure but also obviously the sacking of hundreds of workers from the Australian Post Office. Perhaps, more seriously, a cutback would affect the employment of many people in industries such as the electronics and telecommunication industries which supply requirements to the Post Office. Perhaps even more seriously- this is the thing with which we are trying to contend in the Post Office in having to raise tariffs- it would increase the delays in telephone connections in every area, including that of the honourable senator and of honourable senators from Queensland. We are having enough trouble now trying to meet such programs. It is ridiculous, if we look at the general economic situation, to make such a suggestion because it would simply mean that no government could carry out its programs or meet its promises on social services. </para>

            <para>-The Khmer or Cambodian position at the United Nations is that there is a resolution from last year which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> says, seeks to seat the Trunk Government in place of the Lon Noe Government. That was deferred last year. This year a resolution is to be put which calls on the Secretary-General to use his good offices to try to bring about talks between the 2 parties. So the situation is that there will be 2 resolutions before the General Assembly. A further resolution gives precedence to that second resolution which calls Kurt Waldheim into the play. Australia will support the resolution to call in the Secretary-General. We will also support the resolution to give the matter precedence. In addition we will co-sponsor the resolution proposing United Nations involvement. Then the matter will rest on whether that resolution is carried or the United Nations goes back to the position last year and we vote on the question of who shall be seated. We have taken the attitude that because we recognise the Lon Noe Government- the Government with which we have our credentials at the moment- we will support that Government. So there is a series of situations. We will support not only the move to try to bring the United Nations more fully into the matter but we will also seek to give it priority. If it does come to a vote we will support the resolution that the Lon Noe Government be seated at the United Nations. </para>

As the honourable senator probably knows, recently we sent a mission to visit other countries to consider the 2 types of aircraft to which the selection has been limited- the Orion and the Nimrod. But I understand that the Boeing company has asked that its aircraft be placed again in the category for consideration. The Government has not decided which of the aircraft to select. The overseas mission to which I have referred has returned to Australia after considering what should be done. The report is not yet available.

          <para>In addition to the overseas evaluation team to which I have referred, an industrial mission is presently overseas considering to what extent the Barra sonar system might be used in both the aircraft under consideration. I do not know what has resulted from those investigations. I might say also that one of the considerations in relation to the selection of a particular type of aircraft will be the extent to which there is participation by Australian industry in the construction of the aircraft. If I can obtain any more information for the honourable senator I will get it and give it to him. </para>

            <para>-I cannot tell the honourable senator whether this question has been voted on or not; I do not know. The vote is imminent; it could have happened by now. A rather long debate about this matter has been going on in the Security Council. The second question which the honourable senator asked was whether we will press for the expulsion of other members of the United Nations. As I explained the other night when we were debating this matter, it is not a question of our pressing for such expulsions. This matter concerning the expulsion of South Africa was referred to the Security Council and we happen to be on the Security Council. So the matter was put firmly in front of us to make a decision. If it had happened last year or if it were to happen next year we would not have been in our present position, but at this time we are. </para>

          <para>Yesterday I made a statement dealing with this very point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> raiseswhether or not everybody who has assaulted the United Nations Charter- it does not matter to what degree- should be kicked out of the United Nations. Certainly there are many member nations of the United Nations which, if one liked to watch them very closely, one would see have not done the sorts of things that the Charter lays down. But I do not think that this can be used as any excuse for the violations that South Africa has consistently committed over 25 years. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> will see that in my statement. I will give him a copy of it if he would like it. It is not a question of our pressing for the expulsion of other nations. We never pressed this one. </para>

            <para>- It has certainly been indicated already that the discussions between the Japanese Prime Minister and the Australian Prime Minister will include the question of Australian beef exports to Japan. Whether there will be suggestions that the trade between the 2 countries will be penalised because of the problems we find in particular areas of that trade is a different matter. It would not be in the interests of this country or of Japan to damage that trade relationship simply because of difficulties that arise in particular areas. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator will know that since the Minister for Defence made that statement and I repeated it in the Senate the Government has considered what percentage of expenditure should be placed for defence needs. We decided that there ought to be a new priority when we came to government and that we should spend more money on pay and pensions for the Services, re-engagement bonuses and so on. Because of that policy some of the options which the Government had for new equipment were cut back. Everybody knows that at the present time pay, re-engagement bonuses and Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund conditions are really no longer the issues they were when we came into government because hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent in those areas. As to the re-equipment program the Government decided that a replacement for the Mirage aircraft should be put off. It has now been decided that the replacement will not be purchased earlier than 1978. </para>

What would home purchasers save in the same financial year if interest rates were reduced to the 1972 levels?

            <para>- Obviously I am not in a position to answer the first 2 parts of the question. They will have to be placed on the notice paper for the Treasurer to provide a proper answer. As to the last part of the honourable senator&#39;s question, the Treasury has made 5 releases of liquidity since June, if my memory serves me correctly. It has made a great amount of liquidity available in the economy which previously was not available. It would be quite remiss of the Government now to allow injections of money which were unnecessary and unwarranted into the economy at this stage. The Government has been careful in its monetary policy to ensure that there has been a relaxation of the liquidity position, and that is the policy it will continue to follow. </para>

            <para>-I doubt whether there will be discussions with the Japanese Prime Minister on this specific matter on this occasion. As I have said in answering questions previously, the discussions which were initiated last October in relation to the entry of Australian apples into Japan were continued and I think, at least for the moment, resolved in August of this year when the Japanese made it quite clear that they would not allow the importation of Australian apples into that country until such time as they were sure of the elimination of codling moth. At this stage we have not reached the health standards that the Japanese require. It is quite understandable that they will protect their own industries from disease in exactly the same way as we do. We have rigid laws in relation to the imports of livestock, fruit or other products where we feel that our industries might suffer as a result of the introduction of disease. I am not hopeful of any fresh developments in relation to exports to Japan of apples for the 1 975 season. We can only continue to research, explore and improve the methods that we already have for the elimination of the sons of diseases that currently prevent our fruit from being exported to that country. </para>

If so, what is likely to be the short term and long term result of such curtailment? </para>

            <para>-The Trade Practices Act has been in operation for only a very short time and there does seem to be some indication of a movement away from what was occurring previously. 1 do not know whether this has been reflected in any dramatic way in decreases of prices. I seem to remember that the  Chairman  of the Trade Practices Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bannerman,</inline> expressed the view that there would be either a significant drop in prices, or at least that prices would fall significantly below the level at which they otherwise would have been, in a fairly short period by reason of the operation of the Act. There is no doubt that the long term effects will be in this direction. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I should remind the Senate that although the prohibition of price fixing, monopolisation and anti-competitive mergers in the consumer protection provisions has been operating as from 1 October, the provisions in relation to the prohibition of exclusive dealing, prices discrimination and contracts in restraint of trade, other than price fixing, are not operative until 1 February 1975. So another wave of the operation of the Act is still to come. There seems to be a good deal of evidence that the commercial community is responding positively to the provisions of the Act. They see that this is for their ultimate benefit and certainly it will be for the benefit of the consumers. I will concede that ultimately after the delays ceased there was a fairly general support for the provisions of the Act. I am sure that they will be effective in the long term and we would hope in the short term. I will endeavour to get a report from the  Chairman  of the Commission as to how he sees the Act operating, even at this early stage. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Environment and Conservation: Is the Government aware that a group of unions in Victoria is standing over the Victorian Government by simply telling it that the power station, essential for Victoria&#39;s future power needs, is not to be built at Newport? Is not the Minister aware that this attitude is being taken against a background of exhaustive enquiries into the environmental impact of such a station, all of which inquiries have resulted in findings in favour of the station being built? Is it not also a fact that the Minister whom the Minister represents, after initial opposition to the Victorian power station, now indicates that the inquiries have been found to show that the station will not be a detriment to the environment? I ask, in the interests of balanced and sensible environmental policies under which buildings can be constructed after the necessary inquiries have been conducted, will the Minister come out and strongly support the Victorian Government&#39;s position? </para>

            <para>- This issue was raised here, I think, about a month ago. I then indicated that there were certain provisions in our law which were aimed against the development of private armies. I suppose, if necessary, these provisions will be invoked. It is quite undesirable in a world which has been characterised by more and more violence that there should be suggestions in Australia of a private army. I think those in the Returned Services League ought to understand quite firmly- I think we can speak for any government of any political character- that if the Government thinks it needs the assistance of the Returned Services League to run the defence force or any kind of para-military force, it will ask for it. It does not do any good for democracy and the preservation of peace for this kind of idiotic suggestion to be put forward by the Returned Services League or anybody else. </para>

          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to make racial discrimination unlawful in Australia and to provide an effective means of combating racial prejudice in this country. I introduced into the Senate a Racial Discrimination Bill on 21 November 1 973, and again on 4 April 1 974, but the Bill was not debated before Parliament was dissolved for the last election. The present Bill is similar to the previous Bills and includes some improvements. The Bill implements into Australian law the obligations contained in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It is recognised in this Convention that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that any doctrine of superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and without any justification. Eighty-one countries have already ratified the Convention. The Convention was signed on behalf of Australia on 13 October 1966 and the ratification of the Convention by Australia is, I believe, urgent and overdue. </para>
          <para>The basic framework of the previous Bills has been retained. The Bill recognises the importance of legislation that will make racial discrimination unlawful. I emphasise that the introduction of legislation to outlaw racial discrimination is a fundamental step that must be taken if Australia is to ratify the Convention. The common law provides no effective remedies against discrimination in the exercise of human rights, whether it be based on race or colour or on other grounds. Legislation therefore has a vital role to play in the elimination of racial discrimination. The proscribing of racial discrimination in legislative form not only makes people more aware of the evils of discrimination and makes it more obvious and conspicuous, but also furnishes an essential legal background on which to base changes to basic community attitudes. The fact that racial discrimination is unlawful will make it easier for people to resist social pressures that result in discrimination. </para>
          <para>In making racial discrimination unlawful, the Bill follows closely the definition used in the Convention. The Bill will thus make it unlawful for a person to do an act involving discrimination based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which impairs the enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms. The Bill will guarantee equality before the law without distinction as to race. It also deals in detail with racial discrimination so far as it concerns access to places and facilities, the provision of land, housing and other accommodation, the provision of goods and services, the right to join trade unions and employment </para>
          <para>An important objective of the Bill is the creation of practical and effective legal remedies. Pious declarations of principle are of little value unless they can be given practical expression. The remedies provided by the Bill will include those of an injunction restraining the doing of discriminatory acts, an order requiring acts of a remedial nature to be done, an order cancelling a contract and damages in respect of the loss suffered by an aggrieved person and the loss of dignity, humiliation and injury to the feelings of an aggrieved person. </para>
          <para>In addition, the Bill establishes formal administrative machinery for the examination of complaints of racial discrimination on a systematic basis and for the settlement of complaints by conciliation. The Bill recognises that reliance on the spasmodic operation of judicial review for the enforcement of the legislation would be unsatisfactory. The Bill also recognises that an emphasis on mediation and conciliation is a more satisfactory way of tackling individual instances of racial discrimination and the tensions that are associated with individual disputes. A Commissioner for Community Relations will therefore be established as an independent statutory authority to undertake these tasks. Where settlement cannot be achieved, the Commissioner will have power to commence legal proceedings before a court to have the legal issues between the parties determined. </para>
          <para>The Bill also recognises the importance of developing programs of education and research and other programs to combat racial discrimination and promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among racial and ethnic groups. The Commissioner will have the function of conducting programs of education and research to combat racial discrimination, and a Community Relations Council will be established with an advisory role. The Bill contains some improvements to the previous Bills. The Bill has been amended to further emphasise the Commissioner&#39;s position as an independent and impartial conciliator. Overseas experience tends to show that a Commissioner who has an independent and impartial role and whose functions place emphasis on the effecting of a settlement enjoys greater co-operation from respondents than a Commissioner whose functions require him to make a judgment of the issues and identify himself with a complainant&#39;s cause. The bill has accordingly been amended to give effect to this approach. </para>
          <para> There is also a need to ensure that the operation of the Act is not frustrated by a lack of cooperation on the part of a respondent. The Bill has accordingly been amended to give the Commissioner the power to call a compulsory conference for the purpose of inquiring into a complaint and endeavouring to effect a settlement. The Bill will also authorise a judge to require a - person to give evidence in relation to a matter that is the subject of an inquiry under the Act. Evidence so obtained will not be admissible in other proceedings except proceedings for giving false evidence. In Canada, compulsory evidence gathering powers are given to Human Rights Commissions and similar powers are vested in the conciliator established by the New Zealand legislation. The absence of evidence-gathering powers in the United Kingdom legislation is said to seriously impede the effectiveness of that legislation. </para>
          <para>A further change to the previous Bills effected by the present Bill will give the Commissioner the function of carrying out and fostering programs of education and research and other programs to combat racial discrimination. Overseas experience has shown that the success of legislation dealing with racial discrimination depends very much on the effectiveness of programs of this kind. The need for these programs was recognised in the 1 973 Bill and highlighted in the Bill introduced earlier this year. In my second reading speech of 4 April 1974, 1 pointed out that the changing of community attitudes and the promotion of understanding, tolerance and friendship among racial and ethnic groups would form an extremely important part of government&#39;s program for the elimination of racial discrimination. I also pointed out that both government and community-based programs to combat racial discrimination were necessary. Amendments were made to the Bill to supplement the advisory role of the Race Relations Council with respect to education and research. The vesting of the proposed functions in the Commissioner will reinforce these important aspects. Australia will be required by Article 7 of the Convention to conduct programs of this kind to combat racial discrimination. </para>
          <para>Finally, the Bill has been amended to emphasise reliance on civil, rather than criminal, law to combat racial discrimination. The range of offences in the Bill has accordingly been reduced and is mainly concerned with meeting the specific requirements imposed by Article 4 of the Convention. This Bill represents an important step in the government&#39;s program with respect to human rights. The Bill will provide the basis upon which Australia can comply with the obligations imposed by the Convention on Racial Discrimination. The Bill recognises that laws proscribing discrimination are vital, but not in themselves sufficient. The legislation recognises that there must also be effective and systematic enforcement of rights and the promotion of education and research, if the elimination of racial discrimination in this country is to be achieved in fact as well as in theory. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para>-  I rise on this motion to get some indication from the Government in regard to an item on the notice paper. We will return to the Senate on 12 November. I know that reports of committees are scheduled to be presented that day and that the debate on the Family Law Bill 1974 is continuing. But I also notice that the Superior Court Bill 1974 has in recent days been lifted to the second position on the notice paper. It is in regard to the future of that Bill that I seek some indication from the Manager of Government Business in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland).</inline> This Bill, as he will recall, is now on its third appearance before the Senate. It was introduced on 12 December last year and disappeared from the notice paper on prorogation. It was reintroduced in April of this year, debated in the Senate and the Senate rejected the second reading of the Bill. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>At the time of the double dissolution there was standing on the notice paper a motion by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> for the recommittal of the Bill. When the new Parliament assembled the Bill was reintroduced on 30 July and it has been on the notice paper for 25 sitting days. My recollection also is that when the Parliament adjourned on 16 August it was a matter of touch and go as to whether the Superior Court Bill would be debated on that day. In the result it was not debated. But we have had it on the notice paper for quite a long time. I am also very conscious of many statements made from time to time about the Opposition not co-operating with the Government in the passage of legislation. We on our part think we have co-operated well, but we would like an indication as to whether the Superior Court Bill is to be proceeded with. If so, when will it be proceeded with or is it to be regarded as abandoned? If so, are formal steps likely to be taken? I think it is important for us to have some indication as to what are the Government&#39;s intentions. I use this motion to seek that information. </para>

          <para>- My understanding, after consultation with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, is that had the Family Law Bill passed the second reading stage the debate on the Superior Court Bill would have commenced yesterday. There have been some developments in regard to that Bill, as the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> would be aware. For a start, it has been proposed to take one division out of it- that is, the family law division. As I indicated, that proposal was recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. It seemed to be a sensible proposal and I indicated acceptance of it. It has also been suggested that we ought to remove from the Superior Court the matters which could give rise to criticism of possible conflicts of jurisdiction. I have indicated that I am amenable to that suggestion. The scope of the Superior Court may be a matter to be discussed in the Committee stage of the debate. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I think there would be no real reason why the matter ought not to proceed in its ordinary course and these matters dealt with in the Committee stage. Certainly the Government wants to proceed with the Superior Court Bill. That was announced on several occasions in the policy speeches. I do not know whether it is convenient to go through all that now, but there has been a good deal of discussion and a good deal of endeavour on the part of the Government to gain acceptance of the concept, which after all was originally advanced by the Opposition Parties when in Government. I think that with a little goodwill from the Opposition we can succeed in getting a piece of very helpful legislation on the statute book. So I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> if he is anxious for the debate to proceed, to endeavour to obtain and express the goodwill of his own Party to our efforts to continue and to get on the statute book the concept which was originally introduced by members of his own Party. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>I do not want to delay the Senate for any length of time, but I want to correct the arithmetic of one or two honourable senators who have claimed that certain Opposition senators have voted for the Government at certain times, and of course I have been the butt of those remarks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> claimed, I think yesterday or the day before, that I have voted for the Government on 49 occasions when the Opposition has not done so. I have taken some trouble to examine the journals of the Senate, and I have found that the record should be put straight in relation to the Opposition as a whole and the way in which it has either supported or not opposed Government legislation. I tender this factual information for the benefit of the Senate. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>So far this session the Senate has passed 57 Government Bills with the approval of, or certainly without the disapproval of, the Opposition. There are 7 voting procedures connected with the passage of each Bill. Therefore, the Liberal-Country Party Opposition, as a bloc, has voted for, or at least has not opposed, Government measures on 399 occasions. However, expressed as votes by individual senators, this represents 11,571 occasions on which the 29 members of the Liberal-Country Party Opposition have not opposed the Government. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen,</inline> who is trying to interject, studies the record he will find that there are 7 voting procedures connected with the introduction and the passage of each Bill. He will also find that the same standard of approach was adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> in arriving at the proposition that I have voted for the Government on 49 occasions when the Opposition has not done so. I do not alter the standard of approach which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> and his colleagues have adopted. There is no differential in the standard of approach in working out the voting pattern. </para>
        <para>In my case there have been an additional 49 occasions on which I have given individual votes in support of Government Bills. I therefore have not opposed or voted for Government legislation on 399 occasions, plus 49 occasions, making a total of 448 occasions. In order to find the number of occasions on which the LiberalCountry Party Opposition has voted for the Government, one has to multiply the votes of the 29 Liberal-Country Party senators by the number of Bills by the number of procedural matters which are decided by vote. On 11,571 occasions the Liberal-Country Party Opposition has voted for the Government. </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) The Australian Government was given, by referendum in 1946, the power to make laws with respect to the provisions of certain benefits, allowances and services including sickness benefits, hospital benefits and medical services. The Australian Government, by virtue of these powers, can assume certain responsibilities for the health care of the population generally, which of course, includes pensioners, but it does not have an exclusive or even dominant responsibility in that field. The State Governments have accepted that it is their role to control public hospitals and provide treatment from them and clearly asa result, the States have an obligation to the public generally including pensioners in that respect. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>The National Health Act provides for the Australian Government to pay public hospitals $5 for each day that a pensioner eligible for the Pensioner Medical Service is provided with free treatment in a public ward. However, that is not the total contribution by the Australian Government towards the bed costs for pensioners. Previous LiberalCountry Party governments adopted the view that the general revenue grants made by the Australian Government to the States, to cover their broad range of responsibilities, included an element relating to the additional cost of pensioner hospitalisation above the $5 per day directly allocated for that purpose. The present Government agrees that this is a valid position. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>It will be apparent from my answer to the second part of the honourable senator&#39;s question that a comparison of past and present relationships between the pensioner hospital benefit and average bed day costs is inappropriate when considered in isolation from the finance made available under the general revenue grants. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>At the Australian Health Ministers&#39; Conference on 16-18 August 1974, the State Ministers for Health sought an increase in the pensioner bed day benefit. The State Health Ministers were informed that, if they so wished, I would approach the Prime Minister to have the pensioner hospital benefit of $5 a day increased, subject to a corresponding adjustment of the general finance allocations to the States. This is in accordance with my view that if State governments have difficulties in identifying appropriate amounts of the general financial allocations that assist them to meet the cost of treating pensioners in public hospitals, the Australian Government could consider earmarking an appropriate portion of general allocation in the future. </para>

            <para>The action taken by the Government no doubt materially assisted in holding down the inflation which was under way and which was commented on by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development as having begun here in the time of the previous Government and as being rampant overseas&#39;. </para>

            <para>Since 1 970-7 1 there has been a marked quickening in the rate of price inflation and the consumer price index for the December quarter of 1 973 showed an increase of 13.2 per cent over the corresponding quarter of 1 972. </para>
            <para>It was against this background of rapid price inflation and the failure of the States to act uniformly that the Australian Government which came into power in December 1972 announced a number of initiatives in the area of price control. A Parliamentary Joint Committee on prices was appointed to report on a wide area relating to prices. Referenda were held in December 1973 on the questions of vesting in the Australian Parliament full constitutional powers to control incomes and prices. In the event, the referenda failed to be passed so that these powers remained with the States&#39;. (Page 52). </para>
            <para>According to latest estimates the rate of increase of food prices has not been slowing down since September and an easing in the escalation of property prices is discernible. Nevertheless, with the expected very high rates of inflation abroad- the GNP deflator for the OECD area as a whole this year is estimated to rise by about 10 per cent the pressure from external sources is likely to remain severe&#39;.

It did not claim to cover all developed countries, but was in the same form as tables submitted by the Australian Government in previous National Wage Cases.

I take it that the honourable senator is referring to the 1973 figure in the former table. </para>
          <para>If this is so I would mention just 2 points. The first is that statistics were not given for 14 other members of the OECD, most of which are usually regarded as developed countries. The second is that I am advised that the statistics presented showed only the percentage change in the CPI for the month of December 1973 compared with the month of December 1972. (The figures for Australia and New Zealand related to the percentage increase in the December quarter 1973 over the December quarter of the previous year.) There can be significant differences in such statistics from month to month. For these reasons the generalisation put forward by the honourable senator is misconceived. </para>

            </item>

          <para>The answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question is as follows: </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="1">
              <para>. It would not be true to say that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has been slow in assessing the total size of the problem of displaced people on Cyprus. The Cypriot community may however have been referring to the inevitable delays that have occurred in locating and identifying specific individuals who have been displaced. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>On 20 August, the Secretary General of the United Nations appointed the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to co-ordinate U.N. humanitarian assistance in Cyprus. His initial report, prepared after a visit to Cyprus from 22-27 August, included an assessment of the problem of displaced people. He estimated that a total of 223,600 people were in need on the island of whom 179,400 were displaced from their homes. Details will be found in United Nations Security Council document S/ 11488 of 4 September, 1974, which is available from the Parliamentary Library. </para>
          <para>It is a separate, and more difficult and time consuming task to locate, identify and list the displaced people. They have of course left their last known address, and each case must be traced individually. </para>
          <para>The International Committee of the Red Cross has established a Central Tracing Agency on Cyprus, with bureaus in various parts of the island, to trace displaced people. The Australian Red Cross has received 2,139 enquiries from the Cypriot community in Australia about the welfare of relatives. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government&#39;s consular officer on Cyprus is also tracing and checking the welfare of Australian citizens. </para>

            <item label="2.">
              <para>On 13 September, the Government of Cyprus imposed temporary restrictions aimed at preventing citizens of the Republic from leaving the island unless they secured an exit permit from the Ministry of the Interior. The permit is necessary for male citizens between the ages of IS and 60 and for females aged 1 5 to 55. Permits can be issued, however, to those who are normally resident overseas, holders of foreign passports, and those producing evidence of acceptance of their entry for permanent residence in a foreign country. </para>

            <para>Earlier this year, when I became aware of the allegations concerning insufficient quarantine procedures in force in Western Australia, I immediately ordered an investigation which was carried out by the First Assistant Director-General, Quarantine Division, Canberra, the Director of Health, New South Wales Division, and the Assistant Director-General of the Department&#39;s Policy Secretariat and Legislation Branch, Canberra. At the conclusion of their inquiry, during which they interviewed every person considered to be in a position to throw light on the allegations, they reported that there was no evidence to suggest that quarantine procedures were unsatisfactory. A copy of the report was tabled recently in the House of Representatives. In light of the findings and report of the committee I do not consider that an &#39;open inquiry &#39; is necessary. </para>

            <para>I am aware of reported statements by the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia concerning likely severe flooding along the River Murray. The potential flooding has been discussed between officers of the Australian and South Australian Treasuries. I understand that no requests for physical or financial assistance have been received from the State Authorities. However, the Australian Government stands ready to provide technical and financial assistance in the way usually followed when natural disasters occur. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para>I have now been advised by the Minister for Minerals and Energy that in addition to the recent release from defence stocks of 1 50,000 gallons of distillate in Cairns to assist with the sugar harvest, in a further effort to help primary producers, the Army has greatly curtailed an exercise it planned to conduct in Queensland thereby making additional fuel supplies available. </para>
          <para>The Minister also advises that his officers have emphasised to the oil companies the urgency of making supplies available to the grain industry in Queensland and it does appear that the companies are endeavouring to distribute supplies as equitably as possible. </para>
          <para>An additional factor which must improve the situation is that the Amoco refinery in Brisbane which earlier in September was not producing distillate due to a plant breakdown was able to resume full throughput for distillate on 18 September. Also, the Shell Company has been able to arrange, and obtain a permit for a foreign flag tanker to carry products to Townsville and Mackay. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>It should first be noted that the introduction of a capital gains tax was recommended by the Taxation Review Committee in its Preliminary Report which was released with the Budget documents and which is available to all interested members of the public from the Australian Government Publishing Service. </para>
            <para>Secondly, a supplementary statement was released with the 1974-75 Budget documents setting out in broad terms the framework of the proposed tax on capital gains. Copies are available on application to the Taxation Office. </para>
            <para>Thirdly, it may be worth mentioning that No. 10 in the series of Treasury Taxation Papers, the publication of which commenced some weeks ago, is devoted to the topic of Capital Gains Taxes. This paper, which comprises the views put to the Taxation Review Committee by the Treasury last year, is presently scheduled to appear in the latter half of November. </para>
            <para>As to the substance of the matter, the Australian taxation system is based primarily on the concept of the capacity of an individual to pay tax. Capital gains constitute an increase in ability to pay in somewhat the same way as increases in income in the form of wages, salaries, interest, dividends and rents. It has therefore been anomalous that income has borne full tax while capital gains have borne none. Further, some taxpayers have been able to manipulate their transactions so as to substitute capital gains for income and thereby avoid taxation. It is mainly for these reasons that the Australian Government has decided to introduce a tax on realised capital gains accruing after 1 7 September 1974. </para>
            <para>Because however of the great complexity of the measure, precise details of the proposed tax are unlikely to be available until the legislation is introduced in the autumn sittings of Parliament. </para>

            <para>Parliamentary salary is personal exertion income, and not subject to the proposed surcharge. If a member has other sources of income that, considered in isolation, would be personal exertion income, that income too would not attract the surcharge. If, however, he has property income such as rents or dividends, or interest that is not related to his personal exertion activities, such income will be subject to the surcharge. </para>
