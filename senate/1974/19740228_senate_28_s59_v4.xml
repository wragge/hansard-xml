      <para>Her Majesty was pleased to deliver the following speech: </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President</inline>members of the Senate. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>members of the House of Representatives. </para>
      <para>I am delighted to be in Australia again and to be taking part directly in the working processes of this Parliament. </para>
      <para>This is the second occasion on which 1 have addressed this Parliament and the first time with my new Royal Style and Titles to which I was pleased to give my assent last year. </para>
      <para>As you know, because of my constitutional duties which relate to the United Kingdom, I must, after opening our Parliament here today, return immediately to London. </para>
      <para>I very much regret that because of this I shall not be able to carry out my program in full, though it is my intention to return to Australia as soon as practicable and to visit Perth, Adelaide and Darwin. </para>
      <para>However, I am particularly pleased that by opening this Australian Parliament I am able to perform personally an important constitutional duty as Queen of Australia. </para>
      <para>This Parliament assembles at a time of deep concern on the part of my Government and the people of Australia at the loss of life and property in the recent floods in Queensland and New South Wales. </para>
      <para>My Government has already provided substantial assistance to those who have suffered grievously and it will continue to do so. </para>
      <para>It is reviewing the whole national approach to the handling of natural disasters. </para>
      <para>In this session my Government will continue with its policies of reform and innovation. It will use its constitutional powers resolutely to press its program to fulfilment. </para>
      <para>My Government believes the economy is basically strong and buoyant. Nevertheless, it regards inflation as a most urgent domestic problem and will continue its efforts to contain it. </para>
      <para>It believes the many anti-inflationary measures it has already taken are having an important restraining effect. </para>
      <para>My Government is committed to the greatest possible measure of Australian ownership of the nation&#39;s industries and resources. To this end it will proceed with its plans to expand the activities of the Australian Industry Development Corporation and to establish a National Investment Fund. The Companies (Foreign Take-overs) Act will be replaced. </para>
      <para>My Government will also introduce legislation to fulfil its constitutional responsibilities with respect to banking, insurance and financial corporations. The Financial Corporations Bill will be re-introduced. There will be legislation on new insurance companies and on the supervision of insurance brokers. </para>
      <para>Legislation will be submitted to Parliament to establish an export bank and to permit loans by the Commonwealth Development Bank for certain tourist development projects. </para>
      <para>Legislation will be introduced for a limited tax deductibility for home mortgage interest payments for home owners. </para>
      <para>The importance of the creation of a new Ministry of Minerals and Energy has been confirmed by the events of 1973 associated with the developing world energy crisis. </para>
      <para>Although Australia is in a more fortunate position than most comparable nations in this crisis, my Government will not be complacent in planning for the future energy needs of the Australian nation. It stands ready to join with other nations in search of solutions. </para>
      <para>Central to my Government&#39;s plans is the creation of a Petroleum and Minerals Authority by legislation which, while passed by the House of Representatives last year, had its passage interrupted by the adjournment of the Senate. </para>
      <para>The recently Pipeline Authority is closely cooperating with the companies concerned in the planned early development of natural gas discoveries on the North West Continental Shelf. The construction of the first sector of the national pipeline grid has begun. </para>
      <para>My Government is paying special attention to the development of the use of various forms of energy. </para>
      <para>A new road program which emphasises national responsibilities and priorities, including interstate highways and export roads, will be prepared. </para>

      <para>Legislation to provide financial assistance to Queensland for the Ross River Dam and to Western Australia for water supplies for the Gascoyne plantations and Carnarvon will be presented. </para>
      <para>My Government will introduce legislation, as required, on the recommendations of committees of inquiry on Land Tenure and the National Estate. </para>

It is intended that Aborigines be among those trained to care for the parks. </para>
      <para>My Government will again bring before the Parliament legislation to check the development of monopolies and restrictive trade practices which was first under notice by Governments as far back as 1960. </para>
      <para>The legislation will also provide for the protection of consumers from unfair trade practices. </para>
      <para>There will be legislation for the control of the Securities Industry and for a National Companies Act which will establish uniformity- a principle sought by earlier Governments since the late 1950s but acknowledged to be unattainable through separate Acts of the States. </para>
      <para>The strengthening of trade relations around the world will remain a major objective of my Government. </para>
      <para>Revised anti-dumping legislation and a new 5-year export incentive plan will be introduced. Legislation will be presented to revise arrangements for assistance to the shipbuilding industry. </para>

      <para>My Government will seek a timetable for independence for Papua New Guinea in consultation and agreement with the Papua New Guinea Government and subject to the endorsement of the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly. </para>
      <para>In its foreign relations my Government, whilst confirming the importance of historic associations with the Commonwealth of Nations and with the United States, will also pursue its firmly established and forward-looking policies which acknowledge the need for a new spirit of regional and international co-operation in an increasingly inter-dependent world. </para>
      <para>My Government believes it can make an important contribution to economic and social development and political co-operation in the Asian and Pacific region. It remains concerned that this region has no machinery for informal consultations comparable with the Commonwealth of Nations or with existing arrangements among the African States and the countries of the Americas. </para>
      <para>To advance those policies the Prime Minister has visited a significant number of Asian and Pacific countries with which Australia has formal relations. </para>

      <para>Legislation will be introduced to establish a uniform code of discipline and justice for the Defence forces. </para>

Other reports are expected at or before that time from the Independent Non-Parliamentary Inquiry into Repatriation, appointed in October 1971, from the Poverty Inquiry, appointed in August 1 972 and extended last year, and from the National Superannuation Committee of Inquiry appointed last March. Legislation resulting from the reports will follow. </para>
      <para>The Social Welfare Commission will develop the Australian Assistance Plan. </para>
      <para>In keeping with its constitutional responsibilities to provide hospital benefits and medical services, my Government is determined to act on a national basis to give all Australians access to high quality health care at reasonable cost. </para>

      <para>A Science Council is being planned. </para>
      <para>In accordance with its declared policy my Government will assume the constitutional responsibility for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders given to the national government by referendum in 1967. </para>
      <para>It intends to eliminate any remnants of discriminatory State legislation against Aborigines, a hope declared but unfulfilled by an earlier Government. </para>
      <para>My Government, on receipt of the report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission which is expected shortly, will legislate to give effect to its policy on granting land rights to Aborigines in the Northern Territory. </para>
      <para>Legislation will be introduced to create an Aboriginal Loans Commission. </para>
      <para>My government will introduce legislation to provide a simple, flexible form under which Aboriginal or Islander communities can incorporate for economic and social purposes. </para>

There have been consultations with the United Kingdom and my Government will proceed with its legislation to abolish appeals to the Privy Council. </para>
      <para>I inform honourable senators and members that I have decided not to refer to the Privy Council petitions addressed to me by the State of Queensland and the State of Tasmania concerning rights to the seabed. My Australian and United Kingdom Ministers were agreed that the </para>
      <para class="block">High Court of Australia is the appropriate tribunal to determine the issues raised in the petitions and, accordingly, that the petitions should not be referred to the Judicial Committee. </para>
      <para>My Government will propose the establishment of statutory bodies for the Australian Archives, for the Australia Council, for the National Gallery and for assistance to the film and television program industries. </para>
