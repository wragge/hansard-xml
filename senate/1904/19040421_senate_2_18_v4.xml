            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE</inline>(Western Australia). - There is a matter arising out of the present order of business on the paper which I should like to see rectified if possible. Owing to an adjournment of the Senate the order of private business has been disturbed, and with the consent of the Senate the motion which I had moved relative to old-age pensions, although it is an order of the day, is set down for a Thursday, when notices of motion have precedence of orders of the day. I desire this business to be set down, as was intended, for a Thursday when orders of the day take precedence of notices of motion. Although&#39; it was the first notice of motion from a private senator, still, so long as notices of motion are handed in it will be postponed until it goes off the paper altogether. The President has ruled that days when the Senate did not sit shall not be counted, and, therefore, to-day I cannot say on what Thursday orders of the day will have precedence. </para>

                                <para>- Perhaps I may explain this matter. I find that on Thursday, 3rd March, a sessional order was passed providing that, orders of the day (private business), should have precedence of notices of motion on alternate Thursdays. The business paper was accordingly arranged thus - </para>

                        <para class="block">but on the 17th March, on which day motions had precedence, the Senate, at the commencement of the proceedings, resolved to adjourn, at its rising that day, until the 13th April. I read the expression &#34;alternate Thursdays&#34; in the sessional order to mean &#34; alternate sitting Thursdays.&#34; Therefore, I directed the Clerk to place orders of the day first for the next sitting Thursday, namely, the 14th April, as will be seen by the business paper issued on the 18th March. I can easily understand honorable senators taking a different view, but that seemed to me to be the intention and wish of the Senate. According to the ordinary practice, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s-</inline> motion will be placed third, but if the Senate so desire, it will be placed first on the paper for next Thursday. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia). - As there is much uncertainty as to the time when the next parliamentary business will be transacted, what I would suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is that if the motion  of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> be carried, he can move to have, his notice of motion taken, when the business is definitely arranged, for a day when orders of the day will have precedence. Although to-day week is the next day for private business, it may not be the day on which the business will be taken, and in that case his notice of motion will again be put off. The better way would be for my honorable friend to assent to this formal motion, and next week, if the Senate is in a position to rearrange definitely its order of business, specific motions and orders can be dealt with. There can be no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> is pursuing the right course. Although, ordinarily speaking, the carrying of an amendment in a Government Bill in the other House - whatever the result 04 the vote may be - is not the cause of bringing about an adjournment of the Senate, and although the Senate has functions which are much greater than those of a Legislative Council, still we are only following the precedent which was set in 1901. We know that the amendment which has been moved in another place may have an effect which would be equivalent to a motion of censure. My honorable friend has not mentioned trie reason for this motion, but we all know what it is, and there can be no doubt that it is the constitutional parliamentary course to pursue. </para>

                            <para>-! understand you, sir, to have ruled that&#39; the expression &#34; alternate Thursdays &#34; means alternate silting days.- lt further means the days on which the Senate sits. If that is so, it would be unwise to make any alteration in the paper. An honorable senator is- entitled to the place he has obtained upon the paper, and the arrangement which the President has made seems to me to preserve to him all the rights and all the advantages he would have had. if the Senate had continued to sit regularly. I, therefore, submit that there should be no alteration of the order in which business appears on the paper, seeing that the alternation intended bv the Senate, in agreeing to the sessional order, to which reference has been made, is preserved by the action proposed to be taken by the President. </para>
