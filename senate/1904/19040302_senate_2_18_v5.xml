                        <para>- At that time I was allowed to say a few words, and I do not see why I should not do so now. It is uncommon for the House of Commons to refuse to re-elect a Speaker so long as he remains a member, unless there is very good reason for making a change'. I do not hesitate to say that in my opinion there is no good reason why the late President should not be re-elected. When we elected him to the office on a previous occasion, he had come into the Senate as a gentleman who had had great experience as President of the Legislative Council of South Australia. Many of us also had the privilege of knowing him as Chairman of the Federal Convention which sat in the years 1897 and 1898, and a better Chairman of Committees I do not believe there has been in the whole world. For these reasons I have pleasure in once more proposing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Richard</inline> Chaffey Baker as  President. </para>

The difficulties of the dual position which I am called upon to fill are very great) and I ask that allowances may be made for me. In the first place, I have to perform the ordinary duties of a President or a Speaker, and in the second place, under our Constitution, I have to give not a casting vote, but a deliberative vote when, as it sometimes happens, party feeling runs high. The difficulty of reconciling these dual positions is very great, and I hope that I shall have the co-operation of honorable senators in .performing my duties. I earnestly trust that in the discharge of the arduous task imposed upon me honorable senators will help me to see that the proceedings of the Senate are conducted in so decorous and so dignified a manner that the people not only of Australia but of other parts of the world will be able, to say that the Senate of Australia sets an example to. other deliberative bodies. </para>

                    (South Australia - Vice-President of the Executive Council). - I beg to congratulate you, sir, on being elected for the second time to the office of President of the Senate. I feel quite certain that honorable senators will support you in your endeavour to preserve order and decorum, and that their record for the next three years will be equally favourably spoken of as their record for the last three years. I beg to inform you, sir, that His Excellency the Governor-General will be pleased to receive you at 20 minutes past 4 o'clock this afternoon in the Library of the Parliament.

I can assure you that although I have been defeated I have no feeling in the matter, and I trust that our personal friendship will remain as it ever has been. One of my very best friends in the Senate considered it his duty to nominate you for the reelection, and there will be no bitterness between him and me, as I hope there will be none between you and me. I shall be very happy at all times, sir, to assist you in your efforts to insure the orderly and decorous transaction of business in the Senate.
