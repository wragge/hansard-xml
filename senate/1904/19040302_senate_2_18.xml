            <para>- At that time I was allowed to say a few words, and I do not see why I should not do so now. It is uncommon for the House of Commons to refuse to re-elect a  Speaker  so long as he remains a member, unless there is very good reason for making a change&#39;. I do not hesitate to say that in my opinion there is no good reason why the late  President  should not be re-elected. When we elected him to the office on a previous occasion, he had come into the Senate as a gentleman who had had great experience as  President  of the Legislative Council of South Australia. Many of us also had the privilege of knowing him as  Chairman  of the Federal Convention which sat in the years 1897 and 1898, and a better  Chairman  of Committees I do not believe there has been in the whole world. For these reasons I have pleasure  in once more proposing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Richard</inline> Chaffey Baker as  President. </para>

I earnestly trust that in the discharge of the arduous task imposed upon me honorable senators will help me to see that the proceedings of the Senate are conducted in so decorous and so dignified a manner that the people not only of Australia but of other parts of the world will be able, to say that the Senate of Australia sets an example to. other deliberative bodies. </para>

My advisers are pleased to note the cordiality with which these are generally regarded in this country, and are- confident that the feeling will be  strengthened when the statesman who is their author is able to visit us. </para>
