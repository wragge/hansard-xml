I do not know to what he is referring, unless it is the cabled report of the deputation which has just waited on the Prime Minister of England, suggesting an increased contribution from the Colonies towards the defence of the Empire. I do not know anything in regard to the supposed Conference, except that it was stated some time ago that if the English Government are successful at the next general elections, the question of holding an Imperial Conference will be considered. </para>

            <para>- It will still further limit the time at our disposal for the consideration of the Estimates, and, therefore, I distinctly object to it. I understand the motives which animate the Government in this matter. The discussion of the subject has been permitted in another place, and&#39; it is considered that an opportunity should be afforded for a similar discussion here. To debate the subject of preferential trade now, however, is a needless waste of time, because nothing definite can be done, while it will prevent the full consideration of more pressing matters. </para>

        <para class="block">I do not propose to ask honorable senators to pay a visit to cloudland to-day. I prefer to invite them to travel along pathways where at least a footing can be obtained, and along which, with experience and knowledge as guides, we may expect to make some progress. If I am asked whether I have faith in the future of our Empire, I reply in the affirmative, because I believe in our people and that their love of freedom is no passing impulse, but is instinctive and undying. In my judgment, no other Empire depends so much  for its safety and perpetuation upon theprinciples of freedom as does our own. I tremble to think what might happen if the British people, through following wrong counsel or indifference, adopted the ignoble course of penalizing the industries of other countries in order to secure greater rewards for themselves. I see the greatest dangers in the scheme now being brought forward, under which an attempt is being made to induce the people of Great Britain to penalize, more or less, the commerce of the whole world, apart from the British Empire. I admit at once that the term &#34; preferential trade &#34; is more pleasing to the ear than the term &#34; penalized .trade &#34; ; but when it is proposed to penalize more people and more trade than will be accorded a preference, it is more correct to apply the term &#34; penalized trade&#34; than the more pleasant sounding phrase. Are we to ask Great Britain to penalize the commodities of all countries outside the Empire .in order that the commodities of countries within the Empire may have a preference? Are we to deliberately ask the motherland to add to the burdens of her millions of people in order that we may be placed in a position of advantage? I wish to direct the attention of honorable senators to some of the factors, which, out of cloudland, must arrest attention, whilst we are endeavouring to decide whether in the years and centuries that are ahead of us the proposal to impose a penalty on one side and preference on the other rests on solid ground, and would be likely to add to the dignity, nobility, and power of the Empire. In- my judgment, the scheme of preferential trade which has been evolved is full of dangers and contradictions, and is not likely to be of any service to the Empire. In the brief time at my disposal, I shall not be able to elaborate my arguments as much as I should have desired, and, therefore, honorable senators will have to take a great deal for granted. I will ask honorable senators to think over a few matters which, in my judgment, point unerringly to the fact that the scheme which has been brought forward is neither safe nor wise. I should, in the first place, direct attention to that great country, India. The whole of _ the self-governing countries of the United Kingdom to-day- do not embrace as many as 60,000,000 of people, whereas India has a population of about 300,000,000. That vast Empire constitutes the greatest and most sacred trust that was ever reposed&#39; in any nation, and is one with which I believe the people of Great Britain will be slow to tamper. Not long after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> _bad expounded his policy upon the subject of preferential trade, the Governor-General of India was able to show conclusively that his scheme was not likely to add to the prosperity of India. He demonstrated, by means of statistics, that India carried on an immense trade with foreign countries, which purchased enormous quantities of its produce, and that any attempt on the part of Great Britain to aim a blow at other nations must rebound upon India. </para>

            <para>- I am sorry that I have not time to reply to interjections, and I trust that honorable senators will not consider that I am discourteous to them if I allow their remarks to pass without comment. That well-known Anglo-Indian, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Albert</inline> Edward Sassoon, in an article published in a London magazine, laid his finger upon the fact that neither at the Conference of Premiers which was held in 1902, nor at any other time since, had the position of India in regard to this subject been considered^ He very much deplored that that country, with its 300,000,000 inhabitants, should be neglected in this way. When I read his statement, I wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Albert</inline> Edward Sassoon pointing out that in Australia&#34; I had already emphasized the neglect which  was being evinced towards Indian affairs. In reply, I received a letter in which he stated that anything done &#39;in Australia which evinced a regard: for the people of India would be warmly welcomed. I think that the &#39;injury which would be done to India alone under any preference scheme is sufficient to stamp the whole of this policy as a dangerous one, and one which the people of England ought to cast upon one side. Then I invite the attention of honorable senators to another country - I refer to Japan. All I wish to point out in this connexion is that for a few years past Japan has been, and still is, the ally of Great Britain. Is Great Britain to penalize the trade of her ally? Then there is another country of immense interest to us - a country possessing a great history and a great past - I mean Egypt. Under British management,. Egypt is again rising to an important position in the world, and I wish to know how that country would fare under any scheme of preferential trade? I need scarcely point out that Egypt is not a British Possession, although it is under British control. Is Great Britain to penalize the products of that country? Then I come to the United States. I say that it is the dream, the -eager desire of the best hearts in English - speaking countries, that there should be a lasting and a complete alliance between the Anglo-Saxon countries all the world over. I wish to know if such an alliance would be assisted&#39; by .the adoption of a scheme on the part of Great Britain which would penalize the goods of America? In this connexion, it is very singular that some time ago the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> - which, as honorable senators know, is the chief press organ of this new policy - in an article upon the subject, declared that it would be statesmanship of the very highest order if America, being an Anglo-Saxon country, were included in the circle of preferences. That statement, to a very large extent, gave away the whole scheme, because the United Kingdom imports from the United States a very large proportion of her goods. Indeed, if the imports from the United States, and from British Colonies, be added together, they total one-half of the &#39; imports of Great Britain. If we add to that amount onefourth for the raw materials included in the other half which it is not proposed to tax, we see that, under the suggestion of the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> three-fourths of British imports would be actually free from all penalization. If 75 per cent, of British imports are to be thus admitted&#39;, why not go further and admit the whole 100 per cent., as at present&#34;? Then I would direct attention to the fact that there are a number of countries where the duties imposed upon British goods are exceedingly light - where, in fact, the Tariffs operating -are less severe than they are in some of the British Colonies. In this connexion, I may instance Denmark and Norway. The Tariffs of these countries are less antagonistic to British trade than is the Tariff of Canada. What position is Great Britain to take up in regard to these light Tariff countries? Is she, upon the plea of making a fight against certain high Tariff countries, to penalize other countries in which low Tariffs are operative and which subject her goods to lower duties than Chose which obtain in certain British communities to-day? As honorable senators are aware, Canada is the country which first adopted this system of preferential trade. Consequently, it would be well to inquire whether that policy has proved successful there. I notice that last week the commercial agent of that country in Melbourne delivered an address in which he stated that in the seven years since preference had been granted to the mother country the imports from Great Britain into Canada has increased by 100 per cent. I must say that whenever any person gets bewitched by that old hag who masquerades under a thick veil as Sweet Miss Preference his wits seem to go wool-gathering. We have &#39;had various illustrations of that. We know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> at a public meeting, actually assured his hearers that Great Britain paid foreign countries ^800,000,000 per annum, thus making an error of at least ^500,000,000. </para>

              <para>- He did. In addition to that we know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine,</inline> who has recently returned from a visit to the old country, stated in an address at Horsham that it was proposed that all the goods of Australia should obtain some benefit in the mother country. Although he has been at the head-quarters of this agitation, he is apparently oblivious of the fact that wool and raw materials generally are intended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> and others to be excluded from any scheme of preferential trade which may be adopted. He is also unmindful that if it were intended to include wool in the&#39; list of articles to which a preference should be granted, effect could not be given to the proposal, because the production of wool in Australia amounts to twice the consuming power of the whole of the British Empire. I find that the statement made by the Commercial Agent for Canada was quite true so far as it went, but that, in the absence of certain facts, it creates a wrong impression. It is certainly true that between the years 1897 and 11903 the imports into Canada from Great Britain increased by 100 per cent. ; but at the same time the imports into Canada from the United States of America increased by 121 per cent. In other words, the imports into Canada from the United States of America in 1903 amounted to 137,000,000 dollars, while those from Great Britain were of the value of only 58,000,000 dollars, although that was after the preferential Tariff had&#34; come into operation. </para>

              <para>- No. The woollen manufacturers of Canada asserted during the present year that they could not fight the British woollen manufacturers if they were allowed a protection of only 23J per cent. The Tariff was 35 per cent., but it was brought down to 23 J per cent, by the reduction granted to imports from Great Britain. The woollen manufacturers of Canada raised so keen an agitation that the Dominion Parliament has enacted this year that in future the woollen goods of Great Britain are not to be admitted under anything less than 30 per cent. duty. So that to-day, instead of enjoying an advantage of one-third over those of foreign manufacture, the British woollen goods imported into Canada have an advantage of only one-seventh - a preference which is altogether too trifling to be of any value. But the Canadians have done something more than that. The Parliament has enacted that from the beginning of next year no preference shall be allowed to British goods that do not enter Canada through a Canadian port. When we remember that various Canadian ports are blocked by ice for several months in the year we must recognise the importance of this decision. Goods intended for distribution in  Canada must be landed at the extreme end of Nova Scotia, at St. John,, and, carried long railway, journeys if they are to obtain any advantage under the preferential Tariff. If they are landed, at a United States port, and carried over the railways of that country into the interior of Canada, they will not receive any preference. It is obvious, therefore, that: I have been quite correct in asserting, from, the first, that no country which is. protectionist at heart will give way on the protective policy. Its people will talk of preference, but if they find that the policy of protection is being, undone in any way .by the policy of preference they will at once make a change. This is a very important matter for Aus-&#39; tralia to consider. I do not care what any Australians may suggest or offer to Great Britain, if they are convinced that the policy of protection is a right one, they will sweep aside the matter of preference..&#39; I come now to the position of New Zealand. Some twelve or eighteen months agothe Legislature of that Colony passed art Act by which a certain preference in respect to a limited number of articles wasgiven to Great Britain. But it is not merely a preferential measure; it is called a Preferential and Reciprocal Act. Under this Act New Zealand has power to make arrangements with any foreign country in a. similar direction. If a foreign country will admit her goods at a reduced duty, or duty free, New Zealand will on her part make concessions with regard to imports from that country. Honorable senators will see at once how this arrangement for reciprocal trade with foreign countries cuts away that made for preference with Great Britain. Some two or three years ago - just after the close of the war - the South African Customs Union was formed, under which a small preference, amounting, I think, to about <inline font-style="italic">2\</inline> per cent., was given to British commodities. That preference, however, does not cover a very large number of articles. There is one significant feature associated with the making of this arrangement. When the Bill to give effect to it was before the Legislative Council of Cape Colony, an amendment&#39; was moved, with a view to eliminating the preferential proposals, and inserting another set of a protective character. The voting on the amendment was equal, and the Government proposal was carried only by the casting vote of &#39;the  President.  That is a very significant fact. It conveys a warning lesson, which we ought to take to our. hearts; because, as I have already pointed out, in a country which is committed to, or believes in, protection, the policy of preference cannot stand if it be carried to a point which undoes in any way the former principle. If after the great strike in South Africa this matter had been left untouched, if parties had been left to settle it themselves, and to fight out the question alone - as I suppose they will some day - it would have been better and wiser, and more in accordance with the general policy of the Empire. I would draw attention to the fact that the rewards, if I&#34; may so call them, or the payments, under this scheme, would be very unequal. I have already pointed out that Australia would reap no benefit, so far as her main products are concerned, but Canada, being principally engaged in producing grain and meat, would be able to secure a substantial advantage. Australia and South Africa produce a great quantity of gold, which is practically a raw material in both countries, but no preference could be given to it, although it is an article of commerce, so far as South Africa and Australia are concerned. There is no way in which any advantage could accrue from a policy of preferential trade to .those engaged in the gold-mining industry. The Empire is very much greater than a number of people seem to imagine, and the list of articles which it produces in excess of its consuming power - and which cannot, therefore, obtain any advantage from a preferential policy - is also very large. We have, in addition to wool, tallow, hides, and skins, tin, and cheese, and already the imports of cheese from Canada have become so large that they practically meet nil the wants of the United Kingdom. Then we have jute, rice, tea, palm oil, cocoanut oil, ginger, rum, fish (such as salmon), gutta percha, pearl-shell, indigo, woods (such as mahogany and &#39;teak), seeds, and nuts, for expressing oil therefrom, dye woods, and various drugs; making, altogether, a very large list of articles which are produced in the Empire to such an extent that it would be impossible, by any legislative measure, imposing duties on the goods of foreign countries, to give those goods any advantage. Honorable senators must know very well&#39; that it is proposed in England, by the action of certain duties, to transfer to the Colonies certain trade which is now done with foreign countries. But if honorable senators have not been very fast asleep, they must also have noticed that it is distinctly stated in England that &#34;if we make this proposed agreement with the Colonies, we shall be able to use it as a lever with which we shall be able to force foreign countries to lower their Tariffs against our goods.&#34; Very well ; but what then becomes of the advantage to the Colonies? It is, at any rate, largely reduced. The policy which starts by giving Australia and other portions of the Empire advantages, is afterwards to be destroyed by using the arrangement so made to bring down foreign Tariffs. I should like to draw attention to another fact. When a new policy is proposed, no advocate of it endeavours to insert the thick end of the wedge. He begins with the thin end. That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> did in regard to duties on wheat. He talked about 3d. per bushel being sufficient to transfer from foreign countries to the Colonies, the great trade that is now done. But the eager spirits who are always to be found in agitations of this sort soon went far beyond <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain&#39;s</inline> proposals. In, I think, the <inline font-style="italic">Fortnightly Review,</inline> of last December, there was an article by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> H. Mallock, an English writer, in which he says that the lowest duty that should be imposed is 2 s. per bushel, 16s. a quarter. He goes further than that. He says that while 16s. a quarter should be levied on wheat from foreign countries, 14s. a quarter, or is. 9d. per bushel, should be levied on wheat from British communities ; leaving to the Colonies the advantage of 3d. per bushel, which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> originally proposed. This is the natural consequence of proposals such as those made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain.</inline> And if the advocates of this policy can have their way, we may be quite sure that sooner or later these small duties would give place to much greater ones, and that, under the influence of those greater duties, the large trade now done with the United Kingdom in many articles of food would gradually approach to the smaller dimensions which existed in bygone days, when prices, owing to duties, were much higher than they are to-day. It is also worth while to remember that under a preferential scheme there would be large numbers of articles which would be excluded from the action of preference for financial reasons. </para>

          <para class="block">Thus, Canada does not give preference to all British goods on which she imposes a duty. She excludes a large number of articles. And if we were making any arrangement with Canada, she would exclude from any preference such articles as Australian brandy, wines, and so on. I should like honorable senators to notice the first report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain&#39;s</inline> Commission. That Commission, after sitting a considerable time, issued its first report in July last. This report spoke about the development of colonial markets. The Commission also proposed that there should be a maximum Tariff with comparatively high duties subject to reduction by negotiation; again confirming what I have already pointed out that it is intended by the people who are advocating this new policy in England that the Colonies should be used as a lever to work arrangements with other countries. There is, I am sorry to say, a distinct tendency in the old country under the influence of this new policy to deny to Australia and other parts of the Empire their full, independence. One writer - I think it was in the <inline font-style="italic">National Review</inline> - spoke of the market which existed owing to British energy and heroism. He also spoke of how foreigners were ousting Great Britain from her own markets, evidently following up the old idea which prevailed in England years ago that colonial markets exist for the exploitation of British merchants. I want f res-trade; I want British merchants and all merchants to have access to our markets. But I do not want that under any arrangement but a full free-trade policy. , I ask honorable senators not to shut their eyes to the fact that if a policy such as this can be inaugurated, there is a party in England that will try to use it for ends of t&#39;heir own. Indeed this policy seems to me to unsettle people&#39;s minds, and they lose sight of what is due from one to another. Even .in the other House we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> who is, I believe, a constitutional authority, concluding a series of motions by proposing that that House shall give the Government the authority to enter into negotiations with the United Kingdom for doing certain things.  His  motion, if carried, cannot possibly have any effect, because it ignores the Senate. This sort of thing is continually growing. When people take up a policy such as this, they lose sight of the rights of other people. </para>

              <para>- Another point in connexion with these proposals, I think, must be obvious to honorable senators. There is in this policy nothing which can fully satisfy either the free-trader or the protectionist, but it must make of this old matter more of a battle-ground than ever, and must leave uncertainty and quarrelling everywhere. There is another phase of the question to which I wish to direct very special attention. The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> that duties shall be imposed on breadstuffs, has raised a very strong feeling in England, and the belief that men in the British Colonies are indifferent to the cost of living in the United Kingdom has created a very painful impression. There have been numerous cables sent out to Australia, and numerous representations have been made as to the feeling in Great Britain on this subject. I have myself had many evidences of this. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> in a very useful letter in the press, only a few. days ago, stated, as the result of his own experience in England, that it was a fact that there was a very strong feeling arising against the Colonies on account of their callousness. Within the walls of this building, and within the past fortnight, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Caldwell,</inline> a member of the British House of Commons, told me of the things that had been said in Great Britain, which I should not like to repeat in this Chamber. Honorable senators may be assured that there is a very strong and a very painful feeling growing in the old country with regard to the callousness of the people of Australia and Canada, that, living under the protection of the flag, to support which they contribute but little, they should at the same time be willing to&#39; foster a policy which would add to the cost of living of every family in Great Britain. </para>

              <para>- As I have already said, I regret that the time at my disposal does not permit me to deal with interjections, or I should very gladly do so, and honorable senators would find t&#39;hat their interjections, instead of upsetting my argument, would support it. There is one matter to which I should like to direct the attention, especially of honorable senators who have strong feelings with regard to Asiatics and coloured races generally. I feel, that, although they express the opinions which they do, and desire the legislation for which they ask with regard to coloured races and Australia, they have no desire to create antagonism towards Great Britain. But I should like them all to consider whether there is not in this subject of preference possible grounds of disagreement within the Empire. Where the subject of preference as between white people and the coloured people of the Empire is considered I am quite certain that this question must arise. I am satisfied that in the Senate there are some honorable senators who would not as readily give a trade preference to the people of India as they would to the people of Canada. That is not a subject which I should like to see brought forward, and the discussion of such a matter could not possibly tend to strengthen the Empire. I desire to refer to the position of Australia in regard to our own commerce, and also in regard to the commerce of the United Kingdom, in order to show who are buying and consuming our goods, and whose goods we in Australia are consuming. As honorable senators know, the exports from Australia go very largely to&#39; the United Kingdom, in order to find a market., and I have taken the trouble to ascertain what proportion is re-exported to foreign countries. When I add to that proportion the quantity which foreign countries take direct from Australia; I ascertain the consumption of Australian goods by foreigners. Of course, the quantity which is reexported from the United Kingdom I deduct from {he quantity shipped from here to Great Britain, and, having done that, I find that in the year 1901 foreign countries consumed ^17,000.000 worth of Australian merchandise, while Great Britain consumed 11 &#34;9 million pounds worth. Those figures must, I think, be almost startling to many people. They mean that foreign  countries at the present time are consuming one-half  more  of Australian products than are being consumed by Great Britain. I now refer to our importations of goods, and I find that a quantity of Australian importations from Great Britain are not of British manufacture, but include goods which have been sent to Great Britain from foreign countries for shipment to Australia. From the British returns I ascertain the quantity of goods sent from the United Kingdom to Australia which were foreign, and I deduct it from the imports from Great Britain, and add it to those which appear in our figures as imports from foreign countries. I thus ascertain how much we consume of British goods, and how much of foreign goods ; and taking the same year, 1901, I find that the consumption of British goods was 22&#39;4 million pounds worth, and of foreign is&#34;2 million pounds worth. That is truly a marvellous position. While foreign countries consume nearly half as much more of Australian goods than does the United Kingdom, Australia consumes 50 per cent, more of British goods than of foreign goods. </para>

              <para>- If any one may grumble at the position, surely it is not the people of Great Britain, or the people of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has just interjected that we shall consume more in proportion of foreign goods each year, and I have no doubt that will prove to be the case. But if we cannot find a market in Great Britain for our goods, what are. we to do? Are we to burn our goods? Or are we to send them to markets where they can be sold ? The truth is, that Australian trade is &#34;on velvet.&#34; We have in the United Kingdom a huge free market for all our products, and, strange to say, so far as regards those products which the United Kingdom cannot wholly consume, the great protectionist countries of Europe become free-trade, and admit them. Could any position be more satisfactory to us? Should we not be foolish to urge on the Home Government any scheme likely to lessen the advantages which we now possess? I ask honorable senators to consider how small is the area of goods actually imported now from foreign countries, against which we could differentiate. We receive from foreign countries millions of pounds worth which the United Kingdom I  cannot possibly sell to us, because they are not produced there. Included in those goods are kerosene and tobacco, of which we import large quantities, wines, coffee, and certain raw materials which we need for our manufactures, special machinery and tools, and specialities of climate, of art, and of manufacture. These total a very large proportion of the goods imported into Australia, and when all are eliminated from the list of imports, there remains only a small proportion. Looking at the matter all round, so far as Australia is concerned, our great pastoral products have nothing to gain by an arrangement such as is proposed. And the gain to agricultural and dairying products would be one liable, at any time a drought arose, to come to an end, and any gain must be accompanied by an increase in the cost of living to every household in Australia. I should now like to say a few words with regard to the position of the United Kingdom. Of recent years, attempts have been made to show that Great Britain is receding from her foremost position in the world. But such statements are not supported by fact. The census of 1901 showed that in no previous years of her history had there been as great an increase in population in the United Kingdom, and that not for a long time had there been so little tendency to emigration. It is also clear that the wealth of Great Britain has increased enormously. People do not pay income tax on incomes they do not receive, and the returns show that the income of Great Britain has increased immensely. So far as concerns those who do not pay income tax, the consumption of articles of food and of luxury shows such an increase as to evidence a marvellous buying power on the part of the masses of the community. </para>

              <para>- It appears to me that the very success of British commerce has led people astray. Every year Great Britain is getting more and more goods - tens of millions of pounds worth of goods - for nothing, except mere interest receipts. Perhaps ^100,000,000 worth of goods is poured every vear into Great Britain for which she has to pay nothing, except interest receipts. They represent her investments. I think that all honorable senators can see that if she had to part with ^100,000,000 worth of goods in exchange for ;&#163;i 00,000,000 worth of imports she  would be so much the poorer, that her posi- &#39; tion could not be as great as it is to-day. Let me give a simple illustration. Suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> are each employed at a salary of ,&#163;250 a year and live in two houses, which adjoin, and which belong to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones.</inline> If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> has to pay an annual rent of ^50 to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones,</inline> eliminating the matter of rent, the former has .&#163;200 a year, while the latter has ^300 a year. As the rental of ,&#163;50 comes in every year from one house to the other it might be said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> is getting poorer, because all this money is going to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones.</inline> With equal justice, it might be said that Great Britain is getting poorer because of all this wealth which is pouring into her. That is a homely explanation of the mistake which is being made by a great many persons in the old country. An incomplete grasp of statistics is misleading. What has Australia to offer to the world? Australia has nothing to offer but merchandise, while Great Britain can and Hoes offer to the world merchandise in the first place, services of ships in the second place, and the use of capital in the third place. As the United Kingdom is making money out of the world under all those three headings, we ought to add the three together in order to find out her earnings compared with those of countries which come only under the one head of merchandise. If we do this we find that the earnings of Great Britain are immensely greater, and have increased far more than appear from a mere glance at her Customs returns. With regard to statements which are made by preferentialists at home as to the superior value of trade with the Colonies and with India, I have already indicated what that is largely due to. I have pointed out that foreign countries are taking, relatively with the United Kingdom, enormous quantities of Indian and colonial produce, but the foreign countries have to pay for these products, and they pay Great Britain for them either in money or in goods, and she is able thereby to send to the Colonies the large quantity of goods which she does. That is the secret of it.. We see some goods coming here from Great Britain. The reason why large quantities of goods can come to us from the ol&#39;d country is simply that foreign countries are taking an enormous quantity of our goods, which the United Kingdom cannot possibly consume, and in doing so they provide funds in London which pay for the goods we receive. I believe that there are persons in Australia, and I am not sure that there are not persons even in this Senate, who have the audacity to say that we free-traders are not as solicitous about the welfare and greatness of the United Kingdom as- they are. But verv little consideration will show the folly of all those statements. I believe I may claim to have done more, single-handed, to promote the commerce of the United Kingdom than all the preferentialists in Australia put together. Nay, I shall go further than that. I shall say that any free-trader who, outside legislative circles, has by his vote done what he could to promote the cause of free-trade has done more than all the protectionist preferentialists of Australia have done &#34; in the past, and are doing at the present time, to promote the prosperity of Great Britain. I should like to draw attention to some views I expressed as -far back as the eighties, and recent utterances, showing how 1 have worked for, and done my best to promote, the interests of the United Kingdom. I propose to read a letter which I received in 1S87 from 1 he Right  Hon.  W. B. Dalley, of New South Wales, the first Australian gentleman upon whom the honor of a seat on the Privy Council was conferred. I had written to the right honorable and learned gentleman pressing him to deliver a public address on the commercial relations of Australia and the mother country. Unfortunately, owing to illness, he was&#39; not able to do SO j but he wrote me the following letter, which is well worthy of a place in the records of the Senate - </para>

            <para>You have suggested in your note (so admirably conceived and so felicitously expressed) the precise grounds which I should have thought would have commended the cause to all lovers of the Empire. All who are desirous of discussing a great subject, not as one to be treated in warehouses and exchanges, but in the Parliamentary Chambers, cannot fail to perceive how intimately are blended the preservation of the freedom of our commerce, and the perpetuation of our Empire. In the absence of this great thought, and in the forgetfulness of the duties which it involves, there is much to be said on the side of those to whom you are opposed, and against  whom  you are fighting with singular gallantry. But nothing can be said to qualify the statement that a fettered trade is a defective, loyalty to the Empire, which has based its policy upon absolute freedom, and which is rebuked, and to some extent, enfeebled before the world when that policy is practically protested against by any portion of the Empire. </para>

The resolutions which I have moved I commend to the careful consideration of the Senate, and I ask honorable senators to join with me in declaring tha&#39;t our love for, and our faith in, those sea-girt isles which we call the motherland, are associated with the belief that the foundations of her Empire rest on the eternal principles of freedom, and that, so long as she is true to those principles, she can face the future with a stout heart and a smiling face. If here, in this remote part of the Empire, we can do anything to strengthen her resolve to hold high .the flag of freedom, we may well be content, and fully satisfied that we have done what was best, not only for humanity in general, but for the home of our race, and that galaxy of countries which, taken together, constitute the British Empire. </para>

            <para>- When the debate was adjourned on Friday, I was referring to the fact that the movement for the subsidy in connexion with the service to the New Hebrides was a movement, mainly on the part of some interested persons in Sydney. It might be convenient if I here quoted a clause from the contract with reference to the provision for termination to show that honorable senators may, if they so desire, refuse this proposed subsidy at any time. At page 11. of the return supplied on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> on the 22nd July, 1902, this proviso for the termination of the contract, in the event of the subsidy not being available, will be found in the agreement of 22nd September, 1900 -  _ Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore mentioned the Governor may terminate the contract by notice in writing under his hand to be served as aforesaid in the event of Parliament declining or failing to vote the necessary moneys for the service, and the Contractors shall have no right of action for breach of contract or otherwise in respect of the premises. Provided that if such notice shall be given during the currency of one of the trips hereinbefore mentioned, such notice shall not take effect until the completion of such trip ; and, notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained, the contractors shall only be entitled to be paid for the service up to the time such notice shall take effect. </para>

          <para class="block">The inclusion of such a clause in the contract indicates, to  my  mind, that the New South Wales Government on 28th September, 1900, had some doubts as to whether they could get Parliament to continue to vote this subsidy to Burns, Philp, and Company. </para>

              <para>- Quite so; they might have wished to leave it open to the Federal Parliament. But honorable senators will agree that they may, with a perfectly free and open mind, decline to vote this subsidy, because there is no obligation on the Commonwealth Parliament to continue it. I was saying that this was a movement on the part of interested persons in Sydney. We can have no legitimate grounds for objection to the action of those interested persons. They are entitled to do their level best to get the subsidy if they can, and if the members of the Federal Parliament are foolish enough to vote it. But it is the duty of the members of this Parliament, and especially of the members of the Senate, since the Senate is the guardian of the interests of the States as a whole, to see that Commonwealth money shall not be wasted or spent in an irregular or unjustifiable manner. The Sydney people are entitled to get all they can. </para>

              <para>- Rockhampton may be nearer than is Brisbane, but I am not aware of that. A glance at the map will show that Brisbane is hundreds of miles nearer to the New Hebrides than is Sydney. If what we require is a speedy mail service, one would think that the Government would select the point of departure nearest to the New Hebrides. But no, t&#39;hey have selected Sydney. Sydney is the starting point for all these services to the New Hebrides, to New Guinea, and to the Solomon Islands. 1 may mention, incidentally, that the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce has asked that tenders should be called for these services.

              <para>- It appears that fivesixths of the passengers who go to New Guinea desire to go direct to Samarai from Cooktown. They prefer to make that journey, a distance of some 426 miles, rather than go round by Thursday Island, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Port Moresby, to Samarai, a distance of 957 miles, and a voyage occupying three weeks to perform. The voyage from Cooktown across to Samarai, the route most patronized, occupies but five days. Our business-like Government, with its keen PostmasterGeneral, in order to establish a speedy mail service to these islands, selects a route which it will take three weeks to traverse, when he might have selected the route from Cooktown to Samarai, which could be traversed in five days. There would be a great deal of delay caused by the adoption of the proposal of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, because they desire to call at a number of minor stations, in order, no doubt, to supply their depots with the goods which they sell as general merchants. One of the objectionable features of this proposal is the effect it will have on other companies. Honorable senators will be aware of the practice amongst business people, including shipping companies, of trying to run competing firms off the ground, and if Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, by receiving a subsidy for this service, are enabled to quote lower freights for goods and passengers, they may be able to run Messrs. Chinn and Sons off the route. I ask is that fair? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> on Friday last, questioned the land settlement proposal of the agreement with Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, and indicated that the Government were not taking any responsibility in that matter. &#39; It appears to me that that is one of the worst features of the proposed scheme. If honorable senators will look at the Appropriation Bill they will see a sum of ^6,000 set down for the present. New Hebrides service, and another sum of ^6,000, making the total proposed subsidy ;&#163;i 2,000. When this agreement was entered into on 12 th March, 1902, it contained this clause: - </para>

              <para>- The remarks were made during the first long session, but they were to the effect that I have indicated. From June, 1902, to December, 1904, is a period of over two years, and, surely, we ought to know from the Commonwealth Government what settlement has taken place. I have asked questions in the Senate, but the Attorney-General has, I suppose, been informed by the officials in the Department that&#39; the information cannot be given. At any rate, such obstacles have been placed in the way that the AttorneyGeneral has intimated&#39; that if I want the information I ought to table a motion  for a return. On the 4th March, 1902, Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company wrote from Sydney to the Secretary of External Affairs as follows: - </para>

          <para>It will be observed that the great anxiety of the company was that the Government should enter into this arrangement before the matter got cold; while the agitation was warm and ardent, the company thought it necessary to have the agreement signed. It will be noticed that intending settlers had to show to the satisfaction of the Federal Government that they were possessed of&#163;1 for every acre of land taken up, and that the allotments were to be from 50 acres up to 500 acres. Are the Federal Government justified, in the present unsettled condition of the continent of Australia, in encouraging men who have from&#163;50 to &#163;500 to leave these shores ? Evidently the Government thought it was their duty to do so, because on the 6th March, 1902, they sent the following letter to Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company :  - </para>

              <para>- I desire to know what has become of the first batch of settlers who went to the New Hebrides. Is it a fact that certain of them were diverted on their way to other occupations, and that some, who arrived at the New Hebrides, thought the prospect so vile, that they left ? On those points I have been unableto get any information. I was led to ask the question by reading in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 30th July, 1902, an article by the Rev. A. Stewart, M.A., of Essendon, on &#34;Australians in the New Hebrides.&#34; That gentleman went to the New Hebrides, and wrote a most interesting account of his visit.

Twenty  had  been selected from hundreds of applicants. Seventeen actually started from Sydney ; three were diverted to other employment by the way ; three returned dissatisfied with their explorations and the outlook ; the remaining eleven are now settled on the southern coast of Santo, which is the largest and most northerly of all the islands. </para>

The Attorney-General, as I have already mentioned, said that this would be most fittingly the subject of a return to be called for on a motion. In the records of the Federal Parliament and Government, there must surely be some information as to how their grand scheme of colonization in the Pacific is getting along. I venture to think that the scheme is a failure, and that that failure is another reason why we should not pay this additional sum of <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;B,</inline> 000 to Messrs.

              <para>- I mean to say that we desire to keep Australia for what we understand to be the white races- - descendants of the British and European races, such as the German, French, and others. We have passed the Pacific Island Labourers Act, under which no Pacific islanders can be brought into Australia after the 31st March, 1904, and the Federal Government may deport any Pacific islander found in Australia after 1906. I have never heard any one, excepting, perhaps, a few senators and a few members of the House of Representatives, who hold views favoured by Senators Pulsford and Dobson, express any disagreement with our endeavours to attain a White Australia. All others have said that this is a very good ideal. Both the Pacific Island Labourers Act. and the Immigration Restriction Act were passed by large majorities. Does the leader of the Senate not see a paradox in taxing the white settlers of Australia - whom we expect to employ white labour - to provide Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company with a subsidy of ^12,000, in order that other white settlers may be taken to the New Hebrides, where they will have to employ black labour? </para>

              <para>- No; but if Australia is not good enough- for Australian settlers, let them go to the New Hebrides at their own expense. The proposal is that we should send away from Australia some of our most thrifty and energetic settlers, men who have worked hard, and acquired from .&#163;50 to ,&#163;500. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> knows, in Queensland millions of acres of land are crying out for settlers of that description. In order to prove that intending Australian settlers would have to employ coloured labour, I propose to quote a letter which was sent by Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company to the Secretary for External Affairs on the nth March, 1902. It was written on the day before the contract was signed, and reads &#39;as follows : - </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Another important question, and vitally affecting the success of the venture, is that of the restrictions upon the obtaining of coloured labour. For the clearing and planting of this land each settler will require from half-a-dozen up to twenty natives. Under the present system, it will be impossible for them to obtain them except by illegal recruiting. We would suggest that a similar custom to that obtaining in British New Guinea be authorized, namely, that every settler be permitted to engage his own labour from adjoining islands, provided he registers them on the first opportunity afterwards before the captain of a British man-of-war, or, when appointed, the British Resident. The mission influence in the islands is sufficiently wide-reaching to insure any abuses being promptly reported to the authorities, and unless something is done to enable the settlers to obtain the necessary labour, it is hard to see how they are to make any progress wil&#39;h the building up of their plantations. </para>

          <para class="block">I object to the taxation of any settler in Queensland, or, indeed, in any other part of the Commonwealth, in order to enable some other settler, who thinks he can do better in the New Hebrides to go down there, and employ black labour. The next proposal, which must inevitably follow such a course - indeed, it has already been made - is that the products of the settlers in the New Hebrides and other places, shall be admitted to the Commonwealth at a&#39; lower rate of duty than the products of other parts of the world. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline> said that certain French companies received subsidies for running the boats and also for colonizing the New Hebrides, and he mentioned the firm of Ballande and Company. A member of the firm says he is somewhat astonished that such a statement should be made in the Parliament, of what he describes, rightly, I think, as a great country, without proof being advanced. It has also been stated that Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company have lost &#163;16,000 during the year by this service, for which we pay now &#163;6,000. While such a statement may be very useful in inducing members of Parliament to vote a subsidy, it is not a very great tribute to the business-like capacity of the members of the firm. I do not suppose for a moment that keen business men like  Colonel Burns  and his colleagues are likely to indulge in such an enterprise as would lead to the loss of so many . thousands of pounds. The Australian Joint Stock Company&#39;s Year Book gives this information about the firm at page 104 : - </para>

              <para>- I understood that the honorable senator did know something about the matter; I should like to have further proof. If the service means a loss of anything like &#163;16,000 a year to the firm, is not that an additional reason why the Commonwealth should cease to pay away money for such a service? I think it is. I am. very much1 opposed, as I have frequently said, to taking Australian settlers down to the New Hebrides. I object very strongly to the Federal Government taking any part in any scheme which is likely to mislead settlers or is calculated at a, future date to land the Federal Government in. some financial responsibility. Any settler&#39; who leaves Australia to take part in this colonizing scheme would certainly be influenced to do so by the knowledge that the Federal Government had a clause in their mail contract providing that Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company should do certain things in regard to the land. We are informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> that there are many claimants to the land in the group. </para>

              <para>- The point is that the British Government, who have appointed a Resident in the New Hebrides, and who will agree to the appointment of a new Land Commission, will probably give that Commission the same instructions as they gave for dealing with other lands in Fiji.

          <para class="block">I am anxious to show that we should cease at once to have anything to do with this scheme of Burns, Philp, and Company to transfer titles to the citizens of the New Hebrides. The Commonwealth Government will be committing itself irrevocably, and may finally have to do as the British Government did - pay a considerable amount in compensation. In adopting this agreement, which has now been in force for two or three years, and which I consider should be put an end to, we are taking up an attitude which is totally opposed ,to the attitude which the Commonwealth Parliament has outlined with respect to British New Guinea. We have declared that the lands of the Possession shall not be sold, but may be leased at a proper rental. The same principle has been adopted in the British Fijis. The British Government cannot get a piece of land in Fiji without renting it from the natives. They have recognised the rights of the natives. But we are proposing to help Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company to take away from the natives their land for all time. That is contrary to the principle laid down by the Federal Parliament, and is opposed to the wishes of the people of the Commonwealth. I will now come to the question of whether we should interfere with the New Hebridean islands. Honorable senators will have noticed that the Government said, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> that they would cable to the Imperial authorities the fact that information was at hand that certain people in the New Hebrides were applying for the annexation of the islands by France. </para>

              <para>- I argue that this subsidy cannot be justified as a mail subsidy. The Vice-President of the Executive Council admits that. He contends that it is not really a mail subsidy, but a subsidy for the encouragement of commerce, and for patriotic purposes with a view to our getting hold of the New Hebrides. I want to show that it is the desire of a number of the British settlers to be left alone, and that they do not wish to be annexed by the Commonwealth of Australia. </para>

The idea seems to be that Australia is not large enough for our present settlers - that we have settled all our lands in Queensland and the other States, and that we need to send men down to the New Hebrides, and to give them free passages, ,to induce them to settle there. In order to give them free passages, we are to pay to Burns, Philp, and Company &#163;12,000 a year. We ought to let these people alone. If trade with the islands comes to us naturally, let it come. It may possibly happen in time that the New Hebrides and New Caledonia will become Australian. But I do not think .that that will be so for many hundreds of years. The French have been down in New Caledonia ever since 24th September, 1853, when the place was annexed under instructions from Napoleon III. Having been there for fifty years, they have had the same experience as Australia has had. Australia was first a convict settlement. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps I have been  a little too discursive, though I do not think so. But I will bow to your ruling and come to another point. I think that the Government are to be condemned - perhaps not this Government so much as other Governments who have been longer in power. The Barton and Deakin Administrations had office successively up to the commencement of this year. There was a great deal of time in which to get information. But there is no more information to be gained with regard to this mail subsidy now than there was when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> told us two years ago that he did not expect much opposition to the proposal, and had not got all the details at hand. Knowing that this proposal was to be made, the Government ought to have had statistical records available, so as to give information to Parliament. But it is impossible to get it. When one asks for information he is told to move for a return, which will probably be forthcoming some time in the following year. I notice that the Prime Minister has said that the Government only need  , &#163;3,000  for this extra subsidy this year. The Government do their business in such a loose and haphazard way that they place upon the Estimates a sum of &#163;12,000 when it appears that they require only  &#163;9,000.  Six months of the present financial year having elapsed, if Parliament is unwise enough to grant this subsidy theGovernment will use only  &#163;3,000  of the extra amount. That is not a businesslike way to proceed. In the first place the proposal is a travesty, so far as a mail service goes ; and if the Senate intends to vote the money they should grant only onehalf of the extra amount askedfor by the Government. In other words, the sum ought to be reduced by  &#163;3,000.  I can see that some honorable senators are carried away by their ideas of patriotism, and their exaggerated notions of Empire. Consequently, in all probability this subsidy will be voted. But I shall not rest content until the Commonwealth Parliament declines to vote the money any longer, because I regard it in the first place as a breach of the Constitution, and in the second place as a great waste of money. </para>

              <para>- I withdraw that suggestion, but this firm is so large, has so many agencies, and is so overpowering in its majesty, so to speak, that some honorable senators do not appear to think that there are any other ship-owners in the Commonwealth. I am thinking of the smaller people, such as Messrs. Kerr Brothers,  who have sent a letter to the Prime Minister objecting to the granting of this subsidy unless tenders are called. I desire to know from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> the VicePresident of the Executive Council, and an exPostmasterGeneral, whether the contract which was signed in 1902 was carried out by Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company? In that contract it is stated that the <inline font-style="italic">Ysabel</inline> is the steamer to be employed in the service. I wish to know from the exPostmasterGeneral what the <inline font-style="italic">Ysabel</inline> was doing at the Marshall Islands? I find that she made several trips to those islands although they ,are not mentioned in the contract signed in 1902. She was to call at the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, but there is no mention of any trip to the Marshall Islands, which is some 500 miles away from the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. Does it not seem extraordinary to honorable senators that we should be paying, Burns, Philp, and Company a subsidy to conduct a mail service, and should allow them to send their boats 500 miles away from the Gilbert and Ellice Islands to the Marshall Islands? Were they looking for letters or for copra? I venture to think that the main business of these boats is trade with the islands. They carry goods for Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, who are not only shippers, but traders, to the islands and bring back the copra produced by the natives. I do not think that is fair to the general trader, who sends his goods down to the islands ; nor do I think it is fair to the small ship-owners trading to the islands, that we should pay this subsidy. I hope, when, the time comes, that the Senate will request the House of Representatives to eliminate the vote from the schedule. </para>

              <para>- What happened was this - The Attorney-General, instead of replying on the various questions which had been raised on the first reading of the Bill, craved leave to do so on the second reading. Leave was given, but I said I could not prevent any other honorable senators also referring to those questions. Subject to that, the ordinary rule applies. </para>

I fear, however, with regard to the revenue that if &#39;something is not done very shortly, we shall find that the bonuses which we shall have to- pay in connexion with the sugar industry will necessitate further taxation in another form. </para>

              <para>- There must, it seems to me, be a great loss of revenue ; for, as the growth of sugar by white labour proceeds, it is quite evident that our income must fall off. The nett revenue from excise will become less and less, and I therefore fear that it will become necessary to impose other taxation to take its place. </para>

              <para>- I shall leave that subject alone, but probably I know as much about it as does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> With regard to naval defence, I understand that the &#163;200,000 which we pay annually to the British Government does not appear in the Estimates, but it will probably not be wrong for me to make some allusion to the subject. I think we shall require to face the necessity for some provision for gunboats of our own to protect our harbors. I shall therefore not be surprised if next year we find the Defence Estimates considerably increased. At page 32 of the Estimates I find some allusion to the expenditure in connexion with the selection of the Capital Site. I see that for the year ending 30th June next the sum of &#163;3,500 is put down. Some of that money has already been expended. We know that the New South Wales Government is at the present time considering the matter of granting a choice of various sites. Personally I am glad to see that they do not exclude Dalgety as one of those to be considered ; but it is quite evident that there will be a difference of opinion between the Federal Parliament and the New South Wales State Parliament with regard to the area of land to be granted or purchased. </para>

              <para>- I think we have every reason to thank the Victorian Government for the excellent accommodation they have provided for us here. I do not expect to be nearly as comfortable at Dalgety, if I should happen to be a member of the Federal Parliament when it sits there. At the same time, there is a good deal to be said in favour of- conducting our business in our own premises. I feel some hesitation in making any reference to the mattei to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has referred. I think I shall say nothing about it, but if it should come to a division I shall abstain from voting, as I have the honour to be a director of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, and I am not ashamed of it. </para>

              <para>- Honorable senators may call the firm &#34;The Octopus,&#34; but I daresay that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> wishes he had some shares in &#34; The Octopus.&#34; When Federation was inaugurated we were all in hope that the Federal Parliament would not require to sit so long as we have been doing. This year, we shall have sat between nine and ten months. I hope we shall in future be content with a session of four or five months in each year. I hope that next year the Government will take over the Quarantine, Meteorological and Statistical Departments, and I, for one, shall not object to the expense so involved. With regard to our mail arrangements with the mother country, I am one of those who exceedingly regret that we are no longer to have a regular weekly service. It seems to me that we have acted in a somewhat short-sighted manner. I have always disapproved of what is called the &#34; White Ocean &#34; policy. I fail to see why we could not have given a contract to companies employing coloured labour in the stoke-holds of their steamers. We are now apparently going to pay poundage to many companies who will be employing black labour in the same way. I shall not further detain the Senate except to say that I hope that at no distant date our very good friend <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner will be restored to good health. I have exceedingly regretted to hear of his present state of ill -health. </para>

            <para>- I did not propose to address any remarks to the Senate on the second reading of this Bill, because I understood that - the Government were exceedingly anxious to get it into Committee. When I find that a Government supporter does not fall in with that idea, I may be excused if I follow his example. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has, I believe, been considered a great financial authority in the Commonwealth. The honorable senator travelled pretty well all over the Commonwealth to explain the financial effect of Federation to the people of the States, but he has made an awful financial blunder in the few remarks which he has just addressed to the Senate. He allowed it to be inferred that he is opposed to any further bonus being, granted to the sugar industry. I venture to say that the honorable senator would not be game to mount a public platform in his own State and say so . straight out. </para>

I point out that with .the exception of the manufacture of spirits or narcotics the manufacture of sugar is the only industry in the Commonwealth on the products of which any excise whatever is levied. The bonus paid is merely a return of a portion of the excise to those who grow sugar by white labour.

              <para>- And so am I. But if the Act expires without an amendment, sugar, no matter how produced, will be protected to the extent of  &#163;6  per ton, and no excise will be collected. People will have the right to grow sugar by whatever labour they may find to be available, and the product will be pro-  tected. I do not think that any honorable senator desires such a state of things; and I hope the seriousness of the position will receive the prompt acknowledgment of the Government when we meet next session. The present conditions are undoubtedly blocking all enterprise and expansion. </para>

              <para>- I shall not discuss that Bill beyond saying that however my vote may go, it cannot be secured by any system of bargaining. I should now like to refer to the letting of the mail contract to Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company without any tenders being called for. If any subsidy is justifiable, it should be for a contract which will give the very best service; and, as a matter of fact, the service which Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company offer is not nearly the best which could be secured. I have in my possession a map issued by Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company, and from this it may be seen at a glance that if we desire a direct and fast mail service to any of the places named, some other port than that of Sydney must be marie the point of departure and return; it is all a question of distance. In giving a subsidy for a mail service, the main reason which should animate us is to obtain a fast, direct and cheap service. What right have the Government to say that the mails shall be carried from the more distant pott rather than from a port nearer to the proposed destination? We have here not only a subsidy given to a company without any tendering, but also a subsidy to Sydney at the expense of other ports nearer to the islands. The map, to which I have referred, shows that the direct route from Australia to the New Hebrides is undoubtedly from either Brisbane or Rockhampton, with both of which places there is direct express railway communication with all other parts of the Commonwealth. I cannot see how, in the face of. these facts, the Government are justified in letting a contract under which the mails shall be conveyed from Sydney. We have been told that the reason is that certain reefs in the Pacific block the way. But a glance at the map shows nothing between Brisbane or Rockhampton and the islands, but a straight ocean track, over which ani vessel may travel in safety. The Constitution provides that the Commonwealth shall not discriminate, or give one State a preference over another ; and it is difficult to see how, in face of that provision, the present subsidy is justified. As to New Guinea, the service proposed is from Thursday Island, right round to Daru Island, Port Moresby, Samarai, and Woodlark Island. As the mail will have to go through Cooktown, this means 960 miles of route, whereas from Cooktown to Samarai is only, in round numbers, some 400 miles. We are thus proposing to subsidize a company to go a circuitous route, which will delay the arrival of the mails twice as long as is necessary. The people of New Guinea wanted as fast a service as possible; but the proposed arrangement will enable Burns, Philp, and Company to serve all their little trading stations at different points on the New Guinea coast and other islands. This  subsidy will, further, enable Burns, Philp, and Company to freeze out all other traders, none of whom will be able to get a subsidy. There is only a certain amount of trade to be done, and, of course, Burns, Philp, and Company want as much of that trade as possible ; and by means of this subsidy they will ultimately be giver* the advantage of the monopoly. If it were desirable to subsidize this service, why were not tenders called ? Why is one firm singled out for specially favorable treatment? <inline font-style="italic">We</inline> have been told .that there are no other firms competent to carry out the contract. That is not so; there are other firms competent, and even if there were not at the present moment, they could very soon make themselves competent by &#39;acquiring the necessary^ vessels. So far as New Guinea is concerned, Messrs. Chinn and Sons have a far better vessel than Burns, Philp, and Company ever had, and I do not see why these local traders should not have a fair show. The same remark may be made in regard ,to Messrs. Kerr Bros., of Sydney, who were prepared to tender for the New Hebrides service. It is contrary to all constitutional practice to give a contract of the kind without calling for tenders. There has been a great deal of log-rolling in connexion with this particular matter. The head of the firm, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burns,</inline> was actually in Parliament House log-rolling, and he issued an invitation indirectly to members of the Senate to meet him andi discuss the matter.. </para>

              <para>- I feel in no way sore, but merely give the incident as an illustration of the methods pursued by the firm to accomplish their political ends. As a resident of Cairns for a very long time, I have a particular acquaintance with the methods pursued by the firm at that place. I know how they try to stall off opposition, and break down the small competing traders ; but, to show how far the firm will carry their political spite, I may say that during the three years before I entered Parliament I was running a newspaper business in Cairns, and that, because I did not agree with the firm politically, they absolutely refused to allow the firms for which they acted as agents, and which had previously advertised with me, to continue their advertisements, although the firms lost a considerable amount as the result. For <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> information, I may say that Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company were agents for the Australasian United S.team Navigation Company, and althoughthat company Had advertised in this newspaper for a long time, their advertisements were withdrawn directly I had political difference with the firm. I may safely say, however, that the Australasian United Steam Navigation Company, like the others, thereby lost a considerable amount of money. As I said, however, I do not feel sore on account of the paltry little bit of business that was thus lost to me. But let us look at the matter from the point of view of other traders. When a small mail service, which costs &#163;70 or &#163;80 a year is required, tenders are called for By the Government. I have in my mind a service in Queensland, which costs &#163;75 a year, and for this tenders are called, and a deposit has to be lodged before the contract can be secured. Why should Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company not be subject to similar conditions? I have here a letter from Messrs. Kerr Brothers, of Sydney, dated March, 1904, addressed to the Minister of External Affairs, as follows :  - </para>

            <para>That seems a more equitable way of meeting the case than collecting duty on produce (maize, bananas), and paying it away in the form of a subsidy to a trading company. Practically, all supplies, both&#39; British and French, are drawn from Australia ; but when produce is sent to pay for these goods a duty is levied on it. With regard to the mail service, we would suggest that you call tenders for a direct mail service, monthly, if possible, to say, four principal ports in the New Hebrides, but restrict such service to carrying mails, passengers, and freight - a service like that carried on to the Eastern Pacific by the Union Steam-ship Company of New Zealand - no trading done. For the inter-island mail service to connect, a small subsidy would suffice, but you could hardly restrict trading in this case, unless you paid sufficient just to keep a vessel running on mail service alone, as there would be little assistance&#39; in the way of freight and! passengers. However, by &#39;calling tenders you would make it as equitable as possible. In conclusion, we may state that we have been connected with trade in these islands for many years, and know the conditions there as well as any one. </para>

              <para>- No; but it is not unusual for firms to enter into contracts for performing, services before they have the means at their command for carrying them out. We have no right to assume that a reputable firm, if given a contract for this mail service, would not properly and faithfully carry out its conditions. At any rate, we can secure ourselves in the event of a failure on their part. I fail to see why Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company should be given a contract over the heads of many shipping firms who might have competed for it against them, unless some overwhelmingly good reasons can be shown for the course which the Government has pursued. I shall enter another protest at a later stage against the State I represent being, overlooked to the benefit of Sydney, as it has been in this mail contract service. If a group of islands, considerably nearer to Melbourne than to Sydney, were connected by a direct mail service, for which a large subsidy was paid, with Sydney rather than with Melbourne, would there not be a loud outcry from one end of Victoria to the other at such palpable injustice? We, in Queensland, are in a similar position. A subsidy is given ostensibly as a mail subsidy, tout mainly as a trading subsidy between Sydney and the New Hebrides, and although the ports of Rockhampton and Brisbane, which are connected by a direct mail service with all other parts of Australia, are considerably nearer to the New Hebrides, and are in the direct route, with no barriersor obstacles in the way, yetwe find that they are passed over in the interests of Sydney. The Constitution is directed against any discrimination being shown. It is no part of the duty of the Commonwealth to indulge in any discrimination of that kind. As we are sent here particularly to represent and safeguard&#39; the interests of the States, I take it that it will be the duty of Queensland&#39;s representatives, or, at any rate, of such of them as are free to do so, to oppose to their very utmost this very inequitable proceeding. </para>

            <para>- I rise to move requests for a reduction in the salaries of the  President  and  Chairman  of Committees. I am sure that honorable senators will acquit me of any personal motive in taking this course. I have the greatest respect for the ability and impartiality of these two officers, but my opinion has always been that they have received allowances far in excess of what they should get. The  President  gets an official salary of &#163;1,100, in addition to his parliamentary allowance of &#163;400, while the  Chairman  gets an official salary of &#163;500, in addition to his parliamentary allowance of &#163;400. Now, as economy is our watchword, we have here a most excellent opportunity of making a beginning. If we can get the salary of the  President  re- , duced from &#163;1,100 to &#163;600, and the salary of the  Chairman  reduced from &#163;500 to &#163;350, they will receive &#163;1,000 and &#163;750 respectively. One thousand pounds a year is, I submit, ample remuneration for the  President.  It is as much as is paid in any State Legislature, and. in my opinion, it is more than the services rendered to the Commonwealth merit. </para>

              <para>- It was proposed that the  President  should get an official salary of &#163;1,500 a year in addition to the parliamentary allowance of &#163;400, but the Parliament decided that the total remuneration of the  President  should be &#163;1,500, and that the  Chairman  of Committees should receive, in all;, &#163;900. That is all I intend to say on that question. It may not be out of place for me to express my appreciation - and I think it will be shared by honorable senators - of the manner in which the  Chairman  has presided over our deliberations in Committee, and discharged the duties of his high office. </para>

I think that reductions ought to be made in the salaries of the  President  and the  Chairman  of Committees. In several of the States, I know of men who have had to discharge duties involving much greater anxiety and worry than are entailed in the duties of the two officers mentioned - men who have occupied positions as Ministers of the Crown, and who have worked hard by day, sometimes far into the night - and I am obliged to add occasionally even on Sundays-for very much smaller salaries than these. Some such gentlemen have been paid at the rate of &#163;750 a year. </para>

            <para>- While my votes in the Senate have always been recorded in the direction of economy, I do not consider that the great State which sends me here expects that the  President  of this august body shall receive asmaller remuneration than that which is paid by New South Wales to the  Speaker  of the Legislative Assembly. There the salary paid is &#163;1,500 a year. The inordinate length of our sessions, during which the  President  is compelled to be in attendance at all hours, is in itself an ample justification for the salary paid. Let us take the past two sessions. With the exception of a couple of months for the purpose of holding the last general election, this Senate has been sitting practically ever since the beginning of May last year. I do not consider that we can possibly hope to have as  President  of the Senate a gentleman possessing the large constitutional attainment&#39;s and the great experience that our  President  possesses if we cut down the salary in the manner proposed. We cannot expect the  President  of the Senate to give up the time our sittings necessitate, and to abandon practically all personal exertion in other directions, if the emolument is to be reduced. There has been no demand from any part of the Commonwealth for such a reduction. I shall feel it to be my duty, and I believe that I shall be acting in accordance with the wishes of those who sent me here, to oppose the proposed request. </para>

              <para>- We can all resign if we like ; but we do not. The amount of salary was, I consider, .&#39;a bargain made for the time being with the gentlemen who hold the positions. I would point out that the  Speaker  of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria receives &#163;1,000 per annum, and the  Chairman  of Committees receives &#163;640, including all payments. The  President  of the Legislative Council receives &#163;750, and the  Chairman  of Committers of that House &#163;400 a year. But the curious anomaly, when we contrast the salaries paid by the Federal Parliament with the salaries paid in the State Parliament, is that whilst the  Clerk  of the Parliaments for all Australia receives &#163;900 a year, the  Clerk  of the Parliaments in Victoria receives &#163;1,200 a year, and has about half the amount of work to do. So that we can hardly find a guide in Victorian rates of payment. If the salaries of the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives and the  President  of the Senate are to be fixed at Victorian rates we should act upon the same principle in regard to the  Clerk  of the Parliaments, and should increase <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackmore&#39;s</inline> salary by &#163;300 a year. In view of the fact that many members of the Federal Parliament declare that &#163;400 a year is an insufficient salary, and that they would vote for its increase, it is a little bit inconsistent for us to say that&#34; the salaries of our chief officers are too high. My principal point, however, is that a bargain was made with them, and that we ought not to break it. I hope that the Committee will not interfere with those payments. Let us go on as at present until the time comes when we have to elect a new  President  and another  Chairman  of&#39; Committees. Then will be the time to make substantial reductions in both salaries. </para>

            <para>- There is no possibility of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> standing alone if he calls for a division, because at least one other honorable senator has notified his intention to vote for the motion, and I also shall be very pleased indeed to do the same. I say at once that I shall do so without any feeling against either the  President  or the  Chairman  of Committees. I think that if you, sir, were to examine your ideas as to my motives, you would acquit me at once of having any personal feeling against yourself. We hear a great deal of talk about the poorer classes of the people, and about the necessity for exercising the most stringent economy. There are many honorable senators who will vote for the retention of these salaries ; but who will- go outside and say on various platforms that the expenditure of the Federal Parliament is too high. When we come down to bed-rock, and they are asked to support their declarations by .their votes, they will not do it. The Attorney-General tells us that the time for a reduction is inopportune. That is always the argument when any economy, or any reform is proposed. We are then told &#34; some other time, and some other circumstances will be more appropriate, but we cannot do it now.&#34; I have seen various attempts to reduce salaries and exactly the same argument has been trotted out. Then we are told that it will be <inline font-style="italic">infra dig.</inline> for this Parliament to reduce the salaries of its chief officers at the present time. If, however, we wait until the offices become vacant, we shall be told that we ought not to reduce the salaries, because that will be attempting to bind a future Parliament. We shall be powerless to effect any reduction. In looking over. the list of salaries paid, I am struck by the remarkable disproportion of the emoluments to services&#39; rendered. There seems to be a huge disproportion between the salaries received by some officers wh&#39;en the value of their services is taken into account. One man&#39;s salary is set down at .&#163;1,500, and another&#39;s at &#163;400, although the services of the latter are just as much at the disposal of the country, and just as valuable as are those of the former. I hope that a sufficient number of honorable senators will prove their earnestness by voting so as to show to the people outside that some of us are sincere in our desire to effect, economies. </para>

            <para>- I have travelled in many parts of Australia, and I have come through more than one general election, but I have never heard a single individual complain about the allowances made to the  President  and the  Chairman  of Committees of the Senate, nor about similar salaries paid in the House of Representatives. Many members of this Parliament have stated publicly that their allowances are scarcely sufficient. I hold that opinion, and am prepared to advance it again. I hope that the day will never arrive in Australia when the allowances paid to the  President  and the  Chairman  will be reduced. We have passed through the most critical period of the Commonwea1th, so far as its finances are concerned. We have reason to hope that the population will increase, and that our prosperity will be greater in proportion to the increase. If we have been able to afford these salaries in the past, and the people have not grumbled at them, we shall be in a better position to afford them in the future. I cannot see any object in a motion of this description, unless <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is having a little diversion at the expense of the  President  and the  Chairman.  Perhaps there may be an inclination to amuse ourselves because business is not so pressing as it might be. We have wasted the morning, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> may imagine that we may as well waste the afternoon. If that is his opinion, we may as well know it. As for his standing alone, I am only sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> have decided to vote with him. To impute motives to them would be improper. Of course, they have no wrong motive for what they are doing. Their term of office is not about to expire, so that they cannot be aiming at a little cheap popularity. If they were senators who would have to face the electors at the next elections, I might say that they were taking this action with a view to their being returned again. But as I cannot attribute that motive to them, I can only assume that they are&#34; amusing themselves and the rest of us. I hope that only the economic trinity will be found voting for the reduction when the division takes place. </para>

            <para>- I trust that this motion will not be carried. Few honorable senators can have any idea of the amount of business which the  President  and the  Chairman  of Committees have to do. I consider that the proposed economies will be in the wrong direc tion. Honorable senators opposite were some time ago strong supporters of the proposal to establish a High Court. A very large sum of money was voted for that purpose, and though I tried&#39; to stave off the question for some time, until the Commonwealth could better afford the expenditure, 1 got no support whatever from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> and other honorable senators opposite. The honorable senator now proposes to cut down the salaries of officers of Parliament on what appear .to me to be quite insufficient grounds. If we are to have officials of this Parliament, they should be properly paid. </para>

              <para>- That is the salary which has been paid up to the present time, and there are enormous perquisites in addition. I think it is wrong to attempt to belittle the Federal Parliament in this way. If we cannot afford to pay our  President  and  Chairman  of Committees a fair salary, we should shut up this Chamber. If honorable senators really desire to economize, let them cut down their speeches. The cost of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> would pay the salaries of the  President  and  Chairman  of Committees twice over. </para>

              <para>- I may tell my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that I intend to try a division. But before we come to a division, I should like to point out the position at present existing in Queensland. We have six or seven Ministers of the Crown there, who are paid ,&#163;750 per annum each. No man can fairly coinpare the work of a Minister of the Crown in charge of a great Department in a State with that either of the  President  or the  Chairman  of Committees of the Senate. Yet in the one case we have the  President  receiving &#163;1,500 - twice as much as is paid to a State Minister in Queensland, and in the other case the  Chairman  of Committees receiving &#163;900 a year, or &#163;150 more than is paid to the Minister in charge of a great Department in Queensland. One of these Queensland Ministers has said that it is simply scandalous that we should pay such salaries to our officers in the Federal Parliament. I agree with him, and repeat that it is scandalous. We are paying far more than the services rendered are worth. Honorable senators appear to me to be extremely modest. Where is the honorable senator, with one exception- and that exception is probably myself - who is not as well qualified to hold the position of  President  cr  Chairman  of Committees of the Senate is are the honorable senators now holding those positions? I ask that question without in the slightest degree under-estimating the capacity of those honorable gentlemen. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal,</inline> I am sure, would be prepared to fill the position of  &#39;President  for nothing, and I am equally sure we could get <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .</inline> Fraser to act as  Chairman  of Committees of the Senate at the same figure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has suggested that I am having a little game with the Senate, and am merely amusing myself. I do not come here to amuse myself, the members of the Senate,, or my constituents. I come here to do sound business. I would ask honorable senators before coming to a vote on this subject to consider what it is they are paying the extra &#163;1,100 a year to the  President  for. I ask them to compare the two positions, the position of an honorable senator chosen by the electors of his State to represent them in the Senate of the Commonwealth, and the position of the  President  of the Senate, chosen by its members, to act as  Chairman  of the Senate. Which of the two positions is the more important ? </para>

I do not exactly know the meaning of &#34; august,&#34; as used in 13 e this connexion, but probably it is like the word &#34; Mesopotamia,&#34; very comforting to some people. I, therefore, take the liberty of using it, and I say that of the two positions it appears to me that the position of a member of the Senate representing the people of a State isthe more important. I need only refer honorable senators to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> who comes into this Chamber like a flaring comet with a tail of 194,000 or1 98,000 votes behind him.

              <para>- Honorary. Well,  no; not honorary, . but mainly of an honorary character, for the reason that a large proportion of the members of the Senate are honorable gentlemen who have had previous parliamentary experience, and who are, therefore, amenable to the Standing Orders. Another reason is that we are all, I think, respectable, peaceable persons, who conduct our debates with decorum. That being the case, I think the duties of  President  and  Chairman  of Committees of the Senate are of an eminently easy character, and that in paying them &#163;1,100 a year and &#163;500 a year respectively, we are paying just a little too much for our whistle.

            <para>- I am very glad to hear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> proposes to put this question to a vote. I hope that there will be no reduction moved which will not be carried to a division. IfI move any reduction on the Estimates, I shall divide the Committee on my proposal. &#39; I shall not move a reduction for fun, and if one thinks that a vote is extravagant he should be prepared to take the opinion of the Committee on the matter. I shall vote against the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> though I am under the impression that the salaries paid to the  President  and  Chairman  of Committees of the Senate should represent the total remuneration received by those officers. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is prepared to submit a motion next year, or to introduce a Bill to provide that the salary set down in the Estimates for the  President  and  Chairman  of Committees shall be inclusive of . their allowance as members of the Senate, I shall be prepared to vote with him. We have been invited to consider the salaries paid by the States Parliaments, and we have been told that Ministers in Queensland are opposed to the large salaries which are voted here. On the authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> we are told that one Queensland Minister has stated that the salaries being paid here to officials are scandalous. It should not be forgotten that the salary of the  Speaker  of the Queensland Legislative Assembly was &#163;1,000 a year, and it was only under a special Retrenchment Act that the salaries of Queensland Ministers, the  Speaker,  and members of the Legislative Assembly in that State were reduced. But for the necessity for special retrenchment forced upon the Queensland Parliament, through the exigencies of the State Treasury, those salaries would not have been reduced. </para>

              <para>- I should like to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that in all probability theQueensland Minister who made the statement to which he has referred takes exception to the salary which is being paid to honorable senators at the present time, because it is higher than that paid to members of the Legislative Assembly in Queensland. I am perfectly satisfied that the same honorable gentleman takes an equally determined stand in objection to the allowances made to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and other honorable senators. When I was before the electors last year, I had not previously been a member of the Senate, and I toldthem, when the question of salaries came up, that, while I had no experience on the subject, I believed that the salary attached to the position was not too high. I have since had some experience of it, and I am satisfied now that it is not too high. I am one of those who would be prepared to vote for an increase of that salary. I should like to know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and other honorable senators who are crying out for economy, are not prepared to vote, as I am, for an increase of their own salaries, although they are content to exercise economy by reducing the salaries of members of the Senate who have been chosen to occupy responsible positions? That is the position I take up, and I think it fair to view the matter from that standpoint. </para>

            <para>- I can explain the reason for the difference. When the first Estimates were submitted to the Parliament, the Treasurer, being a Victorian ex-Treasurer, based them very much on those of the Victorian Parliament. In Victoria, the Housekeeper of the Legislative Assembly had a very much larger salary than had the Housekeeper of the Legislative Council, but the Joint Committee of the Federal Parliament decided that this anomaly should cease, and that both housekeepers should be similarly paid. It was agreed, however, that the salaries should not be made equal all at once, but that the salary of the Housekeeper of the Senate should be gradually increased ; and hence the difference. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps I may supplement what the  President  has been good enough to say. The Housekeeper in the House of Representatives received his increase in salary by a special Order in Council, under which he was appointed, and he will reach his maximum salary when he receives &#163;250. This is an exceptional increase. </para>

              <para>- That is a very cheap sort of sentiment to utter. Honorable senators know perfectly well that if a motion for an increase of honorable senators&#39; salaries was brought forward this afternoon, I should vote for it. And I should do so for exactly the same reason that I support a reduction in the salaries of the  President,  the  Chairman  of Committees, and other officials, namely, to make the salaries commensurate with the services. I do not care about entering into personal particulars; but, in my opinion, honorable senators are the worst paid officials in the Commonwealth. There is not an honorable senator, with, perhaps one or two exceptions, who is not compelled to disburse a very considerable sum in order to get returned. When he becomes a member of this Chamber, he has to contribute in various directions so as to keep the good-will of his constituents ; and after his period of office expires, if he wishes to come back, he has to spend further sums. In addition to all this, if he does his duty as the Commonwealth expects him to do, he has to spend largely in travelling up and down his constituency during the recess. </para>

              <para>- That is so, in order that he may be able to assist in legislating for the Commonwealth. When we compare the position of honorable senators with the position of the officials, who are tied down to one particular spot, and have none of the expenses to which I have referred, we can only come to the conclusion that we are underpaid. That opinion I have always expressed, and I believe that senators are underpaid very largely because a considerable number of the officials are overpaid. There is not sufficient money to pay every one an extravagant salary, and, that being the case, some one is bound to suffer. I am trying to be guided by the principles of equity. The labourer is worthy of his hire, in whatever capacity he is placed. Comparing our salaries with those paid in other States, they are too high. Of course, we need not trouble about Victoria, where they have been in the habit of paying high officials very lavishly, and of sweating their minor officials. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator is here so seldom that he does not know what takes place. Is he aware that one Victorian senator advanced as a reason why high salaries should be paid that &#163;1,200 a year was paid to the  Clerk  of the Victorian Parliaments. I consider that these salaries are extravagant, and I propose to test the feeling of the Committee, but if I should be defeated I shall come to the conclusion that my brand of economy is not appreciated, and I shall not call for another division. </para>

          <para class="block">My object in moving this request is to enforce the understanding that the officers of the Senate should receive the same rate of salary as the officers of another place doing corresponding work. I know it will be argued that the other House sits longer than we do, but it must be remembered that it has more officers, and that the work is shared among them. If this increase be allowed to the Housekeeper on the other side, we shall be asked next year to increase the salary of the corresponding officer on this side. I do not propose to speak any longer, because it is not a very important point, but I hold that the salaries of corresponding officers in the Houses should be kept at the same amount. </para>

              <para>- I expect that the other House would take the same attitude as the Senate did last year and the year before, when it resented very strongly any interference by the other House with the remuneration which had been recommended for its officers. The other House has said that a salary of &#163;245 is what ought to be paid to this officer, and if we were to send down this request I should be very much surprised if they did not take the same attitude as we should justly take if an attempt were made to interfere with the salary recommended for an officer of the Senate. </para>

              <para>- We cannot propose an increase to our Housekeeper. Not only has this &#163;245 been declared by the other House to be adequate for this servant, but the increase of&#163;10 is an automatic one under the contract under which he was appointed. By making this reduction we should be repudiating the bargain made with the officer, which I may say involves a further increase of &#163;5 next year, when he will have got to the maximum to which he is entitled. </para>

              <para>- If there is an over-riding reason for retrenchment all round, for what has been very properly called, and what is in certain cases, repudiation, it is all right; but I do not think that we should single out an officer who accepted his appointment on certain terms which are set forth in an Order in Council. The other House has carried out the bargain by voting an increase of &#163;10 this year. It would justly feel, I think, that we were going out of our way if we were to ask for a reduction of the salary by that sum. Next year the salary of the Housekeeper for the Senate can be considered with a view to putting his office, if necessary, on the same footing as the other. I sympathize with my honorable friend in regard to our officer. I do not wish to discuss the point as to the number of officers on each side, but I do hold to some extent the view which Senators Stewart, Givens, and Mulcahy have given utterance to, namely, that in some respects the Senate does not require the same amount of service. </para>

              <para>- In some respects I think we are overmanned. But I would rather not discuss that at all. Personally, if the matter depended upon me alone, I should be glad to make an increase in the salary of this officer. But we are not voting money out of our individual pockets. We are acting as trustees for the public taxpayer. I am one of those who think that the dignity of the Senate is not to be maintained by any rivalry as to the maintenance of the expenditure for this Chamber on the same level as that for the House of Representatives. It is not worthy of the Senate to claim that our officers should necessarily be paid on the same scale as the officers of the other Souse. If that attitude is to be taken up, I may point out that there are other lines to which the House of Representatives might take exception. I find, for instance, &#39; that the travelling expenses in connexion with the Senate are set down at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6o,</inline> as against an appropriation of ,&#163;50 last year, and an expenditure of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;60;</inline> whereas the travelling expenses for the House of Representatives are only &#163;25. If we were to insist upon absolute equality, the other House might object to that. I wish it to be understood that my sympathies are entirely with the particular officer concerned. I think he is an excellent officer. But if we send down a request of this character, we shall lay ourselves open to the imputation that we are interfering with a matter with which we have no direct concern. </para>

            <para>- I regret these discussions on the Estimates in connexion with individual salaries. They have led to allegations that our officers are overpaid. Those statements may be correct, but, if so, it is not appropriate that we should discuss them in connexion with a measure like this. If it is generally considered that our expenditure is too extravagant, the whole subject should be reviewed at a time and under conditions when it can be completely and thoroughly discussed. To discuss individual salaries on the Estimates never leads to anything except loss of time. If an injustice is being done to the taxpayer, as would be the case if our salaries were too high, the proper way to remedy it would be for notice to be given that a particular item was going to be challenged, so that we might discuss it with all the information before us, and arrive at a satisfactory determination. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is an old parliamentarian, and his experience will teach him that motions of this character on the Estimates never lead to anything, except, perhaps, that occasionally the attention of the Government is directed to an anomaly that may subsequently be&#34; removed. I do not say for a moment that I agree that our officers are too highly paid, but I admit that it is an important question, well worthy of discussion. I urge, however, that it is not competent for us to discuss that question completely and satisfactorily at the present moment. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGREGOR</inline>(South Australia). - I do not think that the honorable senator who brought this matter under the notice of the Committee really desires that the salary referred to should be reduced. But the point is that an officer of equal standing, and even longer service, on the Senate side of the building, is not being similarly treated. The Joint House Committee arranged that the salaries of the two housekeepers should be on the same footing. But we find that the salary on one side of the building has been increased by &#163;10 after that decision was arrived at. It is therefore urged that the officer occupying a similar position on the Senate side should be placed upon an equal footing. </para>

              <para>- I understand that, but the increase does not carr)&#39; out the understanding that was arrived at some time ago. I am not arguing with respect to principle, but as to the facts. When we find that there is a violation of an understanding of this sort, this is the proper place to allude to it. The AttorneyGeneral has said that the Senate requires less attendance than does the House of Representatives, but he ought to know that we! have fewer attendants on this side. There is no more proper occasion for ventilating such a matter than when the Appropriation Bill is before us. The honorable senator who called attention to the matter did so with a view to prevent an injustice being done, and with the hope, I suppose, that some remedy would be effected on a future occasion. </para>

This officer, in this capacity, is subject to all the  complaints which people might make who get something which disagrees with them in the refreshment rooms. If they suffer from indigestion they are apt to visit it upon the Controller. The honorable senator will agree that it is better that we should vote the remuneration in this way as an allowance of &#163;50, which might be varied in different years, rather than vote a fixed salary for an office of this description, as we are all aware how efficient this officer is in the discharge of his duties, and the advantage which his supervision secures for the Parliament in respect of the services mentioned, and the expenditure in connexion with the refreshment rooms. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> will not consider it necessary to press his amendment. </para>

            <para>- If the honorable senator feels offended, I apologize, because I admit that the bust does not do his manly beauty justice. I cannot compliment the . person who had the selection of this bust, and who paid for it. It is so very little like Lord Hopetoun that I should not have it as a gift. It might represent almost any man cleanly shaved. I do not know whether we are committed to this expenditure, but if we have got this bust on the time-payment principle, I should recommend that it would be better we should cease the payments and allow the owner of the bust to seize it, and take it home again. </para>

          <para>- This Department spends annually a considerable sum of money, and we ought to have a report of the business done so that we may be in a position to judge whether it is worth the expenditure. I hope the Government will take a note, and see that honorable senators are provided with official informa tion on the point next session. </para>

            <para>- I desire to call attention to what appears to me to be a somewhat curious state of affairs in connexion with the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act. I have not gone into the matter exhaustively, but I have stumbled on one case which leads me to suspect that the administration is becoming somewhat lax. Some time ago a man named Fatta Mahommed deserted from the Peninsular and&#39; Oriental steamer <inline font-style="italic">Egypt,</inline> at Sydney, and, in consequence, the captain was fined &#163;15 under the Immigration Restriction Act. On behalf of the Peninsular and OrientalCompany, a warrant&#39; was issued, charging this man with desertion, and he was arrested in Gippsland, where, I believe, he was found working on a farm. When the case came on for hearing in Melbourne, a telegram was produced from the Inspector-General of Police stating that the Peninsular and Oriental Company declined to take any action, as the desertion could not be proved. That is the first curious point in connexion with the business. It has been proved that the man deserted in Sydney, the captain having been fined &#163;15, because he had allowed this man to go ashore; but the charge of desertion was abandoned, as I have indicated. But the funny part of the business has to come. The matter was reported to the Department of External Affairs by an officer of the Victorian , Police Force, who asked whether it was proposed to institute proceedings under the Immigration Restriction Act; but that officer, at the same time, reported that the man had been a resident in Australia for fifteen years. If that were so, the man could not be a prohibited immigrant, seeing that he had been formerly domiciled in Australia, and, consequently, any legal steps may be resultless. Under all the circumstances, I want to know, in the first place, whether the fine of &#163;15 has been refunded to the captain or tothe Peninsular and Oriental Company, because, on the information given by the police, the fine was undoubtedly illegal. In the second place, I wish to know what evidence the Victorian police produced in support of the statement that this man had lived in Victoria for fifteen years? So far as I can gather from the documents in my possession, the mere statement of the Victorian police was deemed sufficient by the Department of External Affairs; and this indicates to me that the administration of the Act is becoming somewhat lax. We all know that if any leakage is permitted in this connexion, it will be possible to render nugatory, in a very great measure, the result sought to be achieved by the passing of the Act. I shall be glad to hear what the Attorney-General has to say on the subject, and I hope he has some reasonable explanation to offer. </para>

            <para>- Perfectly, and I thoroughly enjoy and appreciate the criticism. But it seems to me that the instance which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> gives shows, not defective or lax administration, but the very opposite. The remarks of the honorable senator show that when a mistake was made - as may readily occur in dealing with coloured races under the circumstances - the police and the Government, on obtaining correct information, applied a remedy as soon as possible. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> says, this man was allowed to be landed, and as he was supposed to be one of those aimed at by the Immigration Restriction Act, proceedings were promptly taken against the Peninsular and Oriental Company, with the result that the captain was fined. The steamer then went away with the captain, but in the meantime proceedings had been taken by the Peninsular and Oriental Company against this man for desertion. Those proceedings, however, were abandoned, and it was discovered by the authorities that this man, instead of being a prohibited immigrant, was as much entitled to land in Australia as would be <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> or myself. This man, it appears, had been domiciled in Australia for fifteen years. </para>

            <para>- The authorities did not know where the man was, and, I believe, that it was only by pure accident that they stumbled on, him when he was working on a farm in Gippsland. But it was then found, according to the police information, that he had been fifteen years in Australia, and, consequently, did not come under the Act. I am compelled to the conclusion that the officers administering the Act were not in this case as watchful as they ought to have been. The Department should issue instructions for greater care to be exercised in the future. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> may not be aware of the terms of the despatch, but he may take it from me that it is a fact that any member of a Legislative Council, while he enjoys the title in Australia, is entitled to use it in any part of  His  Majesty&#39;s dominions. I did not ask for this title - I do not desire it. It is putting a slur on the members of the first Federal Parliament that any restriction should be prescribed in reference to a title which does not apply to any other persons in Australia. It is applying to the members of the first Federal Parliament a distinct limitation of an honour which does not apply to any other persons in Australia using the same title. </para>

            <para>- I have taken some trouble to look up this matter. We, as members of the first Federal Parliament, have precedence over Legislative Councillors, and yet we have been given this inferior title. Some steps ought to be taken either to decline the honour, or to have the members of the Federal Parliament put on an equality with the members of a State Legislature. That is essential if we have any consideration for our own dignity. It would have been as well if no demandhad ever been made to get this honour from a Government which was evidently reluctant to give it. But that has been done, and now the proper thingto do is to rectify the wrong, and to put us in such a position that we shall be entitled once again to enjoy our self-respect. </para>

            <para>- My honorable friend&#39;s dignity is part of the dignity of the Senate, and he certainly does not speak for other senators in this regard. It is a reflection on his fellow senators for the honorable senator to say that they are wearing a distinction which he calls first a label and then a title. If he thinks that his own dignity as a senator is wounded he should write a respectful and courteous letter to the Colonial Secretary, and say he does not wish to wear the distinction, but I find that he has raised no protest. </para>

            <para>- There is no principle involved. But if my honorable friend does not want the title, he can reject it. It would be a very maladroit thing for a Government, on behalf of all Members of Parliament, .to repudiate to the Imperial Government this distinction - whether it is inferior or superior is not the question - simply because my honorable friend thinks that we ought .to have the right to use it outside Australia. There is not much in it, and I hope he will see that it is not worth while bothering about. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I wish to say that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> of section 3 of the Immigration Restriction Act applies not to the persons to whom he referred&#34;, but to persons who have been convicted outside the Commonwealth, and who are sought to be introduced within our borders. The method which is adopted by the authorities is to make a captain declare that there are no persons of that sort amongst those who are . brought to our shores in his ships, and who are sought to be landed. If offences are &#39; committed by persons already domiciled in the .Commonwealth, they cannot be expelled  1  because of those offences. My honorable  1  friend also referred to a <inline font-style="italic">precis</inline> of the correspondence relating to the landing of Indian merchants under exemption certificates. I laid the papers upon the table of the Senate on the 8th December, and they show that the correspondence was initiated by the late Government. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE</inline>(Western Australia). - I have just now, for the first time, been able to see the correspondence to which reference has been made. The fault is mine, because it was laid upon the table some time ago. I have to express my intense surprise at its contents. Although its emanates from a Government from which other things might have been expected, as it involves the entire negation of, and an absolute departure from, the Immigration Restriction Act, that is not going to deter me from criticising it. I have a duty not only to the party to which I belong, but to the people whom I represent. I have pledged- myself to do my best to prevent the influx of coloured races into Australia. The first letter is from the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> to the Governor-General, and is dated 15th August, 1904. It is as follows: - </para>

          <para>The Government of India have received with much pleasure the intimation conveyed in your Excellency&#39;s letter of 18th August, 1904, that the Government of the &#39;Australian Commonwealth have decided to so far relax the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act as to permit Indian merchants, students, and tourist travellers to visit Australia under passports granted by the Indian Government. I have the honour to ask you to convey to your Ministers our cordial acknowledgments for &#39;this valuable concession, and for the sympathy it evinces with the wishes and feelings of the people of India. We cordially concur with your Ministers in hoping that this exemption of the educated classes of Indians from the restrictions imposed on ordinary immigration will result in more frequent intercourse, and in an improvement of trade relations, to the mutual advantage of both countries. </para>

It seems to me to be an extraordinary reversal of the policy of our Immigration Restriction Act, and it should not have been taken by any Government without consulting Parliament. If the session were not so near to its close, I should certainly table a motion expressing the opinion of Parliament that the action of the late Government should be reversed. </para>

We have to remember that the class whom  it is proposed to admit is the very trading class to which the people of Australia object. They are often called Afghans, but as a matter of fact they are Sikhs under the Indian Government. These hawkers are the very people who have been most strenuously objected to. </para>

            <para>- Not necessarily. A number of &#39;exemption certificates have been issued. To my knowledge, several Indian merchants have travelled in Australia under that provision. Some time ago questions were asked as to a certain Indian merchant who was travelling with his son. Is it not a matter of fact that Ministers have freely availed themselves of this power to issue certificates of exemption to Indian merchants? They have done it before, and would do it again. But now they have handed that power over to the Indian Government. That is what I object to. While the power was held by the Commonwealth Government it could be safeguarded, but now it has been handed over to a Government that is not in sympathy with our White Australia policy. </para>

            <para>- If the Indian Government wished to keep that country black they would be justified in excluding me. My great objection is that this exemption gives to the Indian Government the administration of the exemption portion . of the Act. I must again express my surprise at the change. I feel sure that if Parliament had been aware of it a protest would have been made. Of course, I can quite understand the attitude of honorable senators opposite. They do not want to have any Immigration Restriction Act.  They welcome any weakening of the Act as an instalment towards the free access of Indians and other coloured persons into the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is unnecessarily alarmed. The honorable senator makes no distinction between an immigrant and a visitor. He should understand that the intention of the late Minister of External Affairs was to save trouble to both visitors and the officers of the Commonwealth, by getting the work done in India before the visitors came out here. Under the system adopted, a visitor comes armed with proper credentials, which have only to be shown to the accredited officer in the Commonwealth to secure his admission. He may, after he is admitted, visit such places in the Commonwealth as he pleases, and if he desires to remain longer than he at first proposed, he has to apply for a renewal of his credentials. It was never intended, as every honorable senator ought to know, that this provision should apply to people coming to Australia for the purpose of carrying on their ordinary avocations as hawkers, labourers, mechanics, or anything of that kind. The intention was where visitors were con cerned, to make the administration of the Act as easy and as agreeable to both parties as possible, without in any way abrogating the intention of the measure. </para>

          <para>- I believe I am correct in saying that the proposal outlined in the correspondence which has been read originated with the Deakin Government, and was afterwards carried into effect by the Watson Government. I believe that the arrangements made are within the provisions of the Act, and they constitute a business-like proposal. I can imagine that honorable senators who have strong convictions with regard to the inadvisability of the immigration of coloured aliens into the Commonwealth are still anxious to carry out their views with the least possible annoyance to the people of Asia. In making this arrangement <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> rose superior to the prejudices of many of his followers. He and the members of his Cabinet proved themselves to be possessed of some statesmanlike ideas. I direct attention to the fact that the arrangement made has created a very good impression in India, in other parts of Asia, and in Japan. That is worth winning for Australia, when it has been obtained by what is practically no concession at all under the law. </para>

There is another item of &#163;500 set down for the printing and distribution, including postage, of the Commonwealth Statutes to States Governments. I notice that last year &#163;356 was spent on this item. That seems to me to be an exceedingly large sum for the printing and distribution of six sets of the Commonwealth Statutes. </para>

          <para>- I desire to draw the attention of the AttorneyGeneral to the .item of &#163;100 for &#34;Temporary assistance,&#34; and to the following item :- &#34; Incidental and petty cash expenditure, &#163;200.&#34; It appears to me to be a very bad policy to set down in connexion with every Department two items of this nature. It is like telling the_ officers of each Department that; if there&#39; should be a little rush of work they need not tackle it, as there is a vote for temporary assistance which can be drawn upon. Then there is the item for contingencies and incidental expenditure. In the Estimates presented to the State Parliament of Tasmania, no item is put down for temporary assistance. If there should happen to be a rush of work in any Department, then overtime may have to be paid, but the officers of Departments are not invited to believe that they should not endeavour to cope with it. If they are asked to work overtime, a claim for payment for overtime is considered. I have taken out a few figures from these Estimates, which I submit to the Committee. There is asked for temporary assistance in connexion with the Department of External Affairs for the Administrative Staff, &#163;100; Secretary, &#163;25; Crown Solicitor, &#163;40; then for the High Court, &#163;40 ; and in connexion with the Home Affairs Department, Administrative Staff, &#163;300, with &#163;400 for incidental expenses ; Electoral Department, &#163;800 for temporary assistance ; Public Service Commissioner, &#163;500 ; Public Works Staff, &#163;180; and then, when we come to the Treasurer&#39;s Department we find the item &#34; temporary assistance &#34; down, and no figure opposite to it. Our economical friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, apparently knows what the officers of his Department are doing. </para>

            <para>- I am sure that the honorable and learned senator does riot desire that I should make the same speech on every page of the Estimates. I am directing attention .to the practice of putting down these votes for temporary assistance. For the Auditor-General&#39;s Department there is &#163;100 put down ; for the Customs Central Staff, &#163;250 ; &#163;500 in one sub-division, and &#163;425 in another, whilst for the Customs Department in New South- Wales, &#163;1,000 was voted last year, and &#163;750 is down for this year. These figures give a total of between &#163;4,000 and &#163;5,000 set down for temporary assistance in connexion with the few Departments to which I have referred. In addition, there are votes for contingencies and incidental petty cash expenses. I undertake to say that money could be saved in this direction. Instead of inviting every clerk in every Department to note the fact that a fund is voted by Parliament for the Department to go and come upon, he should be given to understand that he and his fellows are expected to do the work of their Department. </para>

            <para>- But even the Audit Department and the Crown Solicitor&#39;s Department have their little funds on which they may draw for temporary assistance. There is not time to deal with the matter effectively this session ; but I shall be prepared next year to test the feeling of the Committee on the subject by a division. These votes are in my opinion a mistake. I can understand a vote for &#163;500. for temporary assistance for the Department of the Public Service Commissioner, as he had his classification scheme to prepare, and the machinery of his Department to put in order. But we have arrived at a time when there should be no such item on the Estimates, and when a clerk at &#163;200 ought to be able to do the work allotted to him. In the case of the Patent Office, a large sum is provided, which to some extent I can understand. I had the pleasure of calling at the Patent Office and asking the Chief Officer what was the cause of the delay, and he gave me some good reasons. In the initiation of a Department of the kind there is enormous work, and there had been some difficulty with New South Wales; and, altogether, I could understand extra temporary assistance being required. But in the case of the Audit Office, the Treasurer&#39;s Department, the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s Department, and the Crown Solicitor&#39;s Office, there has been great abuse of the system </para>

There was a great and sudden rush of work about two months before the Estimates were dealt with, and, as it was impossible to then make arrangements for another clerk, temporary assistance had to be brought in.

            <para>- The principle to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> draws attention is excellent- When it is found that the necessity for assistance becomes permanent, an extra permanent clerk should be provided for on the Estimates. But that principle cannot be observed in the inauguration of new branches, such as the Patent Office or the Electoral Office. I hope the. time may arrive when the desire of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> may be carried into effect. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DOBSON</inline>(Tasmania). - The Attorney-General proves up to the hilt the exact position which I took up. The honorable and learned gentleman has instanced two Departments in each of which &#163;100 was voted for temporary assistance, and only small sums were spent. Could anything be more stupid than such a system of voting money in advance? Why are we going through the Estimates? To try to combine efficiency with economy, and to save the taxpayers&#39; pockets, if possible- The two items quoted by the Attorney-General show. I was going to say the rotten, but, at any  Tate  bad system that is in vogue. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STEWART</inline>(Queensland).- -I should like to draw attention to the division which deal with New Guinea. I observe from the newspapers that the Government intend to send <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt to New Guinea during the recess to instruct the magistrates in their duties. That is a most excellent idea. While <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> is there he might make inquiries as to the administration of justice in the Possession during the past few years. We have had very serious allegations made in one form or another, and it is extremely desirable to ascertain whether there is any foundation in fact for the charges. It has been stated that an individual, or individuals, were arrested without warrant, tried on trumpedup charges, and dismissed without any definite decision being arrived at, and that when the records of the Court were applied for they were not in existence. If that be true, it appears to me to disclose a state of affairs which requires careful examination. The statements may be either true or untrue, but the fact that a charge of this kind was made publicly by a person who says that he . is prepared to substantiate it is a circumstance which ought to influence the Government iri trying to get &#39;the very best information on the subject. During the recess the Government ought to afford such members of the Federal Parliament as are desirous to make themselves better acquainted with New Guinea an opportunity to visit the Possession, for the administration of the affairs of which we are now responsible. There is a problem of very great importance awaiting solution in New Guinea. There are over half-a-million coloured people there, with a very small number of whites, and, as we have assumed responsibility for those people, members of the Federal Parliament ought to be given some opportunity to see the conditions of life in the Possession. By such means we shall be assisted in coming to a conclusion as to the best method of government to be adopted in the Territory. I should like the Attorney-General to say whether the Government will give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt the power to make investigations as to the charges I have referred to, and also whether the Government would be prepared to assist members of the Federal Parliament to visit the Possession?. </para>

Neither should we deprive them of the revenue which they now obtain from selling land, and which is devoted to the improvement of the roads. </para>

            <para>- I am very glad <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> approves of the proposed visit by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt. That visit, however, may, though I do not say it will, depend, to some extent, on whether the Papua Bill becomes law, as I hope it will. I am not quite certain, whether, in the event of that Bill not becoming law, the same necessity for a visit by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt will arise. The idea is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> should assist in explaining the new system of government to the officials, and give what help may be necessary to bring it into operation. At any rate, if the visit is paid, I am quite sure it will be enlarged so that the results may be useful to us in every possible way, including that to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has referred. I am not quite sure that the Government would fall in with the idea of affording facilities for a visit by honorable senators. On the other h,:nd information on the subject is no doubt necessary, and probably much could be obtained as to how to get there, and what to do when there, from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> who undertook an exploration which has been of great value, not only to himself, but to the Senate. I shall make inquiries into the matter. </para>

          <para>- I should like to have some information from the Government as to the reasons which induced &#39;them to grant an extra sum of  &#163;6,000  for the mail subsidy to the Pacific Islands to one firm, without calling for tenders in the usual way ? I also desire to know why Sydney is made the port of call for the mail service, when it is not the nearest point in the Commonwealth to the places to be served. I wish to know whether it is really a mail service, or whether it is not given for a mail service as a mere subterfuge to cover some other idea? It appears to me that, to a large extent, it must be a subterfuge, seeing that we are paying for a mail service from Sydney to New Guinea. We are sending the mails three-fourths of the length of the eastern coast of Australia, when we. have, in Queensland, ports like Rockhampton, Gladstone, and Brisbane, which are infinitely nearer to New Guinea, and also considerably nearer to the New Hebrides and other places. In my speech on the second reading of the Bill, I pointed out that Brisbane, Rockhampton, Gladstone, Maryborough!, Bundaberg, and other portions of Queensland are connected with the rest of the Commonwealth by a direct train service. If it is desired to subsidize a mail service to New Guinea, or to the New Hebrides, and the other islands, undoubtedly, it is the duty of the Commonwealth to see that the service starts from the State which is in closest proximity to the ports to be served. </para>

Suppose that Tasmania were much nearer than Melbourne to some islands in the south, how would the representatives of Tasmania feel if the mail service were- to go right past their door to Melbourne? Undoubtedly they would protest in the strongest possible way against their State being overlooked and overridden. </para>

            <para>- That would be all right for Sydney and Burns, Philp, and Company, but it would be a very bad business for the Commonwealth. I notice these continual attempts to get at the rest of the Commonwealth for the benefit of a tew large ports. Sydney has just as much right as any other port in the Commonwealth to be made the terminal port. When the conditions are in favour of Sydney rather than in favour of other places she has a similar right, but when the conditions are all in favour of other ports undoubtedly they should get a fair deal from the Government. It is contemplated by the Consitution that the Senate should specially safeguard the interests of the States, lt is the special province of the representati&#39;ves of Queensland to see that its interests are not overlooked or overridden for the benefit of any other State, as appears to have been done. I hold in my hand a map, which has been issued by Burns, Philp, and Company to show their various services. A glance at the map is sufficient to show honorable senators that Rockhampton, or Gladstone, or Brisbane is very much nearer than Sydney to the New Hebrides. Why are we to have a mail service from Sydney right round to New Guinea, seeing that we are already paying for a mail service right up to Thursday Island, when only a continuation of the latter service is required ? Could any more fatuous argument be put forward by the Attorney-General than to say that this is a mail service? This map shows that the argument that reefs and islands intervene between Brisbane and the New Hebrides,- and so prevent a direct service, which would be shorter than the one from New Hebrides to Sydney, is all bunkum. According to the map there is neither a reef nor an island in the direct track between Brisbane and the New Hebrides, or between Rockhampton and the other places I have named. Therefore if it is a mail service pure and simple there can be no logical reason why it should not start from one of the southern ports of Queensland. Again, it has been put forward as an excuse that Burns, Philp, and Company are doing valuable work in colonization over there - that they are settling the islands in the New Hebrides and other places. The New Hebrides are not Commonwealth territory, nor are they British territory. We in the Commonwealth have no right to subsidize a company for the development of territory other than our own while we are unable thoroughly to settle our own country. If Burns, Philp, and Company hav&#60;; valuable interests there, let them colonize if they desire to do so, in their own way, at their own cost, but do not let them beg and whine to us to get our money to do it for them. </para>

            <para>- Exactly what  1  say ; neither more nor less. They are coming to us and saying, &#34; Give us this increased subsidy, and we will settle our islands.&#34; That excuse, put forward by those who are favorable to the subsidy, is a piece of utter &#34; flam.&#34; It is most indefensible to ask us to find money for colonizing territory other than our own, when we are unable to settle colonists on our own lands. It is the business of Australia to retain its own citizens, and to develop its own resources, rather than to send people over the sea to develop the New Hebrides. I do not propose to say more on this matter until I get some information from the Attorney-General. Probably he will be able to put a different complexion upon it, and to show us that the proposed subsidy is justifiable. I shall wait until he does so. But until that is done, I am not content to allow this item to pass without emphatic protest. I intend to move that it be reduced by &#163;6,000, which is the amount of the increased subsidy. If that is carried the subsidy will remain exactly where it has been for a considerable time. It will not affect the existing service ; it will not interfere with any arrangement already made ;. but it will allow the Government time to review the decision, and to make whatever arrangements of a more equitable character may be possible. I do not intend to do what I had originally purposed, to move that the whole sum be wiped out of the schedule, because I do not wish to capsize existing arrangements or to inconvenience people who depend upon them. But I hope that the Committee will agree with me that the proposed arrangement is not an equitable one, and that the amount ought to be reduced by the sum which I have named. . I therefore move - </para>

          <para>- I think that it would have been better, as a matter of party policy, if the Government had called for tenders for this extended mail service. But I believe - in fact I feel sure - that the result would have been exactly the same, and that if we require a good service only one company would tender - that is, Burns, Philp, and Company. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline>SMITH.Clunn  and Sons have only one boat of 165 tons; with a 75 horse-power oil engine ! It would have been really like my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> proposal to have a referendum in New Guinea, as to whether the white inhabitants desire prohibition. We know that they would all have said that they did not want prohibition. Calling for tenders for this mail service would have had the same result, because no shipping firm in Australia that I know of could spare six ships for this work. Even if some company were willing to spare them, any one who has any knowledge of island trade knows that it would have been impossible to carry on the service on a &#163;12,000 subsidy, unless they had purchased land on the different islands, and had stores, supercargoes, and the whole of the paraphernalia ready. It would have been impossible for any other company to carry on without losing an enormous sum of money. Therefore Burns, Philp, and Company would have been the only firm to tender for the service. I think that the proposal now made is undoubtedly advantageous to the Commonwealth. I do not care anything about any shipping firm. That consideration has nothing to do with this Parliament. The question we have to consider is - is this proposal to the advantage of the Commonwealth? I intend to look at it purely from that point of view. The proposal was not initiated by the present Government. It was initiated by the Deakin Administration, at the instigation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Woodford,</inline> the Government Resident at the Solomon Islands, and Captain Razon, the representative of the High  1  Commissioner of the Pacific in the New </para>

            <para>- If it is merely a matter of detail, I am quite sure that the Government will see that in every way the interests of the Commonwealth are conserved. I thought the objection was not as to the details, but to the proposal to pay any subsidies to a line of steamers at all. The advantages of the subsidy are, first of all, that it provides a regular mail service. Then there is the advantage of retaining and extending our interests in the Western Pacific, so as to keep foreign powers from obtaining strategic bases close to our shores. I know that there is a difference of opinion as to that. I believe that some honorable s enators, who are actuated by the very best intentions, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, are prepared to see any foreign power- come close into our shores, to monopolize the harbors in the islands contiguous to Australia, and to establish strategic bases and coaling stations there. But I am absolutely opposed to that view. I believe that it is a matter of extreme importance to Australia to use every means in our power to keep foreign nations from establishing strategic bases within striking distance of Australia. </para>

            <para>- I am voting for the subsidy for the reasons which I have mentioned&#39;, and for another reason which I am about to give. That is, that we are building up a mercantile marine manned by white sailors - practically by Australians - who will be of immense importance to Australia in regard to our naval defence in the future. I do not think that we can adopt a policy that is more in the interests of the Commonwealth than to build up a mercantile marine belonging to Australia, manned by Australians ; and if we have these six steamers as a result of this subsidy, it will be a stride in the right direction. Moreover, the trade of these islands is of immense importance. The value qf our imports and exports from the Pacific Islands amounts to  &#163;1,000,000  a year. A subsidy of  &#163;12,000  a year to stimulate a valuable trade like that is in itself justifiable. We send out our manufactures to the Pacific Islands and in exchange we receive products such as cocoanut oil, which are the raw material of some of our industries. That trade is not only large, is not only increasing, but it is a trade which is peculiarly important to Australia, in that it stimulates our manufactures, and leads to a reciprocal trade in our exports. Having mentioned what I consider to be the value of this Pacific trade, let me consider for a moment the cost to Australia. The proposed subsidy works out at is. 4d. a mile. The distance covered by the service is  86,000  miles per annum. If we include the service which runs to Singapore, but which is not subsidized, the total service works out at  300,000  miles a year, or iod. per mile. But I am taking simply the actual mileage covered by the subsidy, which, as I have said, works out at is.  4C1.  per mile. Germany and! France are paying 4s. od. per mile in the Pacific, whilst we are now asked to pay1s. 4d. per mile, and we insist on the employment of white labour, a condition which other nations do no impose. If we turn to other British lines, we find that the Peninsular and Oriental Company are being paid for a mail service 4s. 9d. per mile, whilst the Orient Company asked 4s. 7d. per mile, and refused to take up the service for less. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline>SMITH.There is something in that contention, but it should be remembered that this trade was created, after many years of struggling, by Sydney. New South Wales at the inauguration of the Commonwealth, was actually paying a subsidy of &#163;3,600 a year for the service to these islands, and for the Commonwealth now to take that service entirely away from Sydney would be unjust. In spite of the map which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has displayed, I very much doubt whether the route from Brisbane to New Hebrides ports, like Vila and Havana, is any shorter than is the route from Sydney. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> will consult the Admiralty Chart, he will find that dangerous reefs run out for a very long distance north of New Caledonia. Ships must give those reefs a wide berth, and that would increase the distance from Brisbane considerably. Queensland does not lose everything, because this subsidy will result in the accession of a considerable amount of trade to that State. . Practically the whole of the trade with New Guinea, which is a considerable, and a growing trade is to be worked from Thursday Island, a Queensland port. The proposal under this subsidy is that a steamer shall call at all ports in New Guinea up to Woodlark Island, and shall come back <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the same ports, bringing produce to a Queensland port. </para>

            <para>- I entirely disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> on this point. If we wish to develop New Guinea, this service must call at places like Daru, Orikolo, Yule Island, Moresby, Cloudy Bay, and other places where there is excellent land for cultivation. Unless a steamer calls at these places, it will be absolutely impossible to develop them. It would be putting the money to a very poor use to subsidize a steamer which should only run  to  Moresby and Samarai, the political and commercial capitals of New Guinea. The land around Moresby is sterile, and unsuitable for cultivation, whilst Samarai is on a little island, and is the port of the goldfields. If it is desired to develop the plantations and the natural industries of New Guinea, we must subsidize a line of steamers which will call at various ports all along the coast.  From that  point  of  view, Clunn and </para>

        <para class="block">Sons&#39; proposal would not tend to the development of the Territory. I have said that, in my opinion, it would have been better to have called for tenders for these services. I am absolutely certain that the result would have been the same, but if that course had been adopted little rival traders could not have objected that they had had no opportunity to tender. I am satisfied that no other company in the Commonwealth could have placed six large steamers at our service for this purpose, and no company could possibly run such a service successfully that had not established Stc res on the various islands with representatives there to provide proper trading facilities, and supercargoes to conduct the trade as the boats called at the various ports. Burns, Philp, and Company is the only company that&#34; has established itself in this way, and though I know very little personally about the company, from what I have read with regard to the development of the Pacific, it is my opinion that if it had not been for Burns, Philp, and Company, our interests in the Pacific would not be as important as they are to-day. That firm has, I believe, maintained Australia&#39;s hold on islands subsequently annexed by Great Britain. Our interests in the New Hebrides have been conserved by their mail services, and also our interest in those lands which the firm have transferred to the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- The firm have placed the lands at the disposal of the Commonwealth - we know they cannot transfer them, because the Commonwealth cannot accept them. The proposed subsidy amounts to is. 4d. per mile, as compared with the German subsidy of 4s. 9d. per mile, the French subsidy of 8s. 4d., the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company subsidy of 4s. 9d., and the subsidy requested by the Orient Company of 4s. 7d. per mile. It is a small subsidy, which not only benefits us, so far as the mail services are concerned, but also benefits us in our trade, and in the maintenance of our interests and influence in the Pacific, in so far as it assists to prevent foreign powers establishing strategic bases close to Australia. </para>

Any other company entering into competition would have to go to all the initial expense which Burns, Philp, and Company met years ago. The six vessels necessary for a trade of this description will cost about &#163;15,000 per annum to work, and those vessels have to be manned, provisioned, coaled, and repaired in Australia. All this means an expend&#39;iture in connexion with the Pacific trade of from &#163;100,000 to &#163;150,000 per annum within the Commonwealth. Under the circumstances, is it so very unreasonable for the Commonwealth to spend &#163;12,000 in the encouragement of a trade which will mean so much to the &#34;Australian people, not only in wages, but in the return from the sale of produce, provisions;, and so forth ? We must recognise that a trade will be built up between Australia and New Guinea, and the islands. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> will give me credit for never bandying unmeaning compliments. I got up mainly to reply to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> who is loyally supporting his own State from his own point of view. I venture to think, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is act; ing not altogether in the interests of the Commonwealth at large. Sydney has been, and is, the distributing port for the island trade, principally because Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, and the Union and other steamship companies, have for years past made that city their headquarters. Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company have, from a small island connexion, developed a very large trade; and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has shown, that firm is fully equipped with all the essentials of a prosperous and expanding business. They have establishments at various places throughout the Pacific for coaling, repairs, &#38;c, and they have agencies throughout for buying, distributing, and exchanging cargoes. These facts shew that Sydney is entitled, in some measure, to the trade. As an illustrative fact in this connexion I should like to inform honorable senators that in Sydney there are two oil mills, which import from the islands&#39; over 15,000 tons of copra annually valued at &#163;250,000. These were the first oil mills established in Australia, and they to a large extent revolutionized the island trade. Previously to their establishment, the copra was carried direct by vessels to France, Germany, and other continental countries, but now not only are the 15,000 tons brought to Sydney for the oil mills, but more than an equal quantity is reexported from Sydney to Germany and other parts of the world. Sydney has a legitimate trade, and that trade, whether we like it or not, must be taken into consideration. Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, and the Union Steamship Company, are the only two firms whicli could carry out a contract of the character under discussion, and if they were asked to make one of the Queensland ports their point of departure, they would unquestionably , ask, not &#163;12,000, but &#163;50,000 per annum. The proposed subsidy forms only a small part of the basis of the island trade of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company. </para>

            <para>- In my opinion it is both. The firm could not carry on an ordinary mail , service without a subsidy of at least &#163;50,000; and in that view I shall be supported by every business man. The contract is undertaken with the subsidy proposed, because the firm have all the conveniences already established for carrying on such a trade ; the mails forming only an addendum to their present &#39;business. If we take upon ourselves the responsibility of governing New Guinea, we must do our best to elevate our Pacific Possessions, and, from a social point of view, make the life of the people there as . comfortable and convenient as possible. Those people are cut off from the social pleasures which are the every-day lot of Australians on the mainland ; they are dependent entirely oh those vessels for their irregular correspondence, and they ought to receive every consideration. We must regard those islands, not only from the&#39; point of view of what  they are to-day, but from the point of view of what they will be in the future, and they ought to be developed in a manner best calculated to promote the interests of the Commonwealth at large. I sympathize with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> because it does seem rather hard that Queensland, which, on a mileage basis, has an advantage, should not have a greater share in the island traffic. We cannot, however, get away from the ordinary conditions which permeate the civilized world in regard to business transactions. It is impossible to set aside the ramifications of an established trade, unless we are prepared to pay a very heavy price. From a purely business point of view, the Commonwealth is making a very good bargain in accepting the terms which Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company have asked. </para>

            <para>- Subject to conditions of which we are entirely ignorant. In other cases, the Parliament knows what it is voting the money for, and in many cases, tenders are called. It seems to be assumed in this case that there would be no competition if tenders were invited. What right have we to assume that Burns, Philp, and Company is the only firm which would send steamers to the islands ? We are asked to assume a little too much in that regard. There are many large companies trading round Australia. We were told a little while ago that their trade was not profitable. I was sceptical on that point because I knew that their trade was profitable. Are we to assume that these companies, equally as rich as Burns, Philp, and Company, and equally able to provide steamers, would not compete if tenders were invited? A new steamer is being added almost every week to the fleet of one company or another. Only yesterday a new steamer arrived in the bay for one company. Why should we assume that the other shipping companies have no desire to enter into this trade? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> says that Burns, Philp  and Company have special interests in the islands which other companies do not possess. Perhaps that explains why their steamers propose to make such a detour in order to get to Sydney. </para>

            <para>- Then the subsidy is to be used to serve the business interests of a firm in Sydney. The public money should be spent to serve the public interests, and not those of Burns, Philp, and Company, or of Sydney. Had tenders been invited, we might have had a firm proposing to run a line of steamers direct from the islands to the nearest point in Queensland, and the service might have been carried out at considerably less than &#163;12,000. We are making a very dangerous innovation. I believe that it is advisable to open up the trade with the islands. But if we intend to rely on private enterprise for our mail service, and our trade with the islands, there should be open competition. It is very unsatisfactory to give the  Government <inline font-style="italic">carle blanche</inline> in this matter. &#39; If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> calls for a division, I shall feel compelled to vote with him, as a protest against not calling for tenders. It is said that we are giving this amount in order to develop trade. But what guarantee have we that Burns, Philp, and Company will make corresponding reductions in freights or fares? Have the Government come to any understanding with the firm on that point, or will they impose the condition that Australian goods are to be carried at correspondingly lower rates? </para>

He justified this subsidy on the ground that it would enable the latter firm to take goods at lower rates, and &#39;that, therefore, lit would encourage trade with Australia. If we are to pay _&#163;i  2,000  a year for a mail service only, let us know that we are. But if we are to pay that sum annually for the purpose of encouraging trade, let us have some guarantee that the merchant in Australia and the settler in the islands will derive an advantage therefrom. We have no guarantee at the present moment that the firm will allow either the merchant or the settler to share in the advantage which it will gain from this subsidy </para>

          <para>- I have never been favorably disposed towards this subsidy to Burns, Philp, and Company, because I have always felt that <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> did not procure for the Commonwealth the advantages which it was represented would be obtained. I cannot help thinking that there is an economic fallacy at the base of all the speeches this evening. We have heard a great deal about the trade advantages to Australia, which will arise out of the subsidy, and a great deal about the extension of her influence. I should like honorable senators to carry their minds back a few weeks to the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> advocated a reduction of duties to a particular group of islands in the Pacific, because, as he pointed out, the Australian producers on the islands could not remain British subjects and still make a livelihood. He pointed out that the products of the islands were barred from coming into Australia by a protective Tariff, and that in consequence every one of these settlers was gradually being obliged to become a French subject. The result of my inquiries is certainly to confirm what he said. I do not think he exaggerated the situation in the least degree. </para>

            <para>- The imposition of the duties has had the effect of shutting out all other products, except copra.. which comes in free. We are asked to give Burns, Philp, and Company an increased subsidy to trade with the islands, and the result  of that trade will be that Australian influence will not be extended, but this firm of traders will be enabled to make a larger profit, or an equal profit on cheaper terms out of the settlers, who are not British subjects. Under these circumstances, I fail to see why the Commonwealth should be asked to subsidize a line of steamers simply for the benefit of a firm of traders in New South Wales, or any other State. I am not in favour of the subsidy. I do not advocate the removal of the head-quarters of the line to Brisbane, or any other port, because I do not care to enter upon an economic discussion of that sort. I oppose this vote on principle. T do not think that the Government have taken into account the results which will accrue from the expenditure of the money </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PULSFORD</inline>(New South Wales). - It is singular to me that this amount of  &#163;&#34;&#34;12,000  which has been proposed by three separate Governments, and has probably had more attention devoted to it than any other sum in this long schedule, should be subjected to so much criticism of an unusual character. Of the total of  &#163;12,000  no less than  &#163;6,600  will be paid by New South Wales, leaving only .&#163;5,400 to be contributed by the whole of the rest of Australia. I do not think that honorable senators have yet grasped the fact that &#163;12,000 is an exceedingly small sum for the very large services which are to be given under this contract. I believe that &#163;12,000 is about the sum paid by Australia for the excellent service between Melbourne and Launceston. I dare say that that is a cheap service. Presumably the lowest terms were obtained in entering into the contract in regard to it. Now, . we have a proposal under which five different routes are to be traversed all over the Pacific for the same sum. And this expenditure is proposed in competition with France and Germany, which are running mail sendees over the Pacific, and are paying a total of about &#163;80,000. Not only that, but the boats of France and Germany are able to take any crews they like, whereas under the agreement with the Commonwealth Government the steamers under this contract will0 be obliged to carry white crews. The great bulk of the &#163;12,000 will, I can assure honorable senators, be paid away in wages to the crews. The contract really is a very great one for the Commonwealth. In the House of Representatives, while the matter was being discussed, it was stated by an honorable member that the firm of Burns, Philp, and Company were losing &#163;16,000 a year on their island- and New Guinea business. That is a mistake. Up to a certain time &#163;16,000 was the aggregate of the company&#39;s loss in establishing and carrying on the island and New Guinea business. Since then, partly owing to the loss of steamers, the aggregate loss on the business of the firm in these directions has been at least &#163;25,000. Of course the firm of Burns, Philp, and Company have very large business connexions, and it is because they are making large profits in other .directions that they are able to stand these losses. They do not,  1  presume, ask for the sympathy of Australia. They have gone into new business as business men, looking ultimately for these trades to develop until they became profitable. Other circumstances have arisen which made the business unprofitable. But circumstances have arisen which make it desirable for Australia to make some sort of a show in the Pacific. </para>

            <para>- Australia ought to make in the Pacific some sort of show of its ability to carry on business ; and when this proposal is made, which has been most closely scrutinized by three different Governments, and when the company is willing to -run a total mileage of about 180,000 miles, carrying goods, letters, and passengers, I do not think it needs many words to show that the three Governments were justified in coming to the conclusion that it was advantageous to Australia that the contract should be entered into. In the whole of the circumstances, this strikes me as being remarkably good business for the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> points out that, as three Governments have considered this matter, we ought to agree to it. But that does not make it right. If the honorable senator had been sitting on this side of the Chamber, and this item had come as a recommendation from the Watson Government, he would have viewed it in a different light. He would then have been able to say that because it had been taken up by the previous Government, the Watson Government only took it up because they found it on the book. That is what we were told in connexion with other matters when the Watson Government were in power. Because they indorsed what had been done by previous Governments we were told that that did not make their proposals right, any more than they would have been right if submitted as their own original policy. As a matter of fact, this contract would not have recommended itself to many honorable senators even if the Watson Government had submitted it to Parliament. There were two or three . things which the Watson Government proposed with which I did not agree, although I was a member of their party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> view that New South Wales would pay a verylarge share of this money is not interfered with by the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> It is not proposed to touch the existing arrangement. If New South Wales is prepared to allow her money to be spent to assist the business carried on by Burns, Philp, and Company, let her do it, by all means. But if a larger subsidy is to be  voted than we think is in the interests of the Commonwealth, and if the best arrangement is not being made in regard to routes, quickness of service, and other particulars, we are justified in taking exception to it. No one for a moment wishes to object to Sydney being a port of call for the line of steamers concerned. We are not saying that Queensland ports should be the only ports of call in Australia for the vessels that come from the South Seas. We do not desire to interfere with the business that has been established in Sydney in connexion with the South Seas. What is claimed is that this is a mail service, and that the first port of call in Australia should be the nearest port available on the mainland. The reason for that is obvious. It is that letters and correspondence should be made available for delivery in Australia at the first possible opportunity. I do not know how any one can cavil at such a proposition. It seems to me that the strongest argument in favour of this point of view has been advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> who pointed out that the whole of the trade of New Guinea will go to Thursday Island. The whole of the trade of New Guinea goes to Thursday Island now. It is said that this trade will not be taken from Thursday Island, because of its geographical position. Any one can see that Australia is so situated that it would be stupid for any one to imagine that&#34; the trade of New Guinea could go to .Perth, Adelaide, Fremantle, or any port on the western side of Australia. It is because of the geographical position,, and the communication between Thursday Island, North Queensland, and the outer world, that the trade of New Guinea comes to Thursday Island for transhipment. But if the argument is strong regarding the trade from New Guinea, it is equally strong, or stronger, when we look at the matter from the point of view of a mail service running to the South Sea Islands. It is admitted all round that the nearest port of contact with the islands is the coast of Queensland. I am not saying whether Brisbane, Rockhampton, or Gladstone should be the port of call. The port should be that which is nearest, and where there is railway communication. By means of the railway communication in Queensland we shall be able to give the people in the South Seas a better mail service, by reason of the boats making some particular spot in that State their place of departure and their first port of call, than will be the case under what is proposed. What is asked is that if subsidies are paid by the Commonwealth Government the best service available shall be given to people who have interests at stake. The strongest argument from that point of view also seems to me to have been advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith.</inline> That is, the reason why tenders should be called for&#39; this service. In the first place, there is not an honorable senator who believes that the Post Office should enter into contracts without giving every one an opportunity to  tender if they think fit. It is because of the tender system that the big monopoly Of Cobb and Company, which existed for many years, was ultimately broken up, with the result that there has been a considerably better service to a large number of small towns than they had prior to the time when open tenders were called for. o No one will gainsay that fact in the slightest degree. It was only when smaller firms were able to tender for certain services that the people were better served, and that the Government were in a position to afford greater facilities to those who were paying the money. How much more necessary it is to adopt a similar course in a case like this, when we have complaints made in connexion with the proposed subsidy from Cooktown, and from New South Wales. The statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> that it would not pay any other company to go into this trade should warrant the Government in calling for tenders in this instance, if they are anxious that fair terms shall be secured. It is pointed out that Burns, Philp, and Company have built up an enormous trade in the South Sea Islands, and that they require this subsidy to enable them to carry on and extend that trade. &#39; It will not be contended that this company, having in the course of a considerable number of years, established stores and a business in the various groups of islands in the Pacific, in New Guinea, and in North Queensland, will abandon the business they have built up if they do not receive this subsidy. I do not know that this subsidy will enable them to carry on their business more effectively than they do at present, but it is possible that it will be useful to them in meeting the competition of other people, which they have felt more keenly as they have pushed their trade  to islands further out. We have no reason to believe that, by giving this subsidy to Burns, Philp, and Company, the people settled on the islands  which will be connected with Australia by the proposed services will be given any better service than they have at the present time. The fact that Burns, Philp, and Company have established this business, and are alleged to be better able to carry out these services than is any one else, should induce the Government to say, &#34; You have established your business in these islands, and we do not think it is any part of the duty of the Commonwealth Government to help you to extend that business which you will keep going in any case. But we shall call for tenders for these services, and if any one else desires to go into this business, they shall be given the opportunity to do so.&#34; That is all that we contend for - that instead of the Government subsidizing this company, which has built up a considerable business in the Pacific, they should call for tenders for these services, to see whether there is any one else who is willing to start trade with the Pacific. If we can get some other firm to tender, even though their tender should be about the same as that of Burns, Philp, and Company, it would pay the Commonwealth, and it would be more in the interests of the people settled in the islands, to have two firms rather than one engaged in this business. In such a case, the people settled on the islands would certainly get a better service as a result of the competition between the two firms. We should have a second firm spending money with the object of opening up trade, and there can be no doubt that the people settled on the island would be better served. </para>

            <para>- We are told that the trade runs to over &#163;1,000,000 a year, and is increasing every year. Surely in such a trade there is room for two firms running small boats to these islands. The idea of firms getting boats built specially for the purpose of carrying on this trade is all moonshine. Most of the boats used in the trade, and which will continue to be used in the trade, are boats that have been run on the Australian coast for years, and have become obsolete so far as that trade is concerned. As newer boats have been brought out to take up the Australian coastal trade, the older vessels have been transferred to the trade with the islands of the Pacific. I submit that it would be wise for the Committee to insist that the Government should call for tenders for these services, in the interests of the people on the islands. We have the statement made that a North Queensland firm, as Burns, Philp, and Company used to be before they got a bigger hold, and established their headquarters in Sydney, is prepared to carry out a mail service between Queensland and New Guinea, and to carry cargo, as they are doing already in competition with Burns, Philp, and Company, for a little more than half what Burns, Philp, and Company are asking for the same service. </para>

            <para>- And by a better boat. Is there any harm, therefore, in calling for tenders, and asking Burns, Philp, and Company to compete with a firm already engaged in this business with themselves? It appears to me that this is but an attempt to insure a monopoly for a firm that has used, or has attempted to use, considerable influence to that end. Honorable senators may say that representatives of Queensland are endeavouring to get facilities for that State which she does not at present enjoy, but at any rate I am not looking at this matter from a purely Queensland point of view. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> asked us to discuss this matter from an Australian point of view, and I desire to do so, as well as from the point of view of the people who have settled in the islands, and who are endeavouring to make a living there. We are told that Burns, Philp, and Company are prepared to run half-a-dozen boats, on which they are prepared to spend &#163;100,000 to &#163;150,000 in provisioning and maintaining. </para>

            <para>- I do not know. I take the figures submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> I point out that though it mightbe necessary for the extension of their trade that Burns, Philp, and Company should run five boats if they secured this subsidy, they would, in all probability, continue to run four or five boats if they did not get the subsidy. If tenders are called for these services, and another firm gets the contract, we should have four or five additional boats engaged in the trade; there would be more money spent in provisioning and maintaining the two fleets, and even from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> point of view, that would appear to be the better course to adopt. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> argument on the subject does not amount to a very great deal. </para>

            <para>- I do not know that it will. The boat which is now being run from Cooktown to New Guinea is not being run by coloured labour. How is it that the firm running that boat has not taken advantage of the opportunity to run it with coloured labour? Boats engaged in this trade have been run for years, and are now being run with white labour. I remind honorable senators that there was very nearly a big strike caused not long ago when the <inline font-style="italic">Janet Nickol,</inline> employed in the South Sea trade came into Sydney and wished to take a coloured crew from Sydney back to the islands. When in the Commonweal! h we desire to secure a good service on land, we call for tenders, and if that principle is good as applied to services within the borders of the Commonwealth, some reason should be given why the same principle is not equally good when applied to a mail service beyond the Commonwealth. However, this is not a mail service, but a proposal to subsidize a company for carrying on its own business. </para>

            <para>- At the present time some of our contracts&#39; with these companies are for the carriage of mails alone, but it is not pretended that this subsidy is for a mail service only. There is also the difference that the Peninsular and Oriental Company has not a monopoly of shipping facilities between Australia and other parts of the world. There are many different lines of boats running between Australia and the various ports at which vessels belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Company call. But in this case that is not so. We are informed that if there were tenders called to-morrow there is no firm in Australia able to compete with Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company. </para>

            <para>- That is the strongest reason why the Government ought to call for tenders; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has said that the Union Company could do the work. That, company has a number of boats on; the coast of Queensland&#39;, and could spare half-a-dozen for the South Sea Islands trade; but they have not branches and agencies established, as Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company have, in every little nook and bay, with men there to do trade with the natives. It was further said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> that if a company were asked to take this contract up as a mail contract they would probably ask for a subsidy of &#163;50,000. If that be so, what harm could there be in throwing the contract open to competition? If a firm desires to establish a trade, or to extend what little trade they have in the South Seas, what harm could there be in the Government calling for tenders for the whole service, or any portion which a firm might be prepared to undertake ? There is no reason why the Government should not obtain, not only the cheapest, but the best service, which should be made as nearly as possible approximate to a mail service by stipulating that the vessels shall call at the first port from which there is railway communication throughout Australia. If Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company tendered at &#163;12,000, and another firm tendered at &#163;20,000, the first-named firm would obtain the contract, under conditions which were as fair as they could be made to Australia. Another argument which has been used may be described as the patriotic argument. It has been urged that by giving this subsidy we are establishing, or helping to establish, a mercantile marine, from which we may obtain the nucleus of a naval reserve. But where are the firm getting the young chaps who go on board the half-dozen vessels round the coast? They are getting them mostly from the shore, and training them on board, thus making them seamen fit to be drafted into almost any other branch of the service. Those small vessels will get their crews from men already engaged in the mercantile marine, and if those men are called! on they will be prepared to take their place in the defenceof their country. But the bottom falls outof the patriotic view when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> admits that if a competing firm got the contract Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company would sacrifice all sentiment, and work their ships with coloured labour. We have not often used that argument in connexion with our coastal marine, because, as a matter of fact, though not so much in Australia as in England, that marine has not been manned by Britishers, or by men who would consider it to their interest to bestir themselves in. the defence of the country where they earn their living. There are two points which we must bear in mind ; first, we should endeavour to make this service the most efficient from a mail point of view ; and, secondly, we should give any other firm or body of persons an opportunity to tender for the service. </para>

          <para>- I have listened with very great interest to this debate, and I fancy I shall haveto support the amendment. As an old contractor, I disapprove, and always have disapproved very strongly, of private contracts. I know nothing about Messrs. Burns. Philp, and Company, or any other firm which has been mentioned, but I cannot think it right to hand over a subsidy of &#163;1,000 a month of Commonwealth money without open competition. We are told that Messrs. Burns. Philp, and Company are the only persons who can carry on this trade successfully </para>

            <para>- If any honorable senator were a ship-owner, I am sure he would&#39; feel aggrieved at not having an opportunity to tender, and perhaps open or develop a trade with the South Sea Islands, with a subsidy of &#163;12,000 per annum behind him. That is a large sum, and I have no hesitation in saying that it will be sufficient to pay the wages of the men on the whole of the six ships. Open competition is the principle to which I adhere where public contracts are involved. If we were a private firm of capitalists, and thought fit to give Messrs. Burns, Philp. and Company &#163;12,000 per annum, it might be the best arrangement possible. </para>

            <para>- I would not say that; it may possibly be the best arrangement, but still I must oppose the policy of handing over public money without public competition. I do not want to see established the precedent of giving large contracts privately.We might be told later on, in the case of public works, that Jones having contracted for one section, was the only person who could successfully carry out the next section, and that the contract ought to be given to him privately. That has been done in Australia over and over again, although it is the experience that when contracts are publicly called for in such cases, the contractor for theone section is scarcely ever successful on regard to the second. </para>

            <para>- Yes, it has; John Robb, after doing one section of the Ballarat railway, was privately given the contract for another short section, although there were contractors, who would have done the work at cheaper rates. I was one who waited upon the Railway Commissioners at the time, and protested against such a policy as unsound. I shall support the amendment, without entering into the question whether the amendment proposed be good or bad, relying on the principle that public money, when spent on contracts, should be competed for publicly. </para>

            <para>- I agree with that principle, but I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> will see that whatever view he may take as to the advisableness of calling for tenders, such a course would be, I shall not say impossible - though I think it would be - but, at any rate, highly disadvantageous to Australia. The discussion has very properly covered a much wider area, than that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> originally contemplated; and I desire to recall honorable senators&#39; attention to what is proposed, and what the points involved are. There is, and has been, a subsidy paid of &#163;3, 600 towards a mail service to the New Hebrides and other islands in the Pacific, but that amount was paid by New South Wales alone, the Commonwealth not contributing a farthing of what is transferred expenditure. In pursuance of the white labour policy, &#163;4,000, or an additional &#163;400 was granted, on condition that black labour was not used, and then &#163;2,000 per annum was granted as an additional subsidy, for the extension of the services. Those two latter sums represent &#163;6.000, the bulk of which was paid by New South Wales. The details of the contract are set out in a summary which was laid on the table of the Senate on the nth November last, and are embodied in a contract finally entered into in July, 1902. The contractors are Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, and there are two points which have occupied, what T might call the foremost place in the debate- the rival claims of Sydney and Brisbane. It is perfectly legitimate for honorable senators to have full regard to the interests of the States which they represent. We, from Western </para>

        </interjection>
        <para class="block">Australia and Adelaide, were asked whether we should be satisfied if the mail boats passed our shores ; and there is no doubt that we are bound to do the best we can in the interests of our particular States, other things being equal. We are not to sacrifice national interests, but subject to those interests, we ought to do the best we can for our own States; I say that freely and emphatically. On the other hand, I think undue prominence has been given to Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, and to their business, which I hope has been a profitable one. But whether the business has been profitable or not, it has been of distinct advantage to Australia, of which we are citizens. I deprecate many of the remarks which have been made in connexion with Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company. We ought to look at this question, as far as we can, detached from any firm or firms - as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> said, we ought to regard it from the standpoint of the interests of Australia, and from the stand-point of the efficiency of the service, and in the best way to carry out the purposes we all have in view. That being the state of things, and this contract existing in July, 1902, in the hands of a  particular firm, what firm is most likely to have the facilities, the agencies, and establishments to carry out the service? Where are we likely, in a hurry, or at the moment, to get the best service for the purpose of carrying out the objects we have in view ? Why, by taking those who already enjoy a subsidy of &#163;3,600 from New South Wales, and &#163;1,400 from the Commonwealth, in respect of an existing service which everybody admits is wholly inefficient in respect of the area it covers, and is inefficient in respect of regularity. No service is likely to be effectual for the interests of the mails or the trade of Australia, for. the development of our relations with these islands, unless it has the one important feature of regularity. </para>

            <para>- It is my fault that I did not express clearly enough what I meant, and when it is mentioned I do not think that even my honorable friend will trouble about pressing the motion to a division. That was the state of things in July, 1902. Australia was impressed with the condition of things in these islands. It was reminded of the fact that it had not a mail service running to a number of these islands, and that it had not regularity of service. The result of this irregularity was that the foreign ships were encroaching upon what ought to be the preserves of Australia for trade and commerce. Government after Government was urged to do something to extend the service, and to establish it on a regular basis. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> &#39;s Government took the representations into consideration. After investigation, through Captain Razon, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Woodford,</inline> and the other gentleman who has been referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> and quite apart from all commercial considerations, they appealed to persons who could give them an independent judgment, and a large and impartial knowledge of the whole question, and they came to the conclusion that this further extension of this particular island service could only be accomplished on the most economical basis&#39; at an amount which they all agreed should be  &#163;6,000.  It was cut down as far as possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> declared, over and over again, on independent testimony, that that was a fair price, and everybody was satisfied that the only people at this moment who could carry out the service - having everything at their disposal - were Burns, Philp and Company. That position was taken up in January last. </para>

            <para>- They adopted the result of the inquiry and placed a sum on the Estimates for the purpose. The present Government came into office and made an inquiry. We confirmed the views taken up by the two preceding Governments, not necessarily by Cabinet decisions, and adopted their Estimates. What is the mo- 13  f  2 tion before the Committee? It is to strike out the item of  &#163;6,000,  and to absolutely cancel the service, because, being without money, we should not be able to continue the service until Parliament met again. That is the situation in which my honorable friend wishes to place us. </para>

No statesman would think of doing such a thing for a moment. How can we possibly advertise for tenders now ? The conditions are those which Burns, Philp, and Company, in conjunction with three Governments, have decided upon. What should we have to advertise? We could not advertise for tenders to carry mails amongst all these islands simply. We should have to put in conditions. What conditions should be put in ? We should have to put in the conditions which this company and three Governments have agreed upon, and the result, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> said, would be a perfect farce. After the experience of .the next eight or nine months, however, we could alter the conditions as we pleased. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> will tell mv honorable friend at once that it would be a very novel thing if we first of all arranged with a contractor to do a job on certain conditions, and then advertised the conditions. </para>

            <para>- I am not here any more than any honorable senator to attempt to subsidize or give a monopoly to anybody. We are all here to do our best for the interests of Australia. We are not here to give a preference in this matter to Brisbane over Sydney, or to Sydney over Brisbane. But there is one very emphatic reason which appeals to me in regard to Sydney, and that is the fact that it is the centre of this trade. Perhaps we should have to pay a higher subsidy if the terminus were removed to Brisbane or Cooktown. </para>

            <para>- No, it cannot be signed until the money has been voted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> said rightly enough that this is a subsidy. It is a subsidy in its intention for a mail service. We cannot expect this firm to accept our subsidy of any particular amount unless they have trade to help them along. The Peninsular and Oriental Company would not have carried our mails at the price which we have been in the habit of paying, unless they had goods and passengers to carry as well. This is not a subsidy to assist a firm in carrying on their trade. It is a subsidy which is measured and fixed between the contracting parties by reference to the amount which they will be able to make out of their passenger and goods traffic, and which, of course, enables them to carry our mails at a lower figure, and to visit a larger number of islands. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> asked me whether this was a mail subsidy. Of course it is a mail subsidy, but whether it is a mail subsidy or not, it certainly is not a bounty. The idea that &#34;the subsidy is unconstitutional has no foundation. I have said this much, because I feel .that the debate has been an important and interesting one. &#34;Undoubtedly this is a matter that ought to be. ventilated. The views put forward by honorable senators are of great importance and value. I need hardly say that I shall take care that they are put before the Government, and that every care will be taken in the framing of the final agreement and in its conditions to see that the interests of the Commonwealth are thoroughly safeguarded. Even as regards the different States, care will be taken to see that no injustice is done. In fact, as the VicePresident of the Executive Council intimated, tha Prime Minister has already stated as to two of the three alternative mail services, that an arrangement has been made that the vessels shall call at Brisbane. No attempt will be made to slight or pass by Queensland in any respect. But I am perfectly certain that a very much larger sum will be required if the centre of the trade is shifted from Sydney. All these elements have been taken into consideration. The service takes in a very much larger area than our own islands. Of course,  out  mails go to islands that belong to foreign Governments. We cannot limit our mail service to our own Possessions, but must include other places with which we trade. I hope that, looking at this as a practical question, honorable senators will not vote for the amendment, recognising that, in any case, there will be ample opportunity to table a motion, and to reconsider the subject next session. Parliament will not vote the money again if it thinks that the arrangement is detrimental to all the interests concerned. I may add, before sitting down, that the two lines which are to call at Brisbane are the Sydney to Solomon Islands line and the New Guinea line. </para>

          <para>- I think there is a great deal of misapprehension as to the position in which we find ourselves in reference to this question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> has laid down a very sound general principle. Where public money has to be spent on lines that- are distinct, and where ali the conditions are clearly understood, there should be public competition. But that is not so in this case. To start with, there was a contract between a State and the firm of Burns, Philp, and Company. When Federation took place that contract was taken over and extended. Out of the performance of that contract, and out of the negotiations between the Federal Government and the contractor, have grown other suggestions that have been finally adopted by _ the Government ; but adopted in consequence of negotiations with the existing contractor. Now it is under consideration that we should increase &#39;the subsidy for the purpose of developing a more satisfactory trade. The only knowledge we have as to what is possible is what has arisen out of the negotiations between the present contractor and the Government. Therefore it seems reasonable and fair, in these peculiar circumstances, to depart from the sound principle that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> has laid down. Suppose we do this fair thing for the ensuing few months until Parliament meets again, and can deal with the question more fully. We shall then have had several months of the working of this new contract. &#34;We shall have it in a concrete form, so that we shall be able to say whether or not we desire to continue it. We shall have the advantage of experience. But at the present time what we have to consider is, first of all : Is the trade with the islands of sufficient importance to warrant us in paying out of the Commonwealth funds &#163;6,000 as a subsidy ? For this subsidy we get a service for which, supposing there are any number of ships running, we should probably have to pay the same money. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> has been connected with many contracts, and he would Consider it &#39;a monstrously unfair thing that an. ignorant person - and the Commonwealth (Government is in some respects igno-  rant in connexion with this intricate question - should approach a contractor with a view to acquire fuller information in reference to matters in which they were both interested ; and that then, having got the information from the contractor, the person should say, *&#39; Thank you, I am now going to call for tenders on these conditions.&#34; I shall vote for the proposed subsidy, and during the ensuing months I shall take advantage of the opportunity to look into the working of the contract, with the object of seeing whether it should be continued in the future. In the meantime the Government would be acting wrongly if they did not take the stand they are taking. It has been said that the fact that three Governments have acquiesced in this arrangement, is no reason why we should adopt it. I quite agree that that is not a sufficient reason in itself. But the fact that three Governments, with a greater knowledge of the details than we can possibly have, and with, the responsibility of looking into the matter as fully as. they could, have arrived at the conclusion that this is the best that can be done, while it is not proof, is strong presumptive evidence that is the best. </para>

            <para>- I am proud to think that Governments feel their responsibilities and recognise them. It does not matter to me whether it is a Government that T am supporting, or a Government that I am opposing ; we may lay down the principle that Governments in Australia - Commonwealth Governments, at any rate - recognise the responsibility of their positions, and when matters; come before them, which have been decided by previous Governments, hold it to be their duty to investigate and ascertain whether what commended itself to their predecessors commends itself to them. Therefore, for all practical purposes, it . is just the same to me as if this subject had been investigated separately by three Governments. I think it would be to a great extent a breach of faith if we did not vote this subsidy. Consequently I intend to support the Government. </para>

If that were so, Parliament would have absolutely no control over the finances of the country. A Government could bleed the country to any extent at its own sweet will. I refuse to be influenced by a flimsy argument of that kind. We have been told that Burns, Philp and Company are the only people who can efficiently carry out these services. That is not a correct statement, and it would not be made by any one who knows , the circumstances. It should not be stated by any one who is not acquainted with the circumstances, because it is calculated to mislead. </para>

They might have been let separately, and if that had been done, there are other firms that would have been prepared to tender. With regard to the service to New Guinea, there is a Queensland company, Clunn and Sons, already trading between Queensland and New Guinea with a better boat in every respect, than the boat used by Burns, Philp, and Company in the same trade. Clunn and Sons trade with a steamer called the <inline font-style="italic">Papuan,</inline> which is a vessel of 160 tons, or 54 tons larger than the vessel with which Burns, Philp, and Company carry on that trade, and they are prepared to give  a  better service than do Burns, Philp  and  Company, and at little more than half the cost. They are refused a look in at all, and I ask how honorable senators can justify jobbery of this kind, because that is what it is. It has been the desire to cover up jobbery of this kind which has led to the tenders being called in bulk. </para>

He said that, if at this time next year we find that ser vice has not been conducted satisfactorily, we can refuse to vote the money, and the contract will come to an end. We have exactly the same remedy at hand&#39; now, and I propose to take advantage of it. </para>

            <para>- I have already pointed out that so far as the service to New Guinea is concerned, we have another firm ready to jump into the business, and give us the extended service at once,  with  a better steamer than that supplied by Burns, Philp, and Company, and for a little more than half the money which it is proposed we should pay to that firm. What does the Commonwealth owe to Burns, Philp, and Company that it should make them a present of &#163;1,000 for the New Guinea service? That is what is proposed, and it is a scandalous piece of business on the face of it. What are the facts with regard to the New Guinea service? Burns, Philp, and Company propose under their contract merely to serve their own trading stations. They propose to call at Daru, where there are only two Government officers, and two of their own officials. The condition of things is exactly the same at Hall&#39;s Sound, and at various other places at which they propose to call. If our desire is to open up trade with New Guinea, and give the settlers of the Territory an efficient mail se&#39;rvice, we should secure the best boat and the best service offered, and that is the boat and the service offered by Clunn and Sons, of Cooktown. A humble firm like that is entitled to as much consideration from this Committee as is an octopus firm like Burns, Philp, and Company. The AttorneyGeneral has .said that the only people who can carry the whole thing out are Burns, Philp, and Company; but I point out that there is no necessity for us to intrust the carrying out of the whole thing to any one firm. The point I make is that we should be likely to get a better service by dividing the proposed service into three separate contracts ; one for a service to the Solomon Islands, another for a service to the New Hebrides, and the third for a service with British New Guinea. However much honorable senators may sneer at the  160-ton  boat provided by Clunn and Sons, it i* at all events, superior to the boat which is used by Burns, Philp, and Company in the same service. </para>

I have before said that by my amendment I do not propose to interfere with the  &#163;3,000  a year which New South Wales is contributing in this matter.

As the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs may pay a visit to New Guinea, he will have the opportunity to make inquiries as to whether this saving could be effected. I am indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> for pointing out another argument, the strength of which I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has realized. Honorable senators from Queensland have exhibited a great deal of opposition to the contract; but I would point out to them that when the first  &#163;6,000  was paid there were three services, all of which had to start from Sydney. Then I understand Queensland put in a claim, and the then Prime Minister arranged for two additional services, the steamers of which were to call at Brisbane. It is for those additional services that the extra  &#163;6,000  is being paid, so that Queensland is getting almost the whole of the benefit of the money. </para>

It is not fair for an honorable senator to move that the salaries of any officers be left out, when he has not the slightest knowledge of the work which they have to do. Either the officers in the Public Service are doing their work efficiently, or they should not be where they are. The services of this particular officer have been of the greatest value to the Senate in facilitating the transaction of public business. The AttorneyGeneral might have a secretary and &#39; other officers at his command, but he could not always go to his office. The gentleman whose salary we are asked to omit does work in the Attorney-General&#39;s office. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> would only make a little inquiry before he attacks individual positions I do not believe that he would hurt the feelings of any officer in the Public Service. </para>

            <para>- I know nothing about the officer. I was speaking in an entirely impersonal way. I have no desire to hurt the feelings of any one, but I have a public duty to discharge. If I think that an officer is superfluous, it is my duty to express my view, and if it can be shown to me that his services are absolutely necessary, then, of course, I shall admit that I am in the wrong. I was under the impression that the Prime Minister had no private secretary, but I find that he has, and I suppose that the leader of the Government here must be equipped in a similar fashion. </para>

When the first estimates of the High Court were under consideration, I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> whether there would have to be a registrar in each State, and he replied most emphatically that it would not be necessary, as an officer in the State would be able to do the small amount of work required to be done. That answer appears to be wrong, or else these two items are unnecessary. I desire to know whether it is necessary to have a clerk in the district registry in Sydney, as well as a clerk in the principal registry here; whether there are twenty or thirty, or forty cases in Sydney in the year, and, if so, whether a register of that small number is required? </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator O&#39;Connor&#39;s</inline>answer was perfectly correct. We have a district registry in each .State, except Victoria, where there is, of course, the principal registry. None of the district registrars in the States, other than New South Wales, is paid, because there is very little business to do in Tasmania, Western Australia, South Australia, and Queensland. There is business to be done in some of the States, but very little, and, therefore, there is no fixed rate. In Victoria and New South Wales, however, there is a very large amount of business, and it is absolutely essential that there should be a registrar in Melbourne and Sydney. The remuneration which is made to them is, I think, infinitesimal in comparison with their duties. It ought to be more. </para>

            <para>- The amount voted for last financial year was &#163;1,900, and it was exceeded by &#163;54. &#163;1,954 was the expenditure for eight months, or the period during which the Court was in existence in the last financial year. For the current year it is practically the same amount that we are asked to vote. Of course, in the first year the travelling expenses were rather more, because of the course adopted of going to the different States in order to inaugurate the High Court. During the present year circuits will only take place when there is business to be transacted. Therefore, the amounthere is literally a third less than it was last year. </para>

          <para>- 1 cannot help expressing my regret that this schedule should be crushed&#39; into the end of the session when we cannot give to it that consideration to which it is entitled. I know something about the public works of one of the States, and from that experience I think that Parliament ought to be supplied with fuller information as to what officers are employed, the work which they supervise, and the cost per cent, of the supervision. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has made the suggestion, and I would emphasize it, that we should have an annual report from the Public Works Department, giving an account of the work done. I hope that the leader of the Senate will take that into consideration. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DOBSON</inline>(Tasmania). - I have always  been dissatisfied with this Public Works Department. I see that in addition to the Inspector-General, provision is made for the salary of a Superintendent of Works for New South Wales, and a similar officer in Victoria, at salaries, of &#163;600 each. If these officers are necessary, I do not complain of their salaries, because we need to have men of professional experience. But the point which I wish to make is that we should, as far as possible, work through States officers.&#34; We have withdrawn from the control of the States Departments, the Defence, Post-office, and </para>
        <para class="block">Customs buildings. Therefore, the States officers have less to do than formerly. Many of us objected to the appointment of. an Inspector-General, thinking that the States officers could do the greater part of the work. I am aware, of course, that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, when he was Minister of Home Affairs, said that he would not be responsible for public works that were carried out under officers who were not in his own control. If the Federal Parliament takes that view, there will be no such thing as bringing about harmony between the States and the Commonwealth. We ought to endeavour to use the States Public Works officers as far as possible, paying the States a 6 per cent, commission, which is a generous one. I could build a new house if I could afford it, paying 5 per cent, to an architect, and getting everything done. </para>

            <para>- No doubt, it includes the use of scaffolding, and that kind of thing, but -still, 6 per cent, is a very generous amount indeed. There is  great  room for extravagance under the present bastard system, under which we give 6 per cent, to States for carrying out some works, whilst other works are carried out under the direction of three important Commonwealth officers at high salaries. Is it the duty of the Superintendent of Works in New South Wales and in Victoria to overlook and inspect buildings in connexion with which we pay the 6 per cent, commission charge? if it is, we are paying through the nose for this work under the bastard system adopted. In my opinion, this Department is making for extravagance, and not for economy </para>

            <para>- The Department is not making for extravagance, and it is making for economy. If the honorable and learned senator had studied the matter with a little more minuteness, he would have found that we are gradually doing what he desires should be done. It could not all be done in one day, and honorable senators will remember that there was the very greatest possible reluctance displayed against the creation of new Commonwealth Departments. There was very great objection urged to the establishment of any Commonwealth Public Works Department. For a considerable time, under the Barton Government, we struggled along in a hand-to-mouth way as best we could, but as time has gone on, we have been  able to establish a Department, and we are now doing for ourselves a great deal of the work in respect of which the 6 per cent, commission had previously to be paid. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> imagines that these officers are appointed at salaries of &#163;600 a vear each to walk about the streets with their  hands in their pockets, he is entirely mistaken. There is still some work which has to be done in the old way, but these officers have a great deal of work to do, and they relieve the Commonwealth of expense which was previously incurred in the payment of the commission to which reference was made. </para>

            <para>- This vote of &#163;90,000 has no relation whatever to what I may call the structural works and buildings, dealt with by the Bill we had under consideration the other day. That Bill dealt with new works, whilst the honorable senator will find that the item on which this vote will be expended are set out in detail, and cover rent, repairs, maintenance, fittings, and furniture. </para>

          <para>- A vote of &#163;3,000 is put down to make provision for Sydney Government House, and I should like to know whether this provision is made in respect of what is knownas the State Government House at Sydney, or a distinctly&#39; separate building, used only for the purposes of the Commonwealth. We find here such items as &#34; Maintenance of house, &#163;500 ; maintenance of grounds, &#163;1,000 ; telephones, &#163;100; postal charges, &#163;50; fittings and furniture, &#163;100 ; flags, &#163;25 ; lighting on public occasions and for offices, &#163;250, included in the total vote of &#163;3,000.&#39;&#39;&#39;&#34; I believe that at the inception of the Commonwealth it was necessary that Sydney Government House should be used by the Governor-General, who stayed in that city for some time. But since the first and second Governors-General have departed the place has been used as a residence only on odd occasions. The Governor-General, how- ever, visits other States besides the State of New South Wales, and I should like to know whether it is the intention of the Government to provide him with official residences in those States. Why should one State be singled out for special treatment? The Governor-General must, of course, have a residence in Victoria while the Seat of Government remains in Melbourne. If we maintain a separate establishment for him in New South Wales, we should do the same thing in Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania, which he intends, I understand, to visit in the near future. </para>

            <para>- If the money is paid in respect to a Government House used by the State authorities as well as by the Governor-General, I would like to know why similar arrangements are not made in regard to the other States, all of which the Governor-General is expected to visit. Is the Commonwealth committed in perpetuity to the maintenance of a Government House in New South Wales merely for the pleasure of a few people in that State? This seems to be like throwing a sop to Cerberus. We are trying to placate the people of New South Wales, who are dissatisfied because the Seat of Government is not fixed in Sydney, and cannot be located within a hundred miles of that city. Does the Governor-General visit New South Wales more than any other State ? </para>

            <para>- Is there anyreason why he should do so? Victoria is the State in which he is domiciled. Even if he visits New South Wales more frequently than he visits the other States, why should we maintain a residence for him there all the year round ? How many months in the year has the present Governor-General resided in Sydney? He has been in Queensland for a longer period,I think, than in New South Wales. Is there any reason why we should provide &#163;250 for the lighting of a Government House which is used only occasionally or &#163;20 for flags, or &#163;100 for china and glass, and &#163;1,000 for the maintenance of the grounds. Surely the Government of New South Wales is able to extend hospitality to the Governor-General when he visits that State, and does not expect the Commonwealth to provide &#163;3,000 to relieve her of that responsibility. I venture to say that when the Governor-General re cently visited Queensland the Government of that State, on behalf of its people, put its hand into the Treasury and extended to him a welcome suited to his dignity. Similarly, when he goes to Tasmania, as he will do shortly, the Government of Tasmania will supplement the private hospitality of the Governor of that State, and treat him in a manner befitting his high position. But why should the Commonwealth provide him with a house at an expense of &#163;3,000 a year for the rare occasions whenhe visits New South Wales? We. should take a stand against this expenditure, and determine that there shall be only one Governor-General&#39;s establishment, known as the Government House of the Commonwealth, and situated where the Seat of Government is. While the Seat of Government remains temporarily in Victoria the Commonwealth Government House should be in Melbourne, and when a Federal Territory is chosen in New South Wales, and the Seat of Government is fixed there, the Commonwealth Government House should be there, and there only. </para>

I would, in the first place, inform the honorable and learned senator that the vote is for the maintenance of a residence which is used exclusively and solely by the Governor-General. Not only did the people of New South Wales put their Government House at the disposal of the Commonwealth free of rent, we merely maintaining it- </para>

The Federation was inaugurated in New South Wales, and there had to be special provision made for the Governor-General ; and to disallow this item now would be, it seems to me, to break the agreement. </para>

            <para>- But I urge on honorable senators the necessity to give consideration to the question of when the present arrangement shall be terminated, or when similar provision shall be made in the other States. At present the actual Seat of Government is in Victoria; but, according to the Constitution, there must be a time when that arrangement shall come to an end. There should be in the near future a termination of an arrangement which was necessary at first, but is not necessary now. At any rate, if the arrangement is necessary in a degree now it will cease to be necessary in a very short period. I hope the Government will consider this question, and, by next session, they may perhaps tell us when this dual expenditure is to end. </para>

          <para>- There is a good deal of force in the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> It has been stated that the Governor-General spends considerably more time in New South Wales than he does in some of the other States. That may be so, but the present arrangement was apparently made at the inauguration of Federation, when economy did not seem to be ex-  ercised in connexion with the office of GovernorGeneral. In my opinion, all the States should be placed on an equal footing. I do not suppose for a moment that the Government of New South Wales &#34;make&#34; anything out of the particular amount placed on the Estimates. A separate residence has to be provided for the State Governor at Rose Bay, so that I suppose their expenditure is quite equal to the amount received from the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- It may cost more, but, at the same time, when the GovernorGeneral visits any of the other States, I understand that he is entertained by the States Governors, and that the States&#39; Treasuries assist in bearing the expense. Apart from the fact that this system was apparantly inaugurated at the establishment of the Commonwealth&#34;, I do not know that there is any particular reason why these items should continue to appear on the Estimates year &#39;after year. The AttorneyGeneral admits that there is a great deal in the contention that the States should be placed on the one footing in this regard. I suppose that when the Governor-General is located at the Federal Capital, Melbourne will not look to the Federal Government to ask Parliament to vote a considerable sum each year for the maintenance of the Government House, which is now occupied by  His Excellency. </para>

            <para>- It is quite possible that there may be some contention on the subject. It may be urged that the same consideration should be extended to Melbourne that has been extended to Sydney. But I feel satisfied that when that time comes there will be a big majority in the Senate, if not in the other House, who will be opposed to such a discrimination being shown in favour of a State. I feel quite satisfied that the Parliament will not approve of the Government placing on the Estimates items for the purpose of obliging a few society persons, who look upon the GovernorGeneral as a sort of pivot round which to revolve. The Government ought to seriously consider whether it is not wise to bring to an end a custom which was introduced at the establishment of the Commonwealth, and to make a definite statement of their intentions next session. We cannot expect these items to be removed suddenly from these Estimates, because a contract has been entered into, and one-half of the money has been already spent. As regards the second half of the year, the servants are under engagement for a term, and notice would have to be given to New South Wales that the understanding as to the use of Government House would terminate on the 30th June, 1905. If that is the position which the Attorney-General takes up it ought to be satisfactory for the time being, and next year we may expect to find no such items appearing on the Estimates. </para>

            <para>- It does not matter what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has said. No obligation to incur the whole of this expenditure has been placed upon us. There is no necessity to give a servant or a caretaker six months&#39; notice, nor is there any occasion to give any notice to the New South Wales Government, because the building is rent free. There have only been obligations incurred in respect to a portion of this money. All this talking about economy is simply useless, if we are not prepared to back up our words by our votes. I intend to call for a division, if I can only get an honorable senator to support me, because it is grossly unfair to the taxpayers to keep up this extravagant expenditure mainly for the benefit of society people in Sydney, who want a sort of circle round which to revolve, and to which the general taxpayers are never called. If society people in Sydney want this social centre, there is no earthly objection to their paving for the privilege, but to ask the taxpayers, who in very many cases are enduring great hardship and suffering, to pay &#163;3,000 a year for that purpose is very unfair. Ifit is right to expend this money in the interest of Sydney people, it is equally right to adopt this policy at Hobart, Perth, Adelaide, and Brisbane. In the case of a proposal to which he is opposed, the AttorneyGeneral can always discover constitutional difficulties. I ask him if this item is not a discrimination between one State and the others. </para>

We have not yet been able to wipe out completely the local jealousies which prevailed. To reduce this vote suddenly would have a tendency to cause bad feeling. The AttorneyGeneral has admitted that this system on the face of it contains the essence of inequity, that it cannot be continued, that it grew upon the Commonwealth under circumstances which are quite inexcusable. He has promised, I understand, to give consideration to the matter with a view to submitting a recommendation on the subject next year. In view of the extraordinary circumstances in which the Commonwealth was inaugurated, that is all we can ask. I again strongly urge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> not to call for a division, as to do so might intensify the feeling that we know to exist between New South Wales and Victoria. I do not think there is any justification for that feeling, but we know that it exists, and we ought not needlessly to do anything to increase it. </para>

He has agreed in substance with my criticism, and I feel sure that after the debate that has taken place, the Government will recognise the advisableness of reconsidering the whole division, and of discontinuing the present policy. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> that it is practicable for the House of Representatives to reduce this item now. As pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> it would be extremely awkard and inconvenient to do so. We should be disturbing the arrangement made with New South Wales, which has incurred considerable expense in connexion with the Sydney Government House. I am perfectly satisfied with the views expressed by the Attorney-General, and I am not prepared to do anything which may be impracticable in making a request to the other House, to which effect &#39; cannot be given. The House of Representatives will be compelled to recognise that a change in policy cannot be made immediately. At least something like six months&#39; notice must be given to New South Wales. I trust that the Government will recognise what the feeling is, and that in future there will be only one Governor-General&#39;s residence in the Commonwealth. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GIVENS</inline>(Queensland). - We are all agreed that some reform is necessary in this and other matters. But a large number of persons who profess to be in favour of reform, always want to see it carried out next year. They are never in favour of it here and now. We have nothing to do with next year. Some of us may be dead. Yet we are to shelve our responsibilities until next year. Our duty is to see that this reform is effected now. &#34; What is the use of our saying that reforms ought to be carried out, and that economies ought to be effected in the interests of the States which are suffering the pangs of retrenchment, when we do nothing to give effect to our views by our votes ? Even if I stand alone. I shall call for a division. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator TURLEY</inline>(Queensland).  -  I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is right in insisting on a division, though I do not intend to vote with him. Any one who holds strong opinions regarding matters of this sort, and who thinks it to be necessary to move for the reduction of an item, ought to push his motion to a division. But the reason why I do not intend to vote with my honorable friend, is that I recognise that the New South Wales State Government House has been handed over to the Commonwealth as a residence for the Governor- General. The New South Wales Government have entered into obligations with private people. They have rented a house for their State Governor. We know perfectly well that they could not rent a house of that kind for a week. They could not give a week&#39;s notice, and say, &#34; We will clear out next Saturday.&#34; The expense must continue so far as they are concerned. What is more, we cannot save more than a few pounds in the upkeep of the establishment in Sydney. We must maintain people to look after the House and grounds. If we were to dismiss all the men engaged in the grounds at the present time, at the end of six months we should find that it would cost more to put them in repair again than it will cost to keep them in good order all the time. It should be satisfactory for honorable senators to know, onthe word of the Attorney-General, that next year we shall not be asked to vote a sum of money to give preferential consideration to one State over that which is afforded to every other State in the Union. </para>

But I am sorry that they do not go further. They appear to think that when the next Estimates come before us, this (item will be omitted. What reasons have they to anticipate anything of the kind? The Attorney-General has stated that the Government will consider the matter. No doubt they will, and that they will decide to continue to maintain the Sydney Government House. I wish to point out to honorable senators who are opposed to this expenditure that the only way in which they can signify their disapproval is by supporting the amendment. Anything they may say here in the course of debatewill not for a moment be considered by the Government, and unless honorable senators are perpared to back up their statements by their votes, they are simply wasting time. </para>

            <para>- I have no hesitation in saying that the Attorney-General is now laughing in his sleeve. I find that&#39; since the establishment of the Commonwealth we have spent no less a sum than  &#163;25,980  in maintaining the Government Houses in Melbourne and Sydney.I suppose that nearly half of this amount has been expended in Sydney, and practically wasted. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GIVENS</inline>(Queensland). - I note that an amount of  &#163;800  is set down for maintenance, including a contribution towards the erection of a fireplace, at Government House, Melbourne. The fireplace in question must surely be a costly one to merit special notice. Further, I would direct attention to the fact that we are contributing only a portion of the expense. I see that&#39;  &#163;500  is set down for expenditure upon caretakers, charwomen, and miscellaneous services. I venture to say it would be interesting to have the detailed items of this vote, that we might compare the salaries paid to caretakers and charwomen with those paid to certain other officials. It is just as important that we should have before us&#39; the actual salary paid to the humblest individual in the employ of the Commonwealth as that we should have before us the salary paid, even to the Governor-General himself. Caretakers, charwomen, and miscellaneous expenditure are bundle^ together, and I ask whether honorable senators, who come here representing the whole community and not a particular section, are willing to allow this to pass without a protest. I hope the Attorney-General will be able to give us some satisfactory explanation of why these people are treated in this way. </para>
