                        <para>- I should like to_ ask the Minister of Defence a question without notice. I wish to know whether his attention has been drawn to the following statement, which appears in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of yesterday&#39;s date, and if so, what is his opinion in regard to it. I may add that I learn that this statement is said to have been made by an Australian senator, and been sent to an English paper, by which it has been published. The passage to which I refer is as follows: - </para>

                        <para>The people of Australia have now an ingrained belief that an Australian astride anything with four legs, is, i? possessed of a rifle and a pillowcase full of cartridges, a match for an indefinite number of the best trained soldiers of any nation under heaven. This unhappy mania is shared and propagated by members of Parliament and Ministers of the Crown. The late Minister for Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, G.C.M.G., recently declared in Parliament that if he had not rifles enough for the forces, he would &#34;arm them with pick-axes or something ;&#34; and the present Minister states that should England become involved in the Eastern war he intends to raise the number of rifle club members from 36,000 to 50,000, though well knowing there are not rifles available for even the existing regiments if extended to their war establishments. The Minister apparently prefers undisciplined, unorganized mobs, with rifles of every possible pattern, but minus ammunition, and destitute of officers, .to drilled, disciplined, armed, and officered soldiers ! With such ideas permeating the community, what prospect is there of Australia developing a sound system of military, let alone naval, defence? </para>

                        <para>- I am much obliged to the honorable senator for having given me notice that he intended to ask this question. I desire to say in reply that the matter referred to has come under my observation, and I was astonished and somewhat grieved to find an officer somewhat high in the military service, and a citizen high in the councils of the Commonwealth, attaching his name to statements which are manifestly incorrect both as regards the state of our equipment and the policy of my predecessors, and the administration generally. The absurdity of the whole statement is best refuted by a perusal of it. </para>

Neild.</inline> I understand that the Senate contemplates adjourning for a period of two or three weeks. The Select Committee have been devoting attention to their duties for some time past, and are desirous, if possible, during the interval, to proceed with their work so far as concerns the taking of evidence. It has been ascertained that a number of honorable senators will be distributed over the Commonwealth, and we desire to obtain the leave of the Senate to make three the quorum of the Committee instead of four. I therefore ask leave to move a motion to that effect without notice. </para>

                <para class="block">I wish to point out the necessity for introducing a Supply Bill at this stage. The amount proposed to be voted is &#163;137,216. The. sum of &#163;110,463 is due to the transferred services, and ,&#163;26,753 is due to &#34;other&#34; expenditure; that is to say, expenditure which may be attributed to Federation. The measure is introduced because the Treasurer desires to meet certain accounts that may fall due before the end of the year, and also in order that the officers of the Treasury may have an opportunity of finishing their work in an efficient manner before the 30th June. If the Senate adjourns for a week or two, it will be rather late when we resume to pass a Bill of this character, if the officers are to have time to do their work in a satisfactory manner. We may be asked, &#34; Why is so much money required at this stage?&#34; On inquiry, I find that in the Defence Department very large savings indeed have been made. They are equivalent to about &#163;100,000. In other Departments, notably the Department of Home Affairs - which is one of the large spending Departments of the Commonwealth - a saving of about &#163;106,000 has been effected. Honorable senators will see that we are not actually spending more than has been appropriated for the services of the year. Of the money proposed to be spent, nearly &#163;130,000 was agreed to by the late Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, and about ^10,000 has been sanctioned by the present Treasurer. Honorable senators will find in the schedule annexed to the Bill full particulars concerning the expenditure. It is not necessary for me to enter into details at present, but when we are considering the schedule, if any honorable senator wishes to obtain information with respect to the particular items, I shall do all I can to furnish it. I hope that the Bill will be passed as speedily as possible. </para>

                    <para>- I would point out to the Senate that this is not an ordinary Supply Bill such as we usually pass at the commencement of a new financial year. It is virtually a Supplementary Supply Bill, which authorizes the expenditure of amounts in excess of the current year&#39;s Estimates. Although the Vice-President of the Executive Council has informed us that considerable savings have been made in two Departments, still it has to be remembered that the money voted by this measure is in addition to the Estimates which we passed last year. </para>

                        <para>- There are a number of excess, votes. Whether those excesses are justifiable it is not for me to say. I am not in a position to analyze the items. In these matters we must trust the Government. After what the Vice-President has said we must expect, however, that the Treasury will come out on the right side on the year&#39;s transactions. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Another sum of &#163;9,500 is required to provide for increased payments for the carriage of mails in Western Australia. The Railway Department of that State thought that the amount paid for this purpose was not in proportion to that which was paid in other States, and a demand was made for an increased payment, which, of course, has been agreed to. There are several smaller amounts asked for in connexion with this Department, which honorable senators will see were absolutely necessary to fulfil the obligations to its servants, and to those doing work for it. We must recollect that this is one of the Departments in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, in which probably the largest expenditure is incurred. The items I have mentioned, and others which can be gathered from a perusal of the schedule, show the necessity for the Department to have a large sum of money in its control. </para>

                    (Queensland).- In that case the travelling expenses of the Judges and their Associates will amount to &#163;1,900 for the year, and probably we shall be told, by-and-by, that there has been some other expenditure which was not foreseen. In round figures, the travelling expenses for the three Judges and their Associates will amount to &#163;2,000 for the year. It is very necessary and desirable that the Judges should be paid a salary in proportion to the distinguished services which they render, and in accordance with the dignity of their position. A liberal travelling allowance should be provided so that they may be able to travel in accordance with the dignity of their position, but &#163;2,000 is an inordinately large expenditure for the amount of travelling, which the three Judges have to do. I venture to say that all the members of the Senate do not spend more than &#163;2,000 a year on travelling expenses. I believe that if the Judges had to pay their travelling expenses out of their own pockets, they would not spend anything like the amount which we are asked to vote, and, therefore, they have no right to incur unnecessary expenditure at the cost of the taxpayers. I do not speak in a carping spirit, but I have noticed that in all the States men in high positions who have been entitled to charge the taxpayers with their travelling expenses have generally been very extravagant in that regard. I hope that the Estimates for next year will be framed more in consonance with the ideas of economy expressed by the Government, and desired by the taxpayers. I enter my protest against such a very large sum being spent for travelling expenses, and I hope that a more moderate scale will be adopted.

                    <para>- The reason why these travelling expenses have been more than was anticipated, is that the Judges of the High Court have had to travel from State to State. A very small sum was asked for in the first place for travelling expenses, but it was &#39;found that if the Court was to sit in each State, and move about from State to State, the Judges must incur in the aggregate somewhat heavy travelling expenses. </para>

                        <para>- It includes the actual expenses of the Judges and their Associates while travelling. Of course, if the Judges are not to be allowed to incur travelling expenses it will mean that the Court will have to sit in one State, and all the cases will have to be brought to that State, which I submit is not advisable. I think that the present plan of the Court moving from State to State has given very great satisfaction to the Commonwealth. </para>

                    (Queensland).- I consider it very desirable and necessary that the Judges should travel from State to State. But I contend that this large sum need not be spent for travelling expenses. If the Judges had to defray their own travelling expenses they would adopt a much more moderate scale. I trust that they will moderate their demand on the funds of the taxpayers in this direction.

                    <para>- I desire to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> for an explanation of the item of &#163;2,590 for expenses in connexion with choosing the site of the Capital of the Commonwealth. This is, I think, . the third or fourth tune that we have seen an item on the Estimates for this purpose. I wish to know if this last payment is for the further reports which were laid upon the table a few weeks ago. </para>

                        <para>- In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> I have to say that the cost of the elections in New South Wales would be about &#163;18,000, not &#163;47,500, and that a sum of &#163;1,000 was paid by the State to the Commonwealth for taking the referendum. Whether that is a fair proportion or not I cannot say, but if we had had to carry out the Federal elections apart from this referendum we should have had to pay exactly the same amount. I think that the Commonwealth were rather fortunate in afterwards getting a rebate of &#163;1.000. Senator Staniforth Smith. - The amount really represents the extra expense the Commonwealth was put to in carrying out the elections. </para>

                        <para>- I am informed that &#163;129 is the total amount. The expenditure of &#163;2,000 in connexion with the Federal Capital sites includes not only the cost of reports, but also &#163;300, a portion of the cost of the Royal Commission which was appointed. Senators Dobson, Smith, and others were extremely anxious to obtain cart-loads of reports, and, apparently, at that time never thought about the cost ; and I do&#39; not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> should now raise objection when all are agreed that the most complete information must entail a certain expenditure. </para>

A number of honorable senators and members of another place have visited some of the sites since the previous amount under this head was voted ; and, seeing the Government acted very liberally in this connexion, it is also likely that liberality will be shown to others who desire to complete their education by personal inspection. This is the way in which the &#163;2,000 have been spent, and, having regard to previous amounts under this head, I think the present one is not unreasonable. </para>

                    (Queensland).- While I agree that the conduct of the Common wealth elections, considering the time the officers had to prepare for it, and the amount of work to be done, was very good indeed, and gave almost universal satisfaction, there were particular instances in which the services rendered were not all that could be desired, and which call for some action on the part of the Government. The Electoral Act provides, in the first place, every possible precaution to insure the secrecy of the ballot; and it was the duty of the officers concerned to carry out the law, not only in the letter, but the spirit. We find, however, that in many instances everything was done which the Act said should .not be done, and, sp far as I know, the Government have taken no action in the way of inquiry or punishment.

                        <para>- Be that as it may, honorable senators &#39;have the right to criticise at this stage, and that right I intend to exercise. In a number of places in the Herbert electorate in North Queensland, where from six to ten votes were registered, the ballot papers, instead of being bulked with the votes from other polling places, were, notwithstanding the express provision of the Act, counted separately by the presiding officers at each particular booth. The result was that the electors, knowing that such an arrangement would be carried out, were absolutely driven to vote in consonance with the wishes of those who possessed any control over them. In the case of the schooner <inline font-style="italic">Alice,</inline> the whole of the available nine votes were cast in one particular way, simply because of the arrangement to which I am directing attention. At Lucinda, on the Herbert River, where the whole of the electors are in the employ, or .under the influence, of the Colonial Sugar&#39; Refining Company, only nine or ten votes were cast, and were counted in the same way. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly ; and the Government ought to see that nothing of the kind occurs in the future. If the electoral officials failed to perform their duty, it is for the Commonwealth to see that they are adequately punished for &#39;their gross breaches of the law. What is the good of a law unless it be enforced? At Stannery Hill the polling practically amounted to open voting, owing either to the ignorance or to the wilful misconduct of the presiding officer, who, in some cases, actually went the length of writing the voter&#39;s name across the ballotpaper before handing it to the voter. These matters have been brought under the notice of the authorities, but no action has been taken. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The cases I have quoted are only a few amongst a number, particularly in the Queensland electorates of Herbert and Cook, where the grossest irregularities were permitted. Unless the Government take care to see that the law is properly enforced, we can never have a fair and honest election. I respectfully suggest that something should be done to prevent these grave irregularities, so that the electors may exercise a free and untrammelled choice of representatives. </para>

                    (Tasmania).- Is it correct that at the present time a number of officers in several of the States have not yet been paid for services which they rendered during the elections. I know personally, that up to a fortnight or three weeks ago, some officers who gave their services a.t the December elections in Tasmania had not received their allowances, although they&#39; had written repeatedly to the Department. I notice in the press to-day a reference to similar cases in Victoria. If it be correct that there are unpaid claims of this character, when may the officers expect to receive the allowances to which they are entitled ?

                        <para>- The explanation is very simple. During last year the grounds of both Government Houses were neglected, there being an idea on the part of the Federal Government that the work would be attended to by the States Governments. The result was that the amount allowed to the Governor-General under this head was not nearly expended in that year; but, during the present year, it is absolutely necessary for the Commonwealth to undertake the work which was neglected by the State. We must remember, however, that the amount in excess this year is counterbalanced by the amount saved the previous year; and I have no doubt that the expenditure in this connexion will be kept within statutory limits. </para>

                    (Tasmania). - I notice that, under the heading of the Department of Home Affairs, no provision is made for the cost of nautical surveys, and I desire to bring under the notice of the Government, as a matter for consideration, one case to which my attention was called some time ago. As far back as October last the steamer
                    <inline font-style="italic">Wakatipu,</inline>
                    trading between Launceston and Sydney, encountered, when in Bass Strait, a sunken shoal which was not marked on the Admiralty chart. The mercantile community and others interested in sea communication between Sydney and Northern Tasmania desired to have the locality re-charted, in order to discover what danger there was, and I approached the late Prime Minister on the matter. The Admiral on this station was written to, and he agreed that an early survey .was desirable, but pointed out that he had no ship available at the time. Weeks went by, during which the Government were endeavouring to have some action taken; and the Admiral suggested that the people of Tasmania might do something, as, indeed, they were prepared to do if they were properly compensated.

                        <para>- That question suggests the reason of my present remarks. &#39; I mention the subject because this is a matter which concerns the whole of Australia. The uncharted rock is right in the fairway of Bass Strait, and may be encountered by&#39; ships of other lines. The matter remained in abeyance until the visit of the Fleet to Hobart, in the latter part of January. The Admiral then told off two of the ships to attend some function at Launceston, and he decided that on their return they should take steps to have the locality surveyed. On the way from Launceston to Hobart, two vessels went to the vicinity and waited there for a few hours. They said, however, that it was too rough for them to do anything in the way of surveying, and went on to Hobart. It was suggested, I do not know with what truth, that the reason why the two vessels hastened away, was in order that the officers might attend some function, or fulfil certain social engagements that some of them had made in Hobart. They did not even wait until the sea had moderated sufficiently to enable them to put down their boats. Nothing has been done since then. I again approached the Prime Minister in connexion with the matter, and the Admiral has since stated that he cannot de tail a ship to do the work, though he quite agrees that the spot should be charted so that people who trade in those seas may know the dangers to be avoided. He suggested that the Marine Board of Launceston might do something. I approached them, and they said that they were prepared fully to equip a tug and crew to carry out the work. But the question was who was to bear the expense of doing it ? </para>

                        <para>- If the Admiralty supply, information which is incorrect, as we have every reason to believe is the case in connexion with this locality, some remedy should be available. In other words, the Admiralty charts are inaccurate in this respect; and masters trading in these waters, and following the Admiralty charts, are likely to encounter unexpected shoals and bring their ships to disaster. The Admiralty have always in commission one or two ships for surveying purposes, and are constantly carrying out surveying work in these seas. Surely this locality, which is right in the fairway between Sydney and the northern ports of Tasmania, should receive some attention from surveying vessels. Therefore, I trust that the Government will approach the Admiral, and ask him to devote attention to this locality as soon as he can. As I have shown, he sent two ships to the spot, but they stayed only a few hours, and did nothing. By that act the Admiral admitted responsibility to correct the. Admiralty&#39;s charts. </para>

There is nothing very extraordinary in that, when we remember that the conditions, both in New South Wales and Queensland, in respect to the sugar crop, were very different last year from what they were in the previous year. There was much more to be done, and consequently more assistance was required. </para>

It will be seen that it makes a very important difference whether the daily wage is reckoned as a 1-3 13th or a 1 -365th part of a man&#39;s salary.

I find that a sum of &#163;2,050 has been paid by the Post and Telegraph Department on account of duties for this company. The public ought to know what arrangement has been made that involves these payments.

                        <para>- The explanation is that, prior to&#39; Federation, there was an agreement between the Eastern Extension Company and the South Australian, Tasmanian, and New South Wales Governments, under; which the company was exempt from Customs duties with respect to material and plant. The Commonwealth, of course, had to take over the obligations of the States. That is the reason why we are compelled to refund Customs duties on behalf of the three States mentioned. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly, and the company can decline, to agree to terminate an agreement. It opens up the question as to whether a State, prior to Federation, had the right to contract with any individual, inside or outside the State, that he could for all time import certain articles without paying duty. The Attorney-General ought to be asked for an opinion as to whether this agreement, so far as these clauses are concerned, is binding on the Commonwealth for all time. </para>

                    I venture to suggest that the explanation is simple enough. Like New South Wales and Tasmania, South Australia had an agreement with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. The State, in effect, said to the company - &#34; If you carry out this part of your agreement in connexion with giving us cable facilities with the old world, any goods which you mav import into South Australia&#34; - not into Australia, as

                        <para>- Each State said to the company - &#34; You can import goods into our State free of duty, and your ships will be exempt from wharfage and harbor dues and such charges,&#34; while, in addition, Tasmania said - &#34; Your buildings and land shall be exempt from land tax.&#34; After the establishment of the Commonwealth, and the transfer of the Customs Departments, Australia became one fiscal area, instead of six fiscal areas. The agreement with South Australia is still binding on South Australia, but in the State there is a new fiscal authority, whose jurisdiction ranges throughout all Australia, and which says to the company - &#34; When you import goods to South Australia you must pay the Commonwealth duties.&#39;1 The company replies - &#34; Well, we must pay the duties,&#34; and turning to South Australia, they say - &#34; The agreement we had with you is still in .operation. You agreed that when we imported goods here they should come in duty free, but the Commonwealth now prevents us from importing our goods free.&#34; &#34;Very well,&#34; says South Australia - &#34;You must pay the duties, and we shall have to refund you the amount.&#34; Accordingly South Australia has to refund to the company, in accordance with the obligation which it incurred prior to Federation, and it is nobody else&#39;s trouble but that State&#39;s. As to the allocation of this sum, I suppose that it is debited to the Postmaster- General&#39;s Department, simply because these goods are imported in connexion with the postal and telegraphic relations of the Commonwealth. That is the one Department of the Commonwealth, as it was of a State, which can be associated with such a company, and the proper Department in South Australia to be debited with an expenditure of this character. It is simply because we have changed the fiscal area that the Commonwealth can now say to the company what South Australia could not say, prior to Federation. But, as regards the question of what powers the States had, prior to Federation, of binding the Commonwealth interminably, I cannot see how it can engage our consideration now. We can. only deal with each case on its merits. The obligations that the States contracted with the company are not binding on the Commonwealth as a whole. The particular State which incurred the obligations alone has to bear the burden of them now. </para>

                <para class="block"><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir WILLIAM</inline> ZEAL (Victoria). - Whatever may be the result of the allocation of these moneys to the different States, I think it should be known that this position was caused partly by a breach of agreement. Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria, and probably Western Australia, agreed to respect obligations they had entered into with the Pacific Cable Board, and it was a receding from that agreement which brought about &#34;this trouble. That being the case, it is manifestly unfair that the Commonwealth should have to bear this expenditure, however, it may be allocated. If South Australia chooses to make a bargain which is not just, she should pay, and so in the same way should New South Wales. If the latter State had adhered to her bargain with the Pacific Cable Board, none of these charges would have been brought before us now. Therefore, I think that the Government should see that the Commonwealth is not unduly charged with obligations which it had no interest in creating. </para>
