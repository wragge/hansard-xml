                        <para>-The motion which I now move speaks for itself. The cheers of honorable senators when I read it express their profound sympathy - a sympathy which represents in this Chamber a feeling that exists throughout every portion of the Empire to which we belong. Every citizen in every corner of that vast Empire has been moved by the incident to which the motion relates. No one can feel more than I do that this is not an occasion when language of an inflammatory character should be used. But it does behove us, on grounds of common humanity, and the brotherhood of Empire, when our fellow citizens, pursuing their peaceful calling, are interrupted in this appalling way, to express at the earliest moment - and the appropriate moment is now when things are assuming a critical aspect - our sympathy, and give our strongest moral support to the only attitude which could be adopted by the Government of Great Britain. I shall say no more. The motion commends itself, and I ask that it be carried unanimously. </para>

                    <para>-In seconding the motion, I may say that I am confident that there is not a member of the Senate who would not feel the utmost sympathy, if not indignation, had this incident happened to the citizens of any country other than Great Britain, and when it is our own fellow -subjects who are involved, our sympathy may justly be accompanied with indignation. But I hope, with the Attorney-General, that neither the public of the United Kingdom nor the public of any other part of the British Empire, will be inflamed by the expression of exaggerated reports and jingoistic sentiments. I hope that those who have the control of business such as this on behalf of the British Empire, will be guided by the best motives, and carry out the negotiations in such a conciliatory spirit that Russia will very soon give the utmost satisfaction for any mistake, intentional or otherwise, that has been made. I have very much pleasure in seconding the motion; </para>

                        <para>- I think that it would be more in accordance with the feelings which ought to animate the dealings which one nation has with another that we should wait for definite information as to how this unfortunate occurrence took place before condemning Russia, for that is what we do when we assume, as this motion assumes, that the attack was made deliberately. I submit that we have no evidence to that effect. We ought to await developments. We ought to wait and see if it cannot be shown that this unfortunate affair was altogether the result of an accident. </para>

                        <para>- I think it would be much more in accord with proper international feeling if we assumed, in the first instance, that this occurrence off the English coast was purely an accident. What do we ' do? By jumping to the conclusion that the Russian Fleet deliberately did this thing, we are provoking antagonism in Russia. What is the good of expressing in one part, of this motion a pious hope that there will be no war between Russia and Great Britain when in the first part we accuse Russia of having deliberately broken the good feeling existing between the two nations? </para>

                        <para>- We ought to remember how public opinion was inflamed by the press during the South African war, how a mercenary and unscrupulous press by disseminating lies, by polluting and poisoning the sources of information, actually incited the people of Great Britain, and I am sorry to say, of the Colonies also, to such a pitch that we were prepared to go forth and slay anybody. We have, I believe, though in. a lesser form, something of a similar character taking place now. We should be consulting our dignity far more, and acting a much more humane part - a part more likely to produce peace - by waitin to see whether this act was deliberate, or whether it was altogether the result of accident or panic. </para>

                        <para>- I was just going to submit to the Attorney-General that grand old precept of English law, that every man is supposed to be innocent until he has been, proved guilty. I think that it might very well be applied internationally, as well as locally. Would it not be much better to presume that this occurrence was the result of an accident, than, without evidence, to assume that it was deliberate? I am astonished at the honorable and learned senator, who has been accustomed to prove everything up to the hilt, or to see that the other fellow did- </para>

                        <para>- I think that the whole thing was the result of an accident. Would it not be much better to wait than to fly to this conclusion without evidence, or at least with no other evidence than the inflammatory comments of a jingoistic press, that the act was deliberate? I need not say any more on the subject. I regret very much that I cannot support the motion. If I were satisfied that the Russian Fleet deliberately fired upon these trawlers, no man in this Chamber, or, I believe in Australia, would be more ready than I would be to support a demand for reparation and an apology from Russia. But I shall never be a party to condemn any one unheard. </para>

                        <para>- We all know how m'any lies appear in the newspapers. Would any Court accept a statement in a newspaper as evidence? In the interests of international friendship, we ought to suspend judgment. We ought to presume that the whole thing, if it occurred at all, was an accident until we find that something different was the case. When that occurs it will be quite time enough to demand reparation and apology from Russia, and to express our indignation at the " wanton and cruel " outrage - of which we have no evi-. 10 h 2 dence at present- committed by the Russian Fleet. I regret that I cannot support the motion. </para>

                        <para>- The evidence is unfortunately only too strong, and too plentiful. The terms of the motion, it appears to me, do not condemn the great Russian nation. They do not charge the Russian nation with having deliberately participated in, or ordered this outrage. We are endeavouring to strengthen the hands of the British Government in asking for justice, and in keeping peace; and I have a very strong conviction indeed that, in passing this motion to-day, we shall do something towards the preservation of peace. </para>

I do not think there is cause for hysteria on the part of any member of the Australian Parliament, or any Australian, or any Britisher. But I am sorry that the Attorney-General has not framed his motion on the lines of the motion proposed by the Premier of New Zealand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Seddon, in the New Zealand Parliament the other day. I think that such a resolution would meet the case. I agree with much that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has said, and think that we ought to wait until we hear the other side before we condemn the Russian people. </para>

                        <para>- Have they done so? That is the question. If the Russians had done such a thing, I should say that the Russian fleet should be blown out of the water* But I ask honorable senators who know of the villainous misrepresentations which occurred' during the Boer war - made by interested parties - to refrain before they condemn the Russians without hearing the other side. Is it not possible that the Japanese, being very active, having shown a great deal of " slimness' ' ' in this war with Russia, and having a good many sympathizers - had vessels on the track of the Russian Baltic Fleet? </para>

                        <para>- What is a deliberate act but a wilful act ? The term "a deliberate act," conveys that a person has given some thought to his proposed action. A wilful act may be committed in a passion - on the spur of the moment. I ask honorable senators whether they think it would have been right to condemn the Australian people when our unhappy late Administrator in New Guinea inflicted an outrage upon the natives of that country ? We saw in the press that the natives were shot down in a very cruel manner, and it turned out afterwards that our officers, through panic, or some other cause, had ordered these people to be fired upon, when they were practically unarmed. Many were shot in their canoes, although they were in the act of flight. Would it have been fair to condemn the Australian people on account of that act ? I say, unhesitatingly, that no one would condemn the Australian people unless he was a very thoughtless person. </para>

                        <para>- I think we can express our views in another way. Does any honorable senator believe, for a moment, that the great Russian people would adopt that method of bringing about a breach of the peace with Great Britain? Would they, in order to provoke a war, fire upon fishermen engaged in their ordinary peaceful occupations? And, sir, if this was a "cruel and wanton attack," it would show that the Russians had selected that means of coming into collision with the British nation. I do not believe it for a moment. I believe that the true sentiments of the Russian people are shown by the promise to make reparation if the statements in the press are proved. I believe that the majority of the Russian people - who are not led away by the gross and unfair attacks of a press which is supposed to be neutral, into hostile feeling against England - will be only too ready to make whatever reparation they can. </para>

The terms of the first part of this motion, which affect the great Russian nation, are to my mind the result of a feeling which has been worked up by these villainous statements appearing in the press. The most objectionable part of it all, to me, is this: that the people who are working up this feeling against Russia - those irresponsible persons who, in their little offices, write these biased cablegrams - if a war took place between Russia and England, would be the first to clear out and to show their backs to the foe. </para>

Let me say here that I have the utmost sympathy with the unfortunates who have been injured by this mistake, or blunder, or cruelty, if honorable senators like to so regard it, on the part of the officer who gave the order to fire ; and I am prepared to add my mite to any fund that may be subscribed to add to the money which, I venture to say, will be paid by the Russian Government to aid the sufferers. Of course, complete reparation cannot be made to the innocent people who have suffered. But I am willing to show my sympathy with them. I am willing to give whatever I can afford to any fund which may be got up on their behalf. Therefore, let not my action here, and let not the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> be misinterpreted to mean that we have no sympathy with the sufferers. </para>

I am afraid that the language used by the Attorney-General in the motion submitted is the outcome of the biased accounts in the press, making it appear that the Russian nation is cowardly, cruel, and tyrannical. I, therefore, ask honorable senators not to be carried away by the reports which have appeared in the ' press. The Boer war, which cost <inline font-style="italic">£200,000,000</inline> and many thousands of lives of the best of England's stock, and some 6262 <inline font-style="italic">Russian Attack on</inline> [SENATE.] <inline font-style="italic">British Fishing Fleet.</inline> of the best of Australia's, was caused without a doubt by the lying statements which appeared in the press of the old country. I think that our purpose will be served if we carry a motion on the lines of that which was moved by the Right Honorable Richard Seddon in the New Zealand House of Representatives. I therefore move as an amendment - </para>

                        <para>- That statement is incorrect. There were at least two nations whose representatives refused to sign the agreement, and I regret to say that Great Britain was one of them. How does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> come to the conclusion that the Czar was the chief opponent of the proposal ? Great Britain certainly stood out against it, and, I think, that the United States also stood out, to a limited extent. Any one who reads of the Russian nation, must admit that it is a great nation, and that it is a nation that has as much sympathy and justice in its composition as has any other. Let honorable senators remember that, as Edmund Burke said, we can impeach individuals in a nation; but it is impossible to impeach a nation. </para>

                        <para>- This is practically an indictment. I believe that the amendment I have moved will meet the wishes of the majority of the members of the Senate. We have not only a duty to perform, but an example to set to Australia. There is a great deal too much evidence of a disposition on the part of certain very bellicose people, who probably would not be so full of fight if a war broke out, to bring about international bitterness between nations when they should rather do their best to bring about entirely different conditions, such as were suggested by the Hague International Peace Conference. While we have a right to express our sympathy, and to do it in a practical form, with the bereaved and the suffering in this affair, I say that we should refrain from doing anything which will encourage international bitterness. I have every hope that this Australian nation, which I venture to think is, as a whole, far in advance of any other great body of people of similar numbers on the face of the earth, will, before many years are past, take a part in helping those who are earnest in their efforts to establish an International Court of Arbitration for the settlement of international disputes. The achievement of that end will be delayed by every step we take which is calculated to give any nation the opinion that we are not just, and that we are only too anxious to give a verdict before we hear both sides. </para>

                    <para>- In seconding the amendment which has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> I desire to say that it is extremely regrettable that some action was not taken by the Attorney-General before submitting his motion to ascertain the general feeling of honorable senators, and to consult them as to the terms of the motion, in order that, when submitted, it might be one which would not raise a single discordant note, and which would be agreed to unanimously. If the honorable and learned senator, in acting for the Government, had chosen to do that, it would have been exceedingly becoming, and very much better than the course which he has adopted. The amendment which has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> is an exact copy of the motion submitted in the New Zealand House of Representatives by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Seddon, and there is not a single honorable senator, or a single man in Australia who will say that there is a more patriotic citizen in any part of the British Empire than that right honorable gentleman. I think we might very well follow his lead in this matter. It would be more in keeping with the dignity of the Senate if we were to record our views on the subject in the simplest, most dignified, and most moderate language we can command. There is a large section of people in Australia, and, unfortunately, also, I believe, in Great Britain, whose minds, having been inflamed by what is generally known as the capitalistic section of the press, entertain a feeling of antagonism towards Russia in connexion with the present war between that country and Japan, of which the incident before us is a very regrettable outcome. They entertain similarly a feeling in favour of the Japanese. There is a distinct pro-Japanese feeling given expression to by a certain section of the community in Australia and Great Britain. As a friendly nation we should not be asked to take sides with either the Russians or the Japanese. I confess that my sympathies are enlisted on behalf of the European, and not the little brown Asiatic nation. I say that unreservedly. But when we come to consider the incident to which the motion relates, I say it is inconceivable that the Russian Fleet should deliberately and wilfully have done anything of this kind. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> motion states, the Russian Fleet cruelly and wantonly made that attack, and made it in a deliberate way, it must be admitted that it was an absolutely suicidal act for the Russian Fleet and for the Russian nation. The Russian nation, as we know, has as big a fight on her hands just now as it well knows how to manage, and if the very regrettable incident with which we are dealing should result in war between England and Russia at the present time, we know that the Baltic Fleet would toe absolutely at the mercy- of Great Britain. It is in a trap from which there is no escape. In the ordinary course of events there would not appear to be a chance that <inline font-style="italic">sl</inline> single vessel of the Baltic Fleet could escape. It is therefore not conceivable that those in command of the Baltic Fleet would deliberately have placed themselves in such a position, and it is not reasonable that we should use the strong language which is used in' the motion submitted by the Attorney-General. I quite agree that it is right that some motion on the subject' should be moved, but I repeat that it would have been very much better if the feeling of honorable senators had been ascertained in order that a motion on which we could be unanimous might have been submitted to the Senate. If the Attorney-General will accept the amendment that object may still be obtained. Honorable senators on this side have the utmost , sympathy with the unfortunate people who have suffered by this very regrettable incident, but we certainly have no desire to use the incident in such a way as to precipitate a very much greater misfortune. </para>

                        <para>- No one will be found more ready than honorable senators on this side to uphold the honour of the nation when it is attacked, but in this case the whole of the evidence points to a huge blunder or mistake on the part of those in charge of the Baltic Fleet. It does not involve the honour of the nation, and I think it will be proved that the statements which have been made are largely unfounded. </para>

                        <para>- And on such occasions there has never been elicited the sympathy which honorable senators 'are now showing for the sufferers by the occurrence in the North Sea. We should not use an incident which everybody must condemn and regret as a means to inflict a greater misfortune on the world. I agree with the motion in so far as it expresses the hope that nothing will occur to disturb the peaceful relations existing between Russia and Great Britain. War is a misfortune almost as great to the country which wins as to the country which loses. The British people have been engaged in many wars during the past few centuries - indeed, they have scarcely ever been out of war - and we should not do anything to promote further conflicts. The amendment will accomplish all we desire; it will show that we regret the incident, that we condemn the carelessness or blundering which led to it, and express the hope that ample reparation will be made. We should not do anything to embarrass the Imperial authorities in their negotiations. Any motion we pass will be cabled home, and in a few hours will be in London, and in possession of the people of Great Britain, and will undoubtedly have one effect or another. Let us endeavour to make the motion effective in favour of peace between two great European nations, and thus accomplish our purpose, instead of, mayhap, precipitating, or helping to precipitate, a conflict which will be a misfortune, not only to Russia, not only to England, but to Europe and the whole of the civilized world. </para>

What is the position? The moment this incident happened every nation, or the press of every nation, at once expressed practically the same opinion that the English press . hold. And since then, seeing the dilatoriness with which Russia has acted, strong terms have been employed, even by the continental papers. To-day we are informed that one of the leading European newspapers has used the particularly suggestive words that it is hopeless for Russia to contend that she is not in fault, and that the sooner she recognises and admits her fault the better. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Russian Attack on</inline>[28 October, 1904.] <inline font-style="italic">British Fishing Fleet.</inline> 6265 is shown to those who are the possible enemies of England. A great deal has happened since the motion was submitted to the New Zealand House of Representatives. That motion might have been a very proper one two days ago, but honorable senators must not overlook the fact that the hope therein expressed has not been fulfilled. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon</inline> submitted the motion to the New Zealand Parliament, there was every reason to suppose that the first man in the whole world to come forward and offer every reparation in his power would be the Czar of Russia. But what has happened ? ' So far as the Czar is concerned, there has been practically nothing more than such an expression of sympathy as might be offered if there had been loss of life by an explosion in a mine or a railway accident. As a result, we stand face to face to-day with the fact that the British Government have absolutely issued an ultimatum. And why ? Do the British Government act on garbled cablegrams, and on insufficient evidence? Surely, if there had been any evidence to support the fantastic theory put forward to-day that some of these trawlers were torpedo-boats in disguise - and this shows how little honorable senators appear to know of the difference between a torpedo-boat and a trawler- </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I say again that the position has entirely altered since the motion was passed by the New Zealand Parliament. To-day, owing to the fact that the Czar has not redeemed the hope then entertained - that absolutely nothing has been done except to delay and trifle with the position - the Imperial authorities have been compelled to take up a position which we all regret, but which I, at any rate, support. A motion which might have been sufficient two days ago is totally insufficient to-day. I can only say again that I regret very much that it has been necessary to do more than pass this motion with cordial and unanimous approval, but it would be entirely wrong, and impossible for me, at any rate, to keep silent, when I find countrymen of my own - citizens of the same Empire - expressing sentiments which may be taken to indicate that in time of trouble Great Britain will not be as united as she ought to be, and, as I believe, she will be. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that the Senate is very much in agreement on many points, and I think we could have framed a motion which would have met all objections. In my opinion we could have passed unanimously a much stronger motion than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> proposes, and such a course would have been more desirable than to have had this discussion. </para>

                        <para>- While I totally disagree with the attitude of Senators Higgs, Stewart, and Givens, I at the same time have considerable sympathy with what I know to be the motive which prompts their action. We have been tricked once on a question of this kind by the press of Australia and that fact must give every person considerable sympathy with those who, perhaps, see in the newspaper reports and 6266 <inline font-style="italic">Russian Attack on .</inline> [SENATE.] <inline font-style="italic">British Fishing Fleet.</inline> comments of to-day an attempt to trick us again. But I would remind honorable senators that the argument of those who, to a large extent, sympathized with the Boer Republics when the unwarranted attack was made on them, was that that attack was brought about by an unjustifiable raid, which had the sympathy of some, at any rate, of the leading politicians of the United Kingdom. I see in the present unwarranted raid on the commerce and workers of Great Britain a very similar occurrence to the Jameson raid in South Africa. As I believed that raid to have been made for the purpose of forcing the Boer Republics into war, so I believe that the present unwarranted attack on peaceful workers of Great Britain is for the purpose of forcing Great Britain into war. I condemn both raids, and for the same reason. </para>

We know that modern armaments provide a search-light, and no matter what the object in commencing the firing was, the warships must have known very well before they left the scene of the outrage that the vessels on which they fired were not warships or torpedo boats, but peaceful fishing boats. </para>

                        <para>- The reports in the press state that they did. Whatever else they did, they made no attempt to succour the wounded men. When they found that their firing was not replied to ; when they found, as they must have found by the searchlight, that they had made a mistake, and had attacked peaceful fishing boats, they never attempted to do what the instincts of common humanity should have prompted them to do. They did not remain to succour those whom they had attacked. I would remind honorable senators who object to the motion that something has happened since the firing took place. The Russian warships have touched at a French port, where they must have received advice as to the description of the boats they had attacked, and the result of their firing. At that port the Russian shins would be in communication with St. Petersburg by telegraph, and a message could have been flashed to the Czar and his Ministers immediately to the effect that they had made this attack as the result of a belief that they were firing on the enemy, but that they had made a mistake. Russian ships touched at a French port at least two days ago, and, although, as the cables this morning tell us, the Czax and his Ministers know all the circumstances of the case, yet there has been no act of reparation, no apology, no expression of sorrow for the action taken, no succour to the wounded. I would appeal to honorable senators not to allow racial antipathy or an exaggerated feeling against the press of' Australia, for which I believe to a certain extent there is some warrant, to lead them to do an injustice to their own nation, and to the seamen who have been wronged. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Givens. - What injustice does the amendment propose? </para>

                        <para>- The amendment is one which could have been accepted by the Senate last Wednesday. On that day it would have been a proper thing for the Senate to express a hope that the Czar would make reparation for what had been done. But three days have elapsed since that motion was carried in the New Zealand Parliament. I venture to say that if it had to be moved there to-day, it would take the form of the motion submitted by the Attorney-General. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has said that by the motion we condemn the Russian people. I can find in the motion a condemnation of the Russian official class-of the Ministers of the Czar - but certainty no condemnation of the Russian people. Those who know how the official class exercise their power in Russia can see in the motion no condemnation of the Russian people. I believe, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> that the Russian people do not entertain any hostile feeling to the British or any other nation except, perhaps, the one with which they are now at war. But I must not close my eyes to the fact that it is not to the Russian people, but to the ruling class, that we can look for reparation or apology, and it is from that class that we ask that the British Government shall demand full reparation and apology. Our attitude in regard to the parties engaged in this terrible war in Manchuria ought not to influence our consideration of this motion. I reciprocate the sentiments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> My sympathy in this war is with the European nation as against the Asiatic nation. But I do not allow that fact to interfere in any way with my attitude on this motion. Had this outrage been perpetrated by Japanese ships, I venture to say that the motion would have been tabled in precisely the same form. It is of no consequence to us which nation perpetrated the outrage. It is sufficient for us to know that there has been an outrage on our fellow-subjects, and that for four days there has been no recompense made, no reparation offered, no full apology tendered, no official recognition of the responsibility of the Russian Government for the acts of their servants. During that period the Russian Government must have been in communication with their fleet, because on two occasions a portion of the fleet has been in harbor, and the Admiral has bad an opportunity of communicating with the Ministers. Under these circumstances, I hold that the delay has merely aggravated the original offence. I shall support the motion as it stands. In view of the necessity which exists for unanimity, and in view of the fact that the motion does not reflect on the Russian nation, but merely on its responsible Ministers, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn in order that we may get a unanimous expression of opinion by the Senate. </para>

                    <para>- I rise to support the amendment ; but not out of any sympathy with Russian officialism. All my life I have had an antipathy which would not permit me to sympathize with Russian officialism, or aristocracy. The result of my reading has been to prejudice that class in my eyes in every possible way. Whilst I admit that a motion of this kind may be necessary, I submit that it is moved either too soon or a few clays too late. Had it been moved when we received' the first notification of this outrage, we should have been quite entitled to pass it without any comment. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that we have any better evidence on which to form an opinion now than we had then. It must be remembered how war news filters through the press. We have been tricked so often that I think we should be very foolish if we accepted all that appears in the press in time of war. It takes a considerable time for the truth in connexion with great international affairs to reach the people of this country. It would have been better if the motion had been withheld until the next sitting of the Senate, when the full circumstances will be known. The British Government have demanded a prompt reply to their despatch, and when it ds received we shall be in a far better position to say what form our motion should take. I propose to quote an extract in order to give the Senate an idea of the feeling which prevails in Russia, so far as we can ascertain it. I do not mean to say that this report is better than anything else we get in a time of war excitement. We have to take everything we see in the press with a grain of salt, but our newspapers of Wednesday last published this cablegram : - </para>

                    <para>The Russian press censor only permitted the St. Petersburg evening papers to state concerning the Dogger Bank outrage that a collision occurred in the North Sea, with some casualties resulting. Russian officials who are cognisant of the truth are horrified and amazed at the mishap. Count Lamsdorff, the Russian Foreign Minister, is reported to have declared promptly that Russia will make full reparation, if the facts, as stated in England, are correct. </para>

                <para>In order to allow ample time for a reply to be made by the Czar, I think it would be better for both the motion and amendment to be withdrawn, because if the outrage is as great as is reported, and seemingly it is, our resolution ought to be even more strongly worded. But we ought to hear the reply of the Russian authorities before we take any action in the Senate. </para>

                    <para>- The position is altogether too important to be allowed to pass without at least indicating the current of my feelings. The evidence, so far as it goes, seems to show that there has been, as is stated in the motion, wanton cruelty perpetrated. For this reason, I deeply regret that an amendment has been moved. I sincerely regret that an attempt should be made to divide the Senate into two parties on a question which intensely affects us all as Britishers. Our sympathies' would certainly go out to any nation that had suffered in the. same manner as our own people have suffered on this occasion. If we can so heartily sympathize with the people of other nations, our sympathies must go out towards those with whom we are allied in kinship and brotherhood. The' supporters of the amendment have advised very great caution in the absence of more definite information. Hut in taking up the newspapers I find that the British Government appears to be well informed concerning what has occurred. England is much closer to Russia than we are, and the British Government appear to be in close touch with the whole of the circumstances. They have given the Russian Government until mid-day to-day to do certain things, after which a Cabinet meeting is to be held to determine on British action. I therefore come to the conclusion that British statesmen have decided that an act has been perpetrated which demands reparation ; and I am prepared to believe that there is some truth in the cablegrams. It must be remembered that although the Russian fleet was not far away from its own country, it appears to have failed to give definite information as to what has occurred, and the Russian Government has failed to make prompt reparation. Under all the circumstances, I am prepared to support the motion. </para>

                    <para>- I had hoped that this motion would be unanimously carried by the Senate. I still trust that such will be the case. I have every respect for the earnestness of my colleagues, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs and Senator Givens.</inline> I sympathize with their motives, because I know that they are good, and I trust that they will not be misunderstood in moving and supporting the amendment. But nevertheless, I hope that they will not push the amendment to a division, and that the motion of the Attorney-General will be unanimously carried. Like other honorable senators, I should have preferred notice to be given of the motion ; but, after all, we have had just as much notice as had the members of another place. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> that the present case affords any parallel with the circumstances of the South African war. The incident which has lately occurred was sudden, and it requires prompt treatment. Had such an incident occurred in Australian waters - had a, fleet of fishermen from our coasts been fired upon by a foreign vessel - we should have expected not merely sympathy, but practical help from Great Britain. While I am entirely in accord with what has been said concerning the misrepresentations of the press in connexion with the South African war, yet I must insist that this is not a parallel case in any sense. We must trust the British people, through their leaders, in the present crisis, and we are doing no more than we ought to do in expressing our sympathy with them. I should like to see the whole Parliament united in regard to the matter ; and while I agree that we ought not to get hysterical, I do not think that it will show hysteria to pass the motion submitted by the Attorney-General unanimously. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> must remember that the motion does hot declare war. It simply expresses our sympathy on account of the wanton attack made by the Russian Fleet. I should not object if the words " or criminal blunder " were added. Possibly the attack was wanton, but if it was a blunder at all, it was undoubtedly a criminal blunder. If it was a wanton attack, it deserves all the condemnation which </para>

                        <para>- It could not have been an accident, because guns do not go off of themselves. I do not think it was a blunder. My opinion is, and was from the very commencement, as many honorable senators know, that it was a deliberate attack - that there was a deliberate intention to destroy human life, and that British life. Imagine the scene when that great fleet attacked a number of peaceful fishermen, who were merely carrying on their ordinary avocation, and who probably had nothing more effective with which to defend themselves than a dead herring. </para>

                        <para>- I am led to that conclusion, not altogether from this particular incident in itself. I regard this as the culmination of a long series of actions which have been committed by the Russian authorities, not only during the present struggle, but on many other occasions. But even during the present struggle, what can we think of the action of the Russians in sinking the <inline font-style="italic">Knight Commander ?</inline> We know from men upon whom we can absolutely rely - from those upon whom we relied during the progress of the South African war - namely, the war correspondents - what has occurred. We know that the Russians have departed altogether from international honour in laying mines ten miles from the shore, in the track of merchant shipping. They have, in a number of cases, committed acts which are not creditable to the governing authorities in Russia, and of which the Russian nation knows nothing, and is not likely to know anything. This time they have gone a little further than they did before; and I consider that if the Baltic Fleet were permitted to get away without punishment of some description for this particular outrage, the next one would be more serious still. Prompt action is required to prevent anything of the kind occurring in the near future, or even in the distant future. Just look at the information which we have obtained concerning the incident from the blunder point of view. I know that some of my honorable friends will say that the cablegrams published in the newspapers are untruthful and unreliable. They may be. But I should like to direct the attention of honorable senators to the fact that it is not fair to reject the cable messages on one side and to accept, without question, those on the other side. If honorable senators reject the later cables, concerning the details of this gross outrage, would it not be more consistent on their part to reject as being unauthentic the cable that any outrage has taken place at all, or that the British Government has submitted an ultimatum to be answered by noon to-day ? It has been said that the Australian people were tricked by the daily press during the trouble in South Africa, and it is argued that there is therefore a great possibility that we are again being tricked in a similar manner. But I say the cases are not parallel. There is not a single point of resemblance between the condition of affairs during the time of the South African trouble and that existing at the present time. Let me briefly say that during the time of the South African war the cable messages appearing in the daily press of Australia as giving the views of the Continental press showed that they were entirely anti-British and pro-Boer, and that a violent epidemic of anglophobia had broken out all over the Continent at that time. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, absolutely. Let <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> make no mistake, and let not the honorable senator misinterpret what I arn stating. I am showing the difference between the position of affairs during the time of the Boer war and the present time, in view of the outrage which we are now discussing. I say that at the time of the Boer war, the Continental press were smitten with a bad attack of anglophobia. They were all against the Britisher and in favour of the Boers. A very large section of the American press at that time was also in favour of the Boers, and in England 'itself all the liberal and radical papers were against the war, and in favour of the Boers. But what is the position to-day with respect to this matter? The whole of the British press, conservative, radical, and liberal alike, are unanimous in condemning this affair as a gross outrage, and in calling on the British Government to take prompt and effective measures to prevent anything of the kind occurring again," and to punish those who have been responsible for the outrage. In addition to that, the Continental press is not anti-British on this occasion, but is in favour of the British, and against the Russians. So is the American press, and some American newspapers ha've plainly intimated that if England is not fit to punish in this matter, " Uncle Sam" would not need a great deal of coaxing to come along and give a helping hand. It should surely be admitted that while we had good reason to be suspicious of, and to distrust, what appeared in our conservative organs in Australia regarding the truth of matters in South Africa, we have not the shadow of a reason to hold that opinion regarding this matter, because the whole of the press is unanimous on this subject. </para>

                        <para>- The presumption is that it is true. In the circumstances, to quote what occurred in connexion with the South African war does not make a case against those who are in favour of the motion submitted bv the Attorney-General. My own opinion is that if the regret of Russian officialdom, with the Czar at its head, had any semblance of sincerity in it, we should not have had the feeble, wishy-washy message which has been sent by the Czar; there would have been a more prompt and vigorous expression of regret than that message. If the Czar had really felt any deep and sincere regret for the criminal acts of his officers in charge of the Baltic Fleet he would have made a much more vigorous protest, and he would Have accompanied his message of regret with a cheque for £1,000 or more for the immediate relief of the sufferers from the criminal act of his officers. I do not know what terms have been submitted as adequate reparation for this outrage, but no mere expression of sympathy and monetary recompense will, to my mind, be sufficient. I believe that the fullest and closest investigation should be made, and the officers who are responsible for this dastardly outrage should be punished in the way in which we know how to punish our Jack-the-Rippers and our Deemings. </para>

                    <para>- It is a matter for extreme regret that in a time of national crisis like the present a debate should take place on a motion of this kind, proposed by the Government, and approved, as I understand, by the leader of the Opposition in another place. We should have adopted the course followed in another place, and agreed to the motion unanimously, without haggling as to its terms. We know that in this matter the British people are in the right. </para>

                        <para>- The war between Russia and Japan is the result of the greed and earth-hunger of the Russian people. The Czar has calmly said that he is willing to sacrifice the lives of every one of his subjects in order to win in that war. In the course of their conduct of the war the Russian people have constituted themselves international pirates. They have broken every rule of international policy on the high seas; they have wantonly taken the lives of neutrals, and have committed outrages which previously have been committed only by pirates flying the black flag. In the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Knight Commander,</inline> referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson,</inline> after the vessel had actually surrendered, and the Russians had searched her for contraband of war, they sank her. Just as every man is held to be innocent until he has been proved to be guilty, so every ship carrying cargo is held to be neutral until a prize court has been constituted, and a decision given that she is carrying contraband. This ship, though she was by international law, free from hostile attack, was sunk by the Russians, who deliberately trained their guns on her. If Great Britain had not been a long-suffering nation, that incident would have constituted a <inline font-style="italic">causus belli,</inline> and war against Russia would have been declared at once. The Russians have now in the North Sea deliberately sunk some of the vessels belonging to British fishermen, and when the Russian commander reached France he expressed his regret that they had not sunk more of those vessels. </para>

                <para>So far as the war between Russia and Japan is concerned, I am with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in sympathizing always with the European as against the Asiatic nation. I am of opinion that the Attorney-General in moving his motion, was very temperate in the language he used. As a matter of fact, the honorable and learned senator has been complimented by honorable senators on this side on having used- no strong language whatever in submitting his motion. Without dragging in any side issues, I may say that the objection raised is that more information is required. But what more information is required to enable the Senate to agree to a motion of this sort? There is information sufficient to lead us, at any rate, to believe that this action was taken by the Russian Fleet. </para>

                        <para>- I did not say that the action was deliberate, nor does the motion say so. If the motion did say that the action was deliberate, I should be prepared to vote against it. As to more information being required, do honorable senators believe, or do they not believe, that this outrage was perpetrated ? In <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> belief, the outrage was perpetrated, and, in the words of the motion, it was a "cruel" outrage. I think that every honorable senator will agree that it ' was cruel on the part of the Russian. Fleet, after inflicting all this damage and loss of life, not to have made some investigation, as to whether a mistake had been made. The Russian Fleet could not have gone away in the belief that they had been opposed by an armed force, seeing that there were only a few inoffensive trawlers there pursuing their occupation. There has been, I think, a misunderstanding in connexion with the motion. The word " wanton " is used, but that does not mean that the occurrence was deliberate or pre-arranged. I understand the word "wanton" to mean that a careless and a cruel outrage was perpetrated upon inoffensive people ; and the motion might be agreed to by every person in Australia without any objection. If the motion had stated that the outrage was pre-arranged or committed under official instructions, I should have been one to ask for its modification. But when we realize, as we all must, that it Was a cruel, wanton, or careless action, we are justified in expressing the feelings of resentment which we must feel towards people who, in our opinion, are not fit to take charge of vessels of war on the high seas. I ask honor able senators, who know anything of fishing vessels of this character, whether there was any possibility of a mistake ? Dogger Bank, one of the best fishing grounds, is a part of the sea where hundreds of fishing vessels from the towns on the east coast of England are engaged for six or eight weeks at a time; and when ships of war, or even merchantmen pass, there is a special international signal by which the character of the fishing fleet is at once made known. On numerous occasions I have sailed by the fishing fleets in the English Channel and the North Sea, and I have never known them to fail to give the well-understood signal. And when that is the case in regard to passing merchant vessels, we may be sure that the signal would be shown in the case of a fleet of ships of war. The occurrence seems unaccountable, except by the fact that a panic arose amongst some of the officers of the warships. </para>

                        <para>- The failure to do so is one of the worst features of the case. But my object is merely to show that the motion is one which might well be unanimously passed by the Senate. I could understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> raising an objection if he were under the impression that the motion meant that the outrage was deliberate or pre-arranged. But that is not the meaning of the motion ; and if we agree, as I think we shall, that this was a wanton and cruel outrage, we are right in expressing the opinion that the guilty persons should be punished. Had a similar outrage been committed by the British Fleet I should be one of the first to ask that those responsible should be punished for their carelessness. Such men would be better chained up at home than in charge of armed vessels, and free to commit such acts. We are quite within our rights, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> proposes in the amendment, in sympathizing with the people who have' suffered from this outrage - with the people who have lost their bread-winners. We are also within our rights in expressing our sympathy on grounds of nationality, and we undoubtedly have a right to ask that not only shall there be reparation and apology, but that those directly responsible shall be punished. </para>

                    <para>- The Senate has been invited, by the representative of the Government, to express, in conjunction with the other Chamber, on the part of the people of Australia their indignation at an action which every one admits affords jus': cause for indignation. Notwithstanding this debate, there has been great unanimity shown on the part of honorable senators. We can even respect the opinions of the three honorable senators who support the amendment, and we have no right to charge them with want of loyalty for regarding the matter from their own point of view. I think, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> would only do justice to himself, to his supporters, and to the Senate, if he were to withdraw the amendment. It is no part of our duty to find excuses for Russia - that is a matter for Russia herself. The outrage is one which it is very hard to imagine was premeditated. We can hardly think there was any deliberate intention to do this mischievous work ; we must suppose that those responsible acted in a fit of drunkenness, cowardice, or insanity. </para>

There has been plenty of time for Russia to do that; but up to the present there is no record of any reparation or explanation of anything like the proper character. Therefore, it seems to me that we can cordially indorse the wording of the motion, though it might have been better had the Attorney-General taken care to ascertain that it would be acceptable to all honorable senators. </para>

Honorable senators who support the motion remind me very much of certain people in Scotland in the old barbarous times, out of which we do not seem to have altogether emerged even in Australia. Those people dispensed what was called Jedburgh justice - that is, they hanged a man first and tried him afterwards, when he was' not in a position to defend himself. All we claim is that we. should hear the other side. At present we have only an <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement, conveyed to us per medium of newspaper cable messages. I remember that, not so very long ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> withered up the newspapers with his scorn and contempt. On dozens of occasions he has called them the lineal descendants of Ananias, but now he takes them to his boson:. </para>

He says in his motion that the Russian Fleet made "a cruel and wanton attack." </para>

                        <para>- The rule is that when an honorable senator has spoken to the original question, and an amendment has been moved subsequently, he may speak again, but must confine his remarks to the amendment. I confess that it is exceedingly difficult for a speaker to confine himself to the amendment, and not to say anything about the motion to which it relates. I ask the honorable senator to confine himself to the amendment, as far as possible. </para>

We have an exactly similar case in connexion with the Russian ships. It is alleged that they fired on the trawlers; but they reply that they took them to be Japanese torpedo-boats. Those of us who object to the motion are accused of favouring Russia and its institutions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> is adopting the Russian method. He is asking us to send the Russian Fleet to Siberia without a trial, or an opportunity to give their version. But we who are the despised only ask for fair play. We wish to hear the Russian version of this matter before we accuse them. </para>

                        <para>- And a very filthy channel it is, so far as this matter is concerned. We know perfectly well that in Great Britain there is a strong anti-Russian feeling, which 1 is being fomented by the press. In fact, a great- number of our newspapers are infected with what may be called Russophobia. On every possible occasion they try to inflame the minds of the people of Great Britain against Russia, to kindle the fires of discord between the two countries. They never lose an opportunity of exaggeration, aggravation, or saying anything likely to lead to a breach of the public peace. I submit that the Senate will be best considering its own dignity as an impartial tribunal if it waits until it can hear the other side before condemning, not only the Russian Fleet, but the Russian nation. What a mockery it is that we, who have been discussing the question of arbitration for a week, should be asked to pass this motion without hearing from the other side in this- matter. </para>

I am very anxious that the Senate should be unanimous, but I could not conscientiously vote for the motion in its present form, and if it is not amended I shall be compelled to vote for the amendment. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia - -Attorney-General). - I do not altogether regret a considerable part of the discussion which has taken place, although I should very deeply regret, and I feel sure that every honorable senator would share that regret with me, if we did not pass this motion as I moved it without dissent. No one recognises more amply than I do the conscientious sense of duty which has prompted every honorable senator who has criticised the terms of the motion, and also the conscientious sense of duty which has prompted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> in moving the amendment, I think mainly with a view to crystallizing the discussion. But at the same time I appeal to him, as others have done, to withdraw it. It has secured its object. It has enabled honorable senators, with the most perfect freedom, which we hope will always be exercised here, to state their views, however diverse they may be. Having accomplished that object, I hope that I am not appealing in vain to my honorable friend when I ask him now to withdraw the amendment. If there is any blame attachable to me in respect of any shortcoming in ascertaining the feelings of honorable senators before I entered the chamber this morning, I take it. </para>

                        <para>- I agree that it is desirable on every occasion to secure, as Senators Pearce and Givens have said, an assurance of unanimity, not merely in the purpose of a motion of .this kind, but in its terms. I can only say, as I have already said, that if honorable senators think I was remiss in anything that I did in that regard, I crave: pardon. I wish to say, however, that I did what I think is customary, and what I' should expect my honorable friends opposite to do when they resume their places on. this side of the table, if they happen to be similarly placed. At the earliest moment I conferred with the leader of the Opposition, and put him in full possession of what I contemplated, and ascertained that the terms of the motion had his approval. I think that is the method that is customarily pursued on occasions of this sort. I offer that as a justification, at all events as a mitigation of the offence, if honorable senators think there is one. It was impossible to communicate earlier with my honorable friends opposite. The position this morning is critical. An ultimatum appears to have been, presented - I think a justifiable ultimatum, i'f I may say so much. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to refrain from inflammatory language. I desire to refrain from expressing condemnation. I desire to refrain from saying one word in reflection upon the people of Russia, who are passing through a great trial, and who are. largely kept in ignorance by their rulers of the true facts. But this morning we have the intimation that things have reached a most critical stage. Whilst we are sitting here debating the terms of this motion, a state of war may arise between these two great nations. My belief is that this motion is in the interests of peace. I take a higher view of the influence of the Parliament of this Commonwealth and of this Senate, and of the Commonwealth itself, than perhaps same people do. I believe in the ' moral effect of a resolution of this kind. I believe that the influence of Australia, by such an expression of opinion as this motion embodies, will directly tend to the maintenance of peace. If I thought that it would have the effect which some honorable senators seem to fear - I will not say to prophesy - that it might tend to war. I should be the 'last to stand here and move it. But I believe that the unanimity of the great self-governing parts of this Empire, in their sympathy with and approval1 of1 the action which! has been taken to enforce upon Russia the prompt recognition of her Obligations, will probably - I hope may certainly - exercise an influence upon the minds of the governing people in that country which will make for peace. I did not think that it was necessary that I should enter into details as to the exact terms of the motion, because, when one is moving a motion of this description, it is the spirit alone to which we should have regard, and not its exact verbal terms, measured bv rule and line, or by the accuracy of the grammarian. Does this motion express our sentiment of sympathy ? Does it express our desire that peace shall be maintained ? My honorable friend's amendment, if he will allow me to point this out, omits the pacific portion of my motion, which says - </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend's amendment omits that portion. I do not wish to criticise it verbally, but under no circumstances does the amendment go so far in its influence towards peace as does this motion in its entirety. If I omitted to refer in detail to the exact terms of the motion, it was because I thought that its spirit would be clear, and that I might appeal to our kinship - that I might appeal to the fact that we are of the same blood as these injured fishermen - and that that would be enough without commenting upon each word and each phrase, to recommend the motion to the acceptance of my honorable friends. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> asks, " Why call what happened an attack?"

Was it by mistake? My honorable friend puts these possibilities, but no one seriously pretends that, the guns went off by mistake or by accident. It is said that there was a panic in the Russian Fleet, and that the officers lost their heads, because they were afraid there were Japanese torpedo boats in these narrow seas. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, indeed. Lastly, was it by design? "By design " does not necessarily mean that this great fleet of forty vessels fired their guns upon a lot of inoffensive fishermen as though in broad daylight for the purpose of smashing them up and destroying human life. Surely it is not necessary to establish that to justify this motion. But if it was by mistake - I eliminate accident, I eliminate design - they could instantly have apologized', and at least one of the vessels should have remained behind to ascertain the truth, and to succour the men wounded and drowning. When I find it admitted that a number, of innocent fishermen, pursuing their industry in the peaceful night watches, were fired upon, and lives taken, then I say that an apology should instantly have been forthcoming. There was no need to wait for a claim for compensation to be made. If a body of soldiers, or a body of sportsmen, in passing through my neighbourhood, fired and injured or killed any of my children by accident or by mistake, what should I expect them to do? To stop and endeavour to assist the little ones, and to apologize straight away. The explanation as to whether the occurrence was an accident, or took place by design, or whatever you like to call it - all that, and the reparation could come afterwards. But no reparation, no offer of reparation, whether adequate monetarily or not, would compensate for that injury, but I should' expect immediate and ample expression of sorrow by those who inflicted it. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> 1 Seddon's resolution had been submitted here three or four days ago, it might have been acceptable to this Senate. But it has been resultless.  And for anybody to tell me that a feeble expression of regret - personal regret - by the Czar is the sort of thing that ought to satisfy British people smarting under such an outrage as this, is not merely an affront to me as a man, but an affront to me as a British citizen. When you ask me about information, I reply that the only information I require is the information that this outrage has been committed ; and the wounds of these poor fishermen -are mouths which cry aloud to us for sympathy with the bereaved and the wounded - for indignation against the perpetrators - for sympathy with our fellow countrymen, and for support to our nation in seeing that justice is done. I believe, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that as between man and man there are but two conclusions which can be arrived at. If the outrage were committed intentionally, or if these Russians were careless as to whether they inflicted wounds and wrought destruction or not, their act was murder. If it was done by mistake the act may be manslaughter. But it is either one or the other. No one can pretend it was what lawyers call - if I may be pardoned for using the expression - " justifiable homicide." Justifiable homicide is committed when you do something in self-defence. But some of these humble fishermen who were killed were photographed, and the photographs show that this terrible death overtook them with knives and flitches of fish in their hands pursuing their avocations, and not offering battle or provocation. This outrage is an insult to us all, and it would be a degradation to Australia if we suppressed our sentiments under such circumstances as these. No one could have been kindlier in his remarks concerning myself than my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Riggs.</inline> was when he alluded to the fact that I refrained from inflammatory language. I do not consider what I have now said to be inflammatory. I am merely stating the facts, and I am endeavouring to state them with that feeling which I should be less than human if I did not avow. I desire that we shall be unanimous. There was an attack undoubtedly. It was wanton in that it was unprovoked. It was at least grossly careless. What more do we say ? It was cruel, and we express our indignation on account of its cruelty. It was a wanton attack by the Russian Fleet upon British fishermen engaged in their peaceful occupations, and we are justified in sympathizing with the British Government. We are justified in expressing the hope that the British Government will insist upon full reparation in every sense. We do not condemn the Russian people. We do not doubt that they will themselves insist upon a full reparation in every sense. </para>

And when we see - and I do not say that the statement is to be accepted as true absolutely, though it is natural and probable under the Russian autocracy - that the military party are minimizing the outrage and exhibiting a truculence as well as an airy lightness in dealing with it, suggesting that it was merely the fleet coming into collision with a lot of trawlers, it must be admitted that the situation is a dangerous one. We are not called upon to express any opinion of the Russian people, and I hope we shall not find ourselves in a position in which it can be suggested that we are attempting to do so. We are not doing so. The attack was cruel and wanton, that is what we say - but we hope that peace will be maintained between these two great Empires, by Russia frankly, as she should have done days ago, making the <inline font-style="italic">amende honorable,</inline> not with an apology wrung from her, but with the voluntary apology which should have been given within an hour of the time when she became acquainted with the occurrence. I have almost concluded. I feel that the language of the motion conveys the sentiments of us all. Senators Higgs and Stewart have not been slower than I have been to express their detestation - if I may use that expression - for the outrage which has been committed, and their sympathy not only with the sufferers but with the whole British people, who are placed in the position of having to vindicate the humblest of their countrymen. I feel sure that my honorable friends opposite will not, even if they differ as to the mere verbiage of the motion - although I consider it unexceptionable - think it necessary on that ground alone to import any element of dissent into this Chamber. I feel sure that we shall express our feelings and views with the same unanimity,. and the same acclamation, which have been exhibited in another place, and that the resolutions of both Houses will go forth to His Majesty the King, and to the Imperial Government, without any discrepancy between them. I believe we shall agree that there shall ' be but one resolution in effect, and that it shall be in keeping with our highest conception of the dignity of the Senate. We should </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to occupy the time of the Senate with any very lengthy remarks upon this Bill. I intend to deal only with a few of the general principles involved, and to leave the discussion of the details until we get into Committee, when I anticipate that I shall have a good deal to say about some of the methods by which it is proposed to give effect to the principles of the measure. The debate on this Bill has revealed a curious state of affairs. It has shown that the support for the Bill, and the principles contained in it, comes from the Opposition side of the Senate, and that the opposition to the measure and its principles comes altogether from honorable senators who support the Government. Almost without exception, honorable senators sitting behind the Government have said that they are opposed to the principle of compulsory arbitration, which is the main principle of this Bill. Yet they are supporting the Government who introduced the measure. Is this an example of the responsible government we were promised when the present Ministry took office ? Is it an example of the responsible government which honorable senators opposite have combined in order to bring into operation. I say that it is a travesty upon responsible government. </para>

                            <para>- It is a curious anomaly. I may or may not be justified, but I do not believe that the members of the Government, in their heart of hearts, are more sincere in favour of the principle involved in this Bill than are any of their supporters. I believe they have introduced it only in deference to the overwhelming public opinion in its favour. </para>

                            <para>- I think that my belief is supported bv the fact that almost every honorable senator behind the Government is absolutely opposed to the principle of the Bill. I should like to congratulate the Attorney-General' on the exceedingly eloquent and. able speech with which he introduced the measure. It was an admirable speech, and I have absolutely no fault to find with it. The most enthusiastic advocate of the Bill might be exceedingly proud to have delivered such a speech in its favour. While, with the greatest pleasure I pay that tribute to the ability and enthusiasm the honorable and learned senator has displayed, I should like to call attention to the fact that there was in the speech a veiled threat held out to the Senate that if it did not deal in a certain spirit, and in a certain way, with this Bill, certain consequences would ensue. In introducing the measure the Attorney-General said that it had already wrecked two Governments, and it only remained for it now to establish a record by wrecking a Parliament. If that" meant anything at all, it meant that if the Senate did not agree to the Bill as received from the House of Representatives, it was possible that there would be a double dissolution, and that the members of the Senate would be responsible for wrecking a Parliament. I am sure that I speak for every member of the party with which I am associated, as well as for myself, when I say that if this Bill were to, wreck a hundred Parliaments, we are not going to abate one jot of our right to amend it in any direction in which we think it ought to be amended in the interests of the people. If in connexion with such a matter we wrecked a hundred Parliaments, all that we should have done would be to refer the question back to our masters, the people, who sent us here. I hold the opinion, which I believe is shared by the Attorney-General and every other honorable senator, that the Senate is a co-ordinate branch of the Federal Legislature. It is as important a part of this Commonwealth! Parliament as is the other House, and that being so we have an undoubted right to exercise the power reposed in us to amend any Bill in any direction we may deem desirable in the interests of the people. I, therefore, resent any threat being held out to the Senate that by taking certain action it may wreck a Parliament. This Senate has a right to resent such a threat, because it is an attempt to intimidate us from doing what we may believe to be right, because some personal penalty may follow. That consideration should only spur us to the performance of our duty. The man who will only do what is right because pf some reward, or because no ill consequence may follow, is deserving of very little praise. We should do what is right and just irrespective of consequences, and that is the principle which should animate every member of the Senate in dealing with a measure of this kind. There is just one point in the Attorney-General's speech to which I desire to call attention, and which emphasizes what I said at the opening of my speech as to the sort of responsible government Ave now have in the Commonwealth. The Attorney-General pointed out that this Senate, as especially representing the States, has to safeguard States rights. The honorable and learned senator intimated that there was one provision in the Bill which, in his opinion, and in the opinion of the Government, is an infringement of States rights. That is the provision dealing with the inclusion of public servants within the operation of the Bill, and this the Attorney-General invited this Senate, as the custodian of States rights, to eliminate. But when challenged on the point, he did not, and could not, say that the Government would propose to strike out the clause. </para>

                            <para>- Anybody who reads the Attorney-General's speech, as I did, and with very great pleasure, will find that there is a plain invitation to the Senate to safeguard States rights. We were invited to consider whether it was not our duty to eliminate the provision; which the honorable and learned senator thought was unconstitutional, and an infringement of States rights; but, in reply to an interjection, he said that the Government would not propose its elimination. If that is the sort of responsible Government we have, I say that it is a travesty. Here we have the Government fathering a measure which contains a provision of which they distinctly disapprove, and yet they dare not propose its elimination, though they invite the Senate generally to reject it. I say that the Government are evading their responsibilities; and to call that responsible government as a mere travesty. The Attorney-General's speech bears out in full every statement I have made. Were it not that it would unduly prolong my remarks. I should read what the Attorney-General said1 on this particular aspect of the case; and if the Attorney-General reads his remarks over again he will admit, as he is always ready to do under similar circumstances, that I have fairly stated the case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> took it upon himself to threaten that the Senate would have to accept the responsibility of losing the Bill if we attempted to amend it. He certainly said that no drastic amendments would be accepted by another place - that the Government would, rather than accept such amendments, " chuck " ' the measure under the table. If that be so, let me invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> as an ardent supporter of the Government, to induce the Government to put the Bill under the table if they dare. When this Bill was before another place, with another Government in power, the present Prime Minister said that it was not the property of any particular Government - that it was the property of the people and their representatives, and that no Government could say what would be its fate. I agree with that statement ; and it does not lie in the mouth of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> to say what will be the fate of the measure if we attempt to amend it. The Bill, having come before the Senate, is now the property of the Senate, and it is our undoubted and inherent right to amend it in any direction we think proper in the interests of the people and the States we represent. For my part, even if the threat of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has any justification. I would rather see the Bill "chucked" under the table than have it placed on the statute-book in its present form. I believe that now when we are attempting to deal with the subject of industrial arbitration, we should make our legislation as effective as possible. We should do all we possibly can to make it a good and useful Bill, which will provide for every possible case. I should like to remark - and I think the Attorney-General will agree with me - that in the industrial world to-day compulsory arbitration is on its trial. </para>

                            <para>- The system has been tried only in a few countries of the civilized world, and in a few States of the Commonwealth, and the period during which it has been working is too short to enable us . to form an absolute judgment as to its full effects. The system being on its trial, I contend that it is the duty of this Parliament to deal with it in such a spirit as will enable us to pass a measure that will be really effective. Let me remind the Senate that in this Bill we are not merely legislating for the Commonwealth; we are doing something more. Under these southern skies new communities built up under the British flag, are leading the way in progressive legislation. In passing an Arbitration' Bill we have the eyes of the civilized world upon us, and other nations will be largely guided in their industrial legislation in the future by the success or otherwise of the Bill we pass. Therefore, I think there is an enormous responsibility resting on us in taking the lead in this matter, and1 we should not if we can possibly avoid it, allow an imperfect measure to receive the stamp of legislative approval in the Commonwealth. For that reason it is more important that in this attempt we should not be so anxious to save time, or be actuated by any other motive than the desire to make the measure as perfect as possible. I hold that belief strongly, and I think the Attorney-General will agree with me that we are doing something more than legislating for the Commonwealth. We are, as I say, taking the lead with a progressive measure which will guide the civilized world in the near future. </para>

                            <para>- We should be exceedingly careful not to do anything which might nullify the possible good effects of the measure. The Bill should be so framed that it might fairly be expected to prove in actual practice that it will be as beneficent to the general well-being as its most ardent advocates believe. For the reasons which I have briefly enumerated, I hold that it is right for the Senate to amend the Bill in any direction we deem desirable. With regard to the threat that the other House or the Government may deal in a very scurvy manner with the Senate - that they may refuse to consider any amendments we may make- </para>

Not by way of a threat, but by way of a reply to the veiled threat held out by the Attorney-General that the Bill might wreck a Parliament, I say that in the last resort the Senate has an exceedingly effective means to deal with a recalcitrant Government or lower House which refuses to give full consideration to its amendments. I ask the Attorney-General, what sort of a fix the present Government would find themselves in if they insultingly refused to consider our amendments - to have anything further to do with the Bill, because we had amended it - if we in retaliation refused, as we have the power to refuse if we see fit, to pass the Government Estimates ? </para>

                            <para>- I never require a " peg " on which to hang an attack. If I wanted to attack <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> the Attorney-General, or the Government, I should not go round looking for a " peg " - I should make the attack straight away. I regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> as a personal friend of my own, and any remarks I make about him are purely political. I may say that when I first became' acquainted with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> I very shortly began to think he was a really good democrat, disguised as a conservative, but after his speech the other night, I begin to think that he is a first-class conservative disguised with a thin veneer of democracy. It is admitted on all hands that there is need of a measure of the kind before us - that the industrial strife which has been going on for generations calls for some other remedy than disastrous strikes and lock-outs. It is universally conceded that some method should be devised to protect the public from the disastrous consequences of industrial strife. We have seen in this country - and have heard of similar occurrences in other countries' - the terrible results of strikes, both to employers and employed. Millions of pounds have been lost to the employers, owing to the cessation of work, and millions of pounds have also been lost in wages to the employes, and those dependent on them. Their wives and little children have had to go hungry, and the employers have often relied upon the cries of the little ones' for the bread which their parents were unable to supply, in order to force the employes to accept the terms offered. Untold suffering and loss have been inflicted upon the whole community by that sort of industrial strife. People who were in no way connected with the strike have been just as seriously affected by its results. When one industry stops it involves other industries in its temporary ruin. The workmen in several other industries are thrown out of employment. All the industries indirectly affected, perhaps, suffer as great a loss as the industries directly affected. The whole community is so much the poorer by the cessation of the wealth-producing power of the industries for the time being. But that is not the worst thing which occurs through industrial strife. It engenders an intensely bitter feeling between the employers and the employes, and general hostility between employers as a whole and employes as a whole. Anything which will tend to minimize or do away with that intense bitterness of feeling between fellow citizens, between people whose interests under any proper system should be common, ought to be welcomed by the Senate. These are only a few of the many and great evils attendant upon industrial strife. And any attempt to provide a remedy ought to be welcomed by everybody who has at heart the interests of the employers on the one side, and the employes on the other side, as well as the interests of the general community. I do not view this as a Bill which is in the interests of employers or employes, but as a Bill which is in the interests of the general public, and therefore also in the interests of employers and employes. The community has an absolute right to protect itself from the evil consequences which may result from industrial disputes. Frequently during this debate we have been told that the Bill is an unwarrantable infringement of private liberty, that an employer must have the absolute right to say who shall or shall' not work for him, and that no such infringement of individual liberty should be attempted by any Government or Parliament. Now every law, no matter what it is, is an infringement of individual liberty. I challenge any honorable senator to mention a single Act in this or any other civilized country which is not an infringement of individual liberty. Therefore the contention that because the Bill infringes individual liberty it is a bad one falls to the ground. In all organized communities there must be an interference with individual liberty, because that is the foundation of all government. If every man had the fullest liberty to do what he liked, when he liked, and where he liked, then good- bye to all government. In a civilized state every citizen must have given up a certain" amount of his individual liberty in the interests of the general community in order to establish that government. When honorable senators talk about an interference with individual liberty, they are unconsciously advocating absolute individual liberty. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> or any other honorable senator on that side were called an anarchist he would feel highly insulted. If their statements are analyzed it will be found that that is exactly what they are advocating here. </para>

                            <para>- I am only responsible for the sentiments I express.' I have expressed my views as freely as any other honorable senator has done, and therefore <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> knows them just as well as any one does. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mann</inline> or any other person is right on all occasions. I refuse to be drawn aside by an inane interjection about what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mann</inline> did or did not say. Every law, I repeat, interferes with individual liberty. It is an offence for a man to be drunk in the streets. It is also an offence to sell whisky without a licence. Every one who is in favour of government at all must agree that it is necessary to" give up a certain amount of individual liberty. All we ask for in this Bill is that a small modicum of individual liberty which is enjoyed by the employers on the one side and the employes on the other, shall be given up for the good of the general community. An enormous sacrifice is demanded of trade unionists when they are asked to give up the weapon of which they have hitherto had the free use in order to fight for their rights. It is admitted in Great Britain by the highest authorities, and it is acknowledged in Australia that the right to strike and the existence of trade unions have effected more good for the working people of Great Britain and Australia than any other combination of circumstances, or any other efforts made in that direction. When we ask trade' unionists to give up the weapon by which they have accomplished so much, and by which they might accomplish much more; when we ask them to give up their individual liberty in that direction we should be careful to see that the Bill affords them an ample safeguard and protection against the injustice which might be forced upon them through the lack of that weapon. In doing so, we think we are only adopting a reasonable course. I do not uphold strikes. I think that a strike is a barbarous method" of accomplishing the end in view, but until some other weapon is invented, or some tribunal is created, by which the same result can be obtained, it is absolutely necessary. Therefore, when this weapon is withdrawn from the .trade unionists we should be careful to see that they receive ample compensation for the sacrifice we ask them to make.

                    <para class="block">It does not propose to inflict upon them any disability, which dozens of laws I could name have very often imposed upon other persons. It is largely designed In their interests. We are told that untold loss and suffering are inflicted upon them because of the uncertainty of the labour conditions, because their industry is likely to be disjointed at any time by a strike, because they have no safeguard that the conditions of labour will remain the same from day to day. What do we offer them in return ? We offer them absolute security in the form of a decision by a judicial tribunal, which I believe can be so constituted as to command the entire confidence of every person in the community. We are also told that the employers will suffer inordinate hardship if they are compelled to give preference to unionists. At a later stage I intend to deal more fully with that subject, but here I shall merely say that it is only insisted upon when every condition is equal. What we ask, and what the Bill says, is that "all other things being equal " preference may be granted. If, for instance, I were as good a workman as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> but not a unionist, and he were a unionist, he would have a right to get a little preference over me. Where is there any hardship to the employer in that ? </para>

I agree entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> that no section of the community should be shut out from the benefits of the law. No class in the community, except the Public Service, was shut out from the effects of this Bill as it was introduced by the Deakin Government. There is something radically wrong in a law which does not apply to every individual in the community. </para>

I have not indicated any particular amendment; I am only speaking of the general principle, that no person should be exempt from the provisions of a law. It is a pernicious act to exempt one section of the people from a law. The law should be there for every citizen. It is the intention of the party with which I am associated to make the scope of this Bill as wide as possible, so that every section of the community - so far as we are not limited by the Constitution under which we exist - shall enjoy the benefits which the Bill confers. Amendments will be moved such as we deem necessary to attain that end. We were intrusted with certain rights and certain powers by the Constitution.

                            <para>- I will argue that question with the honorable senator at a later stage. No section of employers or employes should be excluded from the benefits of this measure. We have been told by the highest legal authorities that the word " industrial," as used in the Constitution, has a very important meaning. We are assured that it certainly limits our right to deal with the employes of the States to those who are engaged in industrial occupation such as railways, dock-yards - if we had Government dock-yards - railway work-shops, and other places of the kind. </para>

The interpretation of what constitutes an " industrial " employment must be left to the High Court.

                            <para>- I am inclined to agree that they should neither have been included nor excluded. No limitation should have been imposed. The Attorney-General has invited us to exclude the States servants on the ground that the Senate is in an especial degree a States' House. But I would point out that we are the representatives of the whole of the people of Australia, chosen on the widest franchise - a franchise that means in our case a sort of national referendum in every State. We have, to safeguard the rights of the people of the States.- Some people would interpret " States rights " to mean the views of any particular State Government for the time being. I do not share that opinion. I hold that my duty as a senator representing the State to which I belong is to safeguard the welfare of the whole of the people of that State, rather than to accommodate myself to the views of the few people who may happen to be in power for the time being. Every senator is quite as competent to know the particular interests of the State which he represents, as is any State Government, or collection of individuals in a State. When I am told that to include the States servants is to infringe States rights, I reply that States rights have nothing at all to do with the question. In every State the Governments are trying to find means by which they can free themselves from their responsibilities in dealing with their public servants. In Victoria the railways have been handed over to the control of Railways Commissioners, who are supposed to <inline font-style="italic">bo.</inline> absolutely free from political influence. In Queensland a Public Service Board was established to deal with the entire Public Service, in order - as was said by the people who adopted the system - to remove the Public Service from political influence. The Government were absolutely bound by the. decision of that Public Service Board, which could1 increase or decrease wages just as it pleased. Parliament was bound to vote the salaries which the board chose to fix. </para>

                    <para class="block">Therefore, the cry that we should be taxing the States by establishing this tribunal, is so much bunkum, and I do not propose to be influenced by it in the slightest degree. What is proposed in this Bill? We are proposing to establish a tribunal which I hope will be so composed as to possess the confidence of the entire Commonwealth. That tribunal will hold the scales of justice evenly between the States and their servants. It will endeavour to do the fair thing in regard to every case which comes before it. We are sometimes told that the States would refuse to obey the decisions of the Court. I should like to see them try it. The States Governments have to obey the verdicts of the Courts already. Have no verdicts ever been recorded against States Governments before? There have been scores and hundreds of cases. Has no verdict ever been recorded against the Commonwealth? I think so. Has the Commonwealth ever refused to obey the decision of the Court? Do the people who make this statement think that the States are going to defy the law, or <inline font-style="italic">10</inline> do something which would absolutely set at nought the decisions of a judicial tribunal ? </para>

But it is preposterous to suppose that any Parliament would defy the law or would resist tha decrees of the Courts. I am satisfied that the States would loyally abide by the decisions of this Court, and I believe that the States Parliaments in most instances would be very glad to be relieved of the responsibility of dealing with their employes in matters of this kind, and would rejoice that the ultimate decision was left to an independent tribunal.

                    <para class="block">States servants, in case of a dispute between them and their Governments, would be an infringement of States rights. It must also be remembered that a dispute between a State and its servants might overflow into another State. If that happened the dispute would immediately become a Commonwealth matter. It is our duty as a Commonwealth Parliament to set to work to provide against such possibilities. What sort of national disaster would occur if our industries were capsized, or subject to sudden cessation through- a great dispute between a State and its servants? <inline font-style="italic">'l'obe</inline> the railway strike which occurred in Victoria some time ago. The amount of loss and bitterness and hatred that would accrue from a struggle of that kind, if extended into another State, would be almost inconceivable. Yet we a e asked to believe that the Commonwealth is powerless to legislate for such cases. There are only one or two Other points that I wish to make before resuming my seat. One of them has relation to the question of preference to unionists, about which there has been a good deal of misunderstanding and bickering and bitterness. This feeling has mainly arisen because of a misconception, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has pointed out, " preference to unionists " is a wrong term. What we require is really protection for unionists. Unless there is protection for unionists, the benefits proposed to be conferred by a measure of this kind will be useless. It must be remembered that, in order that cases may be referred to the Court, there must be organizations. There must 02 in thom organizations persons who take a prominent part in cases which are worked up for submission to the Court. There are always certain prominent men connected with trade unions who take a leading part in their proceedings. Suppose a case affecting a certain industry was taken before the Court. Suppose that an award was made in favour of the union. If there is no preference provision, undoubtedly the prominent men would be boycotted and victimized. Let me give an instance which came under my own personal observation of the way in which prominent unionists are treated by employers. I know that there are other honorable senators who have personal knowledge of such cases. On Charters Towers, following the general election, in 1903, for the State Parliament, when two labour representatives were returned for that great gold-field, every man who had taken a prominent part, in unionism or in labour politics speedily became a marked man with all the employers of labour. It did not matter how many mouths were dependent upon him, if he were objectionable from! the political or union stand-point, he was immediately victimized. It would, perhaps, have been no great hardship for a man to be dismissed from one mine, but when the mine-owners all followed the same course, and it became absolutely hopeless for a man dismissed from one mine to get employment in another, the result was that he had to leave his wife and family at Charters Towers and roam this Commonwealth from one end to the other in search of employment. I believe that as many as 700 or 800 cases of victimizing in that way occurred. We used to make a noise about it. We used to get on public platforms, and denounce those who were guilty of it. Those who had taken this action protested that there was no such thing as victimizing going on, that the men who were dismissed from employment were "sacked" in the ordinary course of business, and that their politics and their unionism had nothing to do with their dismissal. A case, however, occurred by which one man was able to sheet home the charge of victimizing .to these people. A man was working in a mine in which he held a considerable number of shares. At a meeting of the <inline font-style="italic">directors</inline> of the mine, one of the directors, looking over the pay-sheet, said to the manager, "I see you have got such and such a man there ; why do you keep him; he is an agitator?" The manager said. " I do not know anything about his being an agitator. I have no fault to find with him. He suits me." The director then said, " You will have to sack that man," and the manager replied, " I shall not do anything of the kind. If- you want to sack him, you must sack him yourself." The director then said, "We will very soon do that." A resolution was passed at that meeting of the directors, and the man was " sacked ' ' accordingly. The man considered what steps he should take to obtain satisfaction for this gross outrage upon his liberty to work in a mine in which he was a large shareholder, and 'at- the same time to convict these people of the boycotting of which they were so guilty, but which they so strenuously  denied. "  He considered that the only thing for him to do was to compel" the employers to bring him before a Court, when he might get the opportunity of putting them in the witness-box, and of making them swear to the facts themselves. He took that course. He horsewhipped the director who had "sacked" him, and he was taken to Court. The directors were put into the  witness-box,  and they were made to swear to the facts themselves. The result was that the man got two months in gaol with hard labour. That is absolutely true. I was myself the man. That is the sort of thing we shall have if we do not provide in this measure for preference to unionists. </para>

                            <para>- What I have described is what will follow if we do not give preference to unionists. After men have taken all the trouble necessary to work up their organizations, provide funds to carry them on, and bring their disputes before the Court, they will undoubtedly be victimized if we do not provide for preference for unionists. Honorable senators may tell me that the Bill provides that no man shall be "sacked" merely because he is a trade unionist. Do honorable senators believe that any employer would ever be stupid enough to say that he had discharged a man for any such reason? A thousand and one excuses can be found for getting rid of a man besides the excuse that he is a trade unionist. Without preference to unionists, the result will be that any man who urges his fellow workers to bring a case before the Arbitration Court for the betterment of the conditions under which they live will be victimized. Is that to be the only reward which this Parliament will give to a man for self-sacrificing efforts on behalf of his fellow workmen? We are asking, only for a fair thing. Preference is asked for unionists only when all other things are equal, when the unionist workman is as good as any other, and when there are plenty of unionist workmen available for the work offering. Being convinced that we are asking only for a fair thing, it is our duty to do our utmost to give unionists this one small advantage in return for the sacrifice we are asking them to make in giving up their individual liberty, and the right to strike, which is the great weapon on which they have hitherto relied, to better their conditions and to enforce a fair deal for themselves. We have heard a great deal about the working of the Arbitration Act in New Zealand, and I should like to quote one or two extracts from the report of Judge Backhouse, who, in 1 901, was sent over from New South Wales as a Royal Commissioner to report on the working of the New Zealand Act. At page 9 of his report, dealing with this question of preference, Judge Backhouse says - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Thus honorable senators will see that we are not asking for anything new. This is the basis of the New Zealand Act, and it applies all round. So long as union workers are available, they must give the preference in the use of their services to employers working under the award, as pointed out by Judge Backhouse. It is well known that organization is the whole basis of this Bill, as well as of the New Zealand and New South Wales Acts. There must be organization before an award of the Court can be secured. After men have gone to the trouble of forming their organizations and contributing to them for years, and after . they have given up their individual liberty and their right to strike, are we to give them nothing in return? Are the people who will not help us to submit industrial disputes to a peaceful method of settlement to reap the whole of the benefits of a verdict of the Arbitration Court, whilst unionists are only to reap the right to be victimized ? It is monstrous to suggest such a thing. It is palpably right that unionists, after they have gone to the trouble to enable such legislation to be effective, and have made the sacrifices necessary, should get some little advantage from the Bill which we are passing, in the interests of the general community, ro secure industrial peace. There are one or two minor principles contained in the Bill, to which I should like to refer briefly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> and other honorable senators opposite have told us that if we pass this Bill it will frighten capital out of the country, that it will curtail enterprise, and prevent people from engaging in industries. At page 15 of his report, in dealing with the effect of the recommendations of the boards and of the awards of the Court on the investment of capital in and on the expansion of industries, Judge Backhouse says - </para>
                    <para>Generally, I should say that my investigations showed that, with possibly one exception, industries have not been hampered by the provisions of the Act. To attempt to decide whether capital, under other conditions, would have been invested in particular industries is to undertake a task which has merely to be mentioned to show its impossibility. No doubt general statements were made that this abstension had been practised, but I found it more than difficult to get specific instances. Any cases which were mentioned, on investigation, hardly bore out the view put forward. For instance, I was told of the delay in the building of a shirt factory at Auckland j but the factory is now up and in full working order, and it was one of my pleasantest official sights when going over it to see the large number of healthy girls working under conditions which seemed almost perfect. </para>
                    <para class="block">This is the result of this awful arbitration legislation which honorable senators opposite would have us believe is going to be so disastrous to the industries and the people of Australia. These are the words of a Judge of a New South Wales Court, acting as a Royal Commissioner, and making an impartial inquiry into the operation of similar legislation in New Zealand. We have been told also that this measure will engender strife. We say that it will minimize strife, because it will ' render strife abortive. Judge Backhouse, in speaking on this phase of the question, says at pages 23 and 24 of his report - </para>

I saw none of the ill-feeling which has been painted in so strong colours. On the contrary, one of the things which struck me was the excellent relations which existed between employes and employers. I noticed this in the proceedings which I witnessed before a Conciliation Board, and in the Arbitration Court, There the contending parties, although they were fighting their very hardest, appeared to be on excellent terms. At the Denniston mine, after I had examined the manager, he, of his own accord, brought into his office <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Foster,</inline> the representative of the miners, and left him with me to give me his statement, and I could see that this was <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> mere courtesy to me, but was indicative of the cordial relations existing between them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frostick,</inline> during the hearing of the case of the bootmakers, who have had, as I have said, too wide an experience of the Act, made these remarks - " Never, in the history of boot manufacturing in the colony, has there been such a good understanding between the employers and the workers as at present," and " Whatever else the Court of Arbitration has accomplished it assists in bringing about that excellent feeling referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cooper."</inline></para>

The Act has prevented strikes of any magnitude, and has, on the whole, brought about a better relation between employers and employes than would exist if there were no Act. It has enabled the increase of wages and the other conditions favorable to the workmen, which, under the circumstances of the colony, they are entitled to, to be settled without that friction and bitterness of feeling which otherwise might have existed ; it has enabled employers, for a time at least, to know with certainty the conditions of production, and, therefore, to make contracts with the knowledge that they would be able to fulfil them ; and, indirectly, it has tended to a more harmonious feeling among the people generally, which must have worked for the weal of the colony.

(The building trade, with which I am connected, suffers much from shoddy work done by shoddy men - chiefly owing to the fact that employers desire cheap men. This causes me to be strongly in favour of the principle of preference to unionists - a principle which will be more fully dealt with at the Committee stage. This has always seemed to me the essence and kernel of the measure - the vital clause. Unless men are encouraged by preference to joinorganiza tions. the machinery required to carry out the Bill will be wanting, and unions will cease to exist. It seems to me that in this debate some time has been taken up by repetition, but it should be made clear to the opponents of preference to unionists, that it is absolutely necessary, if this Bill is to have any effect, to have strong organi zations on both sides, and the only way to bring about that result is to encourage organization. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator, Gray</inline> is opposed to preference to unionists.

                            <para>- If the majority of the association decided that the wages of the men should be reduced, the honorable senator, in loyalty to that body, would have either to reduce the wages of his own men, or to resign. I have been in exactly that position as an employer. Having been a trade unionist, I have always had a feeling of regard and respect for trade unions. I have felt that they were doing a good work in the community. My experience has been that, as a rule, a unionist is a better workman than a non-unionist. The best men get into the trade unions. A fear has been expressed that where there were ten unionists and 490 non-unionists, the former would get a preference. If a preference be given, where would any hardship come in? Since the unionists would be superior workmen, no hardship would be entailed upon an employer in having to employ them. He could employ men from among the 490 non-unionists at his leisure. </para>

                            <para>- The employer gets the best men, whether unionists or non-unionists ; at least I always did. If I were asked for work by two men of equal capacity, one being a unionist and the other a non-unionist, I should prefer the unionist, because he is doing something to better the condition of not only himself, but all those engaged in his trade, and incidentally to benefit others outside his class. I do not suppose that any one here will dispute the proposition that high wages to the industrial class mean general prosperity to every other class in the community. It has been proved everywhere that every class is more prosperous when wages are high than when they are low. I wish now to refer to the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith.</inline> I hold with the last speaker that we should endeavour to make every measure as perfect as possible, even although it might result in its being dropped elsewhere. At the last Senate election in South Australia the three successful candidates travelled throughout the State advocating or supporting a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and particularly mentioning the inclusion of States servants and preference to unionists. It is only fair to assume that the electors, by their votes on that occasion, approved of the provisions including States servants and giving preference to unionists. </para>

The fact that it was introduced by the Government, and is supported by the Opposition, assures its second reading. In Committee. 1 shall have an opportunity of saying a little more in support of what I consider the vital point of this very important measure. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall not delay the second reading of the Bill, which, I have no doubt, will1 be carried, I hope on the voices, for more than a few minutes. There are one or two matters to which I should like to refer. No one, I. think, can say that the debate has taken a longer time than the importance of the subject, and the varied questions of a controversial character, which are involved, have fairly demanded. The speeches have been,, as a whole, of a very informing character. They have served1 the purpose, at any rate, of ventilating a variety of ideas, and sifting a great deal of information, coming from all sides, on the matters with which we shall have to deal. Nor do I intend to occupy any time in referring, so far as I am able to gather from the tenor of the debate, to the comparatively few questions on which we shall be, on. either side, more or less at arm's length. But we would have been glad to get from honorable senators on the other side a little more information as to the amendments which they intend to propose, and the direction which they are to take.' </para>

                    <para class="block">provements. But I am bound to say that I have not yet heard any suggestion which, in my opinion, is necessary to the efficiency of the Bill, or is likely to improve or round it off. If honorable senators on this side of the Chamber were to be guided by what was said by the honorable senator, who is, I suppose, still the leader of the Opposition, this Bill would be landed in a chaos of ineffectiveness which I, for one,- should greatly deplore. The most direct suggestion we have had has been from my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> in that genial rollicking speech in which he dealt so effectively with the necessity for a definition of Socialism, ' and declared that he throws overboard the provision in the Bill defining the principle regarding preference to unionists, and with equal impartiality also the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> and goes back to the original Bill. He does so on the ground that the original measure was formulated by his Government, and, therefore, must be the best possible. Consistency could no further go. We all think our own swans the whitest, and my honorable friend thinks that the handiwork of his Government is not to be eclipsed. But do my honorable friends opposite intend to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> lead ? I am consumed with curiosity on that point. Why do they not tell us? They are not 'game to do so. There is absolute silence in their ranks. My honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> did not get a cheer on that point. </para>

                            <para>- 1 do not wish to quibble about a word. I am willing to take it that his remarks were a warning. But the word " threat " has been used. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith's</inline> observations are to be regarded as a threat there are equally good grounds for so interpreting the observation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who made a very interesting speech on the subject. And while I say that I should like to add that there was another speech to which I draw special attention. I allude to that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline> A more thoughtful, moderate, and wise speech it has never been my lot to listen to, in dealing with such a complicated matter as this. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that he would rather see this Bill go into the waste-paper basket than upon the statute-book in its present form. That is to say, if he ' cannot secure this Bill in such a form, as a majority of Parliament declare to be inimical to the best interests of the measure, he will have neither part nor lot in it, and would prefer to see it put in the waste-paper basket. I do not think that the word "threat" ought to be applied even to that remark. But it does amount to this that my honorable friend says, " If I can I will tear up this measure and cast it to the four winds if I do not get my way." What does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> say," or any other honorable senator on the same side ? He says, in a much milder form, " I wish to get my way, but I am not going to carry that to the extent of imperilling the Bill. I will do everything I can." He .did not* mean that the Senate should not exercise its legitimate function or abate one iota of its rights. We are to consider, first of all, the voice of the country, and, secondly, to consider the possibility at every stage of passing the measure into law. </para>

                            <para>- I take leave to differ from the honorable senator. My honorable friend's recollection is according to what he believes, but my recollection is in accordance with what I believe. I did not hear words of that kind, and I did not infer that from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> said. Whilst I agree, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> knows quite well, with every word the honorable senator said as to this Senate giving effect to its own opinion by amendment in Bills of any kind, I think, at the same time, that as a legislating Chamber it is our business to consider, as practical, sensible men, the possibility of a particular amendment being adopted or carried into effect. Legislation is a system of compromise ; politics is a system of compromise. </para>

                            <para>- I am coming to what my honorable friend says. No one is more permeated with constitutional ideas, in relation to parliamentary institutions, than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford. His</inline> long experience, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Storyhas</inline> alluded, is a warrant for that, apart from our own experience of him as a member of the Senate. My honorable friend says that this is not the time for compromise. I say that it is the time, though perhaps not to the same extent. I say that at every stage, as practical business men legislating for the country, we have to consider the possibility of passing the measure into law. My honorable friends opposite will understand that I do not suggest that everything should be considered. The whole of the members of the Senate do not go to the country every three years, as do honorable members in another place, and, therefore, , we must pay some respect to the opinion of the country, as reflected in another place, though it may not be indicated by our own. <inline font-style="italic">personnel.</inline></para>

                            <para>- I say that at this stage we must give consideration to these things, though I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that the crucial moment will come when the Bill is returned to us with the final views of another place. We may then have to deal with it- by withdrawal, insistence, or in such other way as the wisdom and prudence of the Senate shall dictate. I agree with my honorable friend as to that, but I contend that we should not be oblivious of these considerations even at this stage, because when the other stage comes, if we forget these things now, if we are immoderate now - as I do not for a moment think we shall be - when the measure comes back to us at that critical stage to which I have referred, feeling will have been imported, the fighting instinct will have been aroused, and it may be more difficult to arrive at what might be called a <inline font-style="italic">via media</inline> then than it would be if we now prepared our lines and laid our plans with caution and with wisdom. I therefore say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> said no more than it was his duty to say. We in this Chamber represent the people as much as do honorable members of another place, although under limitations which do not apply to them. But we do not come from the people as a whole in the same way. and to that limited extent, at least, we are very much in the position of that non-elective body, the House of Lords, when it stands perhaps for a session or two as an obstruction in the path of reforms and beneficial legislation, but after a general election yields to the voice of the people. No one will accuse me of anything like craven submission or abandonment of our powers. </para>

                        <para>Honorable senators must see that if this measure were carried to-morrow there would have to be a complete re-organization and amalgamation of the different workers in each of the States. Can honorable senators not see the necessity for that? It is really what must come about before such legislation as this can have any effect. </para>

                    <para class="block">I think that the number prescribed under this Bill can register so long as conditions are complied with in regard to employers. The body then becomes an organization under the Bill, and effective for all the purposes of the Bill. The severest blow against the utility of the measure and its efficiency will have been struck by the leader of the Opposition if he has his way, and embodies these views in this measure. I do not invite the honorable senator to try to so embody his views, because, unlike him, I wish the measure to become law and effective. But the honorable senator has " let the cat out of the bag " as to how it is he is so far ahead of his party. This is what it all means- - </para>

The intention of the Constitution and of this measure - not merely my intention, or the intention of my friends opposite - is not that the control of industrial affairs in all parts of Australia shall be taken away from the States., and placed under the control of the Commonwealth, but only so far as concerns those disputes which extend beyond the boundaries of a State, and become a national menace. That is the principle of the measure. </para>

The honorable senator reminds me of the celebrated line, " Stiff in opinion, always in the wrong." But I leave the honorable senator to any explanation which he may be able to give to his friends, and I only beg him, before the Bill gets into Committee, to free his mind from all those extraordinary notions, and to apply the true principles of the Bill to the clauses as they come under consideration. I was glad to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley's</inline> views as <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the desirability of liberalizing union rules, so as in every possible way to afford facilities for the introduction of members. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> pointed out, with uncommon moderation, the desirability of such a step, and with great wisdom commended it to tall trade unions. Undoubtedly it is one which will necessarily go a long way to commend the unions, whose good works and services have been exalted in the Senate, and as to which I' need say no more. These facilities would not only commend unions to greater favour all round, but, if I may be- permitted to say so, would strengthen them greatly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> referred to the fact that the Bill was intended to encourage organization. But what organization? It is organization for the purposes of the Bill. This is a matter to which I beg honorable senators to give consideration, and, if I am mistaken in view, to correct me, when I shall be the first to admit my error. This Bill is not, as has been assumed, for the encouragement and aggrandizement of trade unions ; the object is the encouragement of organizations brought into existence, not fur trade purposes, in the same sense as trade unions, or for political purposes, or anything of the kind, but for the purposes of this particular Bill, with a view to- secure the remedial benefits intended to be conferred by it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> yesterday said that there was a limitation in the number pf organizations to be registered in each State, under schedule 2 of the Bill. But that refers to organizations of the same name. It is merely an importation into, the Bill of what is notorious in company law. The provision that there shall not be more than one organization of the same name is intended to prevent confusion. </para>

My honorable friend ought to take the trouble to verify the' quotations he makes before he founds upon them imputations such as are contained in this passage - i was surprised that, at the conclusion of his address, he expected any one to vote for the second reading of the Bill, seeing that he regarded it as impossible to carry out its provisions. </para>
                    <para class="block">Where did I say that? I have said, on the contrary, that the Bill, as it is, will be effective. Honorable senators differ from me as to some of the details, but I never said what is here attributed to me. If I thought it was impossible' to carry out the provisions of the Bill I should be worthy of the severest censure for coming here and moving its second reading.. 'What I did say* was that in regard to railway disputes, I believed .that it would be inoperative because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> . also thought, a railway dispute - we may be mistaken- - would not be likely to extend beyond the limits of a State.

                    <para class="block">How could the honorable senator say such a thing? He stands alone; he does not stand in front of his party in that respect, but a long way behind them. I value what other honorable senators have said on that subject.

He forgets at the end of a speech what he said at the beginning.

I feel that it is unnecessary to refer to other matters which have been dealt with. I hope that the second reading of the Bill will be carried on the voices, and that in Committee we shall do our best, unmoved by threats, or, as far as may be, by undue apprehensions but giving just regard to what is practical and possible in legislation, and that we shall eventually succeed in framing a measure which will carry out the intention, not of myself or honorable senators on this side alone, but the great desire which influences us in common with my friends opposite, whose views, even where they differ from mine in matters of detail, I must sincerely respect. </para>
