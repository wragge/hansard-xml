                <para>I may say at once that there is absolutely nothing behind my motion. But I feel that we are under some little disadvantage, as it was understood that the papers in question were to be laid before Parliament. The selection of a Commonwealth flag is a very important matter, and it has apparently been left to judges whose qualifications have been seriously questioned. I have 'no other desire than to have an opportunity of seeing the papers, and to understand what has led to the selection being, made without any reference to Parliament. I think that Parliament ought to have been consulted quite as -much as outside authorities - indeed, much more so. </para>

                <para class="block">Although my motion occupies a little space on the business paper, it will riot be found to be a difficult matter to deal with. There is a provision in the last section of the Defence Act enabling either House of the Parliament to disallow any of the regulations made under the Act within a certain number of days. I believe that to-day is about the last on which such a motion can be moved ; and in view of the fact that I ask the Senate only to disallow some minor portions of six regulations, I think it will be seen that there is nothing captious in my proposal, and that it is very mild. But while the regulations objected to are not numerous, they deal with an important subject. I suppose that it will be best to move with regard to each regulation separately. 3 h </para>

                    <para>That the Senate resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole for the purpose of considering the following Regulations issued under the Defence Act 1903 : - </para>
                    <para class="block">Then the regulations are enumerated as before. It will be, perhaps, desirable that I should, in the briefest manner possible, indicate the amendments which I shall ask honorable senators to make. I shall do so in a very few words, and shall not argue the proposition. Regulation 72, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g,</inline> which is the first one objected to, provides seven" grounds on which an officer's commission may be cancelled. I think that the first six amply cover the field, and that the seventh, which I propose to strike out, is unnecessary. It affords scope for undesirable practices. As to portion <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of regulation 83, that is a proposal for seconding officers of the Defence Forces if they sit in the Federal Parliament. Seconding means putting officers on the military shelf - out of the way. My reason for proposing to interfere with that regulation is that it seems to me that it is an insidious attempt to interfere with the constitutional rights of members of the Defence Forces who sit in Parliament. The next provision to which I object - paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of regulation 83 - is an extraordinary one. It provides that if any member 'of the Defence Forces obtains a civil appointment, he is to be seconded, and is to lose his military position. T cannot but think that the inclusion of that provision is an accident'; because it would not permit any civil servant in this country to hold a position in the Defence Forces. Of course, in the case of a man who is a paid officer, the regulation ought to apply, but this applies to citizen soldiers, and would even go so far as to apply to members of rifle clubs. The idea, that a member of a rifle club cannot hold a Civil Service appointment seems to me to be extraordinary. As to regulation 27, it contains a provision that if a citizen soldier, who is not under any obligation to attend every parade - indeed, the regulations do not require him to do so - does not attend every parade, he shall be liable to three months' imprisonment. That is sub-section 20 of regulation 27. If he fails to attend at a p'lace of assembly he is liable under a further section that is referred to in my motion to all sorts of pains and penalties - three months' imprisonment or ,£20 fine. Yet the regulations as a whole do not require his attendance on every occasion. With regard to sub-section 44 of regulation 27, which is mentioned in my motion, I may say that I do not propose to press for its disallowance. There may be reasons for it. On page 54 of the regulations there is an extraordinary proposition, that if a citizen soldier when not on duty commits the offence of drunkenness, he shall be liable to a <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> penalty or three months' imprisonment, a sentence which no magistrate in the country could pass on him. </para>

                            <para>.- If a soldier is in camp or in garrison he is under obligation to do his duty. I do not want te interfere with a soldier once he has undertaken his military duty. He must stand by it then. What I object to is penalizing a man in this unreasonable manner for a technical offence, which may not be an offence at all - for not being present at some parade.- In regulation 28 the portions objected to are those that fit in with regulation 27, to which I have made reference. As to regulation 38, printed on page 59 of the regulations, I may point out that it was one of the most deliberately enacted provisions of the Defence Act which this Chamber carried unanimously on the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> that no men of the Military Forces should be expelled without the right of court-martial. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely stating the facts. The regulation I allude to is one that stands in the way of an officer demanding an inquiry if he is charged with misconduct. The last regulation to which I take exception requires an officer to attend at Head-Quarters for examination for promotion. Honorable senators who come from distant 'States which cover large areas, and which have scattered defence forces, can realize what this means. An officer may be required to travel for a considerable distance in order to be examined in his capacity for drill, and, under this regulation, if for some reason or other, the officer should unhappily fail to please the inspecting or examining officer, he is to be allowed no expenses for what may have been his 300 miles' journey each way, nor is he to be paid his hotel expenses or incidental expenses for attending the examination. Hitherto in New South Wales officers have been grouped for examination purposes, and have been examined locally by one of the Head-Quarters staff or at camps. But this regulation places the obligation on a candidate for promotion to travel to HeadQuarters, and then if he fails to pass the examination he is to get nothing at all for his travelling expenses. It is difficult enough now to obtain the services of suitable men. This regulation will make it almost prohibitive. I hope it will be recognised that these are reasonable matters for the consideration of the Senate. I trust that the Minister also will regard them as reasonable, and allow us to go into Committee to consider them. I say no more now, feeling sure that the Senate will adopt the motion, and that the regulations enumerated will be considered in detail in Committee. </para>

                <para class="block">I think that the words of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> are so unnecessarily wide, and so absolutely dangerous, that they may be made an excuse for doing almost anything, while the six preceding paragraphs clearly cover every rational ground for dispensing with an officer's services. He can be got rid of if he neglects his duty, or if he is medically unfit, or if he fails to pass the examinations, or when he reaches the age limit, or by sentence of court-martial. That, I think, is sufficient provision to make in that direction. I object to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g-,</inline> because under it a man may be thrust out of the service without any action known to himself. I rather startled the Committee when we were considering the Defence Bill by stating that secret representations were made to get rid of officers. The Minister knows perfectly well that, at the present time, there are in his office papers connected with a secret attempt to get rid of an officer. This has not met with Ministerial approval so far, and will not, I feel quite sure. But that&gt; perhaps, is because the officer against whom the attempt has been made is in a. better position to defend himself than are others. I object strongly to power being given by regulation to afford opportunities for character assassination for any reason, particularly if the reasons are splenetic. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the honorable senator. I think that the retention of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> is absolutely essential. It is provided in the orders that certain offences shall be punished, but certain general conduct of an officer may be improper, and may not come specifically under any paragraph in the regulation except paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g.</inline> His general conduct may be so offensive that it may be necessary in the interest of the force to get rid of them. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator seems to forget the exact meaning of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g.</inline> Surely he has been sufficiently long in Parliament to know that the; term " Governor-General " does not mean the General Officer Commanding the Military Forces. Surely he knows that His Excellency will only take action that has been deliberately determined on by the Executive Council, and for no other reason. There is every reason why this power should be maintained, and therefore I ask the Committee not to agree to the motion. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the Minister of Defence. It would be very inadvisable to cancel this part of the regulation, because it would make a very great difference in the position of an officer who holds a commission. The theory is that the commission is always held from the Crown, and that it may be withdrawn by the Crown at any time. There may often be reasons why a commission should be cancelled, which may not be 3 h 2 covered by paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> to / of the regulation. I think it is right that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> should be retained. I wish the Committee to understand that this is not a mere trivial matter. It will make a very considerable difference in the conditions under which a commission is held. </para>

                        <para>- I was very pleased indeed to hear the Minister of Defence speak as he did. I am surprised to learn that a high officer like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> should try to get rid of discipline. He is the last man who should introduce a proposal of this kind to the Senate. If we have not the power of enforcing this discipline, what is the good of having a Military Force at all ? I chiefly rose to say that if the Minister decides with such good common sense in other matters I shall be very glad indeed to support him on those occasions also. </para>

                            <para>.- If paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> is retained the other paragraphs can be done away with, because it places everything in the power of the Governor-General, and the question arises at once whether it is wise in the case of our citizen forces .to place the Executive Council in the position of being able, behind an officer's back, if it saw fit, advise the Crown to withdraw his commission. Of course, if there was a provision made that iri all these cases the officer should be called on to show cause before his commission was withdrawn, there would be the possibility of replying to the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> . But I am under the impression that, taking into consideration all the provisions which are made, and the reserve power of the Crown, the regulation will be quite sufficient without paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g.</inline></para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that the position taken up by the Minister of Defence ought to be supported. This general power should rest with the Executive Council, and we are amply protected from any caption or improper use of the power in the fact that the Executive Council is responsible for its every act. We have a perfect assurance that there can be no base or improper use made of this power without the possibility of the act coming under the review of Parliament. While there does appear at first glance to be ample protection against any possible offence in the preceding paragraphs of the regulation, still there may happen circumstances for which we have been unable to provide. A man may be guilty of conduct which altogether unfits him for his position in the military service, and yet -such conduct may not be covered by any one of the specific conditions named in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> to /. We might trust the Executive Government in a case of that kind. If there should ever occur a time when we could not trust the Executive Government, and they took action which was improper, we should have all the power of Parliament to bring them to book. </para>

                    <para class="block">This regulation deals with the seconding of officers. If a military officer becomes an aide-de-camp to a State Governor he is at once seconded. He does not cease to be an officer of his regiment, but he is put on the shelf - he is out of the way while he., is holding- the other appointment. An officer of the regiment I command in New South Wales is private secretary to the General Officer Commanding the Military Forces, and he is seconded while he is away on other duties. What I am taking exception to is the proposal that an officer is to be seconded from the date of his application to be seconded if he becomes a member of the Federal Parliament. That refers to officers below the rank of major. </para>

                            <para>- I thought I had made that point very plain. If this regulation remains, there is great risk that officers below the rank of major, on being elected to either House of the' Commonwealth Parliament, may be told, " You had better apply to be seconded." I do not say that an officer could be ordered to apply to be seconded, but he might be told that there was a provision of the kind, and that he had better make application. If an officer did not act on such a suggestion, he might be " marked down " at once, and he would " go down " sooner or later. </para>

Such an officer cannot go back to his regiment, unless there is a suitable vacancy for him, and he runs great risk of having his military career absolutely closed. </para>

                        (South Australia. - I cannot see where any injury can occur. The regulation does not say that an officer shall make application to be seconded, but that if he does, his seconding shall take place from the date of application. If a member of the Legislature, who occupies a military position such as has been indicated, wishes to be seconded he may apply, but he is not compelled to make application. No doubt, if an officer does apply, he places himself in a disadvantageous position as to future promotion ; but as I have said, there is nothing to compel him to apply.

                        is fearful that the regulation may lead to the - compulsory seconding of officers, but there is nothing to that effect in the regulation, which simply provides what shall take place when an officer desires to be seconded on account of his ceasing to perform active duty. This seconding is a very fair arrangement to junior officers ; otherwise, officers on the unattached list, would, as it were, find their position continually improving, to the detriment of others lower in rank who continued on the active list. " Seconded " means, as

                            <para>- Not while he is seconded, although during that period he retains his present rank. When the disqualification - if I may use the expression - ceases, and there is employment on the active list for him, he rejoins at exactly the same rank he. held when seconded. That is a very fair arrangement to junior officers, who, if on. the active list, are anxious for their proper promotion. No provision is made that a military officer, who becomes a member of Parliament, shall be removed from the active list, but if he so desires, he can be seconded, retaining his rank. There is a subsequent regulation providing that where a vacancy occurs, it may be held over for three months, in order to give a seconded officer an opportunity of rejoining. </para>

                            <para>- I should like the Senate to disagree with the motion. In addition to the excellent arguments which have been put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> there is another argument to which I should like to call attention. I have felt for some time, and I see no reason to alter my opinion, that it is not good for the efficiency of the' Military Forces that any officer, whether major, or of lower rank, who owes allegiance to ,the General Officer Commanding, should at the same time, as a member of Parliament, be the critic of that General Officer Commanding. The dual position is not conducive to the best discipline, and cannot lead to the greatest efficiency of the military Forces. For that reason I think the regulation ought to remain as at present. </para>

The Constitution clearly lays it down that the mere fact of holding a commission in the volunteer or partially-paid military services shall in no way affect the right to be returned to Parliament.

                            <para>.- Perhaps a man, in such circumstances, ought to resign, and perhaps he ought not; I say nothing on -that point. Men on the active list do not resign on being elected to Parliament ; at any rate, I know of none. I was always under the impression that when a man was relieved from military work he was not debarred from promotion in the ordinary and legitimate course. What I mean is that, if, for instance, the senior officer died or retired, a junior officer, who was seconded, was entitled to apply for promotion. Some years ago that was the state df the law, but the regulation now provides differently. Personally, I see no serious objection to the regulation. It deals with a matter which might well be left to the officers themselves. If an officer feels that his parliamentary work will not permit him to properly attend to his military duties, it is well that he should have the opportunity to be seconded. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> fears that the regulation may be made a means of enforcing an application to be seconded. That, however, is an apprehension which I think may be put on one side. If an officer is so weak a man as to be driven into such a position, it is, perhaps, better that he should leave the service. With all respect to the opinions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> I think it is just as well that the regulation should be allowed to stand. </para>

                        (Victoria). - There are two reasons why I think the regulation should be permitted to remain. First, the regulation presents itself to me as having a good deal of reason on its side ; and, secondly, the term " seconded " appears to be so ill-understood by honorable senators, we ought not to interfere with it, in view of the fact that it has been adopted by persons who may be assumed to be thoroughly conversant with the subject. I rose more particularly to call attention to what I think is a mistake on the Minister's part in dealing with the question of whether soldiers should be members of Parliament. I respectfully submit that that is not a question which ought to be discussed here, except on a proposal to amend the Constitution.

                            <para>- It is a question open to very great difference of opinion, whether soldiers should be in Parliament. But it is a question that has been decided, and . cannot be re-opened except on a proposal to alter the Constitution. It must always do harm, and cannot possibly do good, to say anything in Parliament which is a reflection on the Constitution, unless we are proposing to amend the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- I had no intention whatever of casting any reflection on soldiers, or on the right of soldiers to take their seat in Parliament. But I expressed the deliberate opinion that, for the sake of this Chamber, and for the sake of the Military Forces, for the maintenance of which we pay so much, it would be better not to have, as' members of Parliament, officers who, when on the active list, are subservient to the General Officer Commanding, but who as members of Parliament may be his critics. I am sorry if it be thought that I cast any reflection, when none is intended. My remarks were entirely apropos to the motion before us, and I would direct the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> toone of the reasons given for the regulation. </para>

                        <para>- This discussion has opened up a large subject. I entirely agree with the Minister, whose remarks are quite apropos. No doubt many of us have crystallized our opinions on this subject, in view of occurrences which have taken place in the Senate, and it is not out of place for those who hold decided opinions to give expression to them. I am one who, after carefully thinking over the matter, believes that the two positions of military officer and member of Parliament are, and always will be, entirely inconsistent. Although, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> says, the Constitution does not debar a soldier, under certain circumstances, from sitting in Parliament - in fact, it expressly sanctions his doing so - still, it would be well if it were understood that, in the interests of discipline, it is inadvisable that any person holding a commission in the forces should remain a member of Parliament. I am quite sure that these remarks will not be taken as a reflection on any members of the Senate in view of recent occurrences, but it is a matter that is worthy of consideration, whether it would not be well to let it be understood that, in our opinion, it is unadvisable for any member of the Military Forces to remain in them after being elected to Parliament, where his duty may compel him to criticise the actions of the Genera] Officer Commanding. There will always be a danger of trouble arising from such a conflict of duty. I should like to see an expression of opinion - not necessarily to-day, but at some future time - to the effect that when once members of the Commonwealth Defence Forces become members of Parliament they should resign their commissions. </para>

                        <para>- I can hardly fall in with the views of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwithon</inline> this question. He has laid it down as an axiom that, because a certain thing is provided for in the Constitution, we ought not to express an opinion about it. I think that we ought to express opinions on matters like this. We may very well turn to the mother country and see what is done there. I do not say that because a man happens to be a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, and is at the same time a member of the Military Forces, either in the lowest capacity or as an officer of high rank, he occupies two inconsistent positions. We have had full privates in our local Parliament, and we have had officers of high rank. But my judgment is that, when military officers take a seat in Parliament they should be placed on the retired list. I do not believe that they should give up their commissions, because a man may be a member of Parliament for only a certain number of years, and may wish to take up military duties again. If he does so he should be permitted to start from the position he occupied when he was elected to Parliament. The best way out of the difficulty is to follow the English practice. But it is provided in the Constitution that members of the Military Forces shall have a right to sit in the Commonwealth Parliament and criticise the military authorities to the fullest extent. Therefore, we cannot exercise any controlling power in that direction. It must be merely a matter of good taste. But I believe that the public will be of opinion that it will be better and wiser for a gentleman occupying a position in the Defence Forces, on being elected to Parliament, to cease to be on the active list. I believe that public opinion will eventually .carry weight in that direction, and that military officers who are elected to Parliament will, under the circumstances, feeling that they occupy an invidious position, voluntarily adopt the practice of the mother country. There need be no alteration of the Constitution. It is an important subject, and one with regard to which it is exceedingly difficult to lay down any hard-and-fast rule. But certainly it is odd that when a man is under the direct command of the General Officer Commanding the Forces General Officer Commanding the Military Forces he should criticise - possibly severely and unfairly, in some circumstances - his actions, or those of his fellow officers, while he himself is on the active list, and is constantly associated with them. In the circumstances, therefore, I think that it would be well for a gentleman occupying two such positions to give up his position on the active list, and that we should adopt the practice of the mother country. </para>

                        but unfortunately he is developing a faculty of putting his foot into his mouth whenever he opens it. The honorable senator says that it is desirable that we should follow the English practice. Evidently he has not .the faintest idea of what the English practice is, or he would not talk such, nonsense. He ought to know when he talks in this manner that officers of the Imperial Army, while on full pay, can sit in Parliament, and say what they like. Officers up to the rank of major can sit in Parliament on full pay, and colonels and generals can sit On half-pay.

A major who may be in command f a detachment 800 strong can sit in the House of Commons and express any opinion he likes; and it is only a colonel or a general who is put on the half -pay list. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> says,  the Commonwealth Constitution only provides for militia and volunteer officers sitting in Parliament. Under the Defence Act, which we passed some time ago, a member of a rifle club would be debarred from sitting in Parliament, according to the opinions which have  been  expressed1 in this debate. But in England there is no disability of any kind attaching to any officer. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure that I am perfectly right. If the Minister will look at page 232 of the regulations, he will find that the Defence Forces are divided into three branches - the Permanent " Forces, the Citizen Forces, and the Reserve Forces; and it is provided that the reserve forces shall consist of "members of rifle clubs constituted in the manner prescribed." But under the statute law of England, volunteers and militiamen of all ranks may sit in Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- There is no disability whatever under the English law with respect to members of the regular forces, the militia, or the volunteer forces beyond, as I have already said, the question of pay to officers of high rank. But even that does not apply to militia or volunteers. Officers of the highest rank in either of those forces may sit in the Commons House without any hesitation whatever, and some of them occasionally use very strong language with reference to military matters. I was reading in a recent issue of the English <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Seeley,</inline> an officer of the Imperial Army, in criticising some of the Imperial regiments recently, advised the War Office to send to Drury Lane Theatre, and borrow properties for the training of their men. </para>

                        <para>- I think, with other honorable senators, that there are very good reasons for this regulation being included. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> has said, every one ought to obey the dictates of good taste in matters of this kind, but we know there may come times, and there may be men in either House who may not be governed by the dictates of good taste, but who may make statements on the floor of Parliament seriously impugning the ability of the General Officer Commanding, and the efficiency of the forces. While we are considering the position of a member of Parliament, in what position do we place the General Officer Commanding, who is responsible for our troops and whose reputation is at stake ? A member of Parliament is practically one of the employers of the Genera] Officer Commanding, and he may make charges in a privileged chamber of which the door is shut to the officer whose ability he impugns. The member of Parliament may make statements criticising the ability of the General in the discharge of his duties, but the mouth of the General will be tied, except that the Minister may ask him to reply. Even then, in what position do we place the Commandant? He has to take upon himself the task of replying to parliamentary attacks. It is advisable that the General Officer Commanding the Military Forces should be called upon to reply to attacks made by officers under his command in a privileged chamber ? I agree that such attacks may be " justifiable in certain circumstances. They are of service to the community if they are made on legitimate lines - that is to say, if the member who , makes', them does so as a result of knowledge that he acquires in some other way than by reason of his position as an officer. But if his position as an officer gives him access to documents, and to information to which he would not have access were he not an officer, and as a member of Parliament he uses that information- </para>

                            <para>- I should imagine that a man who would make such statements would kick up a nice row if his commission were cancelled, and he would probably do it in this privileged chamber. I think that if an officer is seconded when he is elected to Parliament he is free to come here a nd use his military knowledge as applied to military questions and to give the country the benefit of it. But' there is this difference - that he does not use his privileges as an officer to obtain information that is not given to him for. public use. In that way this is a very necessary regulation. I do not think that it interferes in the slightest degree with any member of the Commonwealth Parliament who wishes to serve his country as a soldier, but it does provide that if a man wishes to serve his country as a soldier and also as a military critic on | the floor of Parliament, he should not use one office to assist him in performing the duties of the other. He ought to make a choice between the two positions. The question is an important one, and it is well that it has been raised. We are indebted to the honorable senator who has raised it. It is just as well to define the position, because we have in both Chambers of the Legislature members who have served their country well as military officers. I- am in practical sympathy with the regulation, and I shall oppose its excision. </para>

I find myself in opposition to opinions which have been expressed on this side of the chamber.

If we want to have these corrupt practices put right I do not see why we should stifle the channel through which the information may come to us. It does not matter whether a member of Parliament is in the ranks or outside, or whether he got the information from any one in the- ranks and used it in Parliament. He would be equally within his rights in using it. </para>

                        <para>- I am in accord with the regulations as they stand. It appears to me that, although a member of the Defence Forces has the right to sit here, in accordance with the letter of the Constitution, and the right to speak, and, if he likes, to criticise, still not as a question of good taste, but as a question of discipline he ought not to do so. I think that the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is not a very weighty one. He said that if a senator, who belongs to the Military Forces, discovers any wrong-doing, he ought to make it public. But there are other ways open to him to accomplish ' the object, besides that of coming here and criticising his superior officer. In a matter of wrong-doing, I think that a senator would be justified in coming here and acting in that way ; but small criticisms of regulations, of policy, and of the action of a superior officer, be he a junior or not, are, to my mind, subversive of discipline. If any wrong-doing is going on, it can be brought under the notice of the Minister by means of the telephone, and it will be put right. I take it that a commanding officer, whether he be a' general, a colonel, or a major, has to look to his captains, lieutenants, and privates for all the loyalty and support which they can give him. If they deliberately keep back from him their knowledge of what is right or wrong in the corps, in order to bring it forward in the Senate, they are not loyal officers, but are lacking that discipline which is the foundation of any defence force. If we had a <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel in</inline> one State, a <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Private</inline> in another State, and a <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lieut.</inline> -General in another State, we might have half-a-dozen members of Parliament who might make the life of the General Officer Commanding perfectly intolerable. There may be a time when Old England will be at war with some nation, and we may at any moment expect an attack. What a strife there would be among the officers to go to the front in order to do something for their country ! Should the half-dozen officer members of Parliament wait from Friday night to Wednesday to come here to criticise the General Officer Commanding, when they had information which might help us to defend ourselves more thoroughly and more energetically ? Their duty would be to go to their superior officers and give them the benefit of their experience, knowledge, and opinions. It is only by that means that we shall get discipline in a corps. There are such things as discipline, good taste, and loyalty. My desire is that our regulations shall encourage and promote loyalty and discipline. When an officer in the Defence Forces takes his seat in this Parliament, he has two courses open to him, I think. He can criticise as he pleases, but in such a case he ought to resign his command. </para>

                            <para>- If he does not do that he can retain his command, and to some extent keep his mouth shut and, at all events, not criticise the General Officer Commanding in such a way as to be subversive of discipline. Suppose that in the near future we hand over the control of the Defence Forces to a Council of Defence, as has been done in the mother country - the Council of Defence ought to have the loyal support of all officers, whereas if they happened to be Members of Parliament they might be everlastingly criticising its actions. If so, they would detract from its dignity and' its efficiency. It appears to me that a question, of discipline is raised here. </para>

                        on this point, I submit that if there is an objection to a junior officer, who has very little knowledge, acting as a consul, there must be infinitely greater objection to a senior or commanding officer who possesses a great deal of knowledge acting in that capacity; but' the regulation does not propose to prohibit senior officers from so acting. I believe that one of the colonels who were on the Committee that finally issued these regulations is a consul. Surely a brigadier who commands four regiments knows a vast deal more than an unfortunate company officer can know ? This regulation does not bar the colonel, but it bars the captain, and therefore there is really nothing in the objection from that stand-point.

                            <para>.- Perhaps not. I did not look verv much at the question of consuls, but I did see the apparent absurdity of an officer who is made an aide-de-camp to a State Governor being at once seconded, and the Commonwealth losing the benefit of his services, merely because he did a little complimentary work for the State Governor. I did not see why the Commonwealth should lose the benefit of the services of an officer simply because he is a clerk in "the post-office, or has some other civil appointment. I am not disposed to move an amendment on the question of the consuls. But if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> moves to amend my proposition I shall be quite satisfied. It may be easily seen, however, that an amendment is not necessary for this reason. If we strike out this paragraph, the Minister may very well be left to provide a new one. It is a very large and serious question, whether foreign consuls ought to possess this knowledge. </para>

Several officers are consuls, including a major in the Irish Rifles of New South Wales, who represents Spain, and Brigadier-Colonel Waddell, who is Consul-General for Peru. I hope that civil appointments will not bar a man from serving his country as a. militia or volunteer officer. </para>

                        (Victoria).- If that course is pursued we might have an officer in the service, with all the rights and advantages attached thereto, who had taken an oversea military appointment. The regulation as it stands cannot, in my opinion, do any very serious harm. The regulations were arrived at by persons with military knowledge and specially competent.

                            <para>- That is a matter with which we cannot deal here) because as I understand, we have no power to amend the regulations or make new ones. .It is for the Minister to see that regulations are made, and suggestions of honorable senators would probably impress themselves cn - his mind. As a Senate, we can only disallow, or refuse to disallow. It would be very much better to permit the regulation to stand. First, so far as I can see there is no objection to that regulation, and. secondly, even if I could see any objection, it is highly probable that my limited knowledge of important military considerations might lead me wrong. Under the circumstances I am not going to vote against a decree, decision, or regulation arrived at by persons who must have been eminently competent to arrive at correct conclusions. </para>

                        to observe that this is a regulation which provides that an officer is to be seconded if he takes a civil appointment. What is a civil appointment but an appointment in the Public Service- an appointment on the civil staff of a Government. An officer who accepted the position of honorary aide-de-camp, and performed certain little polite duties at functions, would come within the scope of the regulation.

                            <para>.- At any rate, Colonel Hoad is above the rank of major, and, therefore, the regulation could not apply. But there is a regulation for officers to be appointed as aides-de-camp to State Governors, and these must be junior officers, whom the regulation would bar. The regulations are contradictory. </para>

                            <para>- That is 'not so. Military officers have, in nearly every case civil appointments of some kind or other ; and the regulation clearly refers to such civil appointments as make the performance of military duties impossible. It is intended that an officer, under the circumstances referred to, shall not remain on the unattached list and obtain promotion, but shall be seconded, so that he may not have any advantage over young officers who are performing military duties. Like the other regulations, this deals with the date from which it is to take place, but it cannot have effect in any case unless the man ceases to perform his military duties. Ordinary civil employment does not disqualify. </para>

Such a course would not bring us to a conclusion too hurriedly, and the Minister would have time to frame an acceptable regulation. This is the last day on which objection can be taken to the regulations, and if we allow this to pass we may involve ourselves in a serious position, seeing that some time may elapse before another opportunity for criticism is offered.

Many of them are highly controversial. I may say that, as Minister of Defence, I have many of them under consideration, and I am not prepared to give the definite, clear, and distinct answer which I should like to give. I should, therefore, prefer a little delay. It is not alleged that any of the alterations suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> are particularly urgent. </para>

                        <para>- Even if that be so, what opportunity will honorable senators arriving here on Wednesday have to consider them? If these reports are not a mere sham, and the request for them an excuse to gain delay, we should be given an opportunity to study them. I suggest that the debate might reasonably be adjourned until Wednesday week. If that course is adopted an opportunity will be given to every honorable senator to read the promised reports, and then no honorable senator will be in a position to plead that he is asked to give a vote in ignorance of any information which has been supplied up to date. We must recognise that the Senate is to some extent marking time, waiting for the political atmosphere to clear. If I can forecast the future at all, something must happen next week. Honorable senators must be aware that, no matter which alternative is arrived at, in all human probability the Senate, if it meets next week, will simply do so in order to adjourn again. </para>

If the debate on the motion for the second reading of this measure is adjourned until Wednesday week as I suggest, there will be other business to occupy the attention of the Senate, if it should be in a position to transact business next week. </para>

                        (Western Australia).I shall be in Melbourne, and able to attend to the business of the Senate next week, but still I can see that our meeting then is likely to be farcical. On the authority of a Minister of the Crown in another place, we are assured that the reports, to which reference has been made, will not be ready for nearly a fortnight, and it seems to me that we should have an opportunity to read those reports before we are asked to come to a decision in this matter.

We have, to a greater extent than any of those Chambers, the power of effective initiative, and I think it is somewhat deplorable that we should have been meeting, as we have been for so many weeks, without transacting any business. </para>

I call attention to what I think is an unfortunate position. I think we have powers in the Senate, if we choose to exercise them, to enable us to carry on legislative business efficiently, without respect to what occurs in another place. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> We expect that work should be provided for us, but the circum stances of the present situation are such that it is really impossible for the present Government to provide work for us. We have no reason to complain in that respect just now. What I think we may expect from the Government, is that, so far as they can do so without sacrificing public interests, they should consider the convenience of honorable senators who come from a distance, and have, to a certain extent, to neglect their private business. No honorable senator has a right to complain of being brought here as long as there is work to be done, but honorable senators coming from a distance have some right to complain if they are brought here when there is really nothing for us to do. It would have been very much wiser if the introduction of the Bill now before us had been delayed until we were in a position to deal with it effectively. A number of new members have been returned to both Houses, and in common with myself, they would, no doubt, like to be in a position to give a considered judgment on so momentous a question. </para>

Probably I know as much concerning the proposed sites as many honorable senators who have visited them, but we have a right to expect that, if there is any expert information on any of the sites available, we should be supplied with it. That is likely to be of very much greater value to us than the recommendations of persons who may be politically interested. We are told that certain information is not likely to be available for a fortnight, and in the circumstances we are justified in asking that the consideration of the measure should be deferred until thai information is before us. </para>

                            <para>- No; because of something happening. I wish to make myself perfectly clear. It is on the re cords of the Senate that in the past, in consequence of notice of a motion having been given elsewhere, the Senate . suspended its sittings. If that sort of thing should occur again, I propose to raise the question which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has raised, that under the Constitution there is no obligation on the States House to cease its sittings because of something happening in another place. It appears to me that there is a sort of double-barrelled proposition before us at the present time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> suggests an adjournment over next week, because certain .reports are not ready, but they will, I understand, be ready next week. An adjournment is suggested in another quarter on the ground that it is not likely we shall be able to go on with business in consequence of events transpiring elsewhere. These propositions conflict to the extent that if the reports asked for are ready, we may choose to go on, notwithstanding happenings elsewhere. If those reports are not ready, happenings elsewhere apart, we should i:ot be able to go on. It occurs to me that an adjournment over next week might not involve any real loss of time&gt; because even if the reports asked for were available there would be no prospect of our having sufficient business to occupy our time until an important measure reaches us from another place. Consequently, if we do not adjourn next week we may have to adjourn for a week later on, and we might, therefore, just as well adjourn over next week. </para>

                        <para>- It is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether we adjourn over next week or not. I clearly foresee that in the very near future we shall have to adjourn for a week or fortnight, because we shall have no work to do. It is somewhat farcical, however, to put it forward as an argument for adjourning over next week that we have not been supplied with certain reports in connexion with the Federal Capital site. If that is a good reason, honorable senators who Rave already spoken on the Bill have been placed at a disadvantage in having to speak without full information. I point out, however, that the information contained in the report compiled by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest has already appeared in the newspapers, and that from the beginning of this Parliament, now over three years ago, we have been deluged with papers in connexion with the Federal Capital sites. We have spent thousands of pounds in securing information on the subject, and the reports obtained have  Deen  so numerous as to be confusing in' the highest degree. It would now appear that we still have to discover a suitable site. Bombala is apparently' out of it ; Tumut has not much show ; Lyndhurst is evidently in the background; and what new site is to be recommended no one knows.- </para>

                            <para>- On the other point referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> so long as we carry on our work under a system of responsible government, we shall not get a Ministry willing to go on with the work of the Government in the Senate when a motion of no-confidence has been tabled in the House of Representatives. No Government will work for other people. Why should they ? If there is a risk that they will .be turned out of office, why should they come here and carry on the business of the country in the Senate for some people who are in opposition to them, and who are prepared to turn them out of office and take advantage of the work they have done ? That cannot be expected under responsible government. I may say that even at the first Federal Convention my own idea was that we should not have responsible government in the Federal Parliament. I think that view was also entertained by the President of the Senate. I know that we seriously considered the matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith and others, and there was then an impression in the minds of many that we could not have a proper federation under the ordinary system of responsible government. Mv own opinion was in favour of an elective Government,  and  I have not changed my view from that day to this. The best way ,in which to conduct the business of the Commonwealth would be to 'have an elective Government, instead of responsible government by parties, under which we have troubles and intrigues right through the piece. </para>

                        <para>- I also must protest against this proposed adjournment. I do not think it is necessary. The arguments advanced so far are not of sufficient weight to induce honorable senators to adjourn the Senate when there is work to be done. One argument is that the reports regarding the Capital sites' which have been laid on the table have not been printed. Nobody requires those reports at the second reading stage. The information is required when we get into Committee, to enable honorable senators to decide on the particular site to be selected. It is not fail to honorable senators who have spoken on the question to adjourn the Senate for a fortnight. It would be far better, as we have got work to do which, in all probability, would take some time, to proceed next week in accordance with the Sessional. Orders. </para>

                            <para>- Because one Minister and some honorable senators have gone away on the understanding that the Senate would adjourn over to-morrow. Another argument used' for a further adjournment is that something may happen next week in another place. But the Senate has no knowledge of anything that is going to happen. Every one knows what is hinted at, but until it is necessary for the Senate to adjourn work can be found for us to . do. Thursday next is private business day, and in all probability the motions to be brought forward then will occupy at least one-half of the sitting. The Fraudulent Marks Bill is set down on the paper for its second reading. If we devote Wednesday next to the further consideration of the Capital Sites Bill there will be time for other Bills to be brought forward. I understand from the statements of the Government, that other Bills are ready to be introduced ; and if they cannot be introduced in the other House they can be introduced here. There is nothing in the argument that, because some honorable senators live three or four hundred miles away from Melbourne, the Senate ought to be adjourned for. fourteen days. They should not be considered to be inconvenienced in having to come here to do the work which they were elected to do. </para>

                        <para>- It is not often that the Western Australian senators ask for any arrangement to suit their convenience. On this occasion I feel impelled to mention the position in which we find ourselves. Several of us would like to go tu our States to conduct business there. But a fortnight will not allow us sufficient time to go to Western Australia or to Queensland, and remain there long enough to do any business. We should like to have the business of the Senate proceeded with next week, so that the Capital Sites Bill can be passed. Then we might possibly have an adjournment, of, perhaps, three or four weeks. - That would enable the Western Australians and Queenslanders to go to their own States and spend a little lime there. I am not putting forward any claim of a selfish nature, but we have often studied the convenience of the South Australian and New South Wales senators, and if they can see their way to meet our convenience in this matter, we shall reciprocate on another occasion. </para>

Of course, if the Senate adjourned until Wednesday week, that would cover this motion ; but I desire to say that I do not like a long adjournment, and' intend to resist any proposition to that effect.

Prophesies as to storms that may overtake the Government, and lead to disaster, do not affect my mind. Even if those suggestions should prove to be well founded, they merely furnish an additional reason why the Senate should meet next week. If anything over which we have no -control should happen in another place, which would necessitate an adjournment, we will consider it. Question resolved in the affirmative. </para>
