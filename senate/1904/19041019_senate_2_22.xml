Does not the Attorney-General consider that the action of the Commandant of the Naval Forces of the Commonwealth, in expressing the opinion that the presence of Russian vessels may be part of the general Russian policy of interference with British trade, is a contravention of the neutrality which it has been laid down should be adopted by Australia in the present trouble between Russia and Japan? </para>

          <para>. - I also feel rather like my honorable friend who has just delivered his speech on the subject before the Senate. To revive this matter now, reminds one of the recovery of a long-lost child. We rejoice to find the child, but probably realize . that there may be possibilities of trouble, and perhaps a necessity for chastisement just the same as before. But I think there can be no doubt that the debate which has already taken place on the subject, although it contained some very long speeches dealing with the policy of the Government from very varied aspects, was not without its advantages. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> in the observations which he made on the last occasion, said that it was difficult to discover the policy which, under cover &#34;of this paper relating to the metric system, was outlined by the Government, even with the aid of a microscope. I can only say that if this microscopic policy was successful in evoking speeches of such magnitude and interest, and in promoting the research which was displayed, it must have been not so much like a microscopic fragment, but rather like the grain of mustard seed which grew and prospered until the birds of the air could nest in its branches. I tremble to think what would have happened - to what length the debate would have extended - if the policy had really been visible to the naked eye. Then the progress of the debate was interfered with by the proceedings which occurred in another place. One of the advantages of the interval is that time, which as we know is always a great healer, may have removed whatever feelings of resentments any of us may have momentarily experienced during the progress of the  debate. In all probability those resentments have been a good deal worn away. At any rate, so far as my remarks are concerned - and there are one or two which I desire to make, so that the statements to which I shall refer may not appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> without contradiction - I shall make them, as the phrase is, more in sorrow than in anger. Because, really I feel on this occasion in a most good-natured mood. That is my usual condition - perfect good nature ! I am at peace with all men, including my honorable friends on the benches opposite. I think I may say that, so far as I individually am concerned, I have reason to thank honorable senators - with one exception - for the more than kind references - personal and political - which they have made concerning myself. I do not know, indeed, why it should have been otherwise. Because I think I may say that even in the heat and stress of controversy - and I have never been slow to express, and to assert with as much clearness and emphasis as I have been capable of, my views whether they have been agreed to or disagreed to by other honorable senators - I have never imparted any personal bitterness or feeling to debate, and certainly said nothing that could lead to any estrangement between any honorable senator and myself. </para>

The exception that I have referred to - and I am exceedingly sorry that the remarks were made - was in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> I am exceedingly sorry, not merely because he is a fellow senator, but because he had just vacated the position which I hold at this table.

He knows as well as I do that the possession of a caustic tongue and of a vituperative vocabulary is a great gift, but it is also a very dangerous gift, and it is particularly dangerous when associated with or used with a slight indifference to facts.

When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> animadverts on my absence, I ask him from what was I . absent ? During a period of eight weeks, he, as its leader, asked the Senate to adjourn once for three weeks, and twice for a fortnight, not under the pressure of any rio-confidence motion, or anything of that kind, but simply from sheer dearth of occupation. I am informed that I was absent from eight sittings, from the beginning of June, and that was during the time - I am not reflecting on anybody - when the Senate was in what I may describe as a condition of stale-mate. Will my honorable friends believe that I was absent not merely under those circumstances, but with the concurrence, and I think I may say without unduly straining the written word, at the invitation of my honorable friend himself. In the middle of this desert of work, and being anxious that there should be some work to do, I wrote to my honorable friend on July 6th a courteous letter, which I shall read - </para>

That was unworthy of &#39;him. I not only resent it, but I repudiate it, and I think I have the sympathy of every honorable senator. </para>

            <para>- Having said that as to myself, my honorable friend went oh to assail <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> in very virulent terms indeed. I am not going to vindicate or to be the advocate in that respect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake.</inline> But it must be a great comfort to my honorable and learned colleague to know that, for more than three years, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> who launched these abominable imputations and charges against him of being wanting in honour, and so on, sat with the most profound docility at his feet when he was not an honorary Minister, but a paid Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> without comment, allowed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> to take a salary and share Ministerial responsibility, although he considered him worthy of the animadversions which he has now uttered. That, I think, is a sufficient answer&#34; to the imputations. My honorable friend, in order to make them, arrogated to himself the position of being the custodian of the honour of the Senate, in relation to its leadership. But if that be said, then some other senator is the custodian of its modesty. I protest against the very singular doctrine which the honorable senator by implication put forward that it is the honorary Minister who should come first in the Senate. I take the opposite view. It has so happened in the past, for reasons which amply justified it, but I think, and I have always held the opinion, that the Senate is entitled to have a salaried Minister responsible to the fullest extent occupying the position of its leader. My honorable friend will allow me to say that our friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> did not lead the Senate because he was Vice-President of the Executive Council, but because he was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor.</inline> That was the situation, and we ought to protest in the strongest manner possible against the suggestion that the Senate, unless in exceptional circumstances, such as existed, it may be, in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor, Senator Playford,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> should be led by an honorary Minister. I think it should not. I also desire to record my emphatic repudiation of the action of the honorable senator in expressing, I think I may say unjustly, an opinion as to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> and declaring on the floor of the Senate that he despised him. That expression ought not to have been used of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> here or anywhere. I am sure, that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> who was Vice-President of the Executive Council in the Deakin Ministry, had been here he would have got up and indignantly repudiated such an imputation. I will not say, but it has been publicly said, that the action of my honorable friends opposite justifies the statement that because a man who has been serving them, and who stands high &#39;in the esteem and confidence of the people of this country, exercises an independence of judgment and action, and will not do exactly what they wish him to do, they immediately cast him aside like a soiled glove, and abuse him. That is not right. I do not make that imputation, but I say that we cannot blame people outside for making it if these things are said here. The remarks to which I have referred are extant in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and I think it right to - indeed, I should be doing wrong if I did not - ex press my views as I have shortly done. But with regard to all the matters of policy and cognate matters which have been dealt with, and as to which I did note a great many things of interest, from&#39; a number of the speeches which have been delivered, I dp not think it necessary now to say anything about them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> said that he had no fault to find with the policy of the Government in a general sense. I do not see the drift of what may be in the minds of honorable senators, but that was the drift of all their speeches. There were a great many things dealt with in the course of those very able and exhaustive speeches, &#39;but little was said as to particular items of the policy which I had the honour of announcing to the Senate. There was little to be said, for the reason my honorable friend gave, that there was no fault to be found with the policy in a general sense. He said we had adopted the same course as his party in sinking the fiscal issue. Of course, we all have objects, and attach different values to those objects. We may be content to postpone some in order that others which we may consider more pressing or more dominant should be dealt with. We may postpone one to which a large, perhaps an undue, portion of public time has already been given, with a view to promote others which have not engaged so much attention. We all recognise our differences. The eggs of this country are not all in one basket. And every member of the Senate, and honorable members of another place, and the community, attach different importance to each of these things, while Ministers have to take very much what they can get. They cannot always get what they desire, or seek, or propose, and behind it all the question is what is the popular will. It is the voice of the people that determines in these modern times all political movements, and all policies, and I venture to remind honorable senators that that was so in the foundation of our Union. It was the popular aspiration and the Federal impulse that brought about the Union, and I think now that if we are animated as we ought to be by the same spirit, the true policy for all of us, according to our own lights, is, in our effort to legislate, to try to do the best we can in the promotion of what we believe to be the highest good, to do no wrong to not merely the humblest citizen, but the humblest, minority of the citizens of this country. </para>

          <para class="block">In moving the second reading of this Bill, I recognise, as we all must do, the great importance df the measure. Whilst setting a high value on the principle and purpose of the Bill, I cannot help thinking that as to its immediate practical operation it is viewed, perhaps, with an exaggerated enthusiasm on one side, and with a needless fear or apprehension on the other. I am proud to be in a position to move the second reading. I think it is an honour which any one would appreciate, and which I certainly do very fully appreciate. It will not, I think, be necessary to demonstrate to the Senate the essential principle of the measure. I regard it as a part of that very modern, salutary, and humane legislative effort to substitute in industrial disputes the arbitrament of conciliation, the peaceful arbitrament of an appropriate judicial tribunal, for the violent and barbarous methods of the strike and lock-out. I say violent and barbarous methods, because they bring with them all the attendant passion, and sometimes bloodshed and worse even than that - the untold misery and suffering to innocent people, to women and children. Strikes, which, in their origin, may be merely disputes as to rates of wages, may attain the magnitude of civil war. They may involve a revolt against ordered society and peaceful government. It is so, because we must remember that the accustomed remedy for the trouble was force, and force in combination, and that force in combination very often resulted in conflict with the civil authority. These old methods paralyzed industry ; they sometimes exiled workmen from home and country, and gave trade over to the foreigner ; they involved untold loss on the community. But beyond and above all these things which I have summarized, and which we all recognise, there were the sufferings of . the innocent. Who shall count the tears of the women, or the cries of the children? I have often had in my mind in connexion with the consequences of these methods, which we are at one in desiring to bring to an end if possible, the well-known lines from <inline font-style="italic">The Cry of the Children.</inline> There is nothing which moves a man like the sufferings of children - there is no motive &#39; which appeals more powerfully to a man in guiding his course of action, than the distress of the suffering child. </para>

          <para class="block">Is it not so? And if that is a fair summary in general of consequences, which every one of us deplores, and the removal of which largely underlies this particular kind of legislation, then, surely, every effort that can be made to give for industrial war the blessing of industrial peace will be welcome? The compelling reasons, I do not say for this Bill, but for similar legislation are to avert injurv and loss to employers, to workmen, and to the country, and to promote the interests of humanity. We can never escape from social strife. We cannot escape from national or from international strife. Man, I was going to say, is bom to quarrel and to fight - at any rate, one of the finest qualities which mankind possesses is, when held in proper subjection, the combative instinct. It is found in all spheres of society. We know that it reaches the village, and is asserted by the villager - </para>

          <para class="block">As we go. up and down the scale of social, industrial, and national life, the fighting instinct, the assertion of rights, when they ought to be asserted, and the combative instinct prevail. Whilst it is, therefore, a large undertaking to subdue the combative instinct, it should not be so large an undertaking to regulate and minimize it. In international affairs we know that international arbitration has been brought -about within recent years. I am afraid if only applies to minor disputes. It is, however, not a modern development, although it is largely of modern application. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Finlay, the present AttorneyGeneral of England, a gentleman whose qualifications to express an opinion on such&#39; a subject from the historical point of view, and from the point of view of juridical principle, cannot be exaggerated. But we know quite well that that feeling largely enters into these matters of national and international disputes, and in graver questions there is still, unfortunately, the arbitrament of the sword. The honour of a nation cannot go to arbitration. When I speak of the honour of a nation I fear that we must include in the expression its ambition and its desire of territorial aggrandizement, and not less those national animosities, which very often prevail between nations. The difficulty in international arbitration is the absence of what lawyers call a &#34; sanction.&#34; There must be a reference by consent, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Finlay says, because there is no international authority with power to enforce the decrees of the tribunal. There is no complete sanction, but there is this : There is the honour of the nation itself, and it is that which secures, as we know it has done in the past, the performance of the award which may happen to be made in relation to any international dispute. If, therefore, these efforts have been made - halting and incomplete it may be, as my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> has just pointed out, by reason of the distinction to which he has alluded - and if these efforts have proved successful, in a number of instances which I need not detain the Senate to quote, in relation to international affairs, I think we may very fairly look hopefully to the possibility of applying them in relation to our own internal industrial disputes. The difficulty which faced those who undertook this great subject, in  the first instance, was to reconcile arbitration by consent and arbitration by compulsion. The steps in the first instance were tentative, and I think I may say, in no spirit of depreciation, that these efforts are still more or less in the experimental stage. That is true, as has been admitted, of the New Zealand Act. It is true of the New South Wales legislation, and probably it will also be true of this measure when it comes into operation. But that should not deter us from making the effort so far as we can, and making it as efficient as we can. We need not invite difficulties or meet them on the threshold, but if they arise it is our duty to endeavour to overcome them. I am speaking now of the legislation that has already existed, and of which I am giving a brief historical summary in relation to the principles underlying it. I say that, though compulsory, the efficacy of the law, to my mind, just as in regard to international disputes and awards, must rest, not on penalties and punishments alone, but on the inborn law-abiding sense of the people, and on the force of a just and intelligent public opinion. These forces will always apply. When we are speaking of compulsion, and of the provisions we seek to embody in an Act of Parliament of this, nature, we must never forget that over and above all, and aiding all, is the force of a true and just public opinion. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reeves,</inline> in moving in the New Zealand </para>

              <para>- I was going to point that out. I remember very well that when the measure was introduced it was mentioned that there had already been a Bill, a copy of which was not &#39; then to be obtained, introduced in the New South- Wales Parliament by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Dibbs, then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dibbs,</inline> with the same object. But there can be no doubt of this - that the true credit of&#39; having embodied a carefully thought-out scheme on this subject in a most lucid printed Bill belongs to the Right Honorable C. C. Kingston, who, if by nothing else in his public life, deserves by that measure to be permanently held in remembrance. With respect to that I think I may be excused for giving this little personal reminiscence. The draft Bill was submitted to me before it was finally in print. I regard that as not merely a compliment from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> who was then in politics while I was not, but as an acknowledgment of a desire which I shared with him at that time, and always have shared, that some effort should be made to secure the arbitrament of a tribunal in respect of industrial disputes in substitution for the. methods to which I have already alluded. That Bill was introduced at the end of the session of 1890, not for the purpose of attempting to pass it, but in order to inform the mind of Parliament and of the people of South Australia on the subject, and to give the country, from a statesmanlike point of view, an opportunity to study the question and to form an opinion upon it. </para>

              <para>- The Bill ,was re-introduced in the following year, 1891, and, finally, after other steps, which my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> will recollect, . and which I need not occupy the time of the Senate by de- tailing, it was in 1894 introduced in the Legislative Council. I may here say that I see no reason whatever why this Conciliation and Arbitration Bill should not, at its inception, have been introduced in the Senate. Possibly, if that had been done, many things which have since taken place might have been avoided. There is the precedent which I have mentioned. . It was introduced, as I have said, in the Legislative Council in 1894, and it became law. </para>

              <para>- There is a difference between opposing a Bill and giving it one&#39;s blessing when it is passed by a Chamber of which one is a member. But I frankly acknowledge that many, if not all, holding the views of honorable senators opposite, and belonging to the party which my friend represents, were wry slow to give their approval to any system of arbitration, compulsory or otherwise. Because, like other people, the Labour Party had not at that time reached a decisive point of judgment on the subject. I am not at all reflecting upon them. I think that it is desirable that the process of coming to a conclusion on an important matter of this sort should be slow ; and I think all parties on all sides, and all interests, might very well, so to speak, seek time for consideration before making a departure which is very grave and very vital. </para>

I rejoice in the relief that has already been secured; and I rejoice that the efforts that have been made have, in many directions, been so successful. But I believe, at the same time, that there are no men on this planet who rise so completely above the level of local conditions and local influences, who are so absolutely free from bias and so impartial, bending neither to the one side nor to the other, as are the Judges of our countrv ; and I do not believe: there is any likelihood of a measure of this sort being defeated by an assumption that the Judges will not do even-handed justice. </para>

              <para>- I merely mention that, not with a view of suggesting that conciliation and arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes may not be effected in the mother land, but to bear out the remark I have just made in vindication of any hesitation on the part of the labour organizations, in the early stages of this legislation, to accept it. The same slow, gradual process of conviction may, I hope, make itself felt upon the minds of those in England who, by a majority of nearly three to one in the conference to which I have referred, have just negatived a proposal for conciliation and arbitration. </para>

              <para>- Of course not. As my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has reminded me, there was no compulsion under the first South Australian Act. That Act, unfortunately, was, as a result, largely a dead . letter. It depended on registration. Without registration there was no enforceable award. No award was to affect any one who had. not submitted. The provisions against strikes were against strikes by, or on the part of. registered associations. That measure, nevertheless, was an enormous advance.In fact, it was the foundation of the subsequent legislation which has been passed elsewhere. But, under the conciliation and other provisions of that South Australian measure, which has been, I think I may say, a most satisfactory adjustment of various industrial disputes in South Australia. </para>

              <para>- That is another thing. That is a distinction to which I hope to invite the attention of honorable senators presently. But until there is a dispute there is nothing to arbitrate upon. The object of the legislation was to prevent strikes. That was the first legislation, so far as South Australia is concerned. In the meantime - before 1894 - New Zealand seized upon the idea, and the whole scheme gradually took a clearer form. The essential position was better understood by the time the New Zealand Act was passed. The object then was - and these, it seems to me, are the two cardinal principles basing this kind of legislation - on the one hand, to prohibit strikes and locks-out; and, on the other, to provide &#39; an adequate remedy for the grievances causing those strikes and locks-out. Those are the true and essential principles which formulate themselves in my mind. We have no right, it seems to me, to take away a means of redress - whatever it may be, or of whatever character - in respect of grievances on the one hand, unless, on the other hand, we provide some other means, of giving redress. </para>

              <para>- I really do not think so.  At  any rate, they produced no wrong impression upon my mind, and I feel quite able to disentangle myself from any possible inference, such ashonorable senators opposite seem to draw from them - if I saw anything of the kind, which I do not. In New Zealand, in 1694,. as I have explained, a Conciliation and Arbitration Act was passed. That was succeeded in 1900 by a consolidating measure. Upon that measure I should like to read aparagraph from a most interesting report by two gentlemen whom we have the honour of having as our colleagues - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> - in 1899, as to the operation of the New Zealand Act. I shall quote one paragraph, not merely because of what they express as the result of their observations and researches, but because it contains an expression of opinion by a gentleman who is said here to be one of the largest employers of labour in New Zealand. It is a report on the system of dealing with the Unemployed, the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, Land Settlement, and various other matters of interest in that Colony. On page 13, I find this paragraph </para>

          </interjection>
          <para>We made careful inquiries as to how the operations of the Act were viewed from both the employers&#39; and workmen&#39;s stand-point, and met leading representatives of each side. We were much indebted to the right honorable the Premier for  arranging  a conference for us with the members of the Court, Messrs. Thompson and Slater, representing the employers and workmen respectively, together with several members of the Board of Conciliation for Wellington, with whom we fully discussed the working of the Act. We were assured that the more reasonable class of employers regarded the Act as  fairly  satisfactory, but there were other employers, however, who  complained  they had not the same exclusive privileges of managing their businesses as formerly. The Act is certainly popular with the workmen. Speaking at a special meeting of the Dunedin Chamber of Commerce on the  19th  October, 1897, to consider certain Bills then before Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Mills, the managing director of the Ur.ion Steam-ship Company, one of the largest employers of labour in New Zealand, is reported by the <inline font-style="italic">Otago Daily Times</inline> to have said that, &#34; personally, he thought the Conciliation and Arbitration Act was a very beneficent one. . . .&#34; </para>

          <para class="block">The whole of the report is very interesting, but that is the passage which more particularly refers to the point we are now considering. In 1900 Western Australia legislated, and in 1901 New South Wales followed suit. Before I leave this brief historical summary of State legislation on the subject, I wish to say that the objection has been taken that legislation of this character is calculated to multiply disputes. That probably is true, but I do not consider that that is any demerit or defect. It brings to the surface disputes. Of course, &#34; the means to do ill deeds makes ill deeds done.&#34; But that equally applies to good deeds. There might be many disputes which would not lead to strikes, yet why should they go unredressed? Surely a grievance, df it exists, should have an opportunity of being dealt with. It is better to settle it in some way or other than that there should be a sort of running sore, and a condition of permanent discontent in the minds of even the humblest of the workmen. I do not regard that objection as of any moment. There is a later Act in Western Australia to which T do not refer, but that, speaking generally, was the state of the legislation when Federation came along. The fundamental principle of our Federal union is that the States shall retain control of their social and industrial legislation. If it is intended . that that principle shall be invaded in any way, that we shall take away from the States any portion of that power in respect of social and industrial legislation, it must be plainly expressed in the Constitution. Ours is not like the Canadian Constitution, which is what I may call a drag net kind of Federal Constitution ; it leaves to the constituent provinces only certain specific matters of control and legislation, and sweeps into the Federal net everything else. Our Constitution is framed on the opposite plan and specifically withdraws from .the States only those matters of national import which are to be dealt with by the Commonwealth in the national interest leaving to the States everything else. With us the drag net, so to speak, is in favour of the States. The principle, therefore, which we have to apply, and which I think &#39;we all do apply, particularly in the Senate, which is  (the States House, is that we must, as far as we can, if there is an ambiguity or a doubt, give the benefit of it ito the States, and not to the Commonwealth. That is the initial view. I shall offer two or three other considerations directly. It will be seen that this may involve a question of the interpretation of the Constitution and of State rights in a very important fashion. Whatever view we take, we here, as the representatives of the States as States, are especially charged to protect their interests and their powers of selfgovernment. We must be careful that we 4p not impinge on those powers and rights, at any rate, unless we are satisfied that they will be protected somewhere else. </para>

              <para>- I am obliged to my honorable friend for reminding me of that consideration, with which I shall deal presently. When the Convention sat, a great many matters were dealt with. It was urged in the first, as well as the closing session, that under certain conceivable circumstances, an industrial dispute in a State might fill the Commonwealth area; might overflow from the State of origin into another State, or other States. It was urged that by overspreading Australia it might assume a national magnitude, so as to be a menace to the nation, and that if that condition of things arose, it was desirable that the whole of the people, as distinguished from the people of one State, should deal with it. Therefore, it was proposed that, in the case of an overspreading dispute of that character, the Commonwealth Parliament should have the power to legislate. I was not in favour of the insertion of the provision in the Constitution. I never ceased to be strongly in favour of applying to these disputes some method of arbitration, but I was not in favour of the introduction of the provision into,the Constitution. At the Adelaide session the proposal was defeated, but at the final session in Melbourne it was carried by a majority of  only  three. On that occasion I said, at page 189 - </para>

              <para>- No; I did not. I was not in favour of the insertion of this provision. Because I felt, and I still think, that it will create difficulties. It will still give trouble in its application. It opens up a vista of litigation, which may be acceptable in some quarters, but not to the general body of the people. In opposing the insertion of this provision in the Constitution, I was in excellent company, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. B.</inline> R. Wise took the same view as I did. I think my honorable friends will readily understand that we acted from no narrow point of view when I say that my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> voted for its insertion. And I ought to mention that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> who voted for its insertion, joined in the debate with an ability which, if he will allow me to say so, he showed throughout the proceedings of the Convention. Well, there the provision is, and, being in the Constitution, it is part of the necessary equipment- of the Commonwealth. It is our duty not merely to put it in force, but . also to make it effective, if we can. This I regard as a machinery Bill, just as much as some of the other Bills which have been introduced. We may differ on the details, but it is incumbent on any Ministry and on the Parliament to exercise this power, and, as I say, to make it effective. I think that this </para>

              <para>- It is a dispute beyond&#39; the limits of any one State, and a dispute of that character only to which the words &#34;prevention and settlement&#34; apply. That is a point in respect to which I desire to remove any possible misapprehension. Honorable senators must not cherish the illusion that this provision enables us to interfere with a dispute while it is yet within the borders of a State. I see that some discussion took place elsewhere on this point&#39;, and the words &#34; likely to extend &#34; were used. I venture to say that that is no part of the definition. When we apply our minds to the Bill in Committee, or at any other time, we should avoid running away with the notion that we are dealing with disputes that are &#34; likely to extend &#34; beyond the limits of a State. Extending beyond the limits of a State means that the dispute must have gone outside the borders of one State- and into another before this legislation can touch it. </para>

              <para>- I am obliged to my honorable friend for his interjection. . There is a provision in the Bill which enables the Commonwealth Court to deal with disputes at the request of a State. Whatever the moral effect of that might be - and I am certainly not going to suggest its omission - I gravely doubt whether it is constitutional. I gravely doubt whether any State can shuffle . off its own responsibilities in that way. I wish to be perfectly frank about this. The State, in its control of its own industrial disputes within its own territorial limits, must deal with them and settle them as best it can. </para>

              <para>- I made that point before. The honorable senator will remember that we were not in the Convention using words by plumb and rule. Everybody recognises that a Constitution is not bound in fetters with the rigidity of even an Act of Parliaments Honorable senators will see that whatever meaning is to be attributed to, and whatever effect is to be given to, the word &#34; prevention,&#34; it must be an effect applicable to the kind of dispute to which it applies, namely, a dispute which has overspread into the Commonwealth area, as distinct from the State area. </para>

              <para>- Exactly, and I say I am going to help to do so. Then we come to the next thing which we have to do, and that is to provide for the settlement of these disputes. In making this as good a Bill as we can, we have to bear in mind what it is we are dealing with, namely, disputes extending beyond the limits of a State, because though you cannot prevent a dispute, you can prevent a strike by settling a dispute. </para>

          <para>T think it right to do so, as it is one of the most important matters arising under the Bill. I am dealing now merely with what the Convention did. Once a dispute becomes national as distinct from State - as to territorial area, that is what it means, and not as to atmospherical disturbance - we apply the same provisions to it as we should  apply  if it were purely a State matter dealt with by a State. It becomes Federal and national, and I point out that there is a parallel in one part of the jurisdiction of the High Court, where we have &#34; controversies &#34; as thev are called between States. This is exactly in the same position. We are to give jurisdiction to this newly created tribunal in respect of disputes that have gone beyond the boundaries of a State, and have extended to another territorial jurisdiction. Having made these general observations on the Constitution and the fashion in which the provision got into it, I may say that those of us who resisted its being put into the .Constitution cannot be charged with doing so from any antipathy to the great doctrine of conciliation and arbitration in such disputes. </para>

Quite irrespective of the provision in this Bill with respect to State public servants, the States may be brought into conflict by its operation in other regards. I do not wish to prophesy evil of any sort or description. I hope there may be none. I still, however, adhere to the view I entertained some time ago, that there are possibilities of difficulties which I hope may not arise, but that they exist I think now, as I did then. </para>

              <para>- I am not very sure of that. I should not like to admit that now. I am rather inclined to think that State jurisdiction might settle practically everything. But now that we have this provision it is our duty to assume that there are, or may be, disputes which the </para>

I do not propose to go through the various clauses of the Bill. That should not be necessary, as we shall have an opportunity to deal with them in Committee. I wish to say, generally, that the Bill is not intended, and will not give any benefit to individual employes. It is only as members of organizations that they can secure any benefit under this Bill. </para>

              <para>- Quite so. The individual employ&#233; and the individual employer, except as defendants, are substantially excluded from its operation. Employers are debarred in just the same way as employes from bringing a dispute before the Court, unless as members cif an organization. The Bill does not provide a means for the settlement of disputes between employers and non-associated workmen. Whatever differences there may be between them, there is no means provided by&#39; this measure for settling such disputes. It rests, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has very properly said, upon organization. I propose to hurriedly refer to some leading clauses, and then to deal with two very vital and most controversial provisions before I close. The objects of the measure are set out in clause 2.

No one can view the Bill with an unbiased mind without seeing the extent to which the penalties and disabilities go and the persons on whom they fall. Then we have to consider how the other part of the objects of the measure are to be given effect to. The next thing is the constitution of the Court, and under clause 1 1 the Conciliation and Arbitration Court is to be appointed. In connexion with that appointment,I remind honorable senators that, under clause 35. the Court is to be constituted with the appointment of a  President.  The original proposal to have two permanent members of the Court, in association with the  President,  does not now find a place in the Bill. The remainder of clause 35 refers to the appointment of assessors, or experts, to assist the  President. </para>

Eut I may say - I do not propose any alteration - that I concur with a remark made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> on this point. I do not know that it would be possible, but I think it would be better if the  President  of the Court were a high judicial officer, who was not at the same time a Judge of the High Court. Personally, I do not like the idea of - I was going to say, entangling, but I shall not use that word, because it might be misunderstood - transferring a Judge to an atmosphere in which questions of a totally different kind are dealt with - to an arena in which there are elements not ordinarily present in the High Court.

              <para>- I shall not say discord; but there are elements of heat and irritation, which, as I know from long experience, affect unsuccessful litigants in any Court, but which will be infinitely more in evidence when the litigants number &#39; hundreds or thousands. Smouldering resentment at an adverse decision on the part of an individual litigant is liable to assume much greater intensity under the circumstances which will proceed, accompany, and follow a reference to the Arbitration Court. With a view to having a Judge, who, in this tribunal, shall be above suspicion - in whom there will be a most perfect confidence on all sides, but who, at the same time, will be limited in his powers by the particular class of cases - it is not desirable to run the risk of his being subject, in another tribunal, to complaints of an unpleasant kind, arising out of his duties in another sphere. In this Bill, and, I believe in every Bill on the subject, there is a limitation as to the tenure of office, the term in the present case being seven years. A Judge of the High Court is appointed for life and good behaviour, but if, at the end of seven years, we, all being human, experience on one side or the other a feeling which we would not express but one of dissatisfaction, and he is not re-appointed - then all I can say is that such a judge might go back to his other duties with a blemish. </para>

          <para>I beg honorable senators to bear that clause in mind when they come to consider a subsequent provision to which I shall refer. This clause is further amplified in clause 28, which declares that a decision of the Court &#34;shall be framed in such a manner as to best express the decision of the Court, and to avoid unnecessary technicality.&#34; </para>
          <para class="block">We have here a Court which, I think, should command confidence, and the functions of which ought to be successfully exercised. We have a Court which is expressly emancipated- from those rigid rules and technicalities which, some honorable members may think, occasionally embarrass, if they do not frustrate, the ends of justice. I think I have said enough, without going into the other clauses, to inform honorable members as to the &#39;constitution and jurisdiction of the Court. Then clause 30 provides that when a State law or award is inconsistent with an award of the Court, the latter shall prevail. In another place a question was asked by way of interjection as to how far this clause applied, and I am disposed to think - and I suggest this for the consideration of honorable senators - that this clause will not apply, as many have supposed, to a decision of the Court given before a dispute has overspread into another State. That is to say, if there is a dispute with which a State Court has dealt effectively, I doubt whether, even if the dispute may subsequently travel into another State, this provision would enable the Commonwealth Court to practically reverse the decision of the State Court, or modify it in any respect. I mention these matters so that honorable senators may think them over, and not with any view of laying down a rule. If any honorable senators are under the impression that the Commonwealth Court is to have power to plunge itself into conflict with a State Court which has already done justice in a particular dispute, they will probably find themselves under a misapprehension. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator is mistaken ; but I am very glad to think that he agrees with me. Clause 38, which deals with the powers of the Court, refers to the principle of the common rule; but I do not propose to say anything on that subject now. The fundamental object is to prevent the frequency and multiplication of applications to the Court. Where the Court, in the exercise of its judgment, subject to the qualification imposed by the clause, considers it may bring in the other parties affected, so as to establish a common rule, it is given power to do so. In Committee, we may or may not discuss this point ; but as the provision stands, it seems to me to carry out the intention of the Bill. </para>

              <para>- It appears to me that every effort has been made, so far as this provision is concerned, to intrust the Court with the widest jurisdiction; and no jurisdicion can be complete in this or any other Court, if it has not the power, first of all, to make orders, and, next, particularly in a jurisdiction of this sort, to vary those orders as varying conditions require. </para>

              <para>- It is not so much trusting to discretion, as giving the Court ample jurisdiction to deal fairly and justly with the conditions which are presented. If the conditions alter in the intervals between the making of the order and the application to vary, there should be power to reconsider that order. What could be fairer or more just? The orders of the Court are not to be like the laws of the Medes and Persians, absolutely immutable, because conditions may change and cause suffering to both employers and employes We all desire that in those settlements there shall be evenhanded justice. Clause 51 provides for the registration of organizations, and this is hedged in so as to prevent injustice. Then come the provisions with regard to industrial agreements which are only important in this connexion in so far as they are to be intrusted to the Court. There are two other points to which I promised to refer at a little greater length. The first arises under the definition of &#34; industrial disputes,&#34; and has reference to railway servants, or, as I shall call them henceforth, public servants. The provision referring to railway servants or others employed in industries carried on by or under the control of the Commonwealth or State, has given rise to a great deal of controversy. There are two classes - one consisting of railway servants, and the other consisting of persons employed in industries carried on by or under the control of th? State, or any public authority constituted under the State. It seems to me that those two classes are specifically mentioned, because otherwise they would be outside the Bill. It probably is felt, or was felt - and it is well this should be distinctly stated - that unless they were ex pressly mentioned, the definition of &#34; industrial dispute,&#34; which is imported from the Constitution, would not apply to States servants. At any rate, it is expressly mentioned; and therefore we are in a position to deal with it, and it is not left to mere construction hereafter. That is a very grave question, and it appeals especially to the Senate as the States House. Whatever view we may take of many questions, as to party politics and so forth - whatever view we may take as to issues which are constantly arising between us, and in which&#39; individual views and the views of parties may be expressed - this question, I think, may well be viewed apart from such considerations as much as possible. We should look upon it to some extent from the stand-point that we are the representatives of the States - that we are senators charged with the safeguarding of States rights. </para>

              <para>- I do not take any notice, of that interruption, except to say that my honorable friend occupies a position in this Senate which is only second to that which  1  occupy, and he may well refrain from interruptions which do not usefully assist the discussion. I am going to tell the Senate what I think of the clause, and what I propose to do. It is our duty to look at it from the point of view which I have stated, to consider the position which we occupy, and the redress which the States may have in respect of this provision, if they take exception to it, and whether that redress will be efficient or otherwise. There are three considerations. The first is, is it expedient? The second is, would it be operative - I mean in respect of the public servants of the States? And the third is, is it constitutional? I am going to take the same course as my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> took, and say that in my humble view as it originally stood in the Bill the provision was not expedient; and that the reasons applicable in respect of individual ordinary employers do not apply in the same spirit to a State or to State employment. Private employers are moved by self-interest in respect of their labour bargains. A State is not supposed to be moved by self-interest. It is under the eye and control of its representatives, and, in point of fact, the States servants are really their own employers. </para>

              <para>- Of course it is run on commercial lines j but it is under the control of the people, of whom the p&#39;ublic servants are part. It is under the control of Parliament, which is elected on a franchise which these public servants are entitled to exercise. I am merely pointing out that there is that difference, and that also it must never be forgotten that States servants - and these are considerations which affect the constitutional aspect, as well as the other, and that is why I am putting it now - enjoy privileges which other employes do not enjoy. The States offer inducements which cause State employment to be run after. </para>

              <para>- I have in mind the railways at present. At any rate, there are certain privileges attached to the service of the State, and if in exchange it may be said that State servants suffer from a disability in regard to Commonwealth legislation of this kind, from which other employe&#39;s do not suffer, they  aTe  recompensed in other directions. The position was exceedingly well put in a journal which lately referred to a very remarkable railway strike which took place in Hungary. The railway servants struck. But these railway employes also belonged to the railway regiments of regulars, and the way the strike seems to have been brought to an end was by their being called out and embodied as a railway regiment of regulars to put down their own strike. That was a kind of compulsory conciliation. </para>

              <para>- That would not be striking, in the true sense of the word ; it would be boycotting in sympathy ; and every one agrees - I think I may say that the leader of the Opposition in another place, equally with those who dissent from him on other matters, agrees -  that this Bill does not apply to what is called a sympathetic strike. And what my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> refers to would not be even a sympathetic strike; it would be a sympathetic boycott, to adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford&#39;s</inline> term. Therefore, I do not object to this provision in the form in which it stands in the Bill, for the reasons which I will mention. One of them is that I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins,</inline> with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> - and, perhaps, with others, for all I know - that there is not likely to be any conceivable case to which it could apply. But I must ask honorable senators to consider the question also in connexion with its constitutionality in respect of what are the industries of a State. What are those industries to which this measure would apply? Does it mean water supply or deep drainage, such as we have in South Australia, or anything of that kind? When we come face to face with these matters, we shall find that there are considerations which perhaps will lead to some difficulties in settlement. In the course of the debate in another place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> said that, in these matters- </para>

              <para>- I will not quote what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> said in another place, but I may remark that it was said elsewhere, that the High Court would decide, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.- Mauger</inline> interrupted, &#34; Is not that a solution of the difficulty ?&#34; I think it is a solution of the difficulty. But I feel bound, at the same time, to give the Senate, very briefly, the benefit of the considerations which I think will operate to decide that it is not a constitutional provision. But, of course, as I say again, it is for the High Court to decide; and I personally adopt exactly the same course as I took up in connexion with Tattersalls, when, without dealing with the expediency of the question, and so on, I said that I regarded our legislation as an unconstitutional interference with the rights of Tasmania, and that it was for the High Court to decide. I put it, briefly,, in this way. Federation, honorable senators will recollect, is, as was said by Chief Justice Chase, the indestructible Union of indestructible States. The States are sovereign States. They surrender only certain selfgoverning powers, and they give up certain specific matters- to the Commonwealth Government, keeping what they do not surrender. The States, of course - as the Commonwealth can also do - can bring their own servants under the jurisdiction of a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. They can appoint any tribunal for the purpose of dealing with them. That is perfectly within their own powers. But we have no power by legislation to enlarge the scope of the Constitution, or to take to ourselves powers which are not expressly given to us in the terms of the Constitution. What we are trying to do by this provision, is to bind the Crown, or the Crown&#39;s servants in another jurisdiction, in a sovereign country, over which, as far as this subject is concerned, we have no express control. The Crown is not bound unless it is expressly mentioned, even as regards the Commonwealth. How, then, can </para>

          </interjection>
          <para>Ave  make the Crown, as a State employer, bound without it being mentioned, and in another jurisdiction ? We are asked to declare that the Crown, in another State, and in respect to its own servants, is to be an employer or an organization. That, it seems to me, cannot be constitutionally done. I call the attention of honorable senators to the matter, and it is for these reasons that I feel perfectly satisfied,, as a representative of South Australia, to leave this question, instead of involving it where it ought not to be involved in the heat of party strife, to the decision of the tribunal which is charged under the Constitution with the duty of determining between the relative powers of State and State, and State and Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- On its expediency there may be very great difference of opinion, and if it will avail and is applicable, I should be very sorry to see the provision struck out. If it will avail and is applicable, and there are disputes which will come under its operation, why should it not be brought into play? I think it would be a monstrous thing, if it were a matter on which there was any doubt, that the doubt should be solved by its exclusion if it merely rested on the question of what one side or the other thought was expedient. And when we find that question of expediency made, as it must necessarily be made, a party question, it appears to me that in a Bill of this sort, which I look upon as a machinery Bill, we may differ as to details, but in essence it is a machinery Bill. </para>

              <para>- Yes, if it is constitutional. I have been taunted here before with having said that something was unconstitutional, and with the Court having decided the otherway. I dare say, sir, I am very often wrong in giving an opinion, but if I have an opinion it is my duty to express it, and I hope I may be forgiven if it turns out that I am mistaken. I should feel that I was not discharging the trust which ls reposed in me, in common with other honorable senators, if I did not point out these things, and decline to take upon myself the obligation of deciding the question, and. voting in accordance with that decision, when in the Constitution we have created a tribunal to decide it. for us.

              <para>- I refer to this observation in connexion with the&#39; remark made by the honorable senator as to what the Convention intended. Looking at the jealous way in which it safe-guarded the railways in every respect from the Commonwealth, I am quite sure that if it had been proposed the Convention would not have consented to the introduction of a power giving the Commonwealth Parliament control over the public servants of the States. But whether it has done so or not, various reasons have been shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> in various places as to the possible unconstitutionality of this provision, which I do not intend to deal with now. The only other matter to refer to is preference to unionists. On one occasion, my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> used words which I cannot improve upon.

We now have it in a form in which it seems to me, after as exhaustive an examination of the views on both sides as I have been able to give, to literally express what every one thinks is a fair principle, namely, majority rule. And safe-guarded in that way, and embodying in the Bill a principle on which Courts have already acted, I confess I am unable to understand the objections which have been taken to it bv my honorable friends opposite, or the opposition which they propose to give it. </para>

              <para>- From my point of view, of course, this question of preference does involve in its bare form the whole matter of freedom of contract, of whether, if unionists decline to work with non-unionists, the penalty of being out of work should fall on the non-unionists only. It covers the whole area of the States, with diverse conditions of climate, different scales of living. </para>

              <para>- I .do mention it. The bald principle is said to be essential to the  Act.  I do not think it is. I was going to use the expression &#34; unadulterated,&#34; and I hope I may be allowed to say, without offence, that unadulterated preference is not essential to the measure. I take an illustration which has been given before. There is in Victoria an Act which is really an Act for compulsory arbitration in relation to trade disputes. I refer to the Factories and Shops Act of 1896, in which there is no preference. </para>

              <para>- I was under the impression which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> confirms, because I had noted proceedings under the Act reported in the newspapers which certainly did not bring home to my mind the idea that the Act was confined to organized bodies. However, it embodies a system of compulsory arbitration in. relation to the matters within its scope, and so far as I am aware it contains no provision as to preference as an element in its efficacy, and its efficacy has been great. It has been fought for, and, I think, it is valued highly in this State. That appears to me to afford a strong argument in support of the contention that we may have compulsory arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes as to wages, and so on, without having preference as an essential. </para>

              <para>- It may not be. I am putting it with submission and argumentatively, and honorable senators who disagree will be able to show the difference. The illustration has been given before, and it struck me as very forcible. It is alluded to, I think, in the speech in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. B.</inline> R. Wise moved the second reading of his Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, in New South Wales, and in this connexion, as illustrative of the beneficent effects of a certain kind of compulsory arbitration. But what I desire to point out to honorable senators is that this Bill concedes preference. The only controversy is as to what are fair terms. </para>

              <para>- Unless a majority of &#39;those affected agree. That does not affect the principle of the preference to be given. We propose by the law to lay down the principles by which the Court is to be guided in giving a preference in any case brought &#39; before it. </para>

              <para>- It was not in the original Bill, but it is in this Bill, which is a great improvement on the original Bill, and it ought to have been in the original Bill, because it is a broad principle, laid down -by other Courts after experience. It will commend itself quite as much to my honorable friend to learn that it is embodying a principle which has practically been assented to by the leaders on the other side. </para>

              <para>- I will give honorable senators chapter and verse for it. It appears to me that the question is really : What are fair terms ? What is a fair principle by which the Court shall be guided ? In what way and subject to what limitations shall the Court exercise that particular function, which is so far-reaching and important? I say that it is our duty, having regard to the difficulties of the Court in many other directions, owing to its new and complex jurisdiction, to make these governing lines as clear as we possibly can. There is really, as I have said, no difference of opinion as to the basis or conditions of this preference. I make certain references simply with a view to substantiating what I say as to the views of the leaders on the other side. We know that this provision for a preference was inserted in the New South Wales measure. In an article published in the <inline font-style="italic">National Review</inline> for August, 1902, long after the New South Wales Act came into operation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. B.</inline> R. Wise refers to the subject. </para>

              <para>- I should have thought that my honorable friends opposite accepted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> as their guide, philosopher, and friend on this question of preference. There may be no foundation for it, of course; but I was under some impression that that gentleman had some hand in framing the amendment which was proposed in substitution for the amendment submitted in another place by the&#39; present Minister for Defence, and which now appears as a part of this Bill. A very excellent piece of handiwork it was, although it does not appear to me to differentiate much between the insertion of the two amendments. </para>

              <para>- I do not think the late Prime Minister was &#34; pushed &#34; at all. The fact of the matter is, and I say it with all humility, that it was largely a fight over words without substance. In the middle ages they did that kind of thing, and it was then called, I believe, logomachy. I thought we had outlived such contests; and it would seem that the late Government must have been made the tool of some hair-splitting lawyer. </para>

              <para>-  So long as the rights of majorities are safeguarded, will the AttorneyGeneral be satisfied? ^Senator <inline font-weight="bold">Sir JOSIAH</inline> SYMON.- I think the Bill effects what everybody intends, and I prefer the words of the clause. I am with those who voted with the majority in another place - those who preferred the words now in the clause, rather than have others much more difficult of interpretation and application. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> as I said before, in regard to the difficulty of the word &#34; substantially,&#34; and so forth. The provision is that no preference shall be given unless the application is in the opinion of the Court &#34; approved by a majority of those affected by the award, who have interests in common with the applicants.&#34; I apologize, especially to my friends opposite, for speaking at such length; but the subject is so interesting that I had no idea I had been so long. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> referred to the word &#34; substantially,&#34; but I remind him that that is not the word in the Bill. It was in the other proposed amendment, and the difficulty as to how it would be interpreted shows the propriety of the rejection of the proposed amendment and the retention of the provision in the Bill. </para>

              <para>- I really could not explain. That amendment introduces language much more calculated to create confusion, and to embarrass the Court. The provision of the Bill in the form in which - with the permission of the Senate - I shall endeavour to have it carried, will be open to no exception on the ground of difficulty as to proof. I agree entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and those who take the view that the principle to which I have already referred, with regard to doing away with all technicality and disregarding the rigid rules of evidence, will apply with regard to this as with regard to other parts of the measure, and that the Court will inform its mind - that is the language of clause 25 - by any means in its power, and will, upon the information which it thus derives, come to the conclusion which it may think right. I again apologize to the Senate for having occupied a longer time than I intended. There were other matters to which I wished to refer, but I do not propose to detain the Senate further at this stage. </para>

              <para>- Oh, no ; and,, on the other hand, I hope that my honorable friend will not take the remark I made to him too seriously. I agree with the observation that this has been a very fateful measure. It seemed like a portent. It weakened and shook one Ministry. As my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> put it,_ it rent that Ministry asunder. It has wrecked two more Ministries. There is only one catastrophe which remains for it to accomplish, and that is to wreck a Parliament. For my part,. I fervently hope that that fatality at least may be averted ; and in all sincerity I say that I hope we shall quickly see this measure in the quiet haven of the statute-book. Why it has been so fruitful of disaster I am really at a loss to know. But that, after all, may be a good omen. An accompaniment of warring elements at its birth may presage a power for good and a life of usefulness. That has happened before; I hope it will happen again. And I hope that it will happen in relation to this Bill, which is, at least, the symbol of a higher civilization and a more humane spirit. I think it is big with promise. I earnestly hope that it may also be big with fulfilment. Nevertheless, I trust that the day may be far distant when such a lamentable condition will arise as shall bring it into operation ; because the bringing of this measure into operation predicates a dispute of a magnitude which none of us cares to foretell, and which, I think, we should shrink from seeing. At any rate, when that time comes I earnestly pray that it may be found adequate to all needs, that it may, as we desire, throw wide the everlasting gates of a great temple of peace within whose precincts passion shall be stilled, and no sound of oppression heard, and where the healing voice of justice shall pronounce only that which is right. </para>

            <para>- If the question of extending the sitting days of the Senate is to be considered, I trust that the convenience of senators from distant States will not be lost sight of. I do not know that there is any necessity for the Senate to sit four days a week. The House of Representatives is now engaged in dealing with the Budget, and the Estimates, and will probably be- unable to conclude that work for a considerable time. In the meantime, the Senate can proceed with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and probably we shall be able to dispose of all our business by sitting on the usual days. If, however, we are to sit four days a week, I trust that due notice will be given, so that honorable senators from  distant  States may make their arrangements accordingly. It is not reasonable to spring a proposal of this character upon honorable senators without notice ; but if it is absolutely necessary, we are prepared to attend to our duties, and to carry out the business of the country in any way that may be thought desirable. </para>

            <para>- I agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has said. It must be remembered that the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill has been threshed out in another place, and that consequently there is so much less work for the Senate to do. It has also to be remembered that there are fewer members in the Senate, and consequently our debates ought not to take so long as those in the House of Representatives. I can quite understand the objection to sitting four days a week on the part of those honorable senators who go home at the week end. If they are to return to Melbourne on Tuesday, they will practically be travelling all the time. Although it is true that very little Was been done this session so far, I believe that by sitting three days a week we shall be able to catch up the work to be done, without sitting an extra day. </para>

            <para>- I favour sitting four days a week, or even five if necessary. As a matter of fact, ever since the Senate has been in existence, the convenience of the New South Wales and South Australian senators has been particularly considered in connexion with our times of sitting. They, however, have shown no consideration whatever for the convenience and comfort of senators who come from outlying States. Some honorable senators are able to return to the bosom of their families  every  week end. Others of us are exiled in a strange country. We can get home only once or twice in a session. Very naturally, therefore, we desire to get the business of the session completed, in order that we may retire to our fastnesses in Western Australia and Queensland. On the other hand, our friends from New South Wales and South Australia are inclined to dawdle over the business of &#39;the country. Thev wish to take it bv easy instalments. They want to go home every week end, and to come back on Tuesday morning would be a severe interference with their physical comfort. We wish to get the business of the session finished as quickly as possible. </para>

              <para>- The sooner this measurehas been disposed of by the Senate the better it will be, and that is why I think it should sit four days a week. It will not be a very great hardship for the representatives of New South Wales to come over here for, say, a couple of weeks in succession on Tuesday, instead of Wednesday, and if they do, it will probably enable honorable senators from the other States to ger. away a week or two earlier. I can easily understand that honorable senators opposite, especially those from New South Wales, wish to string out the consideration of this Bill. The Parliament has been in session since March, and when it is prorogued it will have done practically nothing. It has done nothing so far. During this session we have had three Governments, and not one of them has done anything. So far as appearances go, I do not see that the present Government is going to be much of an improvement on the others. </para>

              <para>- I hope that it will. I trust that we shall be able to do some work, and that is the reason why I am anxious that the honorable and learned senator should agree to sit four days a week. I know that, whatever his followers may be, he is a very hard worker. He never spares himself, and I hope that, in connexion with this Bill, he will not spare his supporters, but will insist on them coming here on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. </para>

Why are they not prepared to consider the convenience of those who come from other States? Why is it always the convenience of the representatives of New South Wales which is to be considered ? I ask the poor senators from that State to consider the interest or convenience of the poor senators from Western Australia, who cannot get home at the week end. Have they any notion of what it is to loaf about here on Monday and Tuesday, with nothing to do? We have no home here to go to, and we have no private business that we can do in this foreign capital. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; we are simply compelled to loaf in this Parliament House. I conceive that the representatives of New South Wales are paid their salaries to work here, and not to go home at the week end. I see no reason why they should expect to be in a more convenient or better situation for getting home than we are. </para>

I must protest against the assumption that the representatives of New South Wales are paid .&#163;400 a year each simply to enable them to go home on Friday, and return on Wednesday. I maintain that when a senator is elected for that State he should abandon all hope of seeing his family from the day the Parliament meets until it is prorogued. </para>

I have made a point of being here time after time, even when we have met to sit for only an hour or two. I have travelled many hundreds of miles, and sat here for an hour and a half. Why? Because the friends of honorable senators opposite had been talking day after day in the other House, in many cases for four hours each, when they knew that it was all useless. If honorable senators will only be content to speak for, say, a quarter of an hour on each question, we shall soon get through our work.

I think that, thev would rather not sit at all, if that would conserve their own convenience, and the interests of their own particular crowd. We hear nothing now but the expression of a desire to steal into recess with the greatest .possible speed, in order that certain gentlemen who occupy the Treasury benches may be secured in that position for about another year. No one has perhaps said so in plain language, but it has been said that the present Government desire to get into recess as soon as possible. </para>

              <para>- I have no desire to go into recess until the business of the country is completed. I wish to sit for four days a week, because I believe that if we did so, we should be able to give better consideration to the measures before us, and we should not have to slur over anything. It is quite a common experience in all Parliaments to find that, towards the close of a session, Bills and Estimates are hurried through in a shameful manner, and do not receive half the consideration which their importance demands. The consequence is that the legislative work is very badly done, and we should be. here to do that work as well as we can. We have before us now an exceedingly important measure which it will take us a considerable time to deal with. The public have been clamouring for this Bill, and we should give it our continued attention, instead of scrambling down here on the Wednesday from New </para>

            <para>- I rise to take exception, briefly, to the manner in which the Attorney-General answered my question. I am sorry to think that the honorable and learned gentleman does not appear to consider Captain Creswell&#39;s statement of very much importance. I may say that I have considerable respect for Captain Creswell, and I was very happy indeed to be able to use his arguments, and his speeches in favour of an Australian Navy, as opposed to the Naval Agreement. But when he ventures to take sides in the present contest between Russia and Japan, inasmuch as he is Commander of the Naval Forces of the Commonwealth, I think he is not obeving the order of neutrality. I have a verv great respect for the Russian people. The Russia of to-day is not the Russia which we read about in Stepniak&#39;s novels. If Australia is to be neutral, let us be really neutral. I must say that I deplore some of the articles which have appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and some of the cartoons which have appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">World&#39;s News</inline> reflecting and throwing contempt on the Russian people. I should like to see Australia stand quite clear of the contest between Russia and Japan. I know that there are many people throughout the British Empire who feel it very much when the people of any other nation venture to take sides with England&#39;s enemies; and I think we ought to deprecate the taking of sides by our own people in the contest now being waged. I am in hope that the time will come, when we shall have an alliance of the great Powers to enforce international -arbitration. I think that thearticles appearing in newspapers, and the ill-considered speeches of gentlemen like Captain Creswell, will tend to delay the consummation of that splendid time when we shall settle international disputes by arbitration, instead of by going to war with all its disaster and loss to the people engaging in it, and to the world in general. The reply given to me by the Attorney-General is not in keeping with the attitude which the honorable and learned senator has assumed since he took office. Those of us who knew him as leader of the Opposition in. the Senate, and admired sometimes his sturdy and perhaps truculent demeanour - </para>

We were rather surprised to notice the way in which, as Attorney-General, the honorable and learned senator conducted the business of the Senate after he took office.

              <para>-Col. NEILD. - It is perfectly true that the honorable senators from New South Wales have come here time after time merely to go home again. Even the present sitting appears to be but another illustration of the same kind of thing. We have listened to a very eloquent speech, but apparently we are again to adjourn without doing any business. I protest against the frequent adjournments which have taken place lately, but I am not in favour of four sittings in the week unless some occasion can be shown for it. I echo what I think was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane,</inline> and I say, let us go on with three sittings a week&#34;, and when we see any necessity for four sittings in the week, let us have them, but not merely as a matter of whim and without any real reason. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (AttorneyGeneral - South Australia). - I confess that the amount of heat which has been generated over &#39; this motion for adjournment has surprised me. I have been equally surprised to find that there are so many grave differences, which I hope willyet be healed between some honorable senators opposite. I regretted to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> powerful arguments met with the ejaculation, &#34; Why this indecent haste &#34; ? I have possibly some right to complain of the reception which his remarks have been given by some of his honorable friends. On this question I desire to say that I am absolutely in sympathy with those who wish to get on as actively as possible with the work of the country, but it should certainly be done with something like regular progression. I believe in sitting four days . in the week, but I am not prepared to move a motion to apply the order to next Tuesday. There is a sessional order now in force, which prevents our sitting on the Tuesday, and I may tell honorable senators that I have &#39; a notice of motion written out which I shall be prepared to submit when the necessity arises, and when I think that by &#39;sitting on the Tuesday we shall expedite the business of the session. I do not propose to begin the Tuesday sittings next week, and honorable senators from New South Wales and from all the States will have ample notice, so that they may make their arrangements, and so that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> mav not be a homeless, hapless wanderer on the face of the earth, without knowing what he has to do. &#39; With regard to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has said I feel sure that the honorable senator cannot suggest that there was any discourtesy in the way in which I put what I had to say when he asked his question to-day. I certainly had no intention of being discourteous. My refusal to answer his question was due, as 1 said, to my belief in his own solicitude for the time and dignity of the Senate. In the form in which the question was put I thought I ought not to have been called on to answer it, nor do I think so now. It would, in my opinion, have been better if the honorable senator&#39;s question had not been placed on the noticepaper. At the same time I do not undervalue the sentiments he has expressed in regard to Russia and international arbitration. I do not think the remarks of Captain Creswell were at all a violation of the neutrality by which we are governed in relation to the struggle now taking place . between Russia and Japan. The honorable senator will accept my assurance that my reply was made in no spirit of discourtesy. I hope I shall never be justly charged with discourtesy to- any member of the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has suggested that we might go on with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, when we meet at half-past  2  p.m. to-morrow, but the honorable and learned senator must know as well as I do, that to-morrow is private members&#39; day, and I should not bejustified in asking that that Bill should be gone on with without the consent of honorable senators who have private business onthe paper. If honorable senators who are in charge of . private business give their consent, I shall be pleased to arrange for the continuance of the debate on the second reading of the Bill, as soon as possible, - if that should also be found convenient to the honorable senator who has moved -the adjournment of the debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has made some reference to the desire of honorable senators to have proofs of my remarks in moving the second reading of the Bill. I shall, of course, desire to go through the report to check the quotations I have made, but I shall confer with the  President  if he will allow me, and also with those in charge of <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard,</inline> to see what can be done to enable honorable senators to receive proofs of my speech as soon as possible. </para>
