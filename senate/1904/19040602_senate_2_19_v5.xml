                    <para>I should like to ask the Vice-President pf the Executive Council, without notice, whether the Government will take steps to have the printing of necessary documents done more expeditiously than at present? I belong to a Select Committee before which evidence was taken last week. Printed copies were only put into our hands this morning, at 10 o&#39;clock, and we had not. time to read them before business commenced. I hope that the Government will endeavour to take some steps to have printing more expeditiously clone. </para>

                        <para>- So far as <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> can recollect, those were the words which were used by Major-General Hutton. It appears, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> statement, that he met the then Minister of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, in Sydney - at the Hotel Australia, I think he said. Being very well acquainted with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest and his family, he mentioned to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John,</inline> not, he thought, in his capacity as Minister of Defence, but as a personal friend, that he was about to be retrenched, and that he thought it very hard. However, when Major-General Hutton spoke to him in those terms, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> thought there must be something at the back of his retrenchment beyond the stated reason that he was retrenched on the ground of economy. He endeavoured to find out the reasons- for his retrenchment. After eight months of repeated requests in various quarters, Major-General Hutton gave three reasons for <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> retrenchment. They were as follow : - </para>

                <para>I entered the Queensland land service on probation on 27th February, 1898. Three months afterwards I passed the examination for Lieutenant in the Queensland Defence Force, Artillery branch. </para>

                <para>I then applied to be placed on the unattached list, as I had to go to England on private affairs. </para>
                <para>I was granted one month&#39;s leave on full pay, and sailed shortly afterwards as an officer of the Queensland Artillery, and was attached to the Royal Field Artillery at Aldershot by General J. F. Owen, R.A., Commandant of Queensland. I then served with the 4th Field Battery under <inline font-weight="bold">Major Pickwoad,</inline> and then with the 57th Field Battery under <inline font-weight="bold">Major Martin</inline> until 18,92. This service was carried out at my own expense. </para>
                <para>I then passed the examination for the rank of Captain, and was gazetted in Queensland as having passed such examination. </para>
                <para>After leaving Aldershot I went to the London Royal Veterinary College, as some Artillery officers did a short course at Aldershot. I wished to go further with a regular veterinary course, and I passed two examinations whilst there. </para>
                <para>In May, 1893, I sent to Queensland to ask that my Imperial service should be allowed to count as service in the Queensland Defence Force; and I was allowed by the Commandant to remain on the list of unattached officers, provided that I obtained and forwarded particulars of the work performed by me with the Imperial Forces. </para>
                <para>In 1894 I went to Aldershot, and served with &#34; G &#34; Battery of Royal Horse Artillery under <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hunt,</inline> and afterwards with the 4th Hussars under Colonel Brabazon. I sent certificates of such service, which .were approved. This exhibit also conveys to me the Commandant&#39;s satisfaction at the progress I was making in my military studies. </para>
                <para>Whilst in England I also went to the Royal Gymnasium, and underwent a course of physical training, obtaining an extra certificate. </para>
                <para>In 1899 I completed the course, and obtained a certificate from Colonel Fox, which he had specially endorsed as follows : - &#34;This officer deserves the highest credit for the constant pains he has taken to master the work in all its branches.&#34; </para>
                <para>In 1896-7 I obtained leave from the Agent-General of Queensland to accept the position of Her Majesty&#39;s Commissioners in West Africa, and I was duly appointed by the Secretary of State for the &#39;Colonies. Under this Commission I held Courts, superintended trade, and performed general administrative work in connexion with seven very large native tribes. </para>
                <para>On my return to England, having been invalided home, I was offered the Commissionership to the Shire Highlands in East Africa by Lord Salisbury, in 1898, through his Secretary, on the recommendation of the Assistant Adjutant-General for Artillery at the War Office, who knew that I had served at Aldershot with the Field and Horse Artillery, and had been well reported upon. I refused this position, and accepted a Staff appointment in Queensland under General Gunter. </para>
                <para>As regards the reasons for my appointment, I would refer you to a letter by Major-General Gunter. In this General Gunter refers to the favorable reports as regards both my character and my bearing ; and he suggested that I should be appointed an adjutant, on probation, and that I should be immediately attached to an infantry regiment at Aldershot for a period of three or four months, the confirmation of my appointment being contingent on my passing an examination before leaving England. During this period General Gunter recommended that my salary should run on. </para>
                <para>The whole of the time that I was in England going through courses of instruction to obtain the highest efficiency in the profession, so as to qualify myself for the highest positions that profession could offer, I did so at my own expense. My certificates and letters from the commanders under whom I served should show the various courses which I have undergone. </para>
                <para>I never at any time lost my commission as an officer of the Queensland Defence Forces. </para>
                <para>I would mention that in 1896, when I was appointed as a Commissioner in West Africa, that I applied for local rank of captain as all the Imperial officers who were lieutenants had been given such local rank ; and I stated at the time that I had eight years&#39; service, and passed for my captaincy. The application was refused, on account of a minute written on it by the A.A.G., who said that I had never passed the examination as stated, and that it would be most undesirable that </para>
                <para class="block">I should be given the local rank of captain. 1 then referred to General Owen&#39;s promise that my name should be kept on the unattached list, in recognition of my services, provided that the records of my service with the Imperial troops were sent in ; and I was then replaced on the unattached list. </para>
                <para>My service with the Queensland Defence Force has been continuous since 1S88. </para>
                <para>As regards my appointment to the Permanent Staff in 1S99, 1 claim that it was purely upon the ground of my merits, and in recognition of the efficiency which I had attained through undergoing the various courses of instruction in England in my capacity as- a Queensland officer. I never applied to any one for appointment except to the Commandant, and I brought no political or other influence to bear in the matter. </para>
                <para>After I received a letter from Major-General Gunter, I went to Aldershot at the request of the Queensland Defence authorities, and was attached to the 1st Royal Sussex Regiment. I passed my examinations, and was well recommended by Colonel Donne, then in command of the Royal Sussex. </para>
                <para>After this service I returned to Queensland. </para>
                <para>I would point out that it is extraordinary, if it were true, that having been &#34; found unsatisfactory &#34; after three years&#39; service in the Queensland Permanent Forces, I should have been re-appointed to the Permanent Staff at a later date. </para>
                <para>On my return to Queensland, I was sent to Charters Towers as Adjutant. I did altogether five months service in Queensland after my arrival there, then went &#39;to South Africa as Adjutant 1st Queensland Infantry Brigade. </para>
                <para>Early in the year 1900, I went with the 1st Queensland Imperial Bushmen to South Africa, as Adjutant. I was on active service in the field until I got fever, and was sent into the Field Hospital, and got leave of absence when convalescent. During my leave of absence I went to Queensland and back to recruit my health at sea. </para>
                <para>During the time I served in South Africa, I was under the command of Lt.-Col. Aytoun, and held my position as Adjutant throughout, until invalided at the beginning of September or October. </para>
                <para>Lt.-Col. Aytoun showed the confidence he had in me by putting me in charge of practically one-third of the regiment; and at the conclusion of the War he recommended me for the War Bonus as quite satisfactory, the word &#34; quite &#34; will be found in the records to be underlined in red ink. </para>
                <para>On the expiration of the sick-leave, to which I have already referred, I rejoined my Contingent, but not as Adjutant, as another officer had been appointed to that position in the meantime (Lt. Ferguson, 1st Q.I.B.). I was, however, given the command of &#34; F &#34; Squadron of the Regiment, the 1st Q.I.B. I continued on active service with the Contingent, until July, 1901, and I went to the front, and re-joined my regiment near Pietersburg, North Transvaal, within seven days of landing. </para>
                <para>I was on active service all the time, and served under Colonel Jeff ries in the North Transvaal, and General Plumer in operations around Bethel and Piet Retief. I was then appointed Provost Marshal to the column then under Colonel Gallway. </para>
                <para> I was injured near Utrecht, and was put in hospital two days before the Contingent left foi home. </para>
                <para>The General Officer Commanding at Natal cabled to Queensland to be allowed to retain my services. Leave was granted by the Premier of Queensland in July, 1901. I was attached to the Royal Field Artillery, and I served with, and commanded the 20th Battery, R.F.A. in Natal and East Transvaal. (Exhibit No. 6 in office of Minister for Defence). </para>
                <para>I was promoted by Lord Kitchener to the full rank of <inline font-weight="bold">Major, and</inline> this promotion was approved in Queensland <inline font-style="italic">(Queensland Government Gazette,</inline> 29th November, 1901). </para>
                <para>On 12th March 1902, I was peremptorily recalled from South Africa by the authorities - A.A.G., C.F. - although the Imperial Authorities were still desirous of retaining my services in South Africa. I had the offer of two appointments in South Africa, but feeling duty bound, I obeyed orders, and returned to Queensland. </para>
                <para>I was gazetted in Army Orders in South Africa as a <inline font-weight="bold">Major of</inline> the Queensland Permanent Staff, subject to the approval of the Queensland Government. This was approved, and my appointment was gazetted as <inline font-weight="bold">Major in</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Government Gazette.</inline></para>
                <para>I was appointed to the rank of <inline font-weight="bold">Major by</inline> Lord Kitchener, on the recommendation of <inline font-weight="bold">Major King,</inline> D.S.O., R.F.A., who was in command of my Battery in South Africa. </para>
                <para>I was the only officer from Australia who commanded a Battery of Royal Field Artillery. I would also refer to the fact that I know a report of a highly satisfactory nature was sent to Head-Quarters, Queensland, by General Burne-Murdoch, commanding Newcastle Subdistrict, in regard to my services. </para>
                <para>When I learnt to my surprise that I had been retrenched, I made inquiries as to all the papers and records of my career as an officer, but found that the same had been <inline font-style="italic">destroyed by an order of a Board,</inline> which sat four days before I returned from South Africa. </para>
                <para>The destruction of these documents places me at a distinct disadvantage. I have nothing to fear from any inquiries amongst the officers with whom I served. These records contained particulars of my services in England, and I was desirous of placing all the papers before the G.O.C. for his consideration. </para>
                <para>As regards my service in Australia, since my return, I would point out that I was recalled by cable on the 14th March, 1902, and came back in command of the troopship <inline font-style="italic">Custodian,</inline> having about 500 officers and men on board, whom I landed in perfect order. The troops comprised the Fifth Victorian Mounted Rifles,&#39; and details of Queenslanders. </para>
                <para>On the 5th June, 190a, I received notice of mv retrenchment in Queensland. I was informed in the letter conveying my dismissal that it was verv probable that I would be engaged in my present capacity elsewhere ; and I was asked if I were willing or otherwise to accept service in another State as adjutant. After this I was sent temporarily to New South Wales (see General Order 164^ of 1902), and I was again retrenched when the next retrenchment took place in October, 1902. </para>
                <para>Up to this time I had not received any intimation that my services were considered so unsatis-a- factory that I should not be retained as a permanent officer of the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>When I called for a statement of the reasons for my retrenchment, the same were delayed until about&#34; the 19th September, 1903. I have been for over eight months attempting to obtain satisfactory reasons, and also to receive an explanation as to why my <inline font-style="italic">documents and records of service hae. been destroyed.</inline></para>
                <para>I claim that upon my record, my services might have been retained in the Commonwealth in priority to the officers junior to myself, who have been promoted. I have spent the whole of my life qualifying myself to be an efficient officer. I have obtained my training at my own expense ; I served my Queen in active service upon the field, and fought to preserve the reputation of Australians as members of the Empire; and it seems to me unjust that after these years of service and of training I should be retrenched, and that others should be placed over my head. </para>
                <para>It is to be regretted that Major-General Hutton, after eight months careful deliberation, should have put his name to charges, which I submit, upon my records, and upon the reason&#39;s which I have given in the above letter, are not only unjust to myself, but in one instance, that is to say, the Premier of Queensland, <inline font-style="italic">unfair to a -person</inline> who was occupying a high official position in that State. </para>
                <para>Unfortunately, Major-General Hutton appears to have acted upon reports, which, in view of the facts that I have put before you, I submit are absolutely and utterly incapable of proof. 1 think that it is not fair and just to me that after so many years of self-sacrifice in the interests ot my country, my reputation should be taken away from me on mere <inline font-style="italic">ex -parte</inline> statements. </para>
                <para>I would further add that after I had been retrenched on the 23rd October, 1902, I wrote (Exhibit 10) to the Chief Staff Officer, New South Wales, as I was desirous of obtaining active service in Somaliland. I was referred to Major-General Hutton in Melbourne; but being confident that I would receive a satisfactory reply from the Department, after my many years of service in Queensland, England, and West and South Africa, I went so far as to take my steamer passage to Aden by P. and O. I came on to Melbourne, and saw Major-General Hutton, and my request to him was that he should cable at my expense to the Officer Commanding at the base at Aden,, stating that I was proceeding to Aden, and would be glad if he could attach me without pay to the column. Major-General Hutton declined to do this, stating that I could go as a civilian if I liked, and that I had been retrenched <inline font-style="italic">out of the service.</inline> He seemed to think that because I had been retrenched from the Permanent Staff, that my commission in Queensland from the King had been cancelled. </para>
                <para>I have also another complaint to make, with respect to my rank as <inline font-weight="bold">Major. I</inline> have already shown that I received the rank of <inline font-weight="bold">Major, which</inline> was not local or temporary. On reference to the Army Orders issued in South Africa, and to the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Government Gazette</inline> of the 29th November, 1901, it will be seen that I am given the. rank and title of <inline font-weight="bold">Major in</inline> the Permanent Forces of Queensland, and in G.O. 29, of 1902, on my returning to Australia. An attempt has been made to put me back to the status of a Captain; and on several occasions </para>
                <para class="block">I have complained of my treatment in this respect, viz., on the 22nd July, 1902; 31st July, 1902; and the 7th August, 1902; but failing to obtain any redress, I wrote on the 14th September, 1902, and asked that this matter should be referred, to the &#34; <inline font-style="italic">highest authority.&#34;</inline> I received a reply from the A.A.G., Colonel Mackenzie, informing me that the matter had been referred to Head-Quarters for decision, and that the <inline font-style="italic">General Officer Commanding</inline> had decided that I should be informed that my promotion was promotion only in South Africa. </para>
                <para>I was promoted to this rank in South Africa on the recommendation of my Commanding Officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Major King,</inline> K.F.A., by Lord Kitchener, acting for H.M. the King; and the promotion was confirmed in -the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Government Gazette,</inline> 29 - n - or. In G.O., 244, of 22 - 12 - 02, I am shown as an Honorary <inline font-weight="bold">Major, and</inline> bracketed with three other officers whose promotion was in each instance temporary from Queensland, or local in South Africa. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable senators will see from the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> that he has a very good case for investigation by a Select Committee. This officer is forty-three years of age, so that he is in the prime of life, and it would appear that he has had a very honorable career. He left Queensland, not, as Major-General Hutton says,- because his services had been unsatisfactory, but in order to go to England at his own&#39; expense, and endeavour to qualify himself to fill any position in the Military Forces of the Commonwealth. Having passed several examinations in different branches of defence in the old country, he returned to Queensland, from whence he volunteered, without any pressure being exercised on him, for the South African war. In South Africa he appears to have served with distinction, and his name appears in at least one of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bennett-Burleigh&#39;s</inline> despatches to the London <inline font-style="italic">Daily Chronicle.</inline> He returned to Queensland, but insisted on once more proceeding to the seat of war, although his services could have been retained in Australia. It is strikingly peculiar that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> when in South Africa on active service, received a cable instructing him to return to Queensland, and that four days before he arrived the records of his career were destroyed by order of a_ board. The destruction of the records of an officer&#39;s career is absolutely prohibited. </para>

                            <para>- I am not prepared to reply to that question. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> claims that the military authorities have attempted to take away his full rank of major and substitute that of honorary major. Another peculiarity of the case is that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> is about the only officer amongst those retrenched at the same time who is only forty-three years of age ; all the other officers, with one or two exceptions, are gentlemen who have reached the retiring age in their respective ranks, and might have been placed on the unattached list under any circumstances. At the present time <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> is under a cloud, and, after a long career of honorable service, has no possible chance of obtaining employment, unless an inquiry be held. </para>

Speaking generally, honorable senators have no knowledge of military procedure, practice, or etiquette, questions relating to which will be involved in the inquiry proposed. I suggest that my name be withdrawn in favour of the name of some honorable senator who has had military experience, such as Lt.-Col. Gould or <inline font-weight="bold">Major Drake,</inline> whose presence would, perhaps, save the Committee from making mistakes. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that, in the time of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir&#39; John</inline> Forrest as Minister of Defence, this matter did not receive any strict departmental scrutiny, and,&#39; later on, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> when Minister, did not consider it worthy of attention. My predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman,</inline> held a Departmental Inquiry, which was, .however, unsatisfactory to both the General Officer Commanding and <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> The result of the Departmental Inquiry was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman</inline> wrote a minute - which I have here, and which any honorable senator may see - to the effect that the reasons given for the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> were not the proper reasons - that it was on account of retrenchment that the officer was retired. In that minute <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman</inline> . pointed out that he absolved <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> from any aspersions on his character as a good and efficient officer, stating, as I say, that it was on the score of retrenchment only that he was retired. If the General Officer Commanding, on the other hand, said that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was a good and efficient officer, who therefore should never have been retired, why was it that the Department retained the services of junior officers, who had not seen so much active service, and had not worked so meritoriously on the battle-field? The position now is that, not only <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> but- also the General Officer Commanding, desire an inquiry, the latter in order to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was retired because he was not a good officer. The Department is in a happy position, in so far that both disputants desire an inquiry; and, therefore, I see no reason why the proposed Select Committee should not be appointed. </para>

                        <para>- Having heard the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> coupled with that of the Minister of Defence, it appears to me evident that this is a case in which inquiry should be made into the whole of the surrounding circumstances, with a view to justice being done. If <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> statement is correct, he has evidently been dealt with very harshly and unfairly ; and if a Select Committee were to arrive at a similar conclusion, I have no doubt the Government of the day would take steps to repair the injury done to this gentleman. If, on the other hand, it be found that statements adverse to his efficiency are correct, we shall at any rate have the satisfaction of knowing that the whole subject has been inquired into, and possibly it will be allowed to rest there. My experience in regard to Select Committees is this - that where a man can show a good <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> reason for an inquiry into any complaint he may have in regard to the way in which he has been -.treated by a Government or by any officers, an inquiry should at once&#39; be made into his case. It is above all things essential that whatever steps are taken by a Government in dealing with their officers, those steps should be abundantly justified, and should be of such a character that) when the fullest light of day is let in the public are satisfied that no mistake has been made, either intentionally or otherwise. I notice frequently that when, unfortunately, officers are retrenched from the Public Service, an uneasy feeling gets abroad, owing to statements made by themselves, that they have not been properly dealt with. </para>

                            <para>- In some cases there is a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> reason for the complaint. I think that in this instance a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case has been made out. I may add that the matter was mentioned to me last session. From the <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement then made, it seemed to me that there was a good case for inquiry. I should be happy to sit upon the Committee, except that I feel my time is so much occupied at present that it would be impossible for &#39;me to give proper attention to the sittings. That being the case, I thought that the proper course for me to pursue was to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> not to nominate me, in order that he might substitute another honorable senator, who could give proper attention to the matter. I do not think that it is a matter of great moment in a Committee of this nature to appoint senators who have had military experience. The object is to inquire into the circumstances attendant on <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> dismissal, and not to say whether he was or was not an efficient officer. The Committee will inquire into the records. </para>

                            <para>- I very much regret that it is not possible to have a military inquiry, and to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion in that way, because there are obvious disadvantages in having matters of this kind inquired into by a Parliamentary Committee. I do not know whether there is any probability of a successful result from an inquiry by the Select Committee nominated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs.</inline> There is only one other aspect of the matter to which <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> think it right to refer, because it rather reflects on the- military management in Queensland. That is in regard to what is called the destruction of papers. When the case first came to my knowledge it appeared to me from the way in which it was put that there was an implied charge that when <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was on his way back to Australia, and two or three days before he arrived, some important papers were destroyed, in order to prejudice his case. The statement made just now. by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> bears the same inference. That matter, however, was inquired into, and the report that came to hand was, to my mind, satisfactory. It was to the effect that a Board had been constituted according to the King&#39;s Regulations for the periodical examination and destruction of unnecessary papers in the office. That Board sat. Numerous papers were examined, and they were noted and destroyed. The report stated that there were only two or three papers - I am speaking from memory - relating in any way to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> and that the destruction of those papers could not have in any way injuriously affected him. I do not know whether the report was made while I was Minister, or while my predecessor was in office. </para>

It seems to me that in this case there has been a miscarriage of justice. I hold in my hand a document which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has lent to me, and from which it appears that, after some repeated demands for reasons for his retrenchment, Major-General Hutton told <inline font-weight="bold">Major.

                        <para>- If the Government is satisfied that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> character has been cleared, why are they not taking action at once? Why wait for a Select Committee to be appointed ? It seems to me that the whole of this matter is rather more serious than a demand for inquiry into the case put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs.</inline> I should like to say before going further that it appears that there is a growing tendency on the part of every individual who has been dismissed from any public appointment, to conceive himself to be the subject of an injustice, and to appeal to Parliament. There is also a growing tendency on the part of Parliament to turn a too-ready ear to cases of this kind. I do not say that about this case, but I do want, with all respect, to suggest that Parliament does not require to do anything to extend the practice to which I have referred - at any rate if it desires to maintain discipline, not merely in the Military Forces, but in all the public Departments. </para>

                            <para>- I construe the facts in that way. Here is an admission by the Minister of Defence that, as the result of a departmental inquiry, the accusations against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> are proved to be wrong, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> is proved to be right. Any man in a position of Ministerial responsibility who, knowing that there is any one suffering injustice, and that it is within his power to put it right, refrains from taking action to do so, is entitled to all the rebuke that can be heaped upon him. I object, as a matter of principle, to making Parliament pretend to do things, and I say that this is a pretence from beginning to end. </para>

                            <para>- That brings me back to this point : Has every dismissed officer a prescriptive right to have his case inquired into by a Committee of Parliament? If the Minister is going to hold out to every officer that he can come here and have a&#39; Committee appointed, we can say good-bye to discipline altogether. It will be a very serious matter if Parliament itself is- going to encourage that idea. I draw attention to this curious fact : Honorable senators opposite were strong advocates of military retrenchment when the Estimates were before Parliament. At the instance of their party in another place, a resolution, was passed in favour of a curtailment of the military estimates. It was laid down that the criticisms were directed, not against the citizen soldiery, but against officers with gold lace and clanking swords. But the moment the General Officer Commanding gives- effect to that direction, and dismisses one of the officers - that dismissal being approved of by the Government of the day - honorable senators opposite, and their party, turn round and attack the General Officer Commanding for what he has done. </para>

                            <para>- What is the Department and what is the Minister for? They draw salaries, and we have a right to expect that the work for which they are paid shall be carried out. I know that the amount paid to them&#39; is quite insufficient ; but still we have a right to expect that the services shall be rendered. The Department and the Minister are there to see that the work is properly done.- Instead of doing that, what does the Minister say ? He says - &#34; Here is a wrong ; Parliament must be brought to the rescue, .and set it right; I am incompetent to do so.&#34; It means that the Defence Department is incompetent to decide whether an officer has been rightly dismissed or not, and has to fall back on Parliament to tell the Department what to do. It must be remembered that three Ministers of Defence have dealt with this matter. </para>

If it is suggested that there has been any want of fairness shown by the &#39;Government in not taking certain action after the departmental inquiry was found to have exonerated <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> the blame for that attaches to the last Government. </para>

I repeat that very serious criticism would have been passed on the present, or any other Ministry if, a few hours after assuming office, they took so serious a step against the General Officer Commanding as to pass what would be a severe condemnation on him, by reinstating <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> If we are to believe the evidence which has been submitted to us by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> Major-General Hutton has stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carsoli</inline> proved so unsatisfactory an officer that fee was not fit to remain in the force. In view of the statement made by the present Minister of Defence, that the General Officer Commanding is not satisfied with the ending of the Departmental Committee, ind wishes for the appointment of the Select Committee now proposed, -it must be patent that he believes he can prove that he was right in the action he took. He would not otherwise be anxious - for the appointment of this Select Committee. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> also asks for the inquiry, and, on the evidence submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> if true, he appears to have a good case. If it is not true the Committee will find that out. </para>

But we do not require superfluous inquiries when there are other means of entering into the consideration of the matters in issue which should first be adopted before resort is had to Parliament, which should be the last, and not the first, resort. In these cases, in the first instance, resort should be had to the proper means of redress controlled by the responsible heads of Departments. If the Minister of Defence does not intend to be bound by the departmental inquiry in this case, can he not institute another departmental inquiry ? If the Minister should shrink from doing that- </para>

                            <para>- Whether he be a witness or not, the General Officer Commanding will undoubtedly be a party in this case, because the whole question is as to the truth or otherwise of the reasons assigned by him for the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> This was a matter entirely for the Department in the first instance, and to blame the last Minister of Defence for not having dealt with it, and, at the same time, to excuse&#39; the present Minister for not dealing with it, and for shunting it on to the Senate, seems to me to be most illogical. From what we have heard, the last Minister of Defence instituted a departmental inquiry, and a report was presented. I contend that if the successor of the last Minister of Defence declines to be bound by the finding of the departmental inquiry, there is only one course open to him, and that is of his own motion to institute another departmental inquiry. </para>

                            <para>- We should not be asked to appoint a Select Committee until that has been done. If the Minister declines to be bound by the finding of the departmental inquiry, what will be the position of the General Officer Commanding? What will be his position in connexion with the proposed Select Committee, which, it is said, he desires to have appointed ? Does he accept the finding of the departmental inquiry to the extent that th&#34; reasons he alleged were not the correct reasons, and say now that he is prepared to go further, and give other reasons, which he did not allege in the first instance? If he does, will a consideration of those reasons be &#39;within the scope of the functions of the proposed Select Committee ? Suppose- the General Officer Commanding should say - &#34; So far as the departmental inquiry goes I am prepared to admit that the reasons I alleged for the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> were not the correct reasons, but despite that I am prepared to justify ray action by showing that for other reasons which I did not then allege he should have been retired.&#34; Where will the Select Committee be then ? This will show that the inquiry should proceed on proper lines, and under the control of the responsible heads of the Defence Department. We have not had during the debate the slightest &#39; suggestion that if the reasons alleged by the General Officer Commanding for the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> are not the correct reasons he still has other reasons by which he is prepared to stand or fall in justifying the action he took. If the General Officer Commanding should take up that attitude, I venture to think that under the terms of the motion it will be difficult for the Select Committee to know where they are. The Committee is to be appointed to inquire only - and to inquire as to what? And to report - report, if at all, to whom? </para>

                        <para>. - I desire, as shortly as I can, to put the position from the point of view of the Government. I wish, if possible, to shorten the debate, because if we intend to appoint a Select Committee we should do it as expeditiously as we can. On the evidence submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> every honorable senator must admit that something ought &#39; to be done to clear this matter up. Now, with respect to the position of the Government, ito is not the question whether the General Officer Commanding has been telling the truth or otherwise in the charges alleged against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> that concerns the Government. We have just recently come into office, I might say under peculiar circumstances. The departmental inquiry was instituted by the previous Administration, and those appointed to make the inquiry had actually reported. </para>

                            <para>- The previous Government might not have had time or inclination to take action. Another Government is suddenly placed in their position, something occurs, and would it not be an act of discourtesy to the previous Government if the present Government suddenly took a step which their predecessors failed to take, either -from want of time or want of inclination? That is the position in which we find ourselves. As the matter has now been brought up by a private member of the Senate, I think it is fair that the proposed Select Committee should be appointed. There should have been no reason to ask whom the Committee would report to. The Committee will report to the Senate, and the public will be made aware of the true position of affairs. Then either the Government, the General Officer Commanding, or <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> must take the consequences- If the report of the Select Committee is adverse to the Government, they must face Parliament on that account. If it is adverse to the General Officer Commanding, he has to bear the consequences; and, in the same manner, if the report is against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> he must do the same thing. In all the circumstances I think that further argument is unnecessary. I am sure that honorable senators desire that justice shall be done to everybody. The suggestion that every trumpery case may be brought before the Senate or the House of Representatives on a motion for the appointment of a Select Committee is only the introduction of a red herring. No matter what case is brought before either House of the Federal Parliament, it will be dealt with on its merits. If honorable senators think that there is nothing in the case submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> let them refuse to appoint the Select Committee asked for. If, on the other hand, they believe that there is anything connected with it which justifies an inquiry, they will appoint the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- I quite sympathize with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in his view of the question before the Senate. This Chamber ought to be very cautious in granting Committees of Inquiry for the purpose of dealing with the grievances of public officers. The Commonwealth has only just commenced its career, but there is already a considerable staff in all the Departments, and as the business grows in magnitude, that staff must increase. But there has been taken some precaution to provide means&#39; by which disputes&#39; inside the Departments may be adjusted - by which difficulties, or seeming injustices, may be remedied. </para>

                            <para>- In the Military Department it is all important that complete discipline should be preserved, and that Parliament should always have at its disposal a Ministry with the capacity and courage to take the responsibility of assuring themselves that justice is being done, or of themselves doing justice. The other day the Minister, very wisely I think, showed his strong feeling on the point, when he questioned the propriety of a soldier saying anything in Parliament with reference to the practices or actions of military officers, either superior or inferior. The Minister of Defence took that view on the ground that by such utterances, discipline <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> imperilled. . </para>

                            <para>- It has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that the departmental report on this case was submitted not many minutes or hours before the retirement of the late Government; that, however, does not seem to affect the question. If the late Government had not time to deal with the matter, they are not to blame, but if they had no inclination to do what ought to have been done, they are to be blamed. The late Government, however, have gone ; and if they had not, the Government who succeed them ought to have, the proper inclination. I am dealing now with the argument which has been presented; but I urge on the Senate that there does not appear to me any justification for the appointment of a Select Committee. </para>

I do not want to cavil, because I recognise that the present Government have had very little opportunity of knowing much of any of the Departments. The Government have only been a very little time in power, and all who have any experience of the Ministerial position, know that it takes some time to become acquainted with all the circumstances of a huge Department like that of Defence.&#34; I am trying, however, .to urge that we ought not to appoint this Committee on any evidence that .has been presented to us, owing to the danger of establishing a precedent in the case of any or every dismissed or suspended officer. Now that this matter has been discussed, I have every confidence, whether the Committee be appointed or not, that the Government will inquire and satisfy themselves, and that the </para>

                            <para>- No doubt the Minister would prefer the line of least resistance - the line of the greatest convenience. But, after all, we have a Government and Ministers in whom we have confidence, and whom we expect to take, not necessarily the- most convenient, but the most appropriate and proper course. This is, no doubt, a difficult and delicate question, but it is one with which Ministers ought to deal, and with which the Senate should not attempt to interfere until dissatisfied with Ministerial action. </para>

On the present occasion, however, the honorable senator has omitted one very important fact, which was only casually elicited subsequently. That was the important fact that the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> has already been the subject of a departmental inquiry. On that point, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> never uttered a word, although, as I say, it is most important that honorable senators should be aware of the circumstances. Then, again, we ought to have before us the report which resulted from that departmental inquiry. We have heard that that report stated that the reasons given by Major-General Hutton were not the correct reasons for what, perhaps, I ought not to call a&#39; dismissal, but the removal of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> from the active list. </para>

                            <para>- So far as I know, this is the first time I have heard anything of the case. The papers of the Defence Department were not likely to come before me. except some questions were asked in the Senate. The Minister of Defence ought, certainly, to have been prepared with a very clear and explicit statement of the facts of the case. It would be a great mistake for members of the Senate to take out of the hands of the Executive work which the latter ought to perform; such a step- ought not to be taken in the absence of a very good cause. What are the members of the Executive for but to administer the different Departments, and see that justice is done amongst all the public servants, civil and military ? In no case ought the Government to shelter themselves behind a Select Committee in regard to matters which they are specially called upon to administer. There is no justification for the Government referring this question to a. Select Committee - shunting this particular work on to members of the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- I should imagine that the Minister1 of Defence is prepared to look into the question, and impartially and fairly come to a conclusion as to the proper course under the circumstances, and that he will take the responsibility of giving effect to his decision. Select Committees certainly ought not to be appointed for the purpose of inquiring into little departmental troubles and squabbles. I know nothing about the merits of this case; I only know that such cases are not those in which members of the Senate should be asked to practically do the work of the Government. No doubt important questions may arise, on which Parliament, be fore coming to a decision desires to have before it the result of exhaustive inquiries by Select Committees ; but such cases do not include those of a purely departmental and executive character. Under the circumstances, I hope that the Government will ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> to withdraw his motion, and allow the Government to look into the question. If that be done, I feel confident that the Government will do what is right and proper, and that we shall hear no more of the case. </para>

                        <para>- I entirely agree with the remarks of Senators Trenwith and Playford. If every little departmental grievance is to be brought before the Senate, we shall be in session from one year&#39;s end to the other; we shall have to be a Government, instead of a Senate called to perform parliamentary duties. The Minister ought to assume responsibility, and if he acts wisely and fairly, he will get credit for his administration. Unless the Minister is prepared to assume responsibility, it will show that he has not the courage to do the right thing, even when he knows what the right thing is ; and it is tomfoolery to shift Ministerial responsibilities on to honorable senators or members of another place. I hope that, in any case, the papers to which reference has been made will be laid on the table, so that honorable senators may peruse them before deciding as to the appointment of a Select Committee. Surely &#34;we are entitled to have from the Government the report issued in connexion with the departmental inquiry. </para>

                            <para>- But if the Government encourage or acquiesce in a motion for a Select Committee, then, to all intents and purposes, the Government are responsible. The Government ought to put their backs up at the proper time, and not shirk responsibility. I am speaking emphatically, because I feel, emphatically that the Minister would do himself credit by taking responsibility. I disagree with the proposal to appoint a Select Committee on the <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of any honorable senator or senators. </para>

We should then be able to judge whether a Select Committee is really required. If inquiry proves that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> . has been badly treated, no doubt the Government will take the responsibility of seeing that justice is done. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS</inline>(Queensland). - I have no predilection for Select Committees, and I am sure that no honorable senator, after an experience of one or two of them, would have any great desire to serve on them. I think that that stands to the credit of those honorable members who are willing to serve on this Select Committee; it stands to my credit in this respect, that we must see that a very great injustice has been done to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> before he would ask for the appointment of a Select Committee. Senators Keating, Playford, and Trenwith have dwelt on the necessity for any Government to take responsibility. The last thing, they say, that a Government should do is to shelter itself behind the <inline font-style="italic">cegis</inline> of a Select Committee ; they should inquire, and, if an injustice has been done, see that the officer injured is recompensed or reinstated. It is very singular that these honorable senators happened to be strong supporters of the last Government. </para>

                    <para>When retrenchment was in contemplation, the merits of officers concerned were taken into careful consideration by the then Minister of Defence, in conjunction with the General Officer Commanding ; and T think a bad precedent would be created bv re-considering what was then done. </para>
                    <para> No doubt there were many officers who felt themselves aggrieved by the decisions then arrived at - that is a feeling which naturally and inevitably accompanies all retrenchment; but opinions of this kind cannot in any way override the action of constitutional authority, or deprive the conclusions arrived at of that finality which is essential to the successful control of the Military Forces. </para>
                    <para>Unfortunately, on all such occasions, it becomes the painful duty of a Department to sacrifice the services of some competent officer ; and it is not necessary that charges of want of competence should be brought against those who suffer in the process of retrenchment. </para>
                    <para>With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> complaint, that he has been for over eight months attempting to obtain satisfactory reasons, and also to receive an explanation as to why documents and records of service had been destroyed, I find that on 1/9/03 he was informed that only three papers in connexion with him were destroyed, and that none of these constitute records of service. </para>
                    <para>As regards his claim to promotion, he has been dealt with similarly to other officers serving &#39;in South Africa, by his rank being confirmed as honorary rank in &#34;the Military Forces of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>After a careful consideration of the papers, it appears to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> rendered good service in South Africa; that he is a good and zealous officer, and that no imputation of any kind rests on his character. But, unfortunately, the necessity for economy in military expenditure remains ; and where further expenditure takes place it should not, in my opinion, be directed to an increase in officers and men so much as to a more substantial addition of arms and equipments. </para>

I ask honorable senators to contrast his statement that there is no stain on the character of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> that, in his opinion, he rendered good service in South Africa, and is a good and efficient officer, with the statement of Major-General Hutton that he dismissed <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> because he was found unsatisfactory in Queensland, because he used political influence with the Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hugh</inline> Nelson, and because he was found unsatisfactory in South Africa. Surely the difference between those statements must convince the Senate that an inquiry by a Select Committee is necessary. I think that the action of the present Government can be. defended in every way. Why should they be expected on any ground to institute another departmental inquiry? That would be a reflection on their predecessors, and a reflection, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman</inline> says in his minute, on the General Officer Commanding. </para>

Not merely to see that justice is done to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> but to show the public whether our military system of discipline will bear the light of day. The great objection which I have to the proceedings of our Select Committees is that they are not published until the Committees report to the Senate. We take a volume of evidence. That evidence is bound together, and covers very many pages. But nobody will then take the trouble to read it. </para>

                    <para>- The mover of the motion seems to me to have overlooked entirely the principal point to which he should have addressed himself. The arguments he has adduced might have been excellent for the repeal of the standing order. But his motion requires a suspension of that standing order, and he has given no argument to show why we should take a different course in this case than we took with regard to other Select Committees. It is easy to point out that there are reasons why the standing order should not be suspended. The present matter is largely personal. I regret very much&#34; to have to make the statement which&#39; I am now making - that certain of the members of the Committee are, as is shown by their own arguments, avowed partisans. </para>

Is he not a partisan? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> himself will be the last to dispute it. Coming back to my point, it appears to me that this inquiry will be largely coloured by personal feelings. Personal matters must arise. It is entirely desirable that in such a case the press should be excluded. The accurate report of what takes place will be brought before the Senate, together with the recommendations of the Committee, and it is not at all desirable that the press should be in a position to give from day to day misleading accounts of what takes place - misleading because they are curtailed. It is, further, undesirable that the press should give <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statements at particular times. It is desirable that, in the interests of persons affected by the inquiry, there should be no publicity until the whole of the evidence and the report of the Committee come before the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- The beaten track, from the honorable senator&#39;s point of view, is the wallaby track, and I left that a long time ago. I quite admit that it is inadvisable for the press to be admitted to some of our Select Committees. That is the reason why we provide in the Standing Orders that the press shall not be permitted to attend a Select Committee unless with the express, consent of the Senate. If the surroundings of the case to be inquired into by any particular Select Committee are such that publicity should not be given to them, the press should not be admitted. In this instance my opinion is as follows : - The case of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> has received a great amount of publicity. I am not now speaking as a Minister ; I am speaking as a private senator. I wish that to be clearly understood. Seeing that we have agreed to appoint this Committee, and that there are two parties to the dispute, it would not, I think, prejudice either party if the press were admitted. If, however, honorable senators can show good and substantial reasons for excluding the press, I shall be glad to hear them. </para>

                    <para>- There is one point to which I would particularly draw attention in connexion with this demand for the admission of the press. I voted for the appointment of the Committee, and shall vote against this motion. It is quite clear that I am not in any way antagonistic to the inquiry. But let me&#39; point out that we have a standing order which protects witnesses in regard to anything they say. Is that standing order to be suspended also? If so, it might be an inducement to take from slanderous witnesses the protection which the present standing order gives to them, and I might be willing to vote for the motion. But not otherwise. A trial in the Law Courts goes on from day to day, and the falsehood of to-day may be corrected by. the truth of to-morrow. But a Select Committee may sit at wide intervals. Perhaps a week or more, may elapse between two -meetings. The most serious injustice may be done to one side or the other in consequence of the statements of witnesses being published, and the answers to their statements riot being forthcoming for a long time. Unfortunately, the Senate did not pass a Bill which I introduced last session for the purpose of having evidence given on oath. Consequently, the most &#39;serious statements may be made by a malicious witness giving evidence under the protection of privilege ; and there is no chance of answering them the next day as is the case in the Law Courts. The person who is maligned may have to wait weeks, or even months. </para>

The President is the guardian of the rules of the Senate, and I have been pleased on previous occasions to note the way in which he has discouraged too great readiness to suspend the Standing Orders. Next to the President, I think, that the representatives of the Government in the Senate should most zealously guard against any unnecessary suspension of the Standing Orders. </para>

On the other hand, I may, perhaps, be considered too great a stickler for the observance of conservative rules which I think necessary for the proper conduct of the business of a Legislative Assembly. We have agreed to the appointment of the Select Committee in order to do justice to a man who, on the <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case submitted, appears to have suffered injustice. We have not heard the other side yet, and what we are &#39;asked to do now is to depute our functions to the public, and invite them to express an opinion on a case half heard. </para>

                        <para>- It is proposed that we should make a special exception in this case, but once such a motion is carried on personal grounds, other people may from time to time claim the same right from the Senate, and ultimately all matters referred to . a Select Committee will be reported upon daily by the press. The proper procedure, it seems to me, is that the members of the Select Committee shall listen to the evidence submitted to them, carefully digest it, and then give us their report. The report will then be available to the press, as a complete report, and the public will be able, at the same time, to read the case for both sides. I was surprised to hear the references to &#34; Star Chamber &#34; by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs.</inline> There is no &#34; Star Chamber &#34; or secrecy proposed, but only a temporary withholding of the evidence until the whole of the case is submitted. I have been surprised at the readiness of Ministers and members of their party to admit the press to the proceedings of Select Committees, when we know that no persons have taken greater exception to the press on the ground of bias. </para>

I am sure that he did not mean what was implied by his words, because, although he may think certain members of the Select Committee are biased, I feel sure he believes that they will do justice in the matter. I think that the reason he gave is a reason why the proceedings should be published, in order that the public may be made aware that the inquiry is conducted in an unbiased manner. </para>

                    <para>- I may add my request to that of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> will withdraw his motion. I was one of those who supported the appointment of the Committee, because I thought that a just demand was being made upon the Senate. If we have Standing Orders we should abide by them, and they should not be suspended unless the circumstances are peculiar and exceptional. I am aware of no circumstances of a special character in connexion with this case which justifies the suspension of the Standing Orders in order to allow the press to be present at the proceedings of the Select Committee. The safe rule to follow is to adhere to the Standing Orders as much as we possibly can. I need not add to the arguments already adduced to show the undesirability of allowing reports of the proceedings of a Select Committee to be published from day to day. The representatives of the press would not necessarily report everything that was said ; but would perhaps prefer1 to report tit-bits of evidence that might be specially interesting. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to know in what way the Vice-President of the Executive Council proposes to deal with this clause. Honorable senators have different views as to the site which should be selected for the Federal Capital, and we do not desire to get into a difficulty, and be unable to decide on a particular site. If the honorable senator has no other plan to propose, I suggest to him that we should adopt the course which was followed by the House of Representatives in the last Parliament, by having sites submitted and an exhaustive ballot taken. </para>

                        <para>.- If there are half-a-dozen different sites proposed they can be ballotted for, the site receiving the fewest votes being thrown out, and the others submitted to the ballot again. That was the course adopted in the last Parliament to determine by a majority which site should be selected. Honorable senators would then have an opportunity of proposing any site which they preferred, and the public would know, as they have a right to know, how the votes of honorable senators had been cast. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and other honorable senators last night pointed out the difficulty that the Senate is in when dealing with a clause containing a blank. It may be remembered that when a similar Bill was last introduced in the Senate it contained the name of a certain site which had been agreed to in another place by a kind of exhaustive ballot. I made inquiries this morning as to the course pursued, and the President informed me, just as the Chairman of Committees has stated, that it is not in our power, under the Standing Orders, to adopt an exhaustive ballot. To adopt any method outside that contemplated by the Standing Orders would have necessitated notice of the intention to be given some time ago. That would have caused great delay, which, of course, is not desired, and I have every confidence that honorable senators will select some site by an absolute majority.- </para>

                    <para>- As the President- has pointed out, we cannot adopt any extraordinary method unless we over-ride our Standing Orders, which, in themselves, -provide means for their suspension. It seems to me that it would be wise to adopt some other plan than that of submitting a number of sites in rotation, because the latter would not enable us to arrive at the decision we desire. It would be wise, I think, to suspend our Standing Orders. leaving ourselves free to adopt any course we like. We want greater freedom than our Standing Orders provide. The method which we must adopt under the Standing Orders would land us in chaos, and would certainly not give us the clear mind of the Committee. First, we ought to have a discussion as untrammelled as possible, bearing in view the enormous area over which our minds must range. Having had that discussion on the sites, which, so to speak, are &#34; in the running,&#34; there ought to be some means by which each senator can express his special preference ; and then, if need be, there can be a weeding out such as is afforded by an exhaustive ballot. I suggest that we go on with the discussion for some time, and then have the Standing Orders suspended for the purpose of filling up the blank. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>GOULD (New South Wales). - There is no doubt of the correctness of the opinion expressed by the Chairman, and, I understand, earlier by the President, as to the Standing Orders. But in another place honorable members were confronted with a similar difficulty, and, instead of dealing with the Bill in Committee, they suspended the Standing Orders, and allowed a ballot to be taken in regard to the various sites suggested as suitable. The sites were weeded out until the House arrived at a conclusion, and the name df. that site was inserted in the blank when the Bill went into Committee. I suggest that that is the better course to pursue. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> suggests that he should be allowed to induce the Committee, if he can, to affirm that the Capital site shall be in Southern Monaro ; but which of the three sites would he select? </para>

I would, therefore, urge Senators McGregor and Pearce to assent to a proposition to take a radius of fifty miles from any one centre, and then suspend the Standing Orders in order to get an exhaustive ballot; and whatever place is adopted will be named in&#39; the Bill, and will, I presume, be passed by the Senate as an expression of opinion of the majority of honorable senators brought about in that particular way. </para>

                        <para>- This is not a Bill for fixing the Federal territory, but for fixing the Seat of Government, and, according to the Constitution, the Seat of Government must be within an area granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth. I have always been much in favour of a greatly extended ar,ea; but the Bill provides for an area of 900 square miles, or probably as much more as may be decided on, or as we, after negotiation, can obtain from New South Wales. I do not think it would be within the scope of the Bill to decide on the territory, but it is within its scope to fix the place for the Seat of Government. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> that if a radius of twenty-five miles from the locality does not answer, we have a right to increase the distance to thirty or forty or fifty miles. But I do not see how we as a Government can go for the selection of a territory in a Seat of Government Bill. </para>

When they decline to accede to a request of that kind it will be time enough for us to take steps for compulsory acquisition.

I do not think that there will be any difficulty in getting an absolute majority in favour of a certain site. </para>

                    <para>- The motto of the Prime Minister, &#34; One step at a time,&#34; is a very safe one. The Committee should not attempt to do too much bv this Bill. If there is a complicated question to be dealt with, and it is not known how the decision is likely to go. probably the use of the exhaustive ballot is the only way of getting a settlement. But if, as many of us believe, a majority of the Senate favour Southern Monaro, we need not waste time in taking an exhaustive ballot, because if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> moves his amendment, it will be opposed by the supporters of every other site ; and, if in spite of that opposition his amendment is carried, it will go without saying that a majority of the Senate are in favour of Southern Monaro. I presume that we all wish to adopt such a procedure as will give every locality a fair chance of being considered. I hope that no honorable senator will try to separate the sites in Southern Monaro, just as I should not try to separate the five sites in Tumut. If the Seat of Government is to go to the Tumut district, let it be understood that it is to go to the best place in that district. If, on the other hand, Southern Monaro is preferred, let it be understood that the best site in that district is to be chosen. I am inclined to think that the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is better than the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould.</inline></para>

                        <para>- If the words &#34; Southern Monaro &#34; are inserted, and the Bill is passed, it ought to be the duty of the Government, I think, to employ the services of skilled engineers&#39; and inspectors to thoroughly survey the locality. I take it that that important commission, whose duty will be to recommend to the Parliament the exact locality, ought to consist of one engineer or surveyor from each State, if it is only to shut the mouth of that State and to let its citizens know that one of their officers, chosen by their own Government, had his say in recommending the exact locality which should be selected. It is necessary to proceed in this careful way because the negotiations with New South Wales for an area must be based on a proper survey. In the. preparation of a deed a plan is the most important part of the document. A proper plan, with a couple of lines, is of more use than a deed stretching from Melbourne to San Francisco, without a proper plan. I take it that the Senate ought to be asked to do nothing more than indicate the locality. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> now begins to see that much negotiation will have to take place between the Commonwealth and New South Wales as to the area of land which we can legally take, the area which we wish to take outside that legal area, and the terms, if any, on which they are prepared to give us that extra land. </para>

To my mind, the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is a fair one, because there are two other districts in competition with Southern Monaro. If there is a majority in favour of his proposal, and it is carried, the matter will be settled, so far as the Senate is concerned. It will then be for the Government, when the district is selected by the Parliament, to approach the Government of New South Wales, and to arrange the matter in a way which will be satisfactory to the Commonwealth. If there is a majority here in favour of one district, why delay the settlement of the matter? I have made up my mind as to what district I shall vote for, and therefore I am against resorting to an exhaustive ballot. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MULCAHY</inline>(Tasmania)&#39;. - The desire of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is that we shall select a site in Southern Monaro. I am quite in accord with him in his proposal to enlarge the area of selection. If his assumption that there is a majority in favour of Southern Monaro be correct, the joint efforts of those who favour the selection of other districts would not be sufficient to defeat his amendment. But if that proposal be defeated, we might exclude the Monaro site, while as a contingency many honorable senators would vote for the selection of that site in preference to one of the &#39; other two. This reminds- me of a three-cornered election, in which exactly the same result may happen. </para>
                <para class="block">I do not know whether I am in order in suggesting such a course, but it seems to me that some such practice as is generally followed when a President is elected, with a view of bringing about unanimity of opinion, might be adopted in this case. What we want is to select a site which will be supported by a majority of the Senate. Unfortunately, the machinery of the Standing Orders is not efficient for that purpose. Therefore, we should suspend the Standing Orders, and adopt some such method as the exhaustive ballot. </para>

                    <para>- I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would have any objection to the adoption of the exhaustive ballot system, provided that the three principal areas are balloted for. By adopting the method suggested by. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> it appears to me that a site which is npt favoured by the majority of the Senate may be chosen. Although there are more Senators in favour of Bombala than any other site, Bombala might be blocked out under this method. Suppose there were eight senators for Lyndhurst, eight for Tumut, and fifteen for Bombala. The two eights, by combining, might &#34;knock out&#34; Bombala on the first vote, and then the Bombala advocates would have to vote either for Tumut or Lyndhurst. That would not be satisfactory. I think that an open exhaustive ballot is the better course to adopt. </para>

                <para class="block">That would include the whole of the sites recommended in the Monaro district. It would also include the watershed of all the Monaro&#39; sites. The watershed area of the Dalgety site extends a great deal further than fifty miles from Bombala. It extends more than fifty miles from Delegate, because the Dalgety site is on the western side of Dalgety itself, and the watershed area runs right back to the ranges. My proposal would secure a true expression of the opinion of the Committee as to whether the site should be in the Monaro district or in one of the other districts. After we have taken, the vote on this proposal we can indicate in what portion of the district the Seat of Government shall &#39; be. But if we have an exhaustive ballot, and insert a word where the blank now stands in the &#39;Bill, we shall have this peculiar result - that the Southern Monaro advocates will be divided by three, and the Lyndhurst and Tumut advocates will be divided by two. I do not wish the Monaro advocates to be divided by three, but I am quite willing to give the others a chance of multiplying themselves by two. Therefore, the Lyndhurst and Tumut advocates have nothing to complain of. We should define the district in which the site is to be located in geographical terms that will stand investigation. I find that in the opinion of some people the boundaries of the Southern Monaro district run right up towards Tumut. By inserting the delineation which I propose there will be an exact determination of the opinion of the Committee. </para>

Personalty, I am an advocate of the Tumut site. I might vote for Dalgety as a second choice. We should have an exhaustive ballot, as they had ir&#62; the House of Representatives last session. There is absolutely nothing unfair in adopting that course, as every honorable senator will have an opportunity of .voting for the site which, in his opinion, is the best. </para>

Owen, is also in favour of Dalgety, as is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener,</inline> a surveyor of considerable eminence. I said last year, and now repeat, that one of the most essential features required is a good water supply, and to my mind the Snowy River affords the best water supply to be found in Australia. </para>

                    <para>Viewed from the standard of the factors set forth in paragraph 3, the Dalgety site, in my opinion, fulfils the qualifications to a larger and fuller extent than any other site in the Southern Monaro or Tumut districts. It surpasses all of them under the four headings (b, <inline font-style="italic">e, f</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">i),</inline> and under no factor is it inferior to any of the others. It has also by far the best water supply, and is the most picturesque of all the sites examined. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Lt.-Col. Owen says that the Dalgety site is the best, and that the water supply has 100,000 horse-power available for electricity. That is one of the most valuable assets the Commonwealth could have, and one which we should avail ourselves of as soon as possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> says that the water supply of Dalgety is 8,000,000 gallons per day. It may be easily increased, and will be provided by gravitation through a thirteen-mile tube. If this method is not adopted, a small pumping scheme will be required, which he recommends, because the pumping can be done economically by electricity. As to the climate, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest reports that it is splendid. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> says that the range of mountains to the north of the Snowy River affords protection from the westerly winds, and for that reason he prefers the Dalgety site to the Bombala site. Lt.-Col. Owen reports that Dalgety is the best sheltered of all the sites he inspected in the Monaro district. </para>

                        <para>- No; he has said that he was not long enough there to be able to speak definitely with respect to the climate. Last season we had before us a report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maiden,</inline> the Curator of the Botanical Gardens at Sydney, and that gentleman is of opinion that all plants, shrubs, and flowers usually grown in temperate climates can be grown easily and profitably at Bombala or Dalgety. One honorable senator has said that Dalgety is very bleak, but that can easily be remedied, as one of the surveyors points out, by planting trees, and increasing the forests which are very close to the site. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, within six miles. Facts are worth more than theory, and we have opinions offered by experts, which, I hope will receive the weight they deserve. At Dalgety there is the finest water supply to be had in Australia, and the climate for ten months in the year is as good as that to be found in any other part of Australia. If it is more severe during the other two months, I remind honorable senators that it may have the effect of shortening our sessions occasionally. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator may do so; but I point out that when he has taken a division in favour of the Monaro district, which he defined, he assumes that honorable senators will then only vote for a site within that district. Suppose they decline to do that? Suppose that whatever the inconsistency may be, they persist in voting for their own favourite site, and submit the name of a site which is not favoured by the honorable senator. </para>

The advocates of Tumut, for instance, have in their minds an area near Tumut, in which is Batlow - in many respect the most desirable place. What the advocates of the respective sites have in their minds are districts rather than any definite spots. We decide, in the first instance, that we are in favour of one of those districts, and, if we happen to decide on an area within a radius of twenty miles, say, of Tumut, that will be a clearly defined area. We then proceed to decide on some spot within that twenty miles radius ; and if some honorable senator cautiously proposed Dalgety, the Chairman would at once point out that the latter was not within the area already decided upon. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say, but I am sure the Chairman would know ; at any rate, there would be a clear geographical line fixed. An amendment on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> amendment might, in reference to either or both of the other areas spoken of, be made just as definite geographically. I do not know the districts sufficiently to say how that should be done, , and it would take some time ; but, in my opinion, the danger feared by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> does not exist. </para>

                        <para>- To begin with, honorable senators could not, under the circumstances, vote for any other sites, although they could, of course, vote against the Monaro sites. If so, the advocates of the Monaro sites would ultimately be driven, in self-defence, to adopt some means of se- curing unanimity. That is supposing the worst happened; but I do not think that honorable senators are so captious as to adopt what I venture to say would be an unfair course. </para>

With some honorable members it is an intensely local question, and the great importance of the problem also gives rise to very strong feeling. I do not think, however, that honorable members would take any unfair means to prevent the majority from achieving their desire.

                        <para>- At all events, the evidence presented recently by experts is in favour of the district to which I refer. I am not an expert on the quality of land, water supply, railway matters, and so forth, but I have had six years&#39; training in this special department of inquiry as a member of the Railways Standing -Committee of Victoria, and, therefore, have obtained some smattering of knowledge. The conclusion I have arrived at is that Tumut, while presenting many advantages, particularly the advantage of picturesqueness, and, so far as I was able to observe, of a water supply sufficient for a very considerable population, has the very great disadvantage of having an enormous area of comparatively worthless land in its neighbourhood. </para>

                        <para>- It is extremely broken, rugged country. I was very strongly prejudiced in favour of the Batlow district from a climatic point of view, the climate being much colder than in Victoria. I am very fond of a cold climate ; indeed, I cannot get cold enough in Victoria to suit me. But the only place at Batlow level enough for the Capital city is very restricted in area, and is so situated that one has to climb up to look out of it. Those who urge that a Tumut site should be adopted have overlooked a great many of the characteristics which are desirable in a Seat of Government for the Commonwealth. Amongst others is the fact that all the sites in the neighbourhood of Tumut are a considerable distance inland. Some persons say that there is not a great deal of importance to be attached to the question of a port. But the continuance of the present position of the Commonwealth Government would be quite intolerable. The Government of the Commonwealth, like the Parliament, is a tenant at will. That is a quite intolerable position. But it would be a little less intolerable if the Commonwealth Government were the possessor of an area liable to be cut off at the will of any State. For that reason, it seems to me, that in &#34;a lesser degree, it would be highly objectionable for the Federal Territory to be absolutely within the area of a State. I do not wish it to be imagined that I feel that there is any danger of New South Wales being ungracious, or unfriendly, or unfair to the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- It is not at all a highly probable contingency that any State in which the Federal Territory might be located would unfairly or captiously endeavour to place the Commonwealth at a disadvantage, but still it is a possibility. There is an adage which tells us that &#34; Whatever can happen will happen sometimes.&#34; Arid when we can avoid that possibility without taking on any other disadvantages as a consequence, I hold that, slight as the danger is, it is as well to avoid it.. But there is another reason why I think the Commonwealth, if it can, without taking on other disadvantages that would counterbalance it, should have a port. The commercial well-being of nations, it is general}&#39; admitted, depends largely on the means of ingress and egress, on possibilities of communication with the rest of the world, and an additional port is an additional facility for communication with the rest of the world. The world is generally complaining that the, tendency of civilization is undue <inline font-style="italic">an&#39;</inline> hurtful concentration. If the Commo, wealth were to open up another port, to some extent that would tend to counteract the baneful influence of centralization ; 3 s 2 it would be decentralization in a degree. But a very strong reason is that it is an advantage to the Commonwealth to have as many outlets and inlets as possible for commerce, and for the purpose of reasonable interchange with trie rest of the world. Now,&#39; Tumut, or the surrounding district, does not possess this qualification. I can readily understand that honorable senators may have a very strong feeling for Tumut. There is a great deal in the district to attract one. There is a great deal of practically worthless country. Along the Adelong Creek there is a very rich valley, but it is extremely restricted, and is not occupied. I think it is fair to say. that, whatever my qualifications to judge may be, it was only a flying visit that I made, and it may have some qualifications of which I am not aware, but if it has, it will be for its advocates to present them to the Committee. Leaving Tumut, I went with others to the Monaro district, where the circumstances are entirely different. In leaving Cooma to drive to Bombala, you go the whole way, not through a narrow or restricted area, but through an immensely expansive area, not of first-class land, but of fairly good land. In fact, during the whole journey of forty odd miles, so far as my memory serves me, you go through no land that is hot good, except for the fact that it is excessively stony. </para>

                        <para>- It is impracticable from that point of view; but if the population were ever dense enough to justify the clearing of that extremely stoney country it would become very good second-class land. It is only fair to mention that for agricultural purposes a very large part of that expansive area is impracticable. During the whole distance there is no absolutely worthless land such as I described in the neighbourhood of Tumut. The character of the country everywhere is comparatively Speaking gently undulating. There is none of that intensely precipitous country that any one who is acquainted with agriculture, knows is impracticable from an agricultural point of view, not because of the soil, but because of its contour. It is impossible to get machinery on to such land or to work it well. The whole of the area that I was able to observe in Monaro was gently undulating land. Of course there are considerable altitudes from the general level, but in very few instances indeed are they very precipitous. In most instances machinery could be got on to the land, and it could be worked for agricultural or horticultural purposes. That is not a characteristic of the country in the Batlow district. It is said that the Bombala country is extremely, and, in the view of some persons, unbearably cold in certain seasons of the year, but that does not seem to be borne out by the facts of the settlement. Many persons that one meets there are comparatively hale, well-looking old people, some of whom have been there for forty or fifty years. </para>

                        <para>- It was extremely alluring to the early squatter. The land, being reasonably good almost anywhere - not first-class, except in pockets or patches - and requiring no labour to bring it into a fit condition for agriculture, attracted, I should assume, a number of poor persons. I do not know that it did, and I only make the deduction from the circumstances as they appear to me. They took up the land, and were able to produce crops of excellent quality. But the Government had made no provision for them to get the crops to a market, and they found that it was impossible for them to produce in a way that would provide them with a living. The squatter, whom I am not complaining about at all - for I am not one of those who feel that he is necessarily the natural enemy of the country - found very large areas of cleared land contiguous to and interspersed by belts of timber for shelter, which may be described not as first-class, but as very fair grazing country.. He had nothing to do but to take his stock there with a shepherd. The result is that there is a comparatively small number of people there, who have lived in the locality for a great number of years. They are thriving, and are occupying - without any blame to them - an enormous area of reasonably good country, which would keep tens of thousands of people. The establishment of the Seat of Government there would have a tendency to create, first of all for New South Wales, and in the end for the whole Commonwealth, another centre of civilization capable of providing employment, helpful and lucrative, for a very large number of Australians. The argument used by my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> that no person would go either to Bombala or elsewhere except from some other part of Australia, is one that only needs to be examined to be refuted. If anything happens anywhere to create a point of vantage for settlement, it will attract settlement either from far or near. If the establishment of the Capital : at Bombala attracts population from Melbourne or Sydney, the people <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> Melbourne and Sydney who go there will have been doing something previously ; and there are plenty of people all over the world who want to get into places that other people leave. So that we are bound to attract settlement in any case. But the point which I wish to consider now is not that merely abstract question. We have Jo decide not whether it is desirable to have a Seat of Government, but what is a desirable point at which to establish that Seat of Government. I speak with all- diffidence, because I recognise that there must be honorable senators who possess much higher qualifications than I have. But still, I am bound to speak as one of the trustees of the people to the extent of my knowledge and capacity. Of all the sites of which I have knowledge, it seems to. me that it is not possible to name one to compare with the Southern Monaro district. Much as can be said in favour of Tumut from a narrow and restricted point of view, that site is altogether out of it as compared with the Monaro district. </para>

                        <para>- My impression was that a pumping scheme is necessary ; but I admit that I do not know enough about it, and I can only speak as far as my qualifications go. From actual examination, I only know the Tumut area and the Monaro area ; and I have no hesitation in saying that the advantages in favour of Southern Monaro enormously outweigh the advantages, such as they are, of the Tumut area. I, therefore, feel constrained to vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> amendment. I should like to say a word or two with reference to the argument that the Monaro neighbourhood is cold. I think that is rather an advantage than a disadvantage. But if it is a disadvantage, it must apply with nearly, if not quite, equal force to Batlow. The altitude is not very different, and the latitude is not widely different either ; nor is there much difference in the temperature. But one of the conditions that we require is a cold climate. I am now, of course, speaking merely of the requirements of the site for the purposes of the Federal Capital. The continent on which we live possesses generally an unpleasantly hot climate. I submit that what we require for the comfort of the Federal Parliament - which is a comparatively important consideration when we are dealing with a Seat of Government, where the Commonwealth legislation is to be made - is a place in which the members can do the work of legislation at the season of the year when it is less pleasant to remain at their homes. That season is the summer time. The rule in Australia is for the Parliaments to do their work in winter. The reason for that is obvious - because it is so unpleasant to legislate in the heat of an ordinary Australian summer. If we select a place where we can do the work of legislation at a time when it will be possible to do it without the discomforts that are necessarily endured in our respective State capitals, the fact that the climate is cold seems to me rather an argument in its favour than against its adoption. </para>

                        <para>- I have had some experience of Parliament sitting in the heat of a Melbourne summer, and I can testify that it is far more pleasant to me, ar any rate, to sit in this building in winter. It is singular that we, the descendants of Britons, who came from a country where it is sometimes very cold in winter, and who are proud of the parent nation, should think that any great harm is likely to happen to the Commonwealth from the establishment of the Seat of Government in a cold climate -a climate which, after all, is not so cold as most parts of Great Britain, and which is certainly less unpleasantly cold than any part of Great Britain. The worst fault that can be found with the coldest part of Australia is that it has a keen, biting cold. Generally, when it is not actually raining, we have a clear Australian sky. I do not think, having regard to all these circumstances, that we need be very much afraid of taking a cold place. But if the Monaro district be cold, that is an objection which applies equally to either of the sites of which I know anything, and which are in the minds of honorable senators. Therefore, I say that we should select the Southern Monaro area. I think it would be wise to adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> amendment, because while it mentions the area distinctly, it leaves it open to us to acquire, after we have obtained more perfect knowledge, the best site in that .area. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, that implies a little more delay. But, after all, in the life of a nation, a few months are comparatively unimportant. What I take it the honorable senator is anxious for - and what I think he has a right to be anxious for, as a representative of New South Wales - is that there shall be an evidence on the part of the Australian Parliament of a desire to select the Federal Capital. I think that is a reasonable anxiety. When the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of this Parliament is established, and it is clear that there is no intention to delay the selection of a site unnecessarily, the question of a few weeks or months is altogether unimportant. But it is very gravely important that, having decided where, within a reasonable limit, the Seat of Government shall be, we shall select within that area absolutely the very best site possible on which to plant the Capital. Notwithstanding all the pains that we have taken to inquire into the sites, we are, I think - certainly I am, speaking for myself - quite insufficiently equipped to say clearly as an absolute last word which is the best of the sites available in Southern Monaro. At present I feel that Dalgety has many recommendations. First of all, it can be, and will be, if it is selected - when the energy and the taste and the wealth of Australia are expended upon it as far as may be justified - an extremely picturesque spot. While it is true that there are some conditions connected with it now that are not particularly picturesque, and while it is true that there is a good deal of treeless land and there are a great many unsightly granite boulders, it is also true that the conformation of the land is such as will lend itself to endless beautification by artificial means. First of all, the Snowy River runs along two sides of the projected site. With a very little weiring and planting, that suggests possibilities of beautification. In addition to that, while it is undoubtedly well sheltered from the western point, whence we are informed the cold winds come in that region, it has an outlook of at least twenty miles in another direction. And while that suggests naturally to the ordinary mind an absolute plain, such is not the fact. It is what persons who know anything of mountain country understand as a mountain table-top. But it is comparatively undulating - sometimes considerably undulating - so that if that site be selected the wealth and taste of Australia ought to be able to make the Capital city something like a delight to look upon, and one that could be seen by visitors approaching it from twenty miles off. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that that is an essential condition of a Capital site. It might be supposed that, as a Victorian, I should advocate Albury. But I hope that we consider ourselves as Australians in dealing with this question, and from that point of view I should say that Albury is one of the least desirable sites. However, as it is not in the running, it is hardly worth while to consider it. There is another aspect of this district which I have heard depreciated, and that is that over a large area it is treeless. It is con- tended that this is evidence of some natural characteristic that is antagonistic to its selection for the purpose which we have in view. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of the district of Monaro, because Bombala is. it seems to me, comparatively unimportant. I am considering an area very much more extensive than that of Bombala. It is true that about Bombala there is a considerable area which has always been treeless country, and there is also is a considerable area of timbered country. &#34;It, therefore, seems to me that the absence of vegetation in certain places is not evidence that the district is too cold for vegetation, because a few miles, or a few chains, will make no appreciable difference in that respect. There must be some other reason for this characteristic which we do not understand, and which. I am not sure that it is important we should understand. We do know, however, that, on country which is naturally treeless, it is very easy to produce trees by planting. A number of evidences of this fact, which have a very pretty effect, have been supplied by the efforts of a few settlers who are in the district. If it is contended that there are no trees on this country. because it is too cold for trees to grow there, the argument is completely met by the fact that, if we go to Riverina, which is one of the most fertile parts of New South Wales, when they can get some rain, which they do not get sufficiently often, and if we go to Northern Victoria, to the Mallee country where, after rain, grass grows more rapidly, and, perhaps, is more nutritious than in any other part of Victoria, we shall find in the middle of dense mallee scrub that we may come unexpectedly on an open plain, though so far as one is able to judge, the circumstances are exactly the same as where the country is covered by dense scrub. Those who know anything of that country are aware that these open plains are just as productive for any purpose as the timbered country can possibly become, however carefully cleared and cultivated. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s experience and mine do not tally. My experience may not be as great as that of the honorable senator, but it is somewhat extensive as regards this northern country. I have had some years of experience that entailed the obligation of endeavouring to acquire some knowledge of the character of the country. As I have already told honorable senators, I was a member of a Committee formed by the State Parliament, whose duty it was to report on the possibilities of country. I do not know whether I ever acquired much knowledge on the subject, but at all events that was the duty to which I had to apply myself for some six years. Therefore, while I do not claim to be an authority, I think I may, without undue egotism, claim that my opinion, after observation, is as good as that of the average man. I was pointing out that the treeless condition of country is not necessarily evidence that the country is too cold to grow trees, and though it may have been considered so by some persons, the fact that trees planted on such country grow rapidly, luxuriantly, and healthily, is evidence that the difficulty can be easily overcome. While it may not necessarily be a disadvantage that that country is treeless, there are &#34;reasons why it may be a very great advantage to have treeless country in conjunction with timbered country. Every one who knows anything of agriculture, and who has taken up virgin country, is aware that the first obstacle which settlers usually have to contend with is the giant natural vegetation. They sit down in the midst of the forest for some years without much room to move, whilst they are subduing the vegetation Nature has. put there, and if the country I am speaking of possesses nearly the same degree of excellence as timbered country does when cleared, the fact that it is already cleared must be considered a great advantage. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Millen,</inline>if he has been in the district, must be aware that while there is in that district a very large area of stony land, there is also a considerable area of land entirely free from stones, and a considerable area of other land in which the granite has become so decomposed that its presence is rather an advantage than a disadvantage. It is well known that land which is largely formed of decomposed granite is extremely useful for agricultural purposes. The presence of granite! on the Dalgety site is, to my mind, an extremely strong argument, in addition to others, for selecting that part of the Monaro district. lt seems to me that ail the boulders to be seen on that site would be quickly absorbed, and more required, in order to provide the stone necessary for buildings, sewerage, and other purposes connected with the proposed Capital. I set out as I have said merely to discuss methods., but I have drifted into a speech hurriedly thought out while upon my feet, and I feel that I owe honorable senators some apology for having detained them so -long. I assure them I feel as keenly as any of them can the importance of this question. I do not think it is one which can be settled airily, or with a light heart. It is a question to which &#39;we should give the most complete, careful, and matured consideration. On this account I am glad to note that the amendment, while it binds us to an area about which we can speak with a certain degree of positiveness, does not confine us absolutely to any particular spot. If it is found that the characteristics I have described exist in the Monaro district, and that they are desirable, if not essential, for the site of the Capital of the Commonwealth, then we have them in a broad area at our disposal, and we can afford to occupy a few weeks or months in deciding which is the exact spot on which we shall plant our Capital. </para>

If we are able to choose any area we please, as this Bill purports to do, the people of New South Wales can have no say in the matter. In such a case, as has already been pointed out, we might decide to take Broken Hill, Cobar, or Newcastle, if it is not within the 100 miles radius from Sydney, and say that it should be Federal territory, and New South Wales would have no constitutional right to protest. </para>

                        <para>- That is the view I take. We have the&#39; right to take 100 square miles, because that is the minimum mentioned in the Constitution, but if it is contended that we have the right to take more than 100 square miles without the consent of the people of New South Wales, we should have the right to acquire the whole of that State outside of the 100 square miles radius from Sydney, and that would lead us to an absurdity. Under this Bill it would appear that we have the right to demand any site without consulting the people of New South Wales, and I am desirous of amending the clause in such a way as to recognise the true position, and the true powers vested in the Federal authority m the selection of the Capital site.

                        <para>- The expression in the section &#34;&#39; snail have been granted to&#34; means that the authorities of the State of New South Wales must do something anterior to our action in selecting a Capital site. That is, they have to give their consent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> put the point very plainly in a speech which he delivered some time ago, and I have no doubt that the suggestion he then made would have been the correct one to adopt. The honorable and learned senator&#39;s suggestion was that a resolution by both Federal Houses should be passed, to the effect that the Federal Government desired a certain site, and, if necessary, a certain area, and that the Government of New South Wales should then, by enactment, consent to the Commonwealth&#39; acquiring that site and area. Under such circumstances, a Bill like that now before us would have been right in every particular, simply enacting, as it would, that the land &#34;be accepted. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt that would have been the case. The course suggested was not taken, and last October I asked the then Government if they would come to an arrangement with New South Wales with regard to 1,000 square miles, in order to ascertain whether we had the right, under the Constitution, to obtain within that area all Crown land free, or whether we only had the right to acquire 100 square miles, and negotiate for a larger area. Unfortunately, my request was not granted. For three years we have been considering the question of the Capital site; and I think that the amendment I have moved would get over any difficulty, and place this Bill in a constitutional position. If our requests are reasonable in regard to site and area, I feel sure the New South Wales Government will meet us in a fair and generous spirit; but they will resent our holding a pistol to their heads, and, without consulting them, and in face of the fact that the Constitution does not invest us with the power, demanding a certain area. </para>

                        <para>- If the Constitution recognises that right, and this Bill does not, what is the use of passing a Bill which is unconstitutional? We have under discussion three sites, and the New South Wales Government, who, I am sure, will meet us in a fair and generous spirit, have reserved in each site an area of 1,000 square miles. The Commissioner who was appointed at the expense of the New South Wales Government, recommended the site of Bombala, and, further, recommended that the area should be at least 1,000 square miles. We have no right to assume that New South Wales will take up an unfair or ungenerous attitude. I believe that nothing is more contrary to their intention; but should they do so, their action would probably be stimulated by a Bill such as this. If the New South Wales Government adopt an unreasonable attitude, and refuse to grant more than 100 square miles, then we have the strongest remedy in our power in that we say that we will not select a site which, in our opinion, is not the best in the interests of Australia - that we will wait until the New South Wales Ministry adopt a more reasonable and statesmanlike attitude, or a succeeding Ministry forms a true conception of the obligations of the situation. If we desire to pass this Bill in a constitutional form - if we do not desire to arrogate to ourselves powers which some of the highest legal authorities say we have not got - and if we do not desire to cause a conflict with New South Wales when we can adopt a procedure which will amicably settle this important question, surely it is reasonable for this Senate to adopt that procedure. We do not want to say, in the absence of any power on our part, &#34; Stand and deliver,&#34; &#39;but rather, &#34;We desire a certain site or a certain area ; are you agreeable to grant that site or area?&#34; If New South Wales adopts a spirit which is not consistent with the reasonable desires of the Commonwealth, and the reasonable intentions of the Constitution, it only means that we shall stay in Melbourne until the present, or some succeeding State Ministry realizes that our requests are made in the interests of Australia. I ask honorable senators to consider the advisability of recognising that New South Wales has some rights in regard to the selection of the Capital site, and the amendment would carry out the desire of, at any rate, most of us, namely, to speedily arrive at a definite decision. We shall be far more likely to induce a feeling of compliance on the part of the people of New South Wales, if we recognise what our relative positions are, and not ask that which the Constitution does not give us the right to demand. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> that we should do all we possibly can to consult New South Wales; but I submit that it is sought to insert this amendment in the wrong place. Beyond what the Constitution provides, New South Wales has no right to be consulted as to the situation of the Federal Capital ; but when we proceed further with the measure, and seek to provide that New South Wales shall concede a certain area, will be the time, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> desires, to submit an amendment of this kind. I hope that members of the Senate will not give away the &#39;powers legitimately possessed by the Commonwealth, by inserting an amendment of this character in the place proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith.</inline> The whole argument of the honorable senator is that New South Wales should have some say as to the area ; but he seeks to insert the amendment in a portion of the Bill which does not refer to area, but to the position in which the Federal Capital is to be. That is not contemplated in the Constitution ; and, although I am just as willing as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> thai this matter should be settled in a peaceful manner, and settled speedily, I hope honorable senators will not agree to the. amendment. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> to withdraw his amendment, and I tell him that, although I could not support it, there would not be so much objection to his proposal if it were made on a subsequent clause. </para>

When we come to consider the question of the site, the point will&#39; be in what particular part of the territory it shall be situated. It is necessary, in the first instance, to confer with New South Wales as to where the territory shall be located. </para>

I do not see that the Commonwealth Parliament is giving up one jot or tittle of its rights by accepting an amendment such as that moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith.</inline> I should be just as adverse as any other honorable senator to the Commonwealth &#39; Parliament surrendering any rights to which it is entitled. It is not with the idea of putting this Commonwealth Parliament in an inferior position to that of New South Wales that I hope the amendment before us will &#34;be carried. &#39;Such an amendment shows that there are two rights to be recognised. In the first instance, the amendment will enable the Commonwealth Government to confer with the New South Wales Government as to what land -shall or shall not be granted. </para>

                        <para>.- I have no doubt that it should, because, after all, the Seat of Government has to be within a territory which shall have been granted or acquired. In the first place, I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> that it is entirely a question of mutual agreement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales as to where the territory should be, and it is only recognising in the Bill what must be recognised when we come to deal with or bargain with that State. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DOBSON</inline>(Tasmania). - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> and other senators are now beginning to recognise the necessity that we shall have to undertake delicate negotiations with New South Wales. But I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> will see that the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> are absolutely unanswerable on the point that his amendment, if it should be adopted at all, ought not to be inserted in this clause. The words which he read would govern the whole clause, and not merely the question of area ; and if they are adopted we shall acknowledge that New South Wales is the authority that should determine the site, whereas the State has nothing to do with its determination. There ought to have been negotiations with the Government of New South Wales before this Bill was introduced. It really ought to be called a Bill to determine the territory within which the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be established, and I shall move that the title be amended accordingly. I shall strenuously resist any effort which may be made to compel the Senate to fix exactly the Seat of Government. If we by the Bill determine that the Federal territory shall be in the Tumut district, the Parliament will have taken the first, and: a very important step to carry out its duty. Negotiations can then take place between the Commonwealth and the Government of New South Wales, and the result of those negotiations can be made known to the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> at the earliest possible moment. He may come down and say that the Government of New South Wales are willing to give the Commonwealth 500 or 900 square miles, or that they will not give the Commonwealth more than 150 square miles, and then we shall know where we are. I do not believe for a second that the Government of New South Wales, if they find that the Federal Parliament has determined on a particular territory, will make any unreasonable objection. But if we propose to take too large a territory, in order to go in for a system of land settlement and land nationalization, the Government of New South Wales will, of course, have something to say on that point, and desire to know exactly what land we wish to take, and they may not be willing to give us all that we wish, although they may be disposed to treat us generously and fairly. I think that the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> should be withdrawn, and the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> or a similar one, passed. </para>
                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>(New South Wales).It seems to me that, on the other side of the Senate, there is a misapprehension as to the object of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> in moving his amendment. It is possible that that misconception arises from the fact that, owing to the way in which the Bill has been introduced, it has not been possible, in the scope of an ordinary amendment, for that honorable senator to clearly indicate what he wants to do. As the amendment stands, it is abundantly clear, I think, that it is asking the concurrence of the Government of New South Wales in the selection of the site of the Capital city. At any rate, that is what its effect would be. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Privately owned property must be the subject of negotiation between the Commonwealth Government and the proprietors. But so long as we confine ourselves to the 100 square miles, we are within our absolute rights. We need not say in this Bill &#34;with the consent of New South Wales.&#34; It is not necessary for us to put in an amendment of the character indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith.</inline> As for the contention raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> that clause 2 is tantamount to a peremptory demand, and that it would be better for us in this Bill to adopt the language which is usually used between two Governments which are negotiating, I say - &#34;No; at this juncture it is not a matter of negotiation.&#34; We are not engaged in correspondence, or passing resolutions. We are legislating in the Commonwealth Parliament ; we are exercising our undoubted and exclusive legislative power. In the exercise of legislative powers, it is not customary either to demand, or to beg, or to petition, or respectfully to request, or anything of that kind, but simply, plainly, and straightforwardly to determine. We are not placing a pistol at the head of New South Wales, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> states. We are simply exercising the constitutional powers conferred upon us in the first line of section 125 by proceeding to &#39; determine where the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be. </para>

When the Capital is established, it must be within territory which shall have been &#34; granted to or acquired by &#34; the Commonwealth. That is where the force of those words comes in. They have an application to territory <inline font-style="italic">in esse,</inline> and not to the powers of this Parliament so far as concerns the time when it shall exercise the powers conferred on it by section 125, and proceed to the determination of the site. </para>

I cannot support the amendment in clause 2, but I will support it in clause 3. It is competent for us to exact from New South Wales only 100 square miles. We cannot get any more than that without the consent of New South Wales. If we ask for more territory than we are entitled to under the Constitution, we should approach New South Wales in a respectful and proper manner. </para>

We might be quite willing to do something that would placate or conciliate New South Wales. But we have duties devolving upon us. We have to preserve intact all the powers that have been conferred on us by the Constitution. </para>

We have to exercise the greatest possible discrimination and care in connexion with any negotiation or legislation touching our relations with a separate State. Our relations with the whole of the States are very different from our relations with any one of the States. It is very difficult to give away any of the rights of the Commonwealth by any legislation affecting all the </para>

                <para class="block">States ; but it is very easy to give away the rights of the Commonwealth in legislating in regard to any one State. We are proposing to legislate under powers conferred on us by the Constitution. The Constitution says that the Seat of Government shall be determined by the Commonwealth Parliament. We are proceeding to determine the Seat of Government. The question whether we are doing that awkwardly or adroitly does not arise on this particular issue. The question is - &#34; Shall we take into partnership in these deliberations the Government of New South Wales?&#34; If we agree to say that the power conferred upon us by the Constitution shall be exercised&#34; jointly by us and the Government of New South Wales, we shall be acting unwisely. We shall be abrogating one of the powers conferred on the Federal Parliament, and entailing on the whole Commonwealth a disability that was never contemplated when the Constitution was framed. If we give up a right conferred by the Constitution in one direction,&#39; we establish a precedent for giving up rights in other directions. The question we have to consider is whether we have any right, under the Constitution, to allow the Government of any State to negotiate with us in respect to a Constitutional power? I think we have no right to take a State into partnership with us in this respect; and that if we did so we should be acting be- &#39; yond our powers. I earnestly hope that, at this juncture at any rate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> will withdraw his amendment. It is questionable whether it may not come in at another stage. When we are talking of enlarging very considerably the area which all the States had in mind when the Constitution, was accepted, I think it is reasonable to contend that the people of New South Wales&#39;, when they accepted the Constitution, had in mind the possibility of having to cede to the Commonwealth 100 square miles or thereabouts. When we come to consider whether we shall ask 900 square miles, 1,000 square miles, or 5,000 square miles, it is arguable that we should not seek to acquire so large an area without the consent of the Government of New South Wales; but it seems to me altogether unarguable, at this juncture, to say that any person has a right to be consulted, or that any person may properly be consulted but the Parliament of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>GOULD (New South Wales). - We must all agree with much the honorable senator has said, so far as the selection of the Seat of Government is concerned. Unquestionably, this Parliament alone can deal with that matter. The position I take up is that we are now being asked to pass a Bill to enable us to obtain territory within which the&#39; Seat of Government shall be located, and in obtaining that territory I contend that we have a right to confer with the Government of New South Wales, and that we cannot acquire it without the concurrence of the people of that S&#39;tate, whether it be at Monaro. Tumut, or Lyndhurst. </para>

                        <para>D- - I am arguing the position taken up by honorable senators opposite. If this Bill had been drawn differently, and had been a Bill to provide merely where the Federal territory should be, we should not have got into so many difficulties. We are proposing here to fix the Seat of Government in a territory we have not yet acquired. The Government are proposing that we should select the territory and the Seat of Government at the same time, when really the proper constitutional sequence is first to secure the territory, and then to fix the Seat of Government within it. It is, of course, competent for honorable senators to amend the Bill in such a way as to bring it into harmony with the Constitution, &#39; by making it a Bill by which the Federal territory shall be decided on, and not the Seat of Government, and the Seat of Government may be selected within the Federal territory later on. I say that we have no power to take territory from New South Wales without the concurrence of the people of that State. I am sure that it would not be withheld unreasonably, and that New South Wales would probably give away a good deal in order, to have this matter settled; but senators must see that if it is possible for us to take any area we please, outside the 100 miles radius from Sydney, New South Wales, instead of securing any advantage by the provision fixing the Seat of Government within her territory, has been placed at a great disadvantage. </para>

Sections 123 and 124, which he has referred to, are under Chapter V., dealing with &#34; New States,&#34; and have a general application to the alteration of the boundaries of States, the division of States, or the throwing of two or more States into one. The selection of the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth is a different matter, and section 125 specially deals with it. I draw attention to the wording of the section - </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator does not advert to the procedure necessary. It is suggested first of all that we must have territory granted to or acquired by us before we can proceed to determine the Seat of Government. How are we going to get&#39; that territory? Who is to have a voice in that ? This Parliament alone must determine the Seat of Government. If Ministers by purely Executive act were to bargain with the Government of New South Wales for a particular site, and were to say, &#34; We shall acquire that from. the Crown and the private landholders, and bring down a Bill to the Federal Parliament to determine the Capital site,&#34; what would the criticism be ? Would it not be, &#34;This Parliament is not determining the Seat of Government, but determining only that a certain area of land acquired by the Executive of the day, without the previous sanction, concurrence, or authorization of Parliament, is to be the territory within which the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth is to be located?&#34; We should in such a case be deprived of the full constitutional powers conferred on us by section 125. What is here proposed is the first step necessary. This Parliament must be consulted on every &#39; step taken in this matter, because this Parliament alone is responsible for the selection of the Seat of Government. We are not proposing that a certain area of New South Wales, even 100 square miles, shall be Federal territory, but that a certain portion of New South Wales shall be the particular portion of that State to which this Parliament shall limit itself hereafter in determining the Seat of Government. When we have done that, it will be time enough for the Executive, by the authorisation of this Parliament, to come to terms with New South Wales, and narrow down the area until we secure the proper site. Then it will be for this Parliament to sanction the selection of the particular area required for the determination of the Seat of Government. If honorable senators will remember that this must be done entirely by Parliament, and that the first step must be taken by this Parliament, they will see that we are now taking the proper course in deciding what is the particular area of New South Wales to which we shall restrict ourselves hereafter, when we are more specifically and exactly determining where the Seat of Government shall be. </para>

                        <para>- Very well, the honorable senator was quoting someone else whom he did not name, and I -wish to say that New South Wales does not desire to be conciliated or placated, but to be treated, as I believe honorable senators are willing to treat her, as a sovereign State and a portion of the Commonwealth. I should like honorable senators to consider how important a matter this may be to New South Wales. Had the proposal made a few months ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> been agreed to, and made law, the result would have been that some tens of thousands of her population would have been taken from New South Wales. That would have reduced our right of representation in the other House. by one, if not two members. Even now a small area containing a considerable number of people, might, if selected, bring about the same, result; so that evidently this is a matter of great importance to New South Wales. Is it, therefore, unreasonable that there should, in accordance with this clause, be some arrangement made with&#34; New South Wales for the acquirement of territory, which, after being acquired, will enable us to select therein the Seat of Government? That, I think, is a simple proposition to put before the Committee, and I do not very well see how honorable senators can refuse to recognise its reasonableness. </para>

                        <para>- The meaning is that we should first of all select the Federal territory, and then decide where the Federal Capital shall be. and this latter decision is purely within the province of this Parliament. This Bill seems a clumsy and involved attempt to interpret the intention of section 125. It puts the &#34;cart before the horse&#34; by first selecting the site, instead of selecting the territory in which the site is to be. Clause 2 of the Bill fixes the location of the Capital site, and clause 3 fixes the area of the territory. Clause 2 makes it mandatory that we shall have at least 100 square miles. That area is not mentioned in the Bill, but is provided in the Constitution, and, therefore, we are selecting an area of at least 100 square miles. </para>

I think, however, that those who listened, must have very early come to the conclusion that it was diffident modesty which induced the honorable senator to put forward that disclaimer. Speaking with some knowledge of the matters to which the honorable senator referred, I venture to say that his comparison will strike those who know the two sites as being the most lucid and the fairest to which we have listened. There are, however, one or two points on which I differ from him. The honorable senator, in dealing with Tumut, referred to the large area of useless land in that district. If the honorable senator was speaking merely of agricultural land, I am prepared to agree with him. </para>

We do not want high-class agricultural land on which to build houses. Some of the finest land for building purposes is rock, having a good foundation, such as would be passed over by the poorest agriculturist. </para>

As to the good agricultural land, there is no necessity for, nor, indeed, any great advantage in, taking any extensive area of such land in the immediate vicinity of a city. What we want to know is&#39; that the city is in sufficiently close touch with the sources of supply ; not that the agricultural land is in the main street or immediate suburbs. So long as there is sufficient agricultural land within touch of the markets, all the requirements of a city are met ; and Tumut is so situated. North, south, east, and west of Tumut there are sources of supply more, than sufficient to meet, the requirements of any city likely to be placed there at any time, and under any conditions that we can foresee. </para>

I am merely judging the future of the Federal Capital city, from what has taken place in the United States. When I assume that the Federal Capital, as compared with other&#39; Australian cities, will not be a big one, I am only arguing from what has taken place in the great Republic of America. But even if it should not be as large as an city we have in Australia, I still say that it should be within sufficient and easy touch with good land, capable of supplying all its wants. Whether the area be one, ten, or twenty miles is practically &#91; immaterial. For all purposes, a city located in the Tumut district would be within easy reach of sources of supply sufficient for all requirements. </para>

I desire to deal with the matter in the same fair spirit that was shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> If we are to condemn Tumut because it is capable of growing tobacco and maize, which would seem to be an admission that the climate is unduly hot, we must be exonerated from the accusation that the district is as cold as Monaro. </para>

                        <para>- The advocates of Monaro, in order, as I think, to depreciate the chances of Tumut, point to the fact that in some of the low valleys where the temperature may be high, they do grow these products. But I might as well turn round and refer to some evidence given recently before a Land Board in Monaro, when it was stated that three crops out of ten could be relied on by experienced farmers in the district. That was the sworn evidence of a Government surveyor, who, presumably, was unbiased. I do not venture for a moment to put forward a statement of that kind as fairly representative of the capability of Southern Monaro; but I contend that I would be just as much entitled to do that as are those honorable senators who would condemn Tumut because in certain lower areas it is possible to grow products which do require a considerable measure of heat. </para>

                        <para>- In the matter of climate, we have in Tumut what Southern . Monaro can never pretend to have, and that is variety. If you like, you can get down to a temperature which is summer compared with that of Monaro, and at the same time &#39; you can get into a temperature which is mild enough for anybody. I quite appreciate the appeal to our race feeling made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> when he said that Britishers are not to be frightened by a little cold. I do not know that. I am more frightened than some people, but I admit that the prospect of spending a winter in Southern Monaro has no charm for me. It is a district in which it is impossible to carry on dairying in winter, and that is proved by the fact that at the present moment the butter factories are closed and their machinery is for sale. </para>

                        <para>- I am merely giving what appears to me a very practical illustration of the climate which prevails there; Having regard to the conditions which prevail, dairying cannot be carried on in the ordinary way there, except for five or six months in the year. That evidences a climate more rigid than, I think, we should find comfortable, if, as I assume to be the case, the bulk of the Federal sessions will be held in the winter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has disputed that idea, and has urged reasons - very old ones, I may say - why Parliament ought, and will, sit in the summer. That notion was first started when the Constitution Bill was put before the people for their acceptance. It was just a little bit, of word-painting in which advocates of the Constitution indulged when they pointed out that naturally the Federal Parliament would sit in the summer, because the States Parliaments were in the habit of sitting in the winter, and many of them . supposed that they would be members of both Parliaments. They pointed out to the people that, as the Federal Parliament would sit in the summer only, it would not look for a warm climate in which to sit. But what are the facts of the case? Owing to a provision in the Constitution itself we are more likely to sit in the winter than in the summer. It is provided in one section that senators shall be elected so as to date their term of office from the 1st January of the following year. Another provision - I am not quite certain whether it is in the Constitution or in the Electoral Act - requires Parliament to meet within a certain time after an election. </para>

                        <para>- Just so. The Parliament met on the 2nd March this year, and I take it that it will be about that date when each new Parliament will meet. I do not know what the length of an ordinary session will be when the Parliament settles down steadily to work, but I do submit that the history of the States Parliaments shows a tendency to an ever-lengthening session. In New South Wales we have a tradition that the Parliament must sit in the winter ; but, speaking from a personal knowledge of ten years, I can say that the session is never closed until a week or two before Christmas, to enable the members to get to their homes. While I have heard honorable senators depict what a good time Ave shall have here when we fairly settle down to work - that short sessions will prevail - I venture to think that a Parliament which meets early in March will continue in session, at any rate, well into, the spring, through the most rigid portion of the winter. That being so, I see not only no attraction in the cold climate of Monaro but everything which is repellant to me. </para>

                        <para>- Does not the honorable senator see that if we meet then, and continue in session for five or six months, honorable senators will not adjourn for a month ? We vote supply for twelve months, and what is there to bring us back for? Surely we do not want to live here always. The honorable senator may, but I do not, and I am sure that the country does not want us to do so. I admit that a great many of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> &#39;s statements as to the agricultural possibilities of Monaro are perfectly correct, and would be excellent arguments if they were addressed to the Parliament of New South Wales, and in furtherance of a scheme of subdivision for the closer settlement of that district. I quite agree with him that there is an enormous area of country there which originally was held by selectors. The big estates in Monaro were never purchased from the Crown as the big estates iri Riverina were. </para>

                        <para>- In Riverina, the es- tates were built up by auction, and purchased direct from the Crown, whereas the estates in &#39;Southern Monaro were generally put together by the aggregation by one individual of a number of selections previously obtained in small holdings from the Crown. But that district is admirably suited for small settlement under certain conditions, and in a certain form. I do not mean intense cultivation for growing crops, for I doubt very much whether that is the form in which Southern Monaro could be most profitably developed. But I&#39; think that it will have an ideal future when it shall have copied the lesson which New Zealand has taught us of growing a particular class of meat suitable for export. But these are not arguments which appeal to me in connexion with the Federal territory. I am not at all concerned with matters of that kind in discussing this question from the Federal stand-point. They seem to me to be altogether matters outside Federal jurisdiction and Federal functions. All I am looking for is an area which is reasonably sufficient for Federal purposes pure and simple. I cannot conceive that we, as Federal authorities, are at all concerned about the agricultural or pastoral development of a single acre of land. </para>

                        <para>- Because these were not functions that &#39;were passed from the States to the Federation. These are purely State functions. If my honorable friend thinks that the Federation of the Commonwealth ought to have power to deal with them, that is another matter, but it would be necessary to amend the Constitution to do so. He might as well ask why should we not have consolidation of land in the various States - an idea which might come from a Victorian, seeing that they have parted to a great extent with their Crown lands. Of course, my first vote will be given to Lyndhurst. But there are three reasons why I shall give my vote to Tumut in preference to Monaro. The three reasons apply certainly to Tumut ; two of them to a greater extent to Lyndhurst, and the third to a slighter extent. In the first place, either of those sites is much more central, both as regards the existing, and the probable future, population of Australia, than Southern Monaro. Not only are they more central, but they have the advantage of immediate railway communication - an advantage which would mean the saving of some years in the erection of the Federal Capital, and the transference of the Federal Parliament to the Seat of Government. The third reason is the matter of climate, to which I have referred. Knowing something of Monaro, and a good deal of New South Wales, I can only say that Southern Monaro is about the las&#39;t place outside the particularly warm regions of that State in which I ever hope to be located for any length oJ time. </para>

                    <para>- I rise to express my regret that by reason of the amendments, certain dividing lines are introduced, which interfere with the free choice of the Senate. I take it that we are in duty bound to accept the will of the majority, and I desire that the will of the majority may be attained in the most open manner possible. I should greatly prefer the exhaustive ballot plan. I do not like these proposals which seek to prohibit the selection of any site but one of a certain class. The amendments which have been moved, in the first place, limit the choice absolutely to the extreme south end of the State of New South Wales. Now, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has moved an amendment which professedly means the inclusion of Tumut. I would suggest to my honorable friend that he might just as well have moved the insertion of Tumut right away as hit upon some parallel of latitude or longitude. I desire to give a vote on behalf of Lyndhurst. The only way in which I can do that is by voting against the amendments. That, however, will be an unsatisfactory- and unreal kind of vote. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend has a permanency of affection that is truly admirable, almost pathetic. I do not wish to say anything against Tumut, but I wish to give a vote for one of the two sites which I believe must be ultimately left for final adjustment between the two Houses. From what I have gathered from the members of another place, . it seems to me that the two sites left in the running - which have really &#34;a call,&#34; to use a colloquialism - are Lyndhurst and Dalgety. Dalgety, in respect of water sup- ply is immensely superior to any other site. Not only does it afford a supply for domestic purposes, but it is the only site that will give a good power for electrical purposes. </para>

                        <para>- Will the honorable senator please give Tumut a rest? It is a nice happy locality, but it is hardly necessary to gild the lily and adorn the rose. I quite agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has said in praise of Dalgety. I do not know that I ever paid <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> a public compliment before in my life, but I must say that I listened to his speech with very much more than interest. I spent something like a fortnight in inspecting the Dalgety and. Bombala district. I went to all sorts of places, up all sorts of hills, down into all sorts of gullies and crannies. There are very few visitors who can tell me more about the locality than I know. I do not know how long &#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> spent there, but he certainly has a fine grasp of the features connected with Dalgety ; and I pay him a well-deserved compliment of appreciation for the very excellent manner in which he described that locality. I am sorry that he has not been to Lyndhurst. I admit that Lyndhurst has not so good a water supply. But there is this great point. Lyndhurst gives an immediate railway connexion, while the Southern Monaro sites do not. The difficulties . of establishing railway connexion with the Monaro sites - particularly those which have been named - undoubtedly place a strong bar in the way of a man who seeks to see the Capital established within a reasonable time voting for them. Lyndhurst also possesses advantages of centrality which none of the Southern Monaro sites have. Not even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> pet Tumut can offer such advantages. Undoubtedly as Australia develops, with railways linking its territory on the north and on the west - some are already in process of construction - Lyndhurst will be by far the most central, of any of the sites that are worth v of consideration. That must be palpable to the mind of any honorable senator who takes the trouble to look at the map. Lyndhurst is due north of Melbourne. The line does not run away to the east, as is the case with the existing railway line connecting Sydney and Melbourne. There is at present a cross line to Lyndhurst, but it would become a main trunk line if the place were selected as the </para>

                <para class="block">Capital site. It is a good line. Trains travel over it with dreadful deliberation at present, because they are mixed trains. They carry pigs, sheep, butter, eggs, cattle, firewood, and goodness knows what else. Passengers have to endure a very slow journey. But the question of the character of the line was raised in New South Wales lately, and the Railway Commissioners communicated to the press the fact that the trains do not run so slowly on account of any defect in the construction or the permanent way, but simply because the traffic is con ducted on the mixed principle. </para>

                        <para>- The interruption of the family solicitor reminds me of a little story that I once heard about an American steamer, that was built to draw so very little water that she made a great success in travelling over a field under a heavy dew ! I have yet to learn that even when we have steamers running twenty-five knots an hour they will be able to negotiate the fifty miles of wild ranges between the Tasman Sea and the Bombala&#39; Capital site. At any rate, I do not see how they are going to do it. Naturally, it is not a&#34; pleasant thing for a representative to have to speak to the detriment of any portion of his electorate. Bombala is as much a portion of my electorate as is any. other part of New South Wales. But I must do my public duty, and it is my duty to point out these considerations. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not know, and have not inquired. Sydney has not called and left its card and informed me. But this is what I want to get at : It is very frequently said in reference to the Capital site at Bombala, that the Snowy River is part and parcel of the scheme. Let me say at once that that idea is a piece of pure futility. There are no less than nine miles of wild mountainous country between the proposed site at Bombala and the Snowy River. It would not only be necessary to deal with those wild hills, but the hills themselves are 600 feet above the water level of the river. It is practically impossible by any machinery to connect the water of the Snowy River with Bombala. </para>

                        <para>- The Dalgety water is on the spot all the time. 1 hope the amendments will be withdrawn, and that we may have a straight-out vote on known sites, and not on geographical parallels. I desire to say that my first vote will be given to Lyndhurst, on the score of its centrality for the whole of the Commonwealth. If that vote should fail, I shall give my second vote on behalf of Dalgety, because I recognise that there exists in that locality a superabundant water supply for every purpose, including the power required for electric lighting, to an unlimited extent, and for a great tramway system. I believe that there is something like 50,000 horse power running through a narrow gorge between granite cliffs. It is a marvellous sight to see the water running down between those narrow walls. Very little engineering skill would gather there a magnificent head of power which could not be found in any existing or projected town in any other part of the Commonwealth, except, possibly, at Launceston. The water power at Launceston, used for generating electricity, is a somewhat artificial supply, brought through a small tunnel, and the power secured is infinitesimal when compared with the magnificent power that year in and year out rushes in vast volumes through the narrow gap in the great&#39; granite walls I speak of. Those walls are only a few miles in a direct line above the site that would undoubtedly be occupied by the principal buildings and streets of the Federal Capital if it were established at Dalgety. I quite appreciate the view of those honorable senators who have spoken disparagingly of the portion of Dalgety in the vicinity of the few little buildings which constitute the town. It is certainly a barren-looking spot, but something more is to be seen than what may be seen in the vicinity of the two hotels and the post-office at Dalgety. Pass the first rise to the west, and you come to beautiful undulating country, well sheltered by great hills, the tops of which form a fine tableland to the westward, and on the foothills there are sites for any number of suburban residences and suburbs in connexion with the Capital city. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of the suggested site. As for Lyndhurst, the train to-day runs through the place where the streets of the Capital city would be. I take it it would be almost necessary to move the present railway line somewhat out of the way, because the splendid area it now traverses would be almost too valuable for the site of a railway line. Lyndhurst possesses in the proximity of the grand -old Mount Macquarie, 4,000 feet high, in the foreground, and the Canobolas hills at the back, very handsome surroundings for any city for any purpose. It certainly possesses a paramount advantage in these days of retrenchment and curtailment of expenditure in being connected with existing railway communication from Gladstone on the north, to Broken Hill and Adelaide on the south and west. </para>

                    <para>- I have no doubt that honorable senators have made up their minds as to which site they will favour. I have a strong disposition to pay great respect to the wishes of honorable senators representing New South Wales, but from all I can hear they are in a hopeless minority. The great majority of honorable senators appear to be in favour of an area such as that proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and, that being so, I am inclined to use mv own judgment and make a selection of a site that has a possibility of being associated with a seaport. The Dalgety district appears to possess a very great advantage in the matter of water power, and were the Capital established there, and manufacturing industries started, it would be of incalculable advantage to have cheap power, which is one of the great necessities of modern economical manufacture. We have a remarkable instance of the advantage of the possession of cheap power, of which we are all very proud, at Launceston, in the north of the State of Tasmania. Honorable senators are, no doubt, aware that the cataract of the South Esk, near the entrance to Launceston, has been harnessed up, and provides 1,400 or 1,500 horse power, and the business has been found to be a very profitable and a very promising undertaking. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and a very good example of it. We may expect something of the kind to be adopted in the new Federal city, .which, I hope, will be an ideal one in every way. There would appear to be some doubt as to the nature of the climate of the Monaro district, seeing that the average altitude of the sites, according to the reports of the Commissioners, is 2,600 feet; but we cannot expect to have every ideal fulfilled by any particular site. We must balance the advantages of the various sites suggested, and select the best. There would appear to be no considerable existing town within the area, suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and if the land in the district be reasonably good, that should constitute another reason for establishing the Federal city there. It would not be wise to endeavour to establish the Federal city close to one already in existence, and with which it might in some way compete. If we establish a new city in that district, we shall develop a new producing area, and taking advantage of the water power which has been so highly spoken of, we shall be able to develop a good manufacturing centre. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>GOULD (New South Wales). - Senators Mulcahy and Trenwith have laid a great deal of stress on what they consider the advantage of obtaining a site which would include a port. I am afraid that honorable senators are building up an ideal Federal city which was never contemplated by the Constitution, and which cannot be secured. If either Dalgety, Bombala, or Delegate were selected as the site of the Capital, there would be fifty miles between them and the sea coast. Not only so, but we should have a very steep and rugged range of mountains to ascend to effect communication with a port. Honorable senators must see that if it is considered essential to have a port connected with the Federal Capital, we must acquire an area immensely greater than that contemplated in the Constitution. If we obtain a seaport it will involve enormous expenditure by the Commonwealth Government, not only in rendering it suitable for shipping purposes, but also in the erection of defence works. </para>

                        <para>.- After all, the territory to be developed would be very limited in area compared with the territory of New South Wales; and in the circumstances would it not be better to allow New South Wales to develop the seaport herself. Honorable senators speak as though we were going to establish a new State, and to carry on all sorts of industries and enterprises within its boundaries. Again I remind them that the new State will have to be of a very limited area, and. there will be no opportunity to establish the great works which some honorable senators appear to contemplate. I fail to understand how honorable senators can reconcile these ideas with the jealousy which they entertain against allowing what is termed the unearned increment to extend to any land outside the boundaries of the Federal Territory. After all, where are the great centres of population in Australia going to be? Will they be in our Federal Capital, or in the great commercial centres already established on the coast of Australia? Is, it proposed that we &#39;should take away the manufacturing industries from Melbourne and Sydney and establish them in our new territory ?&#39; Those industries already established in the large centres of population, where greater opportunities are afforded for carrying them on remuneratively. If we look to what has taken place in other parts of the world, we shall find that Washington is a city established for purposes of government, and not for carrying on commercial and mercantile industries. Washington has remained, as I believe our Federal Capital in Australia will remain, a city established for Federal purposes. </para>

                        <para>- If we can improve on Washington, by all means we should do so, but it must be remembered that Washington to-day is a city with a population of &#39;only 300,000, in . a territory which has a population of 80,000.000. Let honorable senators compare that with our population, and then say how many centuries it will take us to attain to a similar position, especially with the ideas prevalent at the present time with regard to immigration, as evidenced by our legislation. The whole object of providing for a Federal Capital was fo establish a city where the Parliament might legislate in its own country, free and untrammelled from any obligation to the various States. It was never contemplated that we should establish a great commercial capital or seaport ; and I contend that we never can have a city which will override the greater cities already established throughout Australia. I admit that the more seaports we have the better it is for the whole of the Common wealth, but I do not think we shall do very much in that respect with the Federal Capital, seeing the limitations imposed by the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Trenwith</inline> contended that it was intolerable .that the Commonwealth Parliament should be a tenant at will at the present time, and the position would be intensified if the Federal city were established within an area likely to be cut off by the action of any one of the States. Is it conceivable that New South Wales, any more than any other State, would attempt to limit or prohibit communication between the Federal area and other States of the Commonwealth? But, supposing that the territory lay between the State of Victoria and the State of New South Wales, it would be possible, if the position were conceivable, for these two States to combine and do exactly what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> fears. The moment a State adopted such a course, it would be evident that it was in a position of rebellion - a position that&#34; could not be maintained by any State. The Commonwealth would have the means of bringing a rebellious State to terms, and we may assume that a State, before taking up such a position, would adopt constitutional means to get away from the Federation. Any suggestions of this character should be banished at once as impossible, in view of the way in which people&#39;s minds are constituted, and as they ever will be constitutes in every part of the world. I hope honorable senators will realize that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in their strong advocacy of Lyndhurst, are supporting that site, because they consider it the most sensible and best. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> expressed the opinion that the people of New South Wales and their wishes should be considered to a very great extent ; and the divisions which have taken place on this question in times past, show clearly that public opinion, as evidenced by the representatives in both Houses, is strongly in favour of Lyndhurst, as being central, with easy communication, and fulfilling all the other requirements of a Federal Capital city. It may be true that Lyndhurst does not possess the same water supply facilities as do some of the other sites. </para>

                        <para>.- Lyndhurst was the first choice of the New South Wales representatives, and the same will be found to be the casts when this Bill reaches another place. According to the report of the last Royal Commission, there is at Lyndhurst a water supply sufficient, at moderate cost, to meet the requirements of a population of 50,000 people, while a supply for a population of 200,000 could, if necessary, be obtained, according to the scheme suggested by the Commission. In view of all the facts, we may take it that, at Lyndhurst, there is a water supply sufficient to meet the requirements of any Federal Capital we may contemplate for centuries to come. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. PULSFORD</inline>(New South Wales). - Many reasons, fanciful and otherwise, have been advanced in order to persuade honorable senators to vote for the southern sites, but the greatest reason of al&#93; in favour of Lyndhurst has been overlooked. In all countries of the world the capital city is, as a rule, made the centre of the military power. In the future, we cannot hope to be free from war troubles, and I ask the Minister of Defence to tell us whether it is not desirable that the place where we elect to have the main body of our troops should have easy access to any portion of the Continent. Southern Monaro is about the last place we should select as the centre of military power, while, on the other hand, Lyndhurst is admirably suited for this purpose, possessing, as it does,, already, means of transit which do not exist in the regions to which many honorable senators are directing their thoughts. Even if means of communication did exist in the Monaro sites, still the time of transit would be very much greater, and we know that during military troubles a few hours may be of great importance. </para>

If we are to have a city worthy of the name, commercial and industrial pursuits must be carried on. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has pointed out that if we&#39; a re fortunate enough to get the Dalgety site, there will be so much water-power that industrial pursuits must be created ; and this might have the effect of relieving the congested populations of Sydney and Melbourne.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline>(Tasmania).- In my opinion &#39;the wording of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> amendment is inadequate, if it is his intention to have comprised in the area the whole of that triangular piece of land which is south of the imaginary line referred to. I do not suggest that he should name the coast and the border of Victoria as the other lines, but that in the place of the word &#34; territory &#34; he should insert the words &#34; the whole of that portion of New South Wales,&#34; and so forth. </para>

We have indicated a territory from which the Seat of Government is to be chosen ; but inasmuch as we desire to take a much larger area than the Constitution seems to warrant, it becomes a question of negotiation with New South Wales for that larger area. Why does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> wish to begin to pick out a spot from within this large territory, when a great many of us must admit that we are not competent to make a selection? I am not capable of giving a vote for either Dalgety or Bombala, because I do not possess the requisite knowledge. We have chosen the Southern Monaro district, which includes Dalgety, Bombala, and Delegate. Why cannot the Government begin to negotiate with the Government of New South Wales, and when they obtain the necessary information as to plans and terms, bring down another Bill? I object to being asked to fix a particular site. </para>

The intention of the next clause is to carry out the purpose of the Bill.

            <para class="block">The Senate has decided, so far as it is concerned, that the Capital site shall be somewhere on the Monaro plain. But my own view - and it is largely shared by honorable senators, I think - is that we are not yet sufficiently informed to say exactly where the area shall be. There have been opinions expressed which are rather adequately included in the amendment I propose. If we are to move a distance from any point, and we fix Dalgety as the point, we must use the words &#34;fifty miles&#34; in order to include Bombala, if that should ultimately be found to be the best site; and it is forty-four miles, as nearly as may be, by the road we travelled. A mile or two here or there does not matter in a .case of this kind. But if we are to have a distance by measurement, 50 miles covers all that we can possibly require. It would be a mistake to select either Bombala, Delegate, or Dalgety at this stage. If we are to say 25 miles from Dalgety, we might as well say definitely that the site shall be at Dalgety. Are we prepared for that? Certainly, I am not. I &#39;do not think that the paying of a flying visit to the district qualifies me to express an opinion definitely at this stage. If we decide the distance, we shall have gone far enough for the present. We shall have shown our <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> to the New South Wales people, and next session will be quite early enough to settle definitely and irrevocably the exact spot. </para>

                    <para>- I want to leave ourselves open to take the very best spot in the district. The time between now and the next session is so small, and the population of the district is so limited, that it cannot matter very much. They are not a population who buy and sell land to any great extent. </para>

                    <para>- I am not sufficiently well acquainted with the district to be able to speak dogmatically, but I tried to learn about the habits and character of the people, and the conclusion- I formed was that they are extremely stationary. Most of them have been there for a considerable time, and there are very few new settlers. I should prefer to see the clause carried as it now stands so far as the locality is concerned. Then amicable negotiations could be entered into with the New South Wales Government, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> suggests. I shall vote against a twenty - five miles&#39; limit, because it does not cover the whole of the suggested sites. That radius from Dalgety would not reach Bombala. I have not so much objection to a radius of fifty miles. But it seems to me that the clause as it stands would achieve all we desire at present. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>(New South Wales).If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith&#39;s</inline> suggestion is adopted what position shall we be in? It will mean that the whole of the Monaro Plains will be locked up. All the thriving settlements about Bega, which is held by hundreds of small dairy farmers, would be affected. The Bill provides that the value of any land taken over by the Commonwealth is to be&#34; the value on the 30th January last year. The consequence would be that not a single acre south of the imaginary line mentioned in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> amendment would be free. No one would buy property in the neighbourhood, seeing that he would not know what value the Commonwealth Government would fix upon it as from the 30th of January last year. Any one who deals in landed property must know that nobody would venture to buy an estate, knowing that a third party might come in and buy it from him at an unknown valuation. </para>

Around Tumut and Lyndhurst there has not been so large an area affected as is now specified - an area eighty miles by sixty. &#39; If this proposal were carried out, the land-owners there would not only be unable to sell, but they would not be able to raise a single penny on their properties from any financial institution. We should simply say to them that for an indefinite period they would be liable to have their properties resumed at the estimated value, at a time long past. Would that be fair? To do so would be to cramp every man holding property or carrying on an industry in the district. </para>

I wish to explain to Senators Pearce and Trenwith that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has given one of the reasons why I suggested Dalgety in the first instance. If honorable senators will look at the map, and the area taken in by the limitation proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> they will find that if they take Dalgety as the centre they may extend fifty miles eastwards without taking in Bega, and if they extend fifty miles westward they will take in country- that is almost uninhabited. - I should have no objection&#34; to the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> to alter the words &#34;twenty-five miles&#34; to &#34; fifty miles,&#34; if it is understood that Dalgety is to be considered the centre. But if Bombala were considered the centre, to extend the territory to a radius of fifty miles from that centre would be to do what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has indicated, because it would impound an area that it is not contemplated by this Bill should be taken from or asked from New South Wales. If Dalgety were considered the centre, and the fifty miles radius were accepted, it would include Dalgety, Bombala, and Delegate. </para>

                    <para>- I feel that there is a great deal in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said. We must get all the security, and as great a degree of definiteness, as we can, and at the same time we must avoid, so far as we can, even the suspicion of injury to the citizens of any part of the Commonwealth. If we can get what we require without the possibility of injury to anybody, it is just as well that we should have it. The Vice-president of the Executive Council has said that the amendment I first suggested, while it would give the protection which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> suggested to the people of Bega, would not give us sufficient for our purpose. I do not wish to go an inch further than is necessary to give us ultimately an untrammelled choice within the area upon which we have decided. With reference to the fear expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> that we may be undoing something which we have already done, I would point out that the limitation now proposed applies only within the original limit, and creates no complication. If those who know the district assure me that both Bombala and .Dalgety will come within a radius of forty-five miles, I see no objection to adopting that distance. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para> <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline> (New South Wales).For all practical purposes there is very -little difference between forty-five and fifty miles, because, at that distance, the edge of the tableland is reached, and you commence to descend the sides of the mountains towards the dairying district lying between them and the coast. I regard the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Trenwith</inline> as a very fair compromise between two opposite positions. &#39; But I appeal to honorable senators not to go further than the distance suggested by him. A distance of fifty miles secures to those who favour either Bombala, Dalgety, or Delegate, ample range within which to make their final selection. </para>

                    <para>- T, thought that when we carried the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> we decided, so far as we were willing to go at the present time, where the Seat of Government should be, leaving the actual position of the Federal Capital an open question. That being so, I cannot understand the reason for suggesting another limit now. I think it will be better to leave the question open. Neither can I understand this new-born enthusiasm for Dalgety. If honorable senators knew more about that site, they would not be in such a hurry to support it in place of Bombala, which had most support last Parliament. Personally, I think we had better adjourn, because we are not likely to arrive at a decision before the last trains leave the city. I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council to report progress. </para>

I do not know what better security than that a mortgagee could have. But by adopting a radius of fifty miles, we shall lock up a larger area than that covered by the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> If by the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> we exclude Bega, we also include a large area to the west not previously included. </para>

If we propose this ring fence round Dalgety, excluding Twofold Bay as a Federal port, we are much more likely to have a disagreement with the- House of Representatives than if we leave the matter as it stands.

                        <para>- Yes ; but the suggestion of the fifty-mile radius was not mine. Those who have brought the Committee into this position must take the responsibility for their own bungle. I am here to prevent injustice - though I- acknowledge the difficulty of the task - to the people with whose land we have no concern. It is the duty of those who want something tq tell the Committee what they want, and to provide an amendment accordingly. To attempt to take land which is not wanted, and in this way interfere with the daily occupations of people in order to secure Twofold Bay, appears ridiculous in the extreme. I suggest that, if necessary, we should report progress, with a view to the recommittal of the clause in order to further amend the amendment of Sena-&#39; tor Pearce, which appears to stand, in the way. I cannot conceive that the Committee, if we regard the matter seriously, can pass the clause in its present condition. If it be desired to have Twofold Bay, the best and most business-like course is to take the action necessary to have the clause recommitted, in order, as I&#39; say, to amend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> proposed amendment. </para>

                        <para>- If honorable senators think that the present&#39; discussion ought to extend over a week or a fortnight, thu arrangement about not sitting next week must be abandoned. I am quite prepared to report progress now, and come back tomorrow, and also next week; but I intend that we shall work reasonable hours until the measures which are before us have been dealt with. If, however, it is the desire of honorable senators that progress be reported, I move accordingly. Progress reported. </para>
