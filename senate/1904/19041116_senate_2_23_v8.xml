I intend to go thoroughly into the whole question of agricultural bonuses with the State Governments during the recess. This does not mean that I am seeking to put the question aside. The fact is that if agricultural industries are to be fostered the Federation must co-operate with the States, for the States have, through their Agricultural Departments, all the machinery for getting into intimate touch with the producers. Though we alone can grant the bonuses, I feel that we should work with the States Governments wherever possible. As I intend to meet the States' Ministers, I do not want to lay down a policy now all cut and dried, and then go to the States and say they must adopt it. With regard to the cotton industry, I am extremely anxious that something should be done to foster it. I shall, therefore, give very special attention to it during recess. The question, after all, is a serious Imperial one, as well as a matter deeply affecting Australians. The position of Great Britain is very serious. If the United States liked to put an export duty on cotton, Lancashire would be in desperate straits, if not ruined. I shall certainly do all I can to help the cotton industry in the Commonwealth." </para>

I am prepared to advance additional reasons in support of that amendment, but I refrain from doing so now in view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> has circulated an amendment, which is not by any means all that honorable senators ora this side would desire, and is less than the Government demand, but which is better than nothing.

Honorable senators opposite, in discussing the proviso, have forgotten the real object of the Bill which they will allow me to remind them is industrial, and not political. The clause, as- at present drafted, contains two special provisos, one regarding the application of the funds of organizations, and the other regarding the rights of their members to " do anything of a political character." </para>

                        <para>- I wish to speak first with reference to that part of the proviso which deals with the application of the funds of an organization. One of the most forcible criticisms which can be offered against such a Bill as this is that while ample security is provided for the enforcement of penalties against employers, there remain grave doubts whether a penalty, imposed under the Bill, could be enforced against employes. 'The basic principle is, as far as possible, to secure that penalties may. be enforced against both sides, and it is for that purpose the Bill recognises organizations. It deals with organizations amongst other reasons, because the criticism that a penalty under its provisions could not be enforced against employes, can be met so far as it is practicable to meet it by providing that" the funds of organizations shall be available to satisfy a verdict given against employes. </para>

                        <para>- Of course; this is an industrial Bill. Honorable senators who are anxiously regarding the conditions of working men must recognise that the criticism to which I have referred is a fair one, and yet the amendment at present under discussion, and, in fact, every amendment which has been suggested on ii h this clause, has had the object, amongst others, of doing away with that security - the security for costs, if honorable senators please - which is provided by the first part of the proviso to which so much exception is taken. I say that if this Bill is ever to be a success no hand must be laid upon any provision which meets the criticism to which I have referred by providing a fund which shall be available for the enforcement of penalties if an award is given against employes. This provision is essential if the Bill is to cut fairly both ways ; and if honorable senators opposite were .to succeed in removing the guarantee of fair play here provided, they would be doing more harm to the cause of industrial conciliation and arbitration than would be done bv the neglect to pass such legislation, or than would be done if we had never touched the subject. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that, but I am at present dealing with the part of the proviso which refers to the application of the funds of organizations. I say that no man who desires that effect shall be given to this Conciliation and Arbitration Bill will in any way weaken the force of the answer here provided to the criticism that the funds of organizations might not be available to meet penalties imposed upon employes. I know that many men who oppose this legislation, wrongly in my opinion, fall back continuously upon the argument that, while a penalty can be enforced against employers, it cannot be enforced against employes, and I say that it is the duty of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> and every honorable senator opposite to meet that argument in every possible way by providing that not a penny of the funds of an industrial organization shall be taken for any purpose outside the purposes of industrial organization. </para>

                        <para>- I grant that, and that is the only reference the honorable senator can find to it, and those words were put in after the Bill had been introduced. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> mean to contend for a moment that an association means a trade union because those words are in the Bill. The basic principle of the Bill is industrial organization. It proposes that these organizations shall begin absolutely <inline font-style="italic">de novo,</inline> and why? As we are all agreed, this Bill is an attempt, and on the part of many of us an honest attempt, to prevent strikes. We know that strikes were not prevented when trade unions were in full swing. One of the chief works done by trade unions was at the time of strikes to enable men to more approximately realize their ideal of justice than they would have been able to do if they had acted as units. That was the principal object of trade unions, and I frankly admit that very good work has in this way been done by them. I say, further, that if we do not intend to pass this Bill, trade unions should not only maintain their present strength., but their continual object should be to increase their numbers! and strengthen their effective power for the protection of working men. Every one must recognise that the individual, as a unit, cannot do the work which can be done by a trade union or association. But it was to meet strikes that trade unions were justified. It was for that purpose that they were encouraged by my honorable friends opposite. But in this Bill we decide to adopt a totally new way of dealing with strikes and locks-out. We have found that the old method of settling them is unsatisfactory. The very fact that we adopt a different method compels us to begin <inline font-style="italic">de novo,</inline> and to have new industrial organizations altogether. That is the point which honorable senators opposite are now grasping, but they grasp it reluctantly. This Bill is absolutely based upon new industrial organizations. </para>

I admit that under certain circumstances members of organizations should have preference under the measure, because if the organizations, and not isolated individuals, are to be responsible, some advantage should be given to them. But I differ entirely from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> and others when they wish to bring in, not industrial preference, but political preference.

                        <para>- I am not so wholly innocent as not to be able to extract from the attitude of honorable senators opposite, and from some of their interjections, what they mean'. In every speech they have shown that there is something political in what they require; and I say distinctly that they will not be satisfied if there is not left to them a hole large enough through which to jamb all they want. I shall oppose every attempt to bring in anything like political preference, and in doing so shall be giving loyal assistance to pass this Bill through Parliament. I am desirous to see the measure placed upon the statute-book. I admit that I am not sanguine about its success, but it is an experiment that we should fairly try so long as it is based upon the recognition of industrial organizations, and not political organizations. Many criticisms have been offered against the Bill, and against the objections of honorable senators opposite. The opponents of the measure have cited a particular case. I have no doubt that honorable senators know the case to which I refer. If the clause is permitted to remain as it stands, the unions will be prevented from shutting their doors, and the Bill will to that extent, curtail the political ambitions of many of the existing organizations. </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable senator say that the decision was never given ? He cannot. The object and intention of the latter part of the clause is this : to open the doors of the industrial organizations as widely as possible, so that every workman may enter, subject, of course, to his perfectly laudable desire to obtain preference. That being so, I say again that honorable senators opposite would, from my point of view, be extremely foolish if they attempted to interpose any obstacle in the way of any man who wanted to enter an organization that ought to be wholly and solely industrial. I believe that if any amendment is made in the clause, the organizations will not be wholly industrial. My object in supporting the measure is to bring about industrial peace, and, as far as possible, to prevent a political complexion being painted upon the Bill. I should like to say also that it has been perfectly obvious during the debate that the whole question of industrial peace, and of settling and preventing industrial strife has disappeared. Honorable senators opposite stand confessed as arguing with extreme enthusiasm and desperate earnestness to bring about certainly not industrial peace-- </para>

                        <para>- I am saying what I honestly think, but I do not wish to say anything that is unfair. If the object be to bring about industrial peace by strengthening the hands of the Labour Party politically, they will never do it. But in all the amendments which have been moved or suggested in regard to this clause, there is one purpose sticking out, and that is to lend a political colour to the industrial organizations which the Bill as it stands absolutely denies to t'hem. Something has been said about party politics. With me it is not a question of party politics at all. I object to the introduction of politics in any shape or form. If we once depart from the industrial lines on which this Bill has been framed, we shall make a mistake and introduce an element of weakness. If an alteration in this clause were not likely to assist the Labour Party, I should oppose it just as strongly. I object to the industrial organizations having anything whatever to do with politics. </para>

The earnestness of honorable senators opposite would induce one to believe that a considerable amount o'f political action was involved, and that it was not entirely non-party action. They have been zealous in their efforts to introduce a political element in this clause. </para>

                        <para>-Col. GOULD. - That is one of the mistakes of the New South Wales law. We know perfectly well what happened in connexion with the Australian Workers' Union and a dispute which it had with another shearers' association. Men would not join the Union for the reason that the rules required they should vote in accordance with the direction of the executive. </para>

                        <para>.- I believe that that statement has also been denied. But, after all, that is beside the question. We know perfectly well that in the other Chamber, when this measure was being discussed, there was a warm debate with regard to this particular proposal, and, as I am informed, the proviso under discussion, in the shape in which it now appears, received the approval of the leader of the Labour Party in that House. If that be the case, and if there be a strong feeling in the other House with regard to the form of the clause, where is the necessity for altering it? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will be on his knees to the other House before long, if that House declines to accept the amendments of this Chamber. Ought we to adopt an amendment which will enable industrial organizations to be converted deliberately into political organizations? I understand preference to mean that any man in a particular trade, if he joins an industrial organization, shall be entitled to receive his share of the work that may be going. There may be men who are strong free-traders or protectionists, but who may object to the labour politics of some of the unions. They would object to join a union, if it adopted a political policy. We ought not to impose any bar to such men becoming members of organizations, when those organizations become entitled to preference. Is it to be said that if a man's views are not those of the majority of an organization he is not to be allowed to have work, because he cannot honestly join that association? With all the views I entertain as to the unfairness of giving preference to any particular union, I am willing to admit that the men who are so strongly in favour of preference being given . say; " We want to do a fair thing between the men and the trade." </para>

                        <para>.- If honorable senators agree that every man, no matter what his political views may be should be entitled to join an organization, and participate in the right to preference, the fairest way is to stick to the clause as it is, and not to introduce an element of grave uncertainty. Notwithstanding the Act, a trade union will have a perfect right to pass whatever regulations it may think fit, so long as they are within the law. But it is not a trade union in the ordinary sense of the term which is to get the benefits of this legislation. Half-a-dozen trade unions will be free to form one organization, which will be recognised by the Court, and whose members will probably hold different views on political questions. One member might be in favour of the Government, and another strongly opposed to its policy. How could these men be brought into an organization if they thought that its funds could be devoted to the purposes of one party or the other, or if they thought that pressure would be brought to bear upon them to contribute in a special direction? </para>

                        <para>- This clause will prevent any member of an organization being compelled to contribute to a fund for political purposes. We know that in a strong organization or union pressure can be brought to bear upon dissentients, which will either compel them to assist in any proposed political action or cause them to occupy such a position that it will be almost impossible for them to meet their fellow members. We do not wish to see anything of that kind. I think it would be a mistake on the part of those who favour this legislation to alter the clause. Even if the amendment were carried here, it would not be accepted by the other House, and ultimately it would be found that several day's had been wasted in discussing an amendment by which we were not prepared to stand. I anticipate that by-and-by several honorable senators will discover a reason for changing their views; in order that the Bill may not be imperiled. </para>

If they make the statements designedly, it is no compliment to them or their honesty. But if they are made from sheer want of knowledge, that is another matter. Times out of number, by interjection, it has been denied that the funds of trade unions have been appropriated for political purposes. I challenged honorable senators on the other side to cite one case of that kind. </para>

                        <para>- It is a positive pain to the. press to tell one atom of truth with regard to the Labour Party. If the editor of a daily newspaper were seen sitting between Ananias and Sapphira he would be in the bosom of his family. I challenge any honorable senator to cite a case where union funds have been used for political purposes. </para>

                        <para>- This is not a betting chamber, else I should be prepared to bet my continuance in this position against an orange that it could not be shown. The fact remains that trade unions have never used union funds for political purposes. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> would only procure a book of the rules, he would learn that every contribution is allocated to a particular purpose. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> what he meant by the term " funds," and he replied that he did not intend to go over old ground. There is a weekly contribution by the members allocated to a certain purpose. The officials of a union may use other funds, but are they union funds ?In his sheer ignorance <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has said something which he cannot substantiate. I object to this brazen attempt to " bull-doze ' ' the general public into thinking that we desire to take advantage of this measure for political purposes. As a matter of fact, the boot is on the other foot. Honorable senators opposite wish to enact a provision to stop us from having any political ideas. </para>

                    <para>- In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson,</inline> I say frankly that if I could kill this Bill I would. I am against preference in any form, and I base my opinion upon the verdict which was given this year in the United States, and in which it was laid down that a preference is unconstitutional, and against the' liberties of the citizens. I have risen to refer to the tame manner in which my honorable friends opposite are to-day viewing the political aspect of this questions, whilst last week, hour after hour was spent by them in expressing their views as to the importance of the political phase of the question, and pointing out how trade unions have, to a very great extent, been the means by which the condition of the classes has been ameliorated. Honorable senators opposite have tried to show that infinite injury will be done to trade unionists if the political aspect is not recognised in this Bill, and if they are not, under it, allowed to carry on a crusade in the same direction. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie waxed so eloquent  on  the matter that  he  made certain statements which were scarcely correct, and somewhat exaggerated. He entered upon a philippic against what he called "the Manchester School," and claimed for the old unionism the credit of all that has been done in the United Kingdom, and to a certain extent in Australia, to remedy the grievances of the workers, and to make their lives happier. I contend that the people who did most for the amelioration of the working classes in the old country were the middle classes of the United Kingdom, though I admit that they were assisted by trade unionists as individuals. Will honorable senators tell me that such men as Robert Owen, Lord Shaftesbury, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> did nothing for the working classes? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator mentioned the name of Lord Shaftesbury, but there were others also - John Bright, Richard Cobden, and Titus Salt. Imagine <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie going to any English constituency and telling the people that, apart from the fiscal question altogether, John Bright and Richard Cobden did nothing for the working classes. Those men sacrificed more for the amelioration of the working classes of England than almost any other men whose names could be mentioned. It is strange to hear honorable senators opposite saying today that the political factor is not of the importance which they attached to it last week. We should look at the question fairly and squarely, and I remind honorable senators of what has been said by two ex-Ministers of the Crown, the present leader of the Opposition and the ex-Minister of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson. Senator McGregor</inline> frankly confessed that the Bill would be used principally and primarily as an organizing Bill. He did not say that it would be used as an organizing Bill to prevent strikes, and it therefore must be for some other purpose. We have had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> anticipating the time when all trade unionists would be organized in one body and all' employers in another. </para>

What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> suggests means either that' employers and employes are, between them, going to squeeze the public, or that employes, as a strong army, are going to use their power on behalf of Collectivism. Honorable senators opposite believe in placing all industries into the hands of the State. That is the goal at which they are aiming, and it appears to me that they are trying to .reach it by means of this Bill. They desire to make use of this measure to carry on their political propaganda, and not only as an instrument for the prevention of strikes. </para>

                        <para>- He does, and he also shows that it has done them a great deal of harm. The suggestion apparently now is that there should be community of interest between employers and employes. The employers are to find that the only way out of the difficulty in which they will be placed by this legislation is to combine with the employes to fleece the public. I do not suggest that in an offensive way, but I say that the mass of the people have had their living expenses increased as the result of the operation of the Arbitration Act in New Zealand, and that is owing to collusion between workers and employers. If the ideals of honorable senators opposite are realized in Australia, we shall have the two bodies combined, with the result that the public will be flattened out between them, because living expenses will be increased all round ; or else the employes, by the power they will be able to exert, will gp further in the direction of State control of industry, which, in my opinion, would, so far as the working classes themselves are concerned, be the most cruel and tyrannical course 'which could be adopted. We had four years of domination by the Labour Party in New' South Wales, during which we have had the ideas of Collectivism- in operation, and they have proved most inimical to the working classes themselves, though for a time they lived in the land of Goshen. It is impossible for the country to progress unless capitalists here and at home have sufficient confidence to induce them to invest in its development. I have stated my views of the ideals for which members of the Labour Party are striving, and what I think would be the consequences of their realization. Today they do not appear to think that the political aspect of the question is of much importance, though they laid very great stress upon it last week. </para>

                        <para>- If I felt that I had convinced honorable senators that they should vote to destroy this Bill, I should resume my seat in a moment. We are told that unions will not register under it, and I therefore dp not see why honorable senators opposite should bother very much about it. If they are prepared to do anything which will have the effect of destroying the Bill, I can promise them my assistance. In his very able speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> demonstrated the position which organizations will occupy under this Bill in a manner which was a revelation to me. I had not previously grasped the distinction which there will be between the old unions and the new unions under this Bill. Honorable senators opposite, should recognise that in agreeing to preference to unionists, some honorable senators on this side have made considerable sacrifices of their views, because they honestly believe that it infringes the liberties of the people. </para>

                        <para>- What do they think of the views expressed by one of the New Zealand Judges when he decided against the opinions of the Labour Party? If we are to consider the views expressed from the judicial bench on the one side, we should also consider them when they are on the other side of the question. Nothing has been said by the employers against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jusitce</inline> Cohen that is half so objectionable as has been said on the other side against Chief Justice Darley, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Parker, and one of the New Zealand Judges. I contend that a Supreme Court Judge is not a proper person to take into consideration the thousand and one various matters connected with business. With the best intentions in the world, he must be influenced by the strong expert man sitting either on his right or on his left. My admiration for the judicial bench, as a whole, and for the honesty and integrity of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Cohen, is not weakened in the slightest degree, notwithstanding the opinion I have expressed, namely, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Cohen has given verdicts which, from a business point of view, are scarcely intelligible to a business man. </para>

The union had the audacity to go to the Court to ask for the cancellation of the Machine Shearers' Union, arguing that there was one big union which the workers could rely upon ; and when it was held by the Court that an organization which had rules of this character rendered it impossible for many men' to join, the union attempted to make an alteration in the rules. It did that simply in order that it might destroy the other union which it regards as antagonis-tic to its interests. </para>

                        <para>.- I say that the Court declined to order the cancellation of the Machine Shearers' Union, because it was not possible for many men to' join a union which had rules of this character staring them in the face. The Workers' Union altered its rules in order to bring about the cancellation of the Machine Shearers' Union. Fortunately, even that did not succeed. I was challenged to show any instance. Here is an instance, and if honorable senators would like to go further; it could' be shown that there is a newspaper; <inline font-style="italic">The Worker,</inline> which published the names of members who were black-listed, and this paper was supported by the funds of the  Union:.'  It was- purely apolitical newspaper,, started and supported by money drawn  out  of the funds which individual members of the union subscribed; and devoted entirely to the advocacy of the political views of the parties who were running it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's amendment would permit this kind of thing to go on. Such a case as that in which the Machine Shearers' Union was concerned could not occur in an organization registered under this Bill if this proviso remained in it. But take the proviso out, and there will be nothing to prevent such a set of rules as the Australian Workers' Union had being passed by any organization. This shows the undesirability of accepting such an amendment as that proposed. An organization ought not to be permitted to use its funds for any political purposes whatever. </para>

The whole spirit of the Bill is against it. What is the object of giving preference? Is it to give facilities for persons holding particular views to obtain employment, or is it simply for the purpose of enabling organizations to register to carry out the provisions of the Bill ? </para>

But while we are going to protect him, we must not render it impossible for any man to join a union on account of its political policy. If the unions are permitted to devote their funds to political purposes many men will be unable to join them. </para>

                    <para>A good deal has been said in reference to the Australian Workers' Union and a bogus union. I happened to be professionally employed in that case. I was employed by the Australian Workers' Union. I wish to say that I absolutely sympathized with the Australian Workers' Union in every shape and form. The case in question constituted a sheer conspiracy on the part of some pastoralists and some working men of a type in which I do not believe. -It was a positive conspiracy to create a bogus union, and their action was not fought with the aid of working men's subscriptions, but with money which came from quite another source. I look, with as great detestation as any man can, upon the action of men - whether they be employers or workmen - who can be bought over to thwart the honest desire of their fellows to do a very proper and beneficent thing. </para>

                    <para>- It has been stated this afternoon that honorable senators on this side attach much less importance to the political aspect of this clause to-day than they did last week. No one on this side has indicated that we do, , and we have ample justification for making a complaint in that regard. No provision has ever been brought forward here in;mytime with less reason for its existence than the one which we are seeking to amend. If the statements of its supporters are to be relied upon, there is not an instance where the Government have more persistently stuck to a shadow than they are doing on this occasion. Last week the Attorney-General said, " We ask you to give us bread, and you offer us a stone." For years and years the people outside the industrial barriers have been crying for bread, and certainly on this occasion they are offered a stone. After years of effort on the part of those who wish not to lay hold of some one by the hair, but to secure an equitable .system of settling industrial disputes, honorable senators on the other side say, "We are prepared to give you an opportunity to settle your industrial disputes if you will give up all the rights and liberties that belong to the political welfare of this nation. In other words, if you will allow us, like our forefathers, to run the show without restraint, we are prepared to give you a modicum of justice in recognition of your industrial efforts." The political rights of the members of these organizations were won by making great sacrifices. A mere shadow is. being held out to trade unions, while . the substance is being filched from them by a provision which has no other end in view than that of preventing industrial organizations from exercising the privilege which every man feels that it is .his bounden duty to exercise. I. thought that the time had passed in Australia when political liberties would be questioned. I imagined that we were safe from the ravages of that old notion which prevailed centuries ago, and which took very deep root in the minds of the people - namely, that the classes were a heaven-created element to enjoy, whilst the masses were a heaven-created element to provide their enjoyment. But when I took up this Bill, and read a provision which withdraws from a man an old established privilege, I thought .that we were returning to the dark days. I was reminded of an occasion when I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> pointing out how dangerous it was for the British Government to rule a country with an iron hand, instead of with intelligence. We have come back to the old Irish Coercion Acts, and it is questionable whether the 'phraseology of their provisions has not been borrowed by the framers of. this Bill. </para>

No one can furnish a logical reason in favour of a provision which seeks to take away a civil right from a man. Trade unionists are asked to give up their political rights in order that they may obtain preference, and may be protected. </para>

                        <para>- No ; but against the tyranny of those who care little for unionists and non-unionists. We desire to protect the unionists against the .tyranny of those who wish all' industrial legislation to be swept off the statute-book in order that they may be able .to return to the good old times of which they sometimes sing, when pie and plum-pudding were all their own, and workmen got their potatoes and salt. It has been urged that the Bill does not seek to take away any man's political rights, and that. if a union wants preference, all it is required to do is to register for the purposes of the Act. The legal luminaries here tell us trial: all we require to do is simply to build up a new organization under a set of rules which will scarcely provide for anything except registration. From the theoretical point of view it may suit the legal luminaries to argue on those lines. Let me tell honorable senators that they have so little experience of these things that they have not yet grasped the rudiments of trade unionism and its operations. I take the case of a union in Western Australia, comprising 9,000 or 10,000 members, and having some seventy or eighty branches. It has rules which are generally speaking uniform for all the .branches, though in some instances they are framed to meet local conditions. It is registered under the Arbitration Act of Western Australia, and, in order that no advantage shall be taken of the Act, the rules have to be placed before the Registrar, as provided in this Bill. But we find that this Bill contains a provision which at once contradicts the statements of our legal friends that this is a very simple matter. In the latter part of clause 40, we have provided - </para>

                <para class="block">If that means anything, it means that we must submit a copy of the rules of our organization when we present ourselves for registration under this Bill. The proviso which is now under discussion, informs us that we shall have no preference so long as our rules or other binding decisions permit the application of our funds to political purposes. What political purposes are has never been denned by honorable, senators opposite for the reason that every man of intelligence must recognise that they cannot be denned. No man can tell where political interest begins and ends in such organizations. It has been clearly shown that trade unions, in the interests of the preservation of the health and lives of their members, must be political organizations. Surely men who profess to be imbued with the humanitarian spirit, recognise these things, and I cannot for the life of me see how honorable senators opposite can continue to stultify their reason by supporting such a proviso as this. The amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is all that should be attempted in the way of amending this proviso. I admit that the Attorney-General contends that it does not take what he chooses to term "the viciousness " out of some; provisions. The only viciousness that can be shown here, is that which is embodied in the proviso to which the Attorney-General so persistently clings. Surely it is not vicious to give men liberty, and to allow trade unionists to spend their money as they please, so long as they do not attempt, in doing so, to wilfully injure other people? Whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's amendment would allow an organization, where its members are unanimous, to expend its funds for .political purposes, that is only what must be recognised as the inalienable right of all organizations. Honorable senators opposite tell us that we are not now dealing with unions, but with some bodies which they term "industrial organizations." They are taking a phantasmagoric view of something which is going to arise under this Bill, but about which nothing is yet known. Personally, I have never known of a trade union that was other than an industrial organization. Trade unions are industrial organizations with necessary political aspirations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has said that last week we announced our intention to bring political organizations within the scope of this Bill. But the honorable and learned senator must be aware that no one ever made any such statement. </para>

                        <para>- Any man who would make such a statement must be beside himself. What interest has a purely political organization in this Bill ? What object could it have in registering under such a measure? A .political organization pure and simple_ concerns itself only with the political welfare of one party or another, but trade unions are industrial organizations, with aspirations and necessities that compel them also to toe political organizations. The amendment must meet all the requirements of honorable senators opposite unless they wish to lay themselves open to the suspicion that there is not one vestige of sincerity in their advocacy of ' the great principle of arbitration ; ' that they are simply advocating the principle at the present time as a make-belief, whilst they intend on some other opportunity to throttle it. It lias been well said that the proviso, if brought into effect as it stands, would at once shut the doors of the Arbitration Court against every trade union or industrial organization that now exists in Australia. It will absolutely prevent any attempt at organization for the purpose of registration under this measure, and by agreeing to such a proviso we shall defeat the whole of the objects of this Bill. Organization is certainly a basic principle of the Bill, and it has been shown that preference is protection. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Cohen has not minced matters in dealing with the question in New South Wales, for he tells us that the New South Wales Act is based on the principle of preference, and he has extended it in accordance with the Act. Here in the Federal Parliament, which should be the most advanced Parliament in Australia, we are asked to insert a provision for preference; then by another clause, to agree to destroy the principle, and finally by the use of the word "permit" to ' get back to the old days when men were ruled by the pressure of coercion instead of by intelligence and light.  We are asked by this proviso to bring out all the vice and all the cunning of which human nature is capable, instead of to adopt the true principle of the Bill, which aims at inducing men to exercise the highest and noblest traits in defence of themselves, and for the protection of their kind. </para>

                <para class="block">In dealing with my amendment, I think it will be just as well to review the position in which we find ourselves on this clause; and I propose to do so as shortly as possible. First of all, the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> practically aimed at striking out the whole proviso. The result would have been that the organizations under the Bill would have been able to use any funds in their possession for any political purpose, whether party or otherwise, and would have been able to bring compulsion to bear on their members to take part in political strife at the dictation of the organization. I do not say that any organization would ever have used that power, but they would have been able to move in that direction. I based my objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe's</inline> amendment on the view that had been expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> that the organizations under this Bill to be of any value would be registered as new organizations, and that the old and at present existing unions would not be found practically registering under the Bill as organizations, though undoubtedly they would have the right so to register. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe's</inline> amendment, as the Committee will remember, was rejected. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie then moved an amendment. It was a very cleverly framed amendment, the result of which would have been that organizations would have been left with the power to use any funds at their disposal for political purposes, whether party or otherwise. But there was this restriction placed upon them - that if they desired to obtain preference for their members under any award given by the Court under this Bill, they would have been obliged to omit any clause in their rules requiring their members to take any political action of a party nature. I think that explains concisely the drift, though not exactly the wording of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's amendment. I objected equally strongly to that amendment, because the view which I took, as I explained to the Committee, was this - that we were compelling men either to do without work or else to join the unions ; that the unions would be supported by the funds subscribed by every man who joined them, and that it was unfair to ask any workman to join a union whose funds could be used for supporting a political party to which he was opposed. Those were broadly my grounds of objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's amendment. I felt that it would be atrociously unfair to put men in the position of either having to go without their bread, or of supporting political action of which they were not in favour. Under these circumstances, of course, I found myself unable in the last division to vote with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. But up to this time I had been absolutely of the opinion following <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> that fell these organizations would inevitably, under this Bill have to be new organizations, and that the old unions would continue to exist and. carry on political action of a party nature. But, as the debate proceeded, Senator Pearce made it perfectly clear that, under clauses 62, 63, and 64 of the Bill, power was given to the Governor-General to proclaim existing unions and force them to become organizations under the Bill - forcing them, at the same time, to adopt new rules which, if the clause under discussion were left as it stands at present, would take from them many of the rights which, as unions, they now have. Under these circumstances, it became clear to me that some sort of compromise would have to be arrived at - at any rate, so far as I was concerned - between the clause as it stands and the desire which has been so strongly expressed on the part of honorable senators opposite, that some greater scope should be given to the organizations in the employment of their funds. My honorable friends opposite have practically come down to this - that as they cannot obtain for their organizations the right to use their funds without control for political purposes, they would be content with half a loaf, which, from their point of view, would be better than no bread; and they are prepared to agree to an amendment, which would have the effect of preventing the funds of organizations being used for party politics, but, at the same time, would leave those funds completely available for any movement in the direction of what we may call domestic politics, dealing with the occupations of the members of the organizations. Therefore, under the circumstances, and considering clauses 62, 63, and 64, I find myself quite prepared to support their views. But the initial difficulty was how to define the difference between party politics and agitation for industrial reform. That is really where the difficulty arises. I think I may fairly claim that the amendment which I now propose defines the difference as clearly as any amendment can do. What I wish to emphasize is this : that the objections of nearly every honorable senator who has spoken on this subject, both in the Senate and in another place, have been to the use of the funds of the organizations for party political purposes. I want to lay particular stress upon that point, because, judging from conversations which I have had an attempt will be made to get past it altogether. The emphasis which has been laid so strongly on the party politics side of the argument will be slurred over, and honorable senators will now say - as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> did this afternoon, knowing that my amendment was to be proposed - that no funds should be employed for any political purpose, whether for the amelioration of the conditions of the workers, or for party politics. It is therefore desirable that the attention of the Committee should be turned to the utterances, at any rate of the leaders, in dealing with this question, so that the rank and file of. each party may understand exactly how they stand. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> at page 6828,' said- </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator did not; but the only interpretation that can be placed upon that utterance is that it is in opposition to party politics, because it is perfectly clear that all the workers in an organization must be unanimous in supporting any movement for the amelioration of the conditions of their employment, the increase of their pay, or the shortening of their hours of work. Therefore, in dealing with these three topics it would be quite impossible for any man who was obliged to join a union to barter his political freedom. That is a point which I wish to impress upon' honorable senators in reference to my amendment. On these three topics every man who compulsorily joins a union must inevit-ably be in accord; and if every member of a union agrees no injustice is done to any one individual. Under these circumstances, if, in order to obtain work preferentially, a man is obliged to join one of these organizations, no injustice is done to him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> further said, dealing with an existing trade union or organization - </para>

Then again, we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson.</inline> Here I quote from the other side. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> said that he was prepared to accept an amendment which would have the effect of preventing preference being given to unions if they have in their rules anything relating to politics which is likely to detrimentally affect any persons who may desire to join them. </para>
                <para class="block">What I maintain is this : that if anything could prejudiciously affect a workman joining an organization, it would be entirely eliminated by the amendment which I have placed before the Committee. So that, I think, I may fairly claim that my amendment is of such_ a nature that I can appeal to honorable senators on both sides to support it as a fair compromise, and one under which the rights of the majority of the workers, as well as of the minority, have been amply safeguarded. Of course, some honorable senators - as will possibly happen - may get up, and say, " How are you going to define conditions of labour? Will it not be possible to make the term, conditions of labour,' apply to all sorts of things outside what the intention of the Committee is?" All I can say is, that, "conditions of labour " is a well -recognised phrase, and it is perfectly well known to what cases it applies. It is perfectly well known what classes of agitation would come under the heading of agitations in connexion with conditions of labour. It is simply splitting hairs to endeavour to read into that expression a number of matters which no Court and no Judge would permit to be read into it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is trying to beg the question. We are not talking of the purposes for which ordinary newspapers are conducted. Evidently the honorable senator imagines that a newspaper could be brought out under my provision, and that it could be run to advocate the interests of particular candidates at an election, as though that were a matter that would come under the heading "conditions of labour." My reason for considering that my amendment is a compromise is this - that we have already seen that existing unions can be proclaimed by the Governor-General. The existing unions have the fullest political rights that any individual enjoys. The Seamen's Union, for instance, is able to carry on a political agitation in every State. If it were proclaimed by the Governor-General it would be debarred from exercising this privilege, so long as it expected to get any preference for its members. Is that just? I am satisfied that no fair-minded person outside the Chamber would think it just. This afternoon, an honorable senator objected to the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, because he said it had no chance of being accepted in another place. Obviously, that objection cannot apply to my amendment. I do not see how any honorable members in that House, unless their minds are saturated with prejudice against these organizations and the Bill itself, could possibly object to allowing industrial organizations to move  and agitate in industrial matters. The three topics on which my amendment touches - the hours, the conditions, and the remuneration of labour - are essentially industrial matters with which an organization, formed under the Act, should have the fullest powers to deal. I am satisfied that if it were not for the unfortunate circumstance that the Attorney-General as a member of the Government is obliged to support the Bill as it stands, he would be the first to support this amendment. </para>

                        <para>- There are very strong reasons for that. It is because of that very earnestness that I have taken up that attitude. But whilst I am most anxious to consider every amendment, and to listen to everything which is urged in its support, I am equally anxious to convince honorable senators of the view I take. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> appealed to me on the ground that if I were not in charge of the Bill I should be more prepared to consider, probably favorably, his amendment. He is entirely mistaken in that respect. I am just as disposed to listen to his persuasive accents in advocating his amendment as if the Bill had not come up here after it had been exhaustively dealt with elsewhere. While my honorable friend was speaking I was trying to find out why the amendment was being moved. He appeals to me particularly on the ground that it is such a small concession to make. Either it is microscopically small, or it is mischievous. </para>

                        <para>- Surely my honorable friend does not wish his name to be associated with an amendment which will be idle and superfluous. The pathetic appeal he made to us not to reject the amendment because it is such a very little one seems to me to suggest that there is a desire on the part of honorable senators to amend the clause in some way, no matter how, so long as they can preserve a political colour, or give a political handle to a particular organization. </para>

                        <para>- For goodness sake let us deal with the subject which is under the consideration pf this Parliament, and that is disputes which extend beyond the limits of a State. It is with these organizations only that we are dealing. We have said- in the Bill that when any dispute arises as to the 'hours, terms, and conditions of labour, there is to be no political agitation. You are not to have a political party founded on an agitation as to» those matters, but you are to go peacefully to the Court and have them settled. My honorable friend1 has misunderstood the whole purpose of the Bill. He is absolutely driving a mine of the most deadly character under its whole scheme. I am sorry that he has moved the amendment, because either it is an idle and superfluous addition of words, or it means that every union may be a political organization so long as its foundation is to take action in respect of the hours, conditions, or remuneration of labour. That is impossible under the Bill ; but if it is possible, it is more mischievous than any amendment which has yet been suggested. My honorable friend asks what action can be taken except by a reference to the Court Of course, none. The Court is substituted for political agitations, and my honorable friends either want to destroy that or else they desire, by this insidious amendment, to make the Parliament a Court of Appeal, with all the mischiefs of political disturbance, from the Court of Arbitration. To my mind, no language is better fitted to prevent preference being given to a political organization than the language which is adopted in this clause. I thought that there was some foundation for the criticism about the words "require" the members of an organization to " do anything of a political character." But the first part of the proviso defines a body which is industrial and political as a body which permits the application of its funds to political purposes. No one can take exception to that. What does the second part of the proviso do ? If a man is forced by an endeavour to secure employment and his daily bread to go into a union, there ought to be nothing in its rules or binding decisions to require him, unless he so wills it, to do anything of a political character'. Such a man may be a conservative or a radical, and not a member of the Labour Party. He may disagree with a programme, or with a political agitation as to hours, or anything else, and he has a right to. say, " I should not be compelled to join your organization and be bound by rules which may require me to do anything of a political character." </para>

                        <para>- If I can I am going to keep organizations under this Bill free from all suggestion that they are political bodies if they are to be allowed to ask for preference. That will be done effectually by the proviso, but it will be the Court which will have to decide whether the particular action challenged is political. There honorable senators will see that we have provided an absolute safeguard. Politics are, of course, a perfectly innocent and most excellent pursuit, and some action might be taken which would not be. held by the Court to be action of a political character. In this connexion I should like honorable senators to listen to the definition of " politics " and "politician." My objection to the use of the word "party " is that when we are speaking of "politics" the term "party politics" is but a limitation of the word The word "politics" includes and involves party politics, but " party politics " does not exhaust the meaning of the word. Honorable senators opposite have reminded me that the platform of the Labour Party does not include the fiscal question. Suppose, for illustration, that some labour unions chose to make the fiscal question a plank of their platform, and they would of course choose free-trade. </para>

                        <para>- It is intended to be sweeping, of course. There was no division on this proviso when introduced as an amendment' in another place, and I think the House of Representatives acted wisely in accepting it. It is undoubtedly difficult to define action of a political character, and in my opinion the words of the proviso have been well chosen, because it would be impossible to deal with the matter better than it is dealt with here. The intention is to prevent preference being given to an organization which is industrial, if honorable senators please, but which is also political, which permits its funds to be used for political purposes, or requires, and that is to say compels, any of its members to do anything of a political character. </para>

                        <para>- We do not require a lot of unnecessary words, which can have no effect. The addition, if made, will lead to the implication that organizations may be political in some things, and that political action may be taken in respect of these matters, which, under the Bill, are to be dealt with by the Court, and which should be dealt with by the Court only, and should not be made the subject of a political movement or agitation. I hope the honorable senator will withdraw his amendment. He has endeavoured to convince me that it is a very little one, and its very triviality should prevent its further progress. But if effect is to be given to it, it will be mischievous, because it will convert organizations which are otherwise industrial into organizations with a political colour, and what that may lead to one can hardly foresee. </para>

                    <para>- One good result of the amendments suggested to this clause will be probably that we shall eventually discover the motive which prompted the insertion of this proviso. We were first told that the reason for it was that, without it, by giving preference to trade unionists, we should drive men into unions, compel them to vote for political parties to which they were opposed, and to contribute funds for political purposes in which they did not believe. But we find now that honorable senators opposite have shifted their ground. We were first of all told that there was no objection to unions taking political action for industrial purposes, and that it was only when they became party organizations that any objection could arise. We now learn from the Attorney-General that political action of every sort is objected to, even though it should be pf an industrial character. It is, in the opinion of honorable senators opposite, obnoxious, and should be prevented. </para>

                        <para>- It is a ban, when preference fs asked for. Preference will naturally be asked" for on every occasion by trade unionists, in order to safeguard their position, and to prevent them being boycotted. I therefore assume that we are dealing with what will be the normal condition of affairs. The Attorney-General, in introducing the definition of "industrial matters," made a very clever attempt to drag the Committee away from the point at issue. The definition of " industrial matters" in this Bill merely means that where there is an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State, it can be settled by the Court, so far as it deals with the question defined in the interpretation of " industrial matters " ; but this Bill does not deal with the thousand and one questions which are covered by the term "industrial matters," either in the States or in the Commonwealth. The Court will deal with them in an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of one State, so far as the parties apply to have them dealt with, but the Court, will go no further. </para>

                        <para>- Only on the application of the parties, and then the .Court in its award will deal with the particular industrial matters involved in the dispute; but that will not exhaust the term. If we take the case of a dispute in the shearing industry, the Court might make an award dealing with the hours, piece-work rates, and conditions of labour, but there is a condition of labour in this industry which the Court would not take into consideration. That is proved from the experience in New South Wales, where there is an arbitration law in force, with a greater scope than has this Bill. In that State it has been found necessary to bring in a special Bill to deal with the accommodation provided for shearers. As shearers have no choice but to accept the accommodation provided for them by their employers, the accommodation must be looked upon as a condition of their labour. That is a condition which in New South Wales the workers have only been able to improve by means of industrial political action,, taken through their union. </para>

                        <para>- No; it shows that the parties concerned considered that they would get what they desired more effectively by legislation than by an award of the Court. I take another example, which will be admitted to be pertinent to this Bill. If we take the case of the Seamen's Union, we have here men engaged in employment in which the accommodation provided for them must be regarded as a condition of their labour, because they have no choice but to accept it. How is it going to be regulated ? Is it by this Bill ? We know that it is not, and that it must be regulated bv a Navigation Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Even if we had a navigation law passed, I venture to think that no Arbitration Court would take it upon itself, by an award under this Bill, to impose conditions with respect to the accommodation to be provided for seamen on vessels plying in ' Australian waters.' I venture to say that the Attorney-General could be most strenuous in arguing that the Court should do nothing of the kind. Though the honorable and learned senator is strongly opposed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> amendment, he will not be so bold as to say that the Arbitration Court will make an award which might lead to the alteration o£ the accommodation provided for sailors on every ship on the Australian coast. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator may say that, but he knows that his own answer to a similar question must also be " Yes." My point is that, as we have other powers in the Constitution for dealing with seamen and shipping, it . is not likely that the Court would say that this Bill deliberately handed over to the Arbitration Court powers in that regard. </para>

                        <para>- It lays down the lines upon which the Court shall work. Without the amendment, the seamen would be unable to agitate for what they consider to be proper cubic space for them on board vessels, and for other reforms which, though the agitations may be said to be political, are certainly not partisan in any sense. Then, again, some honorable senators seem to forget that in connexion with the principal industries of Australia there are certain allied trades. There are trades allied to the shearing and other industries which would never come directly under the scope of this measure. But the shearing industry itself, being bound to some extent by the conditions prevailing in those allied trades, is intensely interested in participating in political action to ameliorate their conditions of labour, their rates of remuneration, and their hours of employment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> amendment goes beyond the particular trades which are. organized, and which may come under an award of the Court-. It gives an organization power to take part in political action on the lines indicated in connexion with other allied trades which are, strictly speaking, outside its own trade. It enables an organization to take part in political action for the purpose of assisting those allied trades which are inseparably associated with its own. There may be an associated trade which cannot get the benefit of an award of the Court, and is not strong enough in itself to take political action. Its conditions, however, may have a great deal to do with the conditions prevailing in <inline font-style="italic">\he</inline> trade that is working under an award of the Court. We know that there are many industries that are associated in that manner. We also know that the conditions prevailing in one trade to a certain extent determine the conditions in other trades. Under this drastic proviso, if an allied trade is endeavouring to secure fair-play, a trade which was working under an award of the Court would not be able to come to its assistance, and to take part in what might be regarded as political action. It must be remembered that the Federal Arbitration Court does not touch occupations like those of the seamen and the shearers unless there is an Inter-State dispute. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> amendment seems to recognise that there are questions upon which organizations might desire to take political action of that kind, and that if they were debarred a deliberate injustice would be done to them. Another point which has to be remembered is that under clauses 62, 63, and 64, if the Seamen's Union, for example, were to say, " We will not consent to pay the price for preference which we are asked to pay, and will not register," then if there were a dispute between the seamen and their employers the Governor-General could proclaim their union an organization. They would be at once brought within the scope of the Bill, and compelled to give up all political action, because if they went into Court they would have to ask for preference unless they wished to sell' themselves body and soul to their employers, and give the employers a weapon by means of which they could disband the union. </para>

                        <para>- Their political organization would be scattered' to the four winds of heaven. It would remain outside the Bill. But the Governor-General could bring the old organization, robbed of all political power, under the Bill. Surely honorable senators have read clauses 62 to <inline font-style="italic">64,</inline> and know that the Governor-General has power to proclaim any organization. If the Seamen's Union said, "We do not think this Bill will be of any use to us, and we decline to register," and if later on there was a dispute in the shipping trade, the Governor-General could proclaim the Seamen's Union. Then what would happen would be this : If the rules of the union did not conform to the requirements of the measure, they would have to be altered. But there is something else which would have to go over with the union. The whole of its funds would go over with the organization proclaimed. </para>

                        <para>- Of course the funds would only be transferred for the purposes of this measure, but the Registrar would take very good care that they were not spirited away. I urge honorable senators to consider the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> proposal is a compromise. Personally, I do not think it goes far enough. I do not think it is quite fair. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's proposal was a fair one. But, nevertheless, this compromise might very well be accepted. It prevents the funds of the unions from being used for party political purposes, but it gives the unions power to agitate upon political lines concerning questions within the scope of the amendment. Under the amendment there could be no coercion used against any workman on account of his political opinions. Every one knows that the whole of the members of a union are interested in conditions affecting their employment. There are scores of matters which could be raised upon which they would desire to take action. Without this amendment, unions would even be prevented from taking any part in connexion with the administration of industrial Acts affecting their trades. Not only could the Registrar do that with organizations which might register under the Act, but through the agency of the Governor-General, he could rob existing organizations of the rights which they have enjoyed, and which might have induced them to remain outside its provisions. </para>

                        <para>- That does not tone down the provision, because the power could be used by the Government. Honorable senators opposite started the discussion on the preference clauses by saying that they were against coercion. But they are lending themselves to an instrument of coercion that will be infinitely stronger than anything which they have suggested the unions would be guilty of if there were no qualification of the preference. Those who object to coercion should be the first to accept the compromise offered by this amendment, because it provides that if any existing organization be proclaimed, although it will be deprived of the right to do political acts of a party character, still, it will have preserved to its members the right to take political action of an industrial character. </para>

We on this side were quite prepared to leave the regulation of preference to the Court. We did not wish the granting of preference to be restricted by any conditions with respect to either political action or social action. We were quite prepared to allow the Court to deal with the circumstances as they arose, and to grant or refuse preference as it thought fit. But there is a persistent endeavour to deprive organized labour of the right to take political action of any description when it wishes to get the benefits of this legislation. It is admitted by a majority of the Committee that for the protection of organized labour preference is really necessary. So far as the granting of preference is concerned, we were willing to leave the Court untrammeled ; but we were defeated. We have to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> for the very reasonable view he has taken. There are one hundred and one questions which interest organized labour, but which do not come within the scope of this measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has dealt with them comprehensively ; but there is another point of view which I desire to submit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has said, " You need not be alarmed. You can have your political organizations, your social organizations, and your industrial organizations, and you can also have a special organization to be registered under the. Act." </para>

                        <para>- It must be recollected that in Australia, as in other countries, the working classes are not all bank managers. It is quite sufficient for them to contribute to one industrial organization. For the purposes of insuring economy they wish that organization to be of as comprehensive a character as possible. If, however, they had to contribute to an organization for political purposes, to a benefit association, and to an organization to be registered under the Act, they could not meet the demands on their miserable wages. The result would be that there would be no organization, and the Act would be a dead letter. The Attorney-General has said that the Bill deals with every possible contingency in connexion with industrial work, whether social or political. By his specious arguments, he has led <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> to think so. I believe that the intention of the latter is to be fair to every class ; but if he will only look at the last portion of the clause, he will see that the members of an organization are not to be permitted to take political action of any kind. Now what is the object of an industrial organization? It is not formed simply for the purpose of dealing with differences of opinion which may arise between employers and employe's. . It is formed for the purpose of improving the social and industrial conditions of its members, and to secure as fair terms as possible in the various industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has pointed out what is likely to occur in connexion with the Australian Workers' Union and the Federated Seamen's Union. If any question has agitated the minds of the working classes, particularly in the building trade during the last ten or fifteen years, it has been the need of a Workmen's Lien Bill, to prevent an unprincipled speculator from mortgaging everything he has to a Christian bank manager, who will not part with a cent of that which he has acquired, even although he may know that hundreds of working men have had to go without their wages. </para>

                        <para>- Is not a question affecting the industrial welfare of the community a political question ? The Arbitration Court could not deal with a dispute in any matter which might arise under a Workmen's Lien Act. If the Bill be passed without some qualification, such as the amendment provides, it will be impossible for any industrial organization, asking for preference, to move in that direction, or to spend one penny for the purpose of promoting such legislation. Honorable senators on the other side want trade unionists to spend money in getting up an association for the purpose of advocating for such matters as the enactment of a Workmen's Lien Bill. Is it not of vast importance to a workman and his family that a measure should be passed for the purpose of giving some compensation to a workman who has met with a serious accident, or, in the event of his death, to his widow and family? If this amendment be not inserted no legislation of that description could be promoted or assisted by an organization registered under the Act if they asked for preference. 1 could point out a hundred and one other cases of that kind. Take the Federated Seamen's Union. For the last fifty years no question has been of more interest to the seafaring class than that of the depth to which a ship should be immersed. But in the absence of the amendment, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> wishes to insert in the clause, the Federated Seamen's Union would be powerless to spend a penny or take a single act in the direction of endeavouring to secure the passage of a Load Line Bill. In other parts of the world there are a summer load line and a winter load line, but on the coast of Australia there is only one load line, and sometimes very great difficulty is experienced in navigating vessels round the coast.

It is true that the Bill provides; that the Court shall deal with such matters in regard to any dispute spreading from one State to another, but these unions or organizations have other duties which they at present exercise in the different States. The Attorney-General seems to lose sight of that fact. I fail to see any reason why, having registered under this Bill, they should be compulsorily debarred from exercising such rights as the people of the various States choose to give them for purely industrial purposes. </para>

It is a matter of doubt whether matters in connexion with pay and the hours and conditions of labour are political questions, and my amendment is intended to clearly indicate that the Court is not to hold that these are political questions iri connexion with which the unions will be debarred from taking action. The contention of the Attorney-General is that the Bill provides for these matters to such an extent that my amendment is quite unnecessary. The honorable and learned senator contends that the Court will take cognizance of these questions under the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I find that what I Jack is the power possessed by ex-Senator Harney, who was able to. deal with ex-Senator O'Connor's arguments in such a way that he could not reply. That was because ex-Senator Harney was a lawyer. The members of the Committee know exactly what I desire, but I cannot deal with the Attorney-General, because he is a lawyer and I am a layman, and the honorable and learned senator is able, apparently, to rebut my arguments, when he really does nothing of the kind. </para>

                        <para>- I maintain that with the assistance, of the present Attorney-General and ex-Senator Harney, we did good work on the Tariff, and with verv much worse material than I am using now, we were able to win. I hope I have convinced the Committee that these unions, which are liable to be proclaimed as organizations under this Bill, have duties which they at present perform quite outside the scope of this Bill, and which it is my desire they should continue to perform. I could give many examples qf political action with which this Bill does not deal, and which it is eminently desirable that organizations should be in a position to take: There is one piece of legislation with which we have been materially concerned in Western Australia during the last month or two, and that is the Truck Act. That is an Act dealing with a condition of labour altogether outside the scope of this Bill. </para>

I shall stick' to that, because I have looked up the matter, and my contention in this respect is unassailable. Will the Attorney-General say that these organizations should be debarred from agitating for such a reform as the passing of a Truck Act ? If the honorable and learned senator makes that contention, I venture to say that very few people outside this Committee will support him. </para>

                        <para>- I have placed the honorable and learned senator iri a difficulty on the question of conditions. One of the most amusing things which have occurred during the debate was when the honorable and learned senator told the Committee that I had practically quoted the terms already used in the definition of " industrial matters," and then proceeded to read those terms. The honorable and learned senator read "hours, pay," terms, and conditions" - and then he hesitated before he read the words " of employment, " because "terms and conditions of employment" in no sense mean "conditions of labour." The terms and conditions of employment are the terms and conditions on which people are employed, whilst " conditions of labour " is a phrase used to describe the conditions under which labour is performed. </para>

                        <para>- The expression "conditions of labour" is a well understood term, covering such matters as ventilation in mines, the cubic space of air allotted to each workman in a factory, and so forth ; whilst " terms and conditions of employment " refers to the terms and conditions imposed by the agreement under which labour is employed. There are many matters connected with the mining industry, with which I am best acquainted, which could not be dealt with under this Bill. The question of ladder-ways in a shaft, the qualifications of the engineer engaged in driving the hoisting gear, ventilation, the use of cyanide in such a way as to prevent the fumes being deleterious to the miners, are questions which could never come before the Arbitration Court. </para>

I am simply laying my views before the Senate, and it is for honorable senators to hold the balance between us. I have addressed myself to the one argument that the Attorney-General raised against my amendment. He has said practically that it is redundant and unnecessary as an addition to the clause, because the Court already has the power. I have endeavoured to show to the Committee that while the Court has this power in the case of disputes extending from one State to another, it has no power to deal with an enormous number of social questions which affects the States only, and which never can, under any conceivable conditions, come within the scope of this Bill. </para>

                    <para>- I should not have taken the trouble to speak again on this question had it not been for the repeated assertions of the Attorney-General and of Senator Clemons, who seem to think that there is no difference whatever between conditions of employment and conditions of labour. If the Committee will only consider for a moment the conditions which surround a workman engaged in his employment, they will see that conditions of labour are entirely different from conditions of employment. Let me take a single case to illustrate my point. Under the Coal Mines Regulation Act in New South Wales, certain conditions of labour are specified. But it does not specify any condition of employment. It says in one section that a certain amount of air shall travel into the places where miners are working - that the miners shall have 150 cubic feet of air per minute. That is a condition of labour. But the conditions of employment are that the coal-miners shall produce one ton of coal at so much per ton - 4s. or 3s., or whatever the price may be at a particular time. It will therefore be seen that conditions of labour and conditions of employment are entirely different. While we have the power under this Bill to deal with questions affecting conditions of employment, we have no control whatever over conditions of labour. The matters to which I refer as conditions of labour come within the scope of Mines Acts or Factories Acts, which are within the domain of States legislation. We cannot possibly deal with them, because the Constitution does not give us power. Our powers are clearly set forth in the Constitution. Undoubtedly, Factories Acts and Mines Acts are retained in the hands of the States Parliaments. </para>

                        <para>- The Committee has not given due consideration to the position which a union will be in when it endeavours to register. We have had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> definition of the matter, and I am coming round to his way of thinking. Evidently the Attorney-General is gradually coming to the same conclusion. I fail to understand him if he is not. It is necessary to remember that we have no control over factories and mines legislation affecting conditions of labour. Take a factory in Melbourne. Suppose children were being employed at a very tender age - a condition which I am pleased to know does not exist in this city - and a political agitation was got up for the purpose of limiting their employment. The .moment an organization registered under this Bill entered into such a political agitation, it would place itself outside the law. So that it is clear that conditions of labour are quite distinct from conditions of employment, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> has contended. </para>

                    <para>- My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> has put forward certain arguments in favour of his amendment in a very clear way. But I do not think that they are convincing. The very foundation of his arguments is wrong. He admits that he wishes to limit the political actions of unions, but he goes on in his exceptions to use three terms which, to my mind, cover almost the whole area of political action, so far as trade unions are concerned. What is there for them to agitate about outside of hours of labour, conditions of ' employment, and wages ? </para>

                        <para>- If they desire to have preference in employment over their fellow-men, they have no business .to enter into political agitation with regard to these matters. Does my honorable friend think that it is possible to draw the line, and say to unionists that they can enter upon political agitation on a certain side of politics, but the moment they cross the line they put themselves out of Court? Are the labour parties of this country going to be bound by a limitation of that sort? The proposal is hopelessly impossible. Look at the eight hours movement. It took years to accomplish. We may have an agitation for a Seven Hours Act before long. We may have an agitation for a new Minimum Wage Act, for a new Factories Act, or for a new Act affecting wages or conditions of employment in some other direction. While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> thinks that this is a good compromise, I say that there is no such tiling as compromise in regard to this provision. It is utterly impossible to draw the line. The three words used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> hours, conditions, and wages, cover almost every ground of political action on the part of trade unionists which it is worth while to consider. </para>

                        <para>- Where did the honorable senator get that unjust idea from? I do not. say that the employer should control them absolutely. I should be content to leave the unionists at perfect liberty to exercise (heir political rights, and carry on their agitations by means of their organizations in their own way ; but if they come and ask for what I consider to be a gross wrong against their fellow-men then I say they will have to give up politics for the purposes of this measure. As I read the Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is to a great extent right as to the rules of the organizations under the schedule. There will have to be a federation between the different unions in the different States, or there will have to be some officer going round in the different States arranging with the unions to register under the Bill; and then there are certain rules which must be made in accordance with the schedule to bring the organizations under the requirements of the law. Every organization that registers will have to do so for the purposes of this measure only. But now my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> says that the registration shall not' be for the purposes of the Bill only, but also for the purpose of carrying on political agitation as it has been carried on from the beginning, because the three words which he includes in his amendment would practically permit the organizations to agitate with regard to the whole of the matters in which, as unions, they are now interested politically. Surely the honorable senator sees that. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Matheson's</inline>position is that the unions are to be perfectly free to. agitate politically with regard to the three matters mentioned in his amendment, though they are not to agitate politically with regard to other matters. I am afraid that the political questions, outside those three matters, which the unions would desire to agitate about, are so few as to be like comparing the honorable. senator's farthings with his sovereigns. ' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in an interjection, said, " That is not the freedom we are fighting for." I will not address myself to the honorable senator, or I might use words that might be considered impertinent, but I think I saw something like the same words in one of the Labour Party's journals last Friday. It was stated there that what the Labour Party was fighting for was freedom of preference for unionists. Honorable senators opposite are fighting not for the freedom of the large majority of the working classes, because they for some reason or other will not join their organizations. I deny to my honorable friends opposite the right to claim that they are fighting for freedom or for liberty. I claim that two-thirds of the workmen are not in the unions, and therefore have no interest in the principle of preference to unionists. As far as I can see, honorable senators are fighting for power to compel two-thirds of the workers of Australia to join their unions, or to suffer a loss of employment. That is not freedom as I understand it. You may ask for liberty to kill a man. I might ask for liberty to put my hand in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> pocket, but I do not suppose that he would call that true freedom. It is not freedom to rob a man or to deprive him of employment. </para>

                        <para>- I am not reasoning, but giving a plain statement of facts. At the time of the French Revolution the guillotine was used under the guise of fraternity and brotherly love, and it seems to me that freedom and liberty are used in much the same sense now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> lias made the most of clauses 62 to 64. But no fair argument can be based upon those clauses. The law is not quite such a "hass" as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bumble</inline> made out; because whenever you pass an Act of Parliament under which you give a man a right to institute proceedings before a Court, the law takes care that the Act shall not be rendered nugatory because the defendant does not appear, or because you cannot serve him. There would be a gross omission from this Bill, for which the draftsman or the Attorney-General- would be to blame; if there were no means of bringing the defendant before the Court. The clauses referred to are simply for that purpose. If either one side or the other will not register, these clauses give power to compel them to register. Suppose the great Engineers' Society, or the Seamen's' Union, for whom this measure has. been principally brought forward, and to whom I believe it is particularly applicable, would not register under the measure. If they did not that would prove conclusively that the desire was to make the Act so much waste paper. Are </para>

                <para>Ave to assume that, notwithstanding the' great outcry there has been for an Arbitration Act, and for industrial peace, the principal organizations will not register when this Bill is passed? Are we to build up a set of arguments on that slight foundation? Suppose that the Seamen's Union did not register, and wished not only to evade the Court, but to stop the whole commerce of the Commonwealth by not doing their work. Then if the employers liked to bring the case before the Court, the Governor-General could proclaim the members of the Seamen's Union an organization for the purposes of the Act. Do my honorable friends think thai: the Court would interfere with its rules on other matters? Do they suppose that the Court would confiscate its funds? The funds would not be transferred from the union to the organization ; but they might be applied to pay a fine, because otherwise the Act would be nugatory. The trade unionists would not be robbed of their political rights. The union would merely be proclaimed an organization for the purposes of the Act, and for no other purposes. If the organization thus constituted would not set to work and frame rules, the Governor-General, could proclaim that schedule B in the Act should be the rules. That would not do away with the old union. If they did not want preference, and did not register, they would not have preference. All their old political agitations could go on from morning till night. Therefore, two-thirds of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> arguments are beside the mark. He sars " I recognise that trade unions have certain duties to perform with regard to the. States. They have certain rights and privileges with regard to States industrial matters, which have nothing to do with Federal matters, and they would be prevented from discharging those duties if this amendment were not made." There is no reason why trade unionists should not carry on political agitations if they like, provided they do not ask. for preference. Cannot my honorable friends opposite see that preference is of very great advantage? </para>

Judging by their interjections, and speeches, it will go forth to the Commonwealth that we are trying to make political outcasts of trade unionists. It is because of all this rant and cant that I repeat my arguments. If my honorable friends want preference, they are bound down not to take part in politics. Let me express my astonishment at what came out this afternoon from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O/Keefe.</inline> I understood in the first instance that this was a Bill to put an end to strikes, and give us peace. Undoubtedly it has a good object ; but we know from the leaders in another place that as a mode of settling industrial disputes, it will be regarded as so much waste paper, unless preference be given to unionists. It is now stated by the leaders of the Labour Party that as regards putting an end to strikes, the Bill has lost all its significance and importance. The whole desire is that under cover of its provisions, trade unionists shall get a legal preference over non-unonists. The Labour Party stands before the Commonwealth with that issue to which I shall try to keep them. I shall not allow them to say that we are trying to make political outcasts of trade unionists. We are doing nothing of the kind ; we are actuated by a spirit of justice and freedom, and we do not intend to enact any conditions which mean exactly the opposite. </para>

If they do not want the Bill to pass, they know perfectly well that they have only to adhere to the provisions relating to domestic servants and agricultural labourers, and at the next election, [' suppose the electors will be asked, " Are the unionists to be political outcasts" ? That will not be a fair and honest way of putting the issue before the country. This amendment is not a fair compromise, because it includes all the trade union politics which are worth troubling about. The only way to settle this matter is to make every organization register under the Act, and for the purposes of the Act only. </para>

                        <para>- Let us take the definition which the honorable and learned senator read. According to the American dictionary, the word " political " means anything pertaining to the government of a country. The position is one of the most extraordinary I have ever experienced. Here we have a Parliament professedly anxious to encourage the settlement of industrial disputes in a peaceful fashion. The very essence of this Bill is preference to unionists ; without preference there will be no organization ; without organization there can be no reference to the Court; and without a reference to the Court any disputes which might arise would be settled in the good old fashion with the bludgeon and other barbarous weapons. Preference to unionists is really the key-stone of the arch of this Bill, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is really anxious to promote peace, it is not absolutely necessary that preference should be given to unionists without reservation. </para>

                    <para>Sydney, Tuesday. </para>
                    <para>In the Arbitration Court to-day judgment was given in the long-standing industrial dispute between the Trolley, Draymen, and Carriers' Union and the Master Carriers' Association, and in all respects, except preference to unionists, the Court was unanimous. </para>
                    <para>The President said that he and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> (employees' representative) were of opinion that preference of employment should be given to unionists. One of the principles of the Arbitration Act was collective bargaining as far as industrial unions were concerned. Therefore he considered that when an industrial union fairly and practically represented an industry as far as the employees were concerned, preference should be given to unionists. Another reason which actuated him was that industrial unions of employees incurred all the expense and trouble in preparing and submitting their case to the Court, and, he assumed, obtained conditions more satisfactory to the employees than existed before the submission of the dispute. Without this preference all encouragement would disappear. Within certain limits, unless preference were given to unionists, he feared that industrial unionism would become a thing of the past. In the minds of some people that might be considered a good thing, but he did not accept that as the declared will of the people of the country. </para>

                <para class="block">I wish to specially direct the attention of honorable senators to the principle of this Bill, namely, that every industrial dispute shall be settled by arbitration. In order to carry out their desire to promote this method of settling disputes they must give every possible encouragement to organizations. That is the price which they have to pay for peace. A great amount of money has been lost through strikes, and very great suffeiing has been brought to the doors of both employers and employes by industrial disputes. To avoid all this loss and suffering, this peaceful method of settling difficulties between employers and workmen has been devised. If the Act be not to our liking we can ignore the Arbitration Court. </para>

                        <para>- It may be that, through the law courts, the capitalists will gain a few victories over us, as was done in Great Britain, but within a very short time the unionists of Australia will find a means of getting past the Act and capturing the Parliament, which can make rules and regulations for every industry, and which will be, as compared with this measure, as a steam-roller is to a wheelbarrow. That is the alternative which, in all sincerity, I place before honorable senators who are opposed to making this a workable measure. Do they court trouble; do they court more and more agitation; do they court a struggle to the very death? If they do let them emasculate the measure as they are doing. Let them ham-string the Bill, as they will do if this clause be retained. The Attorney-General reminds me of an Eastern potentate of whom I read in my youth. A veritable ogre captured a number of persons, cast them into dungeons, and at last had the good grace to say that they were at liberty. The prison doors were opened, the people were led outside, but they were immediately hamstrung, so that liberty to them was a mere fiction. That is exactly the position of the Attorney-General and the Government with regard to this measure. They say, in effect to the Labour Party, "You have been clamouring for conciliation and arbitration. Very well, we will give it to you, but we shall put a provision into the measure. </para>

                        <para>- It is not acceptable to the Labour Party here, and therefore we are doing our best to secure its elimination. This provision, and indeed the whole measure, reminds me of another old story which I read in my youth. Honorable senators have all read the fable of "The Fox and the Stork." They will remember that the fox. being a very cunning gentleman, invited the stork to dinner, and had the dinner laid out on broad shallow plates, so that the stork, with his long bill, could eat nothing. The fox, taking advantage of that fact, gobbled up the whole. I suppose that Reynard thought he had stolen a march upon the stork. In this case the Government is the fox, and the Labour Party is the stork; and, just as the stork of the fable got back on the fox, it is more than probable that the Labour Party will get back on the Government, if this measure is passed in its present form. I listened carefully to the speech of the Attorney-General. I confess that it was a very able one, and no doubt convinced his supporters. </para>

                        <para>- I think not. The honorable and learned senator is too acute to be convinced by sophistry of that kind. There is no doubt it was very able sophistry, but still it was sophistry all the time. The honorable and learned senator directed the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> to the definition of "industrial matters" in the interpretation clause, and said that it covered the whole thing. I do not pretend to be able to say whether it does or not, but the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> would undoubtedly make the clause before us very much clearer than it is at present, would do away with a great amount of litigation, and would also remove a great deal of unnecessary heart-burning, because, rightly or wrongly, the unionists of Australia will consider that this proviso is aimed at their existence. Suppose that, previous to a dispute, some union had passed a resolution affirming the desirability of a legal eight-hours day. Would that be deemed to be political action? I suppose it would, because a legal eight-hours day could not be enforced except by an Act of Parliament, and if an Act of Parliament should be the result of a resolution passed by an industrial body, that resolution would immediately be given a political significance. In the case I have instanced the union would at once be deprived of preference under this Bill, and would not care to take the trouble to bring any case before the Court. If honorable senators opposite are at all desirous of promoting the peaceful settlement of disputes, they will not insist on this proviso. I am not sure that the proviso is constitutional. I should like to hear the lawyers on that point. The Constitution gives every man and every organization of men the right to take part in the government of the country. Not only so, but every good citizen is expected to take an interest in the government of the country in which he lives. </para>

Why should the members of a union fight for better conditions for men who will not enter the union, when they know perfectly well that after the battle has been fought and the victory won, they will reap no benefit from it, but, on the contrary, will be penalized? </para>

I can say for the Labour Party that it has always been in favour of the peaceful settlement of disputes, and I am sorry that I am compelled to add that our opponents have just as consistently been opposed to it. They have always believed in the mailed fist. They have always said in effect, if not in so many words, " Let us starve these people out ; let us scourge them with the whip of starvation ; and let them see their wives and little ones famishing before their eyes." </para>

                        <para>- Either that or that their workmen should submit to their terms. If they have not expressed themselves in just those words, I have stated exactly what the actions of employers' associations have meant in many cases. We wish to do away with all that sort of thing. We desire that disputes shall be settled in a rational fashion, and for that purpose preference to trade unionists must be given without any qualification. That is the demand of the Labour Party. If the Attorney-General will not agree to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> 's amendment, which is a very fair compromise, we must hold out for preference without qualification or no Bill, because this Bill will be absolutely useless to the people of Australia unless preference is granted to unionists. We must consider this clause in connexion with clauses 62, 63 and 64, because if the employers register, and the employes refuse to do so, and a dispute arises, the Governor-General may proclaim the employes' organization an organization under the Bill. That will bring it immediately under the operation of the Bill, whether the employes desire it or not, and ?hen the members of the organization and the organization itself will be liable to all the pains and penalties set out in the Bill. We have come here to a most peculiar position. It appears to me that the Labour Party is deliberately invited to walk into a trap, to go into a blind alley from which there is no escape. We are deliberately invited by our opponents to place ourselves in a position in which we shall be absolutely at the mercy of the employers' organizations, the Governor-General, and the Court. That being the case, it behoves us to be verv careful in what we do. This measure as it stands is not calculated to promote industrial peace. The provisions we are now discussing are more likely to give rise to bitter feelings of antagonism than to promote industrial amity and concord. What will the thousands of unionists throughout Australia think of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament who deliberately deprive them of their political rights as unionists. I do not know whether honorable senators opposite are in touch with public opinion. As some of them secured a large number of votes when elected, I presume that they are to a greater or less extent, and if they are they must be making some terrible mistakes, because in Queensland the great majority of unionists think more of their political rights than of anything else. They look on the man who attempts to deprive them of those rights as their most deadly enemy. That is how they will view the members of this Committee and the Parliament of the Commonwealth if the proviso we are now discussing is placed in this Bill. They will say, "What, deprive us of our political rights? Declare that, as men banded together for our own advancement, we cannot even pass a resolution asking the State Parliament to get us better conditions without being deprived of preference under the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill? This is a tyranny worse than that of Russia." </para>

We give men political rights with one hand, and we filch those rights away from them with the other. Is not that a great deal more contemptible than the conduct of the Russian autocrat, who says, " You shall not have any political power " ? Could any thing be more mean, wretched, and miserable than to say to the great body of the unionists of this country, " You have votes under the Constitution. We expect you, as good citizens, to take part in the government of the country," and in the next breath to tell them that if they wish to receive any preference under this Bill they must abandon all their political rights as unionists ? </para>

The Attorney-General has refused to give us a definition of political question, because the honorable and learned senator cannot define it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> has tried to define it in a way which is not satisfactory to me, because it is my desire that the whole of this proviso should be eliminated, as I consider it fatal to the Bill. For that reason I shall gladly vote against it. But I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> amendment is a very fair compromise under the circumstances, and its acceptance by us shows the reasonableness of the party to which I belong, and that we are not the extremists that we are said to be. </para>

                        <para>- The Court could fix the hours of labour for any trade at eight hours. But the unionists of Australia might decide to proclaim an eight hours day or a six hours day all over the continent; and if they had a majority in favour of doing so, what would there be to prevent them? The electors of the Commonwealth have a right to fix the hours of labour by Act of Parliament if they choose to do so. It has been pointed out by other speakers that it would be impossible for any live labour union to exist without taking part in the politics of the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has told us about the case of the seamen, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> has pointed out the position of the miners. Other honorable senators have alluded to other industries. It has been made perfectly clear to my mind that it would be impossible for a union to exist at all without moving politically. I am astonished that honorable senators opposite have not been persuaded to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> amendment. It proves to me that they -are governed entirely by prejudice, and have no desire to see this ' measure made workable. They think they can beat down the trade unions with other weapons. I warned them a little while ago that if we have this weapon of political action* taken out of our hands we have a more powerful weapon in reserve. We have the numbers, and we can capture every' Parliament in Australia if we put our shoulders to the wheel. Unless disputes of the character now referred to can be settled by peaceful arbitration by a Court which will give the workmen justice and fair play, and before which workers and employer will be on an absolute equality, we shall have recourse to other methods which will be much more effective. </para>

                        <para>- Acts of Parliament regulating all industries. We are not going to abandon this struggle because we are outwitted or out-generalled or out-numbered on the present occasion. If we are beaten on this point we are going to carry the thing a great deal farther. We are going to insist upon fair conditions for all our workers, and to secure the peaceful settlement of disputes in one way or another. If the Arbitration Bill is framed in such a way as to give preference before the Court to the capitalists, then we shall have to cry out for a remedy in some other direction ; and I have not the slightest doubt that we shall be able to find' that direction. But for the sake of peace I hope that honorable senators opposite will come to the conclusion that the right thing to do ac present is to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I do not like to give a silent vote on this question. I have followed two rules with regard to the subject under discussion - to maintain an open mind and a shut mouth. As a matter of fact, when I first read <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> amendment I was disposed to favour it. I thought that it might remove a difficulty, and be a step in the direction of compromise. I have listened to the arguments on both sides quite impartially. I owe no allegiance to either side. I am absolutely independent in regard to the subject. But after listening carefully to what has been said, I have come to the conclusion that the amendment is not necessary. I ought to preface what I have to say by remarking that I am against the principle of preference. Throughout the discussions upon this Bill I have been opposed to any discrimination of any kind. But the Committee, by a majority, has decreed that a preference shall, at the discretion of the Court, be given to unionists, and now that that has been carried I do not intend to do anything to destroy the principle, or by any side wind to deprive the unionists of the preference they have secured. But, returning to the question at issue, it seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> amendment, if it only means what it says, is surplusage. If it means what it says, it amounts to this - that any action which the unions take under the Bill is not to be regarded as political action. Why the very object of this Bill is to enable the organization to take such action as that specified in the honorable senator's amendment. I have not been converted by the arguments which I have heard in favour of the amendment. We can safely leave it to the Court to determine what is political action on' the part of a union. The Court will speedily determine whether any action taken by a union is, properly speaking, outside the scope of the Act. We should not insert words which may be capable of a larger interpretation than is intended by the honorable senator who has moved them. I regard the amendment as totally unnecessary, even from the point of view of the unions themselves. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has read a report of the remarks made by Judge Cohen in the Arbitration Court in New South Wales. Those remarks have been received with a great deal of acclaim by the members of the Labour Party. But if honorable senators will recall the language of the Judge, they will see that he said that preference ought to be granted only when the Court is satisfied that a union substantially and practically represents the industry. This was the principle adopted in the Bill as iti came to the Senate ; but the Labour Party did not accept it. </para>

                    <para>- I find that I cannot please either party. It was reported in South Australia the other day that the Labour Party had "captured <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford."</inline> Now the Labour Party are complaining that my honorable and learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> has captured me. Whichever party thinks that it has captured me must consider that it has a pretty big fish on its hook. But I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has not captured me, in any sense. The first person who spoke to me with regard to this matter was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> who informed me this morning that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> intended to move an amendment. He showed it to me, and I read it through. I made up my mind in about two minutes as to what I should do. I said that it was surplusage. There is no necessity for it. The Bill provides for all that it contains. Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that I ought to vote against it. But I am bound to confess that I do not like the proviso as it stands. I consider that the latter part of it, that requires the members of a union not to do anything of a political character, is a little bit too sweeping. I puzzled my brains to see whether I could devise an amendment which would be satisfactory, but I found the problem more difficult than I had anticipated. The form of amendment which I drafted would have added the words - but, subject to the approval of the Court, any organization may expend its funds and take such action on questions specifically affecting its own trade or calling - and other words following out the same idea. I thought at first that some such amendment would meet the difficulty, but I confess that the task of devising an amendment that would be workable and satisfactory has been too much for me. I am prepared to accept the proviso, especially as we have the assurance of the Attorney-General that no Court would ever rule that the members of a trade union who took action in regard to matters especially affecting their own calling would be doing anything of a political character. The Court would never debar them from such action. </para>

                        <para>- In a previous clause, we refused to say that a hard and fast majority should be required before preference could be given, but that we would trust the Court. In this case it will be a great deal wiser and better for us to leave the question open, instead of trying to modify the provision in such a way as to open the door considerably wider. When the amendment comes to be examined carefully, it will be seen that it opens the door so wide that an organization in Queensland could help an organization in Western Australia to do certain things. </para>

                <para>The amendment is very simple, and at the first glance its effect is not seen. When it is closely examined, however, it is found to be of a very far-reaching character. As the Attorney-General so ably pointed out, it will open the door wider. Either it is mischievous on the one side, or it is surplusage on the other. According to the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> it is really not mischievous, but an exceedingly simple thing. See what a wide door it opens when it allows funds to be taken from one end of the Commonwealth and applied' to a political purpose at the other end. That is going too far, I think. </para>

If the State legislation has not decided the conditions of employment, I should imagine that the Court will certainly have the right to fix them.

I do not see any distinction between conditions of labour and conditions of employment; they are practically synonymous terms. </para>

If the unionists are to be told that they are only asking for that which is right and just and fair, and that we are unwilling to grant their demand, there is another side of the question which can be placed before the electors. To all the men who are not unionists we can say, " Is it fair to give unionists preference over you individually without conditions, so as to prevent them from becoming political societies ? " That is the position which will <inline font-style="italic">'be</inline> put, and it strikes me very forcibly that, although an electioneering cry may be got up on one side,' still an equally powerful cry can be raised on the other side. I think that the Court may be trusted not to take away the right of the members of an organization who ask for preference to agitate, politically if they like, for the redress of other wrongs under which they may suffer, and which are not specially due to their trade or calling. </para>

                    <para>- I have just been handed an American newspaper, from which I learn that the seamen are agitating for certain reforms. Petitions have been presented to the Congress, and delegates have been sent from all parts of the United States to Washington for the purpose of assisting to pass the legislation. What is the position in Australia to-day? Every elector in the Commonwealth has the right to approach his representative, and submit his case. But with the central Government located in Melbourne, it is very hard for the men to see their representatives, and possibly delegates may have to be sent to the Seat of Government at considerable expense. That is a political purpose which would debar the union from getting preference under this provision. Practically the same questions are being agitated in America to-day, as in Australia. This newspaper mentions twelve questions, both industrial and political, which would debar I the Seamen's Union from getting preference under the Act. Let me read the first question - </para>

                        <para>- All the questions I have mentioned are absolutely industrial. Nothing of this sort was attempted in passing the New South Wales and Western Australian Acts. I am satisfied that if the Right Honorable C. C. Kingston, who is the author of this legislation, were present as a member of this Committee, he would be one of the strongest opponents of the Bill in its present form. That right honorable gentleman never had any other idea but that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act should be founded on a recognition of the existing unions, and the Bill as drafted by him went far to show that. He provided not only for organizations for the Commonwealth, but for associations within the States, showing that he had taken into consideration the ramifications of the unions at present in existence. The Bill before us today will not carry out what the right honorable gentleman intended in submitting this legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> was afraid that there might be some interference with States rights in this matter ; but I do not think there is any reason for such a" fear. The question has been raised, and I think a good point might be made of it, that organizations exist in some of the States where no legislation has been passed to protect those engaged in dangerous occupations. Honorable senators by supporting this proviso, would take away from the members of those organizations all power to agitate for the passing of such legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> is aware that unsuccessful attempts have been made in South Australia to have lead-smelting included in the category of dangerous trades. In various unions in that State there is a strong feeling that the smelting industry can well afford to pay compensation to those who suffer from lead poisoning as the result of their employment in the industry. They will not rest satisfied until some legislation is passed to make the owners of smelting works responsible for the consequences of the illness suffered by their employes. It is not sufficient that they should pay a paltry wage of 6s. a day. </para>

                        <para>- Hundreds were leaded as we know to our cost, because the expense was thrown not upon those who were reaping the profits derived from the labour of the smelters, but upon workers associated with them in friendly societies. The friendly societies in those districts have been very nearly ruined owning to the amount which they have had to pay out to maintain those who have suffered from lead poisoning.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGREGOR</inline>(South Australia). - I am aware that a number of honorable senators who have voted against the last two amendments are not entirely satisfied with the wording of the proviso as it stands. I believe that they will be in favour of the amendment which has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> On account of urgent private business that honorable senator was unable to be present today, but he has left his amendment in print. He proposes that we should insert after the word " character" the words " except of a purely industrial nature connected with the trade or calling of the organization." Honorable senators must recognise that the Attorney-General's opposition to the amendment has not been legitimate. By his speech and by interjection the honorable and learned senator has declared emphatically that such political questions as workmen's compensation, liens, load lines, and other questions vitally affecting the interests of workers, and of a purely industrial as well as political character, would not be considered political under this proviso. I cannot imagine for a moment that the honorable and learned senator thinks so. If he were the Judge of an Arbitration Court under such a Bill as this, in which the Court is directed that the members of an organization are to take no political action whatever, would he decide that these are not questions of a political character? If the honorable and learned senator would, he would belie all my past experience of jurisprudence. I do not for a moment believe that the honorable and learned senator, if he were a Judge of an Arbitration Court under this Bill, would hesitate to decide that all the matters to which reference has been made on the amendments proposed by Senators de Largie and Matheson are of a political character. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has acknowledged that he is in a difficulty in connexion with this question. The honorable senator has repeatedly asserted that he is not satisfied with the terms of the proviso, and he acknowledges that industrial unions have a right to interfere in the matters to which we have referred. But he says that the Court would not consider them political. The amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> provides that the Court is not to consider as political action which deals with industrial matters connected with the organization claiming preference. I do not' think it necessary to advance further arguments in support of the amendment suggested by </para>
                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline>because the arguments which have already been used on the last two amendments apply with equal force to this. I am prepared to leave it to the good sense of the Committee and' the judgment of honorable senators, who have declared themselves dissatisfied with the wording of the proviso as it stands. I may state that I was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> to submit the amendment on his behalf, and I therefore move - </para>
                <para>That after the word " character," line 6, the following words be inserted - " except of a purely industrial nature connected with the trade or calling of the organization." </para>

                    <para>- It should be quite unnecessary for me to say so. If the honorable senator had read the amendment in connexion with the words of the proviso he would have hesitated to submit it, because it is a contradiction in terms, and is absurd. Of course, all this is subject to the decision of the Court. My honorable friend appealed to me as to what I should do if I were a Judge of the Court. I shall decide that when the time arrives. We are now dealing with a proviso the language of which is necessarily wide. </para>

All the matters which have been mentioned by honorable senators opposite, unless dealt with by legislation, which, of course, overrides any Court, will be the subject of decisions by the Arbitration Court. Parliament can do everything. If two men fall out about the ownership of a piece of land, Parliament can decide between them. But as we have constituted Courts to deal with such disputes, Parliament will only take action in such a case under very special circumstances. Similarly in these cases we propose to constitute Courts.

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGREGOR</inline>(South Australia). - I do not agree with the Attorney-General. Indeed, I think that he has put his case in a diabolical fashion. He has misled the Committee, not only in the remarks which he has just made, but by his many interjections. He knows very well that all that we have been contending for in connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> amendment is that industrial organizations registered under this measure shall have preference, even when they do take an active part in bringing about such legislation as compensation laws, and laws with regard to liens, load lines, and accommodation for shearers. He knows also that the Court has no power to grant preference to a union that takes political action of any character. That is distinctly provided by the clause, and I am sure that no Judge or arbiter would, when the Bill distinctly stated that no preference should be granted in such a case, think of granting it to a union which took political action, even with respect to matters that do not strictly speaking come within the purview of the Arbitration Bill. What we want is to give the unions liberty to do all they can to bring into existence legislation that will have a beneficial effect upon the working classes, and the general community. I hope that honorable senators will no longer be misled by the Attorney-General. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to move a further amendment. The party to which I belong are prepared to go to any reasonable length to meet the views of honorable senators opposite, but some .of them seem to wish to emasculate the Bill altogether, and to render it absolutely useless. The great object of some honorable senators is to prevent the unions from doing anything to further the interests of one political party - the Labour Party. They have an unreasoning fear of the Labour Party, and, therefore, they wish to clip its wings in every possible way. T desire by this amendment to meet them, as far as possible, and to absolutely prevent the unions from doing anything of a party character. Surely that ought to please honorable senators opposite. We used to be told that we ought to devise some better means of settling industrial disputes than by strikes. Why, then, do honorable senators complain that we take constitutional means to settle labour difficulties and why do they seek to prevent the unions from taking that action which they formerly recommended them to take? We have accepted their advice, and now: they tum upon us. They used to tell us that if the law was wrong we should endeavour to alter' it, but that while the law remained we should have to obey it, or they would send Gatling guns and troops, whose officers would order them " to fire low and lay em out." </para>

                        <para>- Of course they can. The present amendment says the same thing as the other, but in a different set of words. . I ask you, sir, under standing order 126 to say whether or not it is the same in substance as the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. It is also open to the objection that it limits the political purposes to the furthering of the interests of a particular political party. Honorable senators opposite have said that these unions are industrial and political, and, therefore, this amendment would simply affect the furtherance of the interests of ar particular political party quite irrespective of the possibility of the organization constituting a political party of itself. </para>

                        <para>- The effect of the statement of the Attorney-General is to mislead the Committee, .and it would mislead me if I were a little more innocent than I am. He has tried to make out that the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is the same as the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, when as a matter of fact it is of a more far-reaching character. There are many methods of assisting a political party besides subscribing to its funds or voting for its members. In Victoria certain persons find it to their benefit to go to the extent of lying for the purpose of assisting the political party they belong to. This amendment would prevent them from misleading the electors, whereas the other one only related to spending the funds of an organization, or to the actual voting of its members. The effect of the present amendment is. to allow a person to do nothing of 21 political character which would further the interests of a party, whereas the only effect of the other amendment was that an organization could not spend its funds or compel or direct its members to vote. </para>
