If honorable senators will now rearrange the business they have on the notice-paper, so as to enable the first order of the day, under the head of Government business. to come on, that will meet the case, and we shall be acting, I think, in accordance with custom. </para>

                    <para>- Yesterday afternoon, when I asked for an adjournment of the debate inaugurated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> I had no intention to put any member of the Senate to inconvenience. But I recognised that if there was any proceeding that would call the attention of the Australian people to the pronouncement of the Government, it was an adjournment of the debate. The policy foreshadowed by the Attorney-General possessed no feature to make it different from the policy of the preceding Government. When we consider it from that point of view, I ask honorable senators what necessity there was 'for all the turmoil and delay that have been caused by the transition from one Government to another ? I cannot imagine a reason for it, because the present Government have adopted the very policy which- the leader of that Government characterized at Warragul, when he was leader of the Opposition, as a "crawling policy." I want to know whether the Attorney-General concurs in that statement of his present half -leader? I call him so, because we must all recognise that the gentleman who now occupies the position of - well, I cannot find a term for it. When we speak of sacred things, we are familiar with the term "Trinity." But what term represents the present condition of the Government in Australia ? Should it not be described as a " duality " ? I am not certain. We may take it to be a sort of twin Government, just as we speak of twin screws. We must regard the leaders of the present Government as a pair. One of the pair declared at Warragul that the policy of the late Government was a crawling policy. But as soon as he had an opportunity to make a Ministerial statement to the people. of Australia, he came forward with the very same policy. Yet it is not exactly the same. The Government have knocked, off two or three legs, so that that policy cannot "crawl" any longer. We have also to witness a disturbance of the conditions which have existed in the Senate from its very commencement. Everybody in Australia knows, or imagines that lie or she knows, that when the position of the Vice-President of the Executive Council was created, there was a particular intention in view. That was to give a position to a certain member of the first Federal Ministry that would be in harmony with the ability and the earnestness of that gentleman. But what do we find to-day, in relation to the Vice- Presidency of the Executive Council ? If, formerly, I got up to ask' a question without notice, I put it to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and, in the majority of instances, he would probably ask me to give notice. But to-day and yesterday every honorable senator who got up seemed to hesitate. They did not know, what to do. They did not know whether they were to address the Vice-President of the Executive Council or t'he Attorney-General. They could not address the leader of the Senate, because we do not know who he is. </para>

                        <para>- Then, I must confess that my perception seems to be getting dull, because I am of opinion that honorable senators did hesitate when they got up. Every one in the Senate acknowledges the undoubted ability and the perseverance of the present Attorney-General, when he has a fight to conduct. Some of us have had to work at cross purposes with him occasionally. But I could hardly keep from blushing yesterday on account of the very nice way in which he referred to me. No matter what my temper may have been when I came into the chamber, with respect to those who had turned out of office the Government of which I was a member, in a very few moments I felt myself to be all over smiles. The manner of the Attorney-General was so unlike - I cannot say what I have been accustomed to from him, because the honorable and learned senator was never here while I was in office. Of course, I do not know how he would have talked to me if he had been present, as he was constantly in connexion with the discussions on the Tariff. We know how he could fire up, how his eyes would flash, and how the dictionary would rattle as he railed against the opinions of almost every one but himself in those days. But, it appears, we are all a happy family now ! I hope it may long continue to be so. But I am a little jealous of the position which I occupied in the Senate. I do not like to see the office of Vice-President of the Executive Council, or. the leadership of a legislative body like this, dragged in the mud, as it were. Consequently, I may be excused if I feel a little bitter. </para>

                        <para>- It is' very sad. I feel sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> would have a fortnight's illness if his mind were agitated in the , same manner as mine has been in respect to that position, and the way in which it has been treated. But then we could not expect - at least I could not - that such a high and mighty gentleman as the present Attorney-General would subordinate himself to any individual in this Senate, who might be appointed Vice-President of the Executive Council. I could not imagine it- Then the difficulty arose - how could the leader of the Government get some one who would occupy the position of Vice-President, when, as the Right Honorable George Reid would say, it was divested of every feather? Where was he to find a senator who would sit meekly in his place, holding a title without any of the attributes that ought to belong to it? I could hardly believe that there was a single member of the Senate who would take the position under such conditions. But what do we find ? I hope there is no honorable senator who will think that I would speak of any individual present with feelings of - I was going to say anger, but why should I be angry? But when we speak from a political point of view there are many things that we may say that ought not to disturb our personal friendships. I intend to say those things to-day, and I hope to be excused for saying them. </para>

                <para class="block">I was referring to the position which members of the present Ministry, as contrasted with members of other Ministries, occupy in this chamber. Is there a single individual senator who would stand up to-day, and say that, under present circumstances, he would fill the position of Vice-President of the Executive Council? But the dear, docile Drake ducks so that the Symon swan may swim serenely and supreme on the sea of office, That is something like the way in which John Norton would put the position; indeed, I do not know that John Norton could put it better, and, at any rate, that is how I feel. Are we to imagine that the present Attorney-General could do any other than he has done? The honorable and learned senator is a patriot who is prepared to sacrifice himself on the altar of his country's good. When there was nothing to be done - when there was only a paltry allowance attached - the honorable and learned senator did not trouble much about his country's good. We must always bear the facts in mind, and I want the people and honorable senators to know those facts, so that they may never allow themselves to be put in the same awkward position. A month's leave of absence was asked for on the ground of urgent private business, and a telegram was sent, stating that a position required to be filled. Then this great patriot jumped at the position, as they say in Scotland, like a cock at a grosset. But can honorable senators see where the patriotism comes in ? The position of Vice-President of the Executive Council - the position of leader of the Senate - could only be an honorary position, and. of course, that means a great deal to a gentleman who is so patriotic that he would only attend about eight or nine days out of thirty, until such time as the position was open for him in the Government. That is the real position of affairs. The Attorney-Generalship was offered and accepted, and then the position of Vice-President of the Executive Council had to be filled ; and here arose the difficulty. The latter is an honorary position, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> was the only man who could be got to fill it - the only man who was prepared to sink his own individuality and duck under so that he could be superseded in a double sense by the Attorney-General of the present day. Look at the difference between the leader of the Senate and the leader in another place. The Right Honorable George Reid has figured in the politics of Australia as prominently as any man in this country could have done; but he is prepared to sink his individuality, and become half free-trader and half protectionist, and occupy a position which he declares he shares as equal in all things with a friend of his. I am only endeavouring to point out the true position that the Government occupy in the Senate at the present time. What position does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> occupy ? What does he! do? No one ever asks him a question, and he ought to be ashamed of his existence here. I am sure that when he goes back to! the people of Queensland, and they ask him why he dragged the reputation of his State in the mire, he will have no answer to give, except -" Well, boys, I was a'fraid you would not elect me next time, and I thought I would do the best I could for myself at the present time." Nothing of that kind could ever be said of a single individual belonging to the Labour Party, which is so contemptuously spoken of. Not a single word of that description could be uttered with respect to a member of any . of the preceding Governments. I ask honorable senators whether they can have the same faith in the a'dministration of the business of the country when it is in the hands of men who, in one instance, are prepared to sacrifice their individuality, and, in another instance, are compelled by their overweening vanity to grab both positions in the Senate, leaving a poor fellow-member in the mean and degraded position which the Vice-President of the Executive Council occupies to-day. </para>

At present, however, we are discussing the policy which the Government have put forward, though we 'have a perfect right to discuss the position in which we find ourselves. We have to ask why the present position has arisen. I am going this afternoon to say distinctly, that the only object which the members of the present Government could have had in bringing about a change was to displace the Labour Party - this socialistic party - or it was for the purpose merely of getting into office. If their object was to displace the Labour Party - the socialistic party - they have been working a long while to do it; but they must bear in mind that they are a long way, up to the present, from shifting the socialistic party. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator would not hurt any party very much by his presence, and consequently we can be merciful with him. I desire to enlighten members, because some seem to require a great deal of enlightenment as to the socialistic proclivities of the Labour Party. We have it continually thrown in our face: -" You have your labour journals all over Australia launching forth anarchy and Socialism; you have your paid leaders and advocates going all over the country telling people what you believe in, and you are bound to take the statements they make as statements of your views." We are, and always have been, prepared to take those statements when they correctly describe our views, but we are not going to take the biased versions of those statements which very often appear in a prejudiced press. I want to-day to show the policy of the Labour Party and contrast it- </para>

I am not so high and mighty that I would not brook reproof. The first plank of our platform is the maintenance of a White Australia. Is there one honorable senator who objects to it? Only a few months ago certain of the members of the present Government were travelling about Australia howling over the <inline font-style="italic">Petriana</inline> myth, the Stelling case, the1 six hatters incident, and other matters of that kind, but not a word is now uttered as to the repeal of the provisions on the statute-book. </para>

                        <para>- It would be better 'for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> if he did not say much now, for he does not know what will happen. The honorable senator may be hobbled or gagged by those with whom he is now associated. They have done that sort of thing before, and they will dp it again. The Government have accepted the White Australia policy, in spite of all the opposition they offered to it in the past. At any rate, in their statement of policy, there is not a word about the repeal of any of the White Australia provisions. They are going to sit down and touch nothing. The probability is that they will carry out the policy in the way indicated by the Prime Minister when he declared that it did not matter what legislation was passed in regard to immigration restriction, or anything else of that kind, so Jong as he had the administration of it. They may work in underground tunnels, out of sight, and nothing may be made public. They may sit down, and, by their inaction, try to defeat the White 'Australia policy. If that is .their intention the sooner we know it the better. </para>

But what I was going to say was that they 'have accepted the Bill as it stands. They have accepted it with' the provision relating to the railway servants and other provisions in it that they have declared themselves opposed to. </para>

These are the two items of so-called socialistic legislation that the Government have agreed to. They will swallow more ; and they are chewing more than they will be able to swallow. However, I am being led off the track. The next item in the labour platform is old-age pensions. Is that socialistic? New </para>

                <para class="block">South Wales has an Old-age Pensions Act to-day, and so has Victoria. I know of instances in which the administration of the. Victorian Act has been a disgrace. Respectable men and women, who have lived industrious, honest, and decent lives, have been deprived of the benefits of the Act because they have had, perhaps, a worthless son or daughter roaming over some portion of Western Australia, or South Australia. Honest men and women who have established a claim 10 pensions by what' they have done in the past in the development of the resources of this country - who are aged and unable to work - have had them withheld, whilst others, who have been prepared to a awl and creep and to resort to the practices referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> H. Reid at Warragul, have been able to get pensions. I say the old-age pension instituted by the Commonwealth should be one that every man and woman who has earned it should be able to claim as a right, and not as a dole or a bone thrown to a dog. The only qualification should be old age and residence in Australia. There is nothing socialistic in that, and I hope honorable senators will be prepared to assist in carrying the measure when it comes before them. How many are against it I would ask ? Very few ; but these few are going to do all they possibly can to defeat it. The next item in this "socialistic" programme is the nationalization of monopolies. We have carried resolutions in this Senate affirming the principle. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not He is right in a good many things, but he has had very little fair play. Our friends' opposite are all afraid of Tom -Mann. It is due to the work of Tom Mann that the Labour Party have an increased representation in the Victorian Parliament to-day. A few men like him are needed, and we have them. We are seeing the results of their efforts, not only in Victoria, but also in South Australia, Queensland, and Western Australia. They do their work in daylight, and tell the people the truth. There is no "crawling policy" about their methods. Now, with respect to the nationalization of monopolies, if any business has become a monopoly to the detriment of the rest of the people of the Commonwealth, then it should be crushed, and the only way to crush it is to nationalize it. That is a statement which every patriot will, I think, accept. What we contend for has been done in other countries, and it will be done again. </para>

                        <para>- I do not like to include every one at all times ; but so far as the iron industry is concerned, every one knows its possibilities. It is not yet a monopoly, because the manufacture of iron from the ore is not an established industry. But we know what has happened elsewhere, and we should take precautions to prevent the same thing occurring here. I want to refer now to the statements made by the Prime Minister and others who go about the city declaiming against Socialism. They take their diy dogs and tigers with them at all times. The Labour Party has never had an idea of dragging things down to that uniform level. Its members recognise that in the carrying on of a monopoly of that description the Deputy Postmaster-General is just as necessary as the boy who delivers the telegrams. We all know that the Deputy Postmaster-General receives higher remuneration than a telegraph boy or a postmaster. And we all recognise that the Deputy Postmaster-General is entitled to higher remuneration, not only by reason of the position which he occupies, but also by reason of the ability which he displays. What the Labour Party desire is not to drag the position of the Deputy Postmaster-General down to that of the postmaster, but to make it possible that a telegraph boy shall have an equal opportunity with every other telegraph boy of rising to the position of Deputy Postmaster-General. And as it is in that Department, so 'we wish it to be in the case of every other monopoly which may be taken over by the State. I have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> say in' his place that our policy is to bring everything down to one dead level, and I have heard others express the same idea. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator has been told different, and he ought to believe the statements of those who are advocating the policy of the Labour Party, and who, of course, know more about it than he does. We are also told by the Prime Minister that we are the puppets of somebody outside, that we have no independence, that we are bound by the decision of a caucus which sits in a cellar, or some place of that description. I wish to disabuse the mind of any man or woman in Australia of any such idea as that. The members of the Labour Party are the most independent persons in the' Commonwealth. It is really those who are under the domination of the individualists who are not independent. Does any honorable senator think that there is a labour man who would sit at the table and occupy the position which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> fills? </para>

                        <para>- The Labour Party kept <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> in office along with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> for nearly three years, and there was no talk at that time about machine politics, or caucus _ rule, or anything of that kind. ' No; we were fine fellows so long as we followed their lead. We thought that in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> we were following a man who was going for the principles we were advocating. But when we find that he has been hypnotized, or deluded, or turned in some way from the correct path, we can only despise him. And I despise the man who in another House said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> was the only member of the late Government for whom he could express any respect. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> made that remark, and then apologized to some of the other members. He has a right to apologize to me, because I never asked him for anything; I never crawled to him for anything, nor do I ever intend to do so. It was he who went up to Ballarat, and like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> declared that I said that the Labour Party was .for sale, although he had been repeatedly told how that remark came to be made. How was it made? From my place here, I characterized the leader of the Government, the leader of the Opposition, who, at that time was. I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing, Senator Neild,</inline> and others, were present, and they were all leaders - as suns round whom no planets revolved. I distinctly remember using the words. It was in that sense that I declared that the Labour Party was up for sale to the highest bidder. I spoke in a jocular sense, as those honorable senators knew. They have known all along that the Labour Party was never up for sale in any dishonorable sense. </para>

I wish to give honorable senators a correct idea of this machine to see if they can copy it, as they are trying to get all the farmers' associations, property-owners' associations, and ladies' national associations to unite1, and present a solid front to the socialistic party. Is not that what they are trying to do? They are trying to create a machine which will knock out our machine, and their only regret is that they cannot do it. That is exactly the position. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to indicate to honorable senators who are envious of the Labour Party's machine how they can avail themselves of it, and make use of it, if they only care to turn from their evil ways in a political sense, and get into the straight path, and abide by the principles by which every honest politician ought to abide. Any honorable senator can become a member of a trade union if he works at any calling, and then no one will call him a non-unionist, or a black-leg, or any name of that kind. He can then join a democratic association affiliated with the </para>

                <para class="block">Labour Party, or any district committee connected with the Labour Party, by paying a shilling per week and get his ticket. That will give him the privilege of having a say in the formulation of the platform. The policy is not formulated by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> or a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> and then presented to be swallowed 'by the people, but the people through their representatives agree to their policy. Every member of the Labour Party has, therefore, a say in the formulation of the labour platform. He. has also as a member of the Labour Party, a right to be nominated as a candidate. If he accepts the nomination, and goes to the plebiscite, he has to sign a pledge. I am going to tell honorable senators what that pledge means, and ask if none of them has signed a similar pledge, Every candidate is asked to sign a pledge that he will abide by the platform of the Labour Party which he assisted to formulate, and to which he agreed, and if he is not chosen by his fellow labourites to run as a candidate at the election, he is not to contest a district which is contested by an accredited labour man. .Is there anything dishonorable in signing that pledge? Has no honorable senator on the other side ever been asked to sign a pledge of that description? Has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> never received a circular from a blue ribbon association, and signed it, and returned it? Is there anything dishonorable in doing that? If the Free-trade Association ever sent a circular to any honorable senators, and asked them to sign it, and they did, was there anything dishonorable in that? No; but the dishonour would lie in their departing from the pledge afterwards. That is exactly the position which every member of the Labour Party occupies. Again, it is said, " Oh, but you have this obnoxious caucus. You are ruled by the caucus. You cannot do Anything which the caucus does not indicate <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> you. If a majority of the caucus say that you are to go into the House and vote Â»n a certain direction, you are bound to do it, whether you like it or not." </para>

                        <para>- No. Is it not right that the members of the Labour Party should be bound by the seven planks which they circulated by the thousand among the people at the elections, and for which they made themselves responsible? And that is all that the caucus can bind them to. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce, Senator Henderson,</inline> or any other member of our party, can tell the Senate that when any question outside the party's programme is brought up for discussion in caucus, if any member objects to that discussion, he can stop it. If, for purposes of enlightening each other, the discussion is carried on, and if it is thought necessary to go to a vote, no such vote wilt bind any member of the party in the caucus on that question. Is it surprising to honorable senators opposite to hear that statement? Yet, it is the absolute truth. No member of the party is bound with respect to any question outside the platform of the party, and no member is asked to bind himself on any such question. I believe, however, that in New South Wales it has been the custom in the past, where, the fate of a Government was involved, for a caucus decision to be binding on the whole of the party. </para>

                        <para>- That may have been the case in the New South Wales Labour Party, but, such' a rule does not exist in connexion with the Federal Labour Party. I am stating things as they really are. Those members of Parliament who go into the country - whether they be <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Reid, or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin - and say anything to the contrary, are misrepresenting the Labour Party ; and when they are told what I have told 'them;, and continue to make those statements, they are knowingly misrepresenting the Labour Party. My testimony can be borne out by every member of our party who is present. I have shown that none of the calamities predicted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> with respect to bringing down society to a dead-level of mediocrity, are well-founded. That term is often used with respect to the policy of the Labour Party. If one looks at both sides in either House of the Federal Parliament, or any other Australian Parliament, and considers where the mediocrity is to be found, he will be satisfied that the policy of the Labour Party has not a tendency in that direction. The next plank in the platform of the Labour Party that is condemned as being so socialistic that no body can follow it, and with respect to which some persons are trying to frighten the country, is that of a Citizen Defence Force. But to that policy we in the Senate have all agreed. I am not going to argue it. The present Government agreed to it, and consequently they are in just the same boat as we are. The next plank is the prevention of borrowing. Is there any one who is prepared to encourage the policy of borrowing? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> who was a member of the first Federal Government, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> went up to Ballarat, and tried to make the people there believe that the Deakin and Barton Governments were opposed to borrowing. They made that statement deliberately. But is it not a well-known fact that a Bill was introduced by the Barton Government for the purpose of borrowingÂ£500,000, and was it not in consequence of the action of the Labour Party and other Liberal members that that was prevented? The prevention of borrowing, therefore, is also a plank of the platform of the Labour Party that is approved by both Houses of Parliament, and which is recognised as right by nearly every man and woman in Australia. The next plank is navigation and shipping. The present Government have accepted the Royal Commission that was appointed by the late Government to inquire into that subject. That is the policy of the Labour Party from beginning to end. </para>

                        <para>- That, no doubt, is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> would call it. I shall deal with one or two items to show the anomalous position which some of the members of the Government occupy. In the Senate yesterday the Attorney-General referred, in that sinking manner which he adopted - because he was sinking everything yesterday; I hope he will rouse himself ; he does more credit to himself when he is fighting than when he is whining - to the question of preferential trade. Much has been said lately with regard to preferential trade. We have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> express patriotic sentiments with respect to the old country. But, in the name of heaven, what preference can he or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Reid give to the old country if they remain consistent to the programme and platform which they have advocated for years past? For twenty years or more <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has declared that every country should be placed on the same footing with respect to our trade, and that the productions of every country should be admitted free. </para>

They cannot give any preference to anybody, unless they are going to be submerged or merged, or swallowed by McLean-Turner, and Co., or unless they are going to swallow their own principles and adopt some differential or preferential system of dealing with imports from the old country, and other countries. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid, Senator Symon,</inline> and their free-trade supporters, can offer to Great Britain nothing but their loyalty, and that is not worth very much. It has never been worth much to Great Britain. But when the time comes, and there is a necessity for it, I have no doubt that the Labour Party will prove, as it has always proved in the past, and always will prove, that it can give expression not only to loyal sentiments, but to loyal performances as far as the old country is concerned. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline>
                    who knows something about railways, will agree with me that a survey is one of the processes of construction. In such matters the first process is a preliminary or flying survey, and then a survey is made with the intention of constructing the line, the cost of the survey being generally considered as part of the cost of construction.

                        <para>- I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> will agree with me in that, whether he favours or does not favour the construction of the line. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> does not agree that there ought to be a survey made, but that is because he does not agree with the construction of the line, whereas I do favour the survey, because I have always advocated this transcontinental railway. Will the Attorney-General be honest enough to say that the Government will spend ,Â£20,000 on a survey, and then advocate the construction of the line? We know that the Attorney-General will say "Yes" as to a survey," but he desires To have a loophole in the near future, so as to be able to say " No " as to the construction, thus carrying the "Yes- No" policy to its legitimate issue. There are a great many 'other point's which might be considered in connexion with the alleged policy of the Government, but, as I have already pointed out, the present Administration are willing to sink everything - the fiscal question, the electoral boundaries question, and the transcontinental railway question. They take up the latter question tentatively' only to gain support from a few Western Australian members. I urge the Western Australian members, not only in the Senate, but in another place, to beware of men who are prepared to say " Yes-No ' ' in the way which has been manifested to us during the past tew days. The Attorney-General will not give me a decided answer; but I contend that if we spend Â£20,000 on a survey we should be prepared to go on with the construction of the line. If we are not prepared 10 construct the line, let us save this ,Â£20,000 to the people of Australia, though I know that the line must ultimately be provided, and will be for the benefit of the Commonwealth. The policy of the present Government is exactly that advocated by the Ministry to which I belonged ; the only difference' is that the policy is not now advocated with the same earnestness or honesty. In my opinion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> yesterday showed to greater disadvantage than he has on any other occasion. Honorable senators, I have no doubt, could bear testimony that the Attorney-General, I was going to say, conducted himself in a manner that hardly did credit to his ability, and the position he occupies in the legal profession. However that may be, we have had the policy of the Government delivered, and that policy will be carried into effect if the Government can possibly do it. Up to the present, however, the only object which the Government 'have made manifest, to the people of Australia is either that they want to " knock out " the Labour Party, or merely want to get into office themselves. They' may contend that the Labour Party have been conducting themselves in a manner 'injurious to t'he country ; but I contend that the party to which I belong have proved their ability to carry on the government of the country just as effectively as has any other section of Parliament. Indeed, the great danger to the other side was that if the Labour Party were allowed to remain in office for long the people of Australia would begin to realize that they were, a proper people to govern. To-day the official organ of the Government, the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> threatens the Labour Party with a dissolution. We are told that if the Opposition do not allow the business of the country to be carried on in an expeditious manner the result will be a dissolution. But how, in" the name of heaven, can the fear of a dissolution be charged against any member of the Labour Party, either here or in another place? The Labour Party have already desired a dissolution, so that it 'is difficult to see how they can be afraid of such a contingency. </para>

                        <para>- The Queensland elections have put the fear of death into a great .many people, but I am afraid there will have to be many similar exhibitions of the power of the Labour Party before those who differ from us cease annoying a section of the community, whose only aspiration and object is the welfare of the country. The Labour Party have no selfish motive to serve. They have no other business to occupy" them - there is nothing to induce them to stay away from the work of Parliament. They come here and do their duty, with nothing to distract their attention ; and the same cannot be said of every other section of Parliament. It is surely time the people of Australia realized the fact that if they want the country governed well, the government must be carried on by men whose best interests are bound up in the welfare of the country. We have a member of another place bv name of Grattan Wilson, who, speaking in the southern portion of Victoria, expressed the opinion that those we' want in Parliament are men who have given evidence of their ability to carry on their own business - men who have made names for themselves in the commercial world. It almost makes' me shiver when my memory turns over the history of Victoria. The late Robert Reid was a commercial magnate, and other business men in the public life of Victoria are <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKenzie, Mr. Taverner, Sir Alexander</inline> Peacock, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webb,</inline> the last-mentioned of whom gave evidence before the Butter Commission the other day. These were commercial men of high standing. Do we want a few more Webbs, Taverners McKenzies, Woods, Dunns, Bartarms, and Hopes in our public life? The people of Australia are sick of such men, and are getting more disgusted every day, and the result is that the Labour Party will have more successes in Queensland, Western Australia, and other portions of the Commonwealth. The people are filled with disgust at the dishonesty practised by the commercialists we hear so much about. </para>

I have already said in this chamber that if we have an Old Age Pensions scheme it should be a scheme for the whole Commonwealth. Under the New South Wales Act, deserving persons who have been over twenty years in Australia, but yet have not been continuously resident in New South Wales, have been refused pensions. That was an injustice, but such cases could only be met by a Commonwealth measure. Therefore, an Old-age Pensions scheme to be satisfactory must cover the whole of the Commonwealth, and not be applicable only to particular States. </para>

                        <para>- No; we have sunk the fiscal issue. Some reference has been made to immigration. We have no control over land legislation ; but there is a vast area available for settlement in the Northern Territory of South Australia, and I hope that some system of -assisted immigration will be adopted. That Northern Territory has never had justice done to it, and I. am told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that it is capable of supporting a very large number of agriculturists. But they will require to have inducements to settle in the country. With regard to fiscal matters, we must try to remember that it has been said on verv high authority, " Blessed are the peacemakers." We wish to see peace prevail, that the country may progress and prosper. I cannot understand my free-trade friends opposite entering into coalition with the so-called Liberal Protectionists. </para>

                        <para>- Our party sink the fiscal issue. With respect to the High Commissioner the proposal of the Government is highly commendable. They intend to confer with the States, and to consult their interests. In that way it is hoped that a large expense will be saved. And in this connexion I am glad to notice that the Premier of New South Wales is agreeable that the High Commissioner shall take up as many as possible of the duties which now devolve upon the Agents-General. </para>

                        <para>- He is a demagogue ; and if there is a dissolution the Labour Party will come back very much weakened. I have heard that the Labour Party supported both the Barton and the Deakin Governments, not from any admiration of them as individuals, but for what they could get out of them. That was sheer selfishness. Now, with regard to the Western Australian railway, I have always been an advocate of it. I spoke of it in days gone by. I thought then that we should have a railway running from one end of the continent to the other, and I even took the view that it might be paid for by land grants. </para>

In doing so I shall endeavour to avoid the extremely regrettable tone he adopted. With the previous speaker, I deplore his references to the Vice-Pre'sident of the Executive Council. There is no rule, either in the Federal or the States Parliaments, which would necessarily make the Vice-President of the Executive Council the lea'der of the Upper House. There is no honorable gentleman who would not be proud to serve under the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> and there was no other position which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> could take. </para>

I wish to pass on to the observation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> dealing with the policy of the Government. I was struck in listening to his wholesale denunciations, by the strange mixture of questionable sincerity and extravagant modesty which marked them.

                        <para>- I resent the arrogance of the members of the Labour Party, who. on the public platform, and in every public discussion, claim that they alone possess the virtues of truth and rectitude. I am going to test them. But I must go back. I was referring to the contradiction in the attitude of honorable senators opposite to the programme of the Government. His criticisms on the coalition came rather strangely from a gentleman who is a member of a party which has entered into an alliance of another kind. I hardly know what name to give it. I can only describe it as the Isaacs-Watson-Lyne-Mauger combination. But there it is, and it points to the fact that two other sections in politics have found it necessary, in order to serve purposes they have in common, to agree to joint action. </para>

I am not quarrelling with the members of the Labour Party for entertaining these views, but I wish to see clearly ' before me exactly what road I am asked to travel. I think that honorable senators who come here with this modest innocently phrased programme ought in all fairness to tell, not only me but every elector in the Commonwealth, exactly where they intend to go, what their ultimate goal is.

                        <para>- So far as I am aware, the honorable senator, has never minced his words in stating what his aspirations are. What I understand as really the aspiration of the Labour Party is the control of collective industry by the State. Is there a line in this modest programme to suggest that if power be placed in their hands they ultimately intend to lead us into a state in which not a few monopolies, but all the industries are to be controlled by the Government? So far as the programme outlined by the late Government is concerned, it contained very little to which I think any honorable senator would object. But when I know, as honorable senators cannot deny, that their intention, if they once acquire permanent power, is to hurry us not merely from this little instalment of legislation, but to a condition in which all industry is to be controlled by the State, then I submit that it is time for me, as far as I can, by my individual vote, to prevent them from getting into a position which would enable them to give effect to that policy. </para>

For that very reason I am not going to place those who hold views, which I regard as injurious to the country, in a position to give greater effect to them. What battle, political, or otherwise, could be fought in that way? </para>

                        <para>- That is a candid and honest statement. The honorable senator does not deny that the ultimate aspiration of the Labour Party is Socialism. I should regard a socialistic State, in which enterprise, industry, and production are to be under the control of the Government, as not only a disaster in itself, but as bound to end in national ruin. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to point out one or two differences between the programme of the present Government and that of the last Ministry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> spoke about the Immigration Restriction Act, and said that, notwithstanding all the denunciations with reference to the Stelling case, there was no word of repealing that legislation. That is quite true, but, so far as I am concerned, the denunciations with reference to that case had nothing to do with the Act, but with the administration of its provisions. If, under this or any other Government, a similar public scandal happened, I should take up an exactly similar attitude. The man was set at liberty, and nothing more was done with him. No stronger proof that a wrong had been done could be had than the fact that the prison doors were thrown open before the sentence was served, and the man was allowed to go free. That is the only remark I desire. to make on that point. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator knows that that was done in order to have only one fight instead of two. Having made the question of preference to unionists vital, the members of the late Government cannot turn round now, and say that there is no difference between their measure and that of the present Government. The nationalization of monopolies is another plank in the platform of the Labour Party. . I should like to know what it means. I. should have been better pleased if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> instead of affirming that no honorable senator would object to the nationalization of a monopoly had stated in detail what it is that his party wants. Honorable senators are well aware that the Senate has been invited and has carried resolutions affirming the desirability of having a national tobacco monopoly. I am utterly opposed to the proposal, for I can conceive of no monopoly in an industry of that kind. Then we have had the nationalization of the iron industry advocated. </para>

                        <para>- But you may have a despotic state of Socialism as well as a democratic state of Socialism. Honorable senators opposite surely do not mean to say that it is impossible to have a condition of corruption under Socialism. Corruption does not depend upon whether a State is individualistic or socialistic, but upon whether the administration of the- Government is pure. I was about to draw attention to a remarkable omission from the programme of the Labour Party, as laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> and which marks another point of difference between myself an3 his party.' It is strange that in explaining that programme the honorable senator made no allusion to the plank which has reference to the Banking Bill. That is another point upon which I fall out with honorable senators opposite. I decline to support any legislation that is in the nature of an enforced loan from private individuals. I expected that the late Vice-President of the, Executive Council would explain the attitude of his party towards that portion of their policy, but he dropped it out of sight, probably finding it most convenient to do so. The honorable senator glanced away from another point in the programme of his party when he spoke of the Navigation Bill'. He tried to make it appear that because the present Government have approved of the Royal Commission that has been appointed, therefore the policy of the late Government and that of the present Government were in common in that respect. I do not know that the present Government has made a declaration of policy regarding the Navigation Bill ; but the fact that they have not adopted the policy which I know to have been es- 'poused by members of the Labour Partyfurnishes me with another reason why, until the present Government have declared their policy on that subject, I am bound to take my place on this side of the chamber. </para>

                        <para>- Probably the report of the Royal Commission may help them to frame one. I now come to the question of the caucus. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has affirmed that really there is no difference between the caucus - the name by which the meetings of the Labour Party are known - and the ordinary meetings of any other political party in this country. I admit at once that he made out a very good case from his point of view. But he spoilt it by another remark. While affirming that there was no difference between the caucus of the Labour Party and the ordinary meetings of any other political party, he also said, " The only thing that is troubling other parties is that they cannot imitate it." If we have the same system as his party has, we need not be troubled because we cannot imitate it. If it be true that we are troubled because we cannot imitate the caucus of the Labour Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> showed at once that there is a marked difference between our methods and the methods which we cannot imitate. There is another point. There is a difference - let honorable members opposite deny it as much as they will - between the methods of the Labour Party" and the methods of other parties at their ordinary meetings. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and the honorable member's party is rapidly leading to that position. I do not blame the man who controls the machine, when, having a fibrous intellect, he comes along and makes himself master of his party. It is the system that I find 'fault with. That is what has always happened in political affairs when the machine has been established. I have spoken longer than I intended to do, led on by a fire of interjections. I desire to say only a word or two in conclusion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has contended that there is virtually no difference between the policy of his party and that of the present Government. I have risen to show as far as I can what to my mind makes the broad difference between honorable members on the one side and on the other. That difference is that on the one side there is a distinct desire to advance steadily in a direction- the goal of which must be Socialism ; whereas, on the side upon which I take my stand there is a belief that only by means of reasonable measures can we expect to obtain improvements and to promote a state of prosperity that will become permanent. </para>

                    <para>- I think we can say that whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in his usual vigorous style has attacked the party to which I belong he has refrained from . personalities ; and I hope. that in any remarks which I may have to make in following him I may also achieve that end. I think that we can differ with respect to the policies of the various parties that are represented in this Parliament without indulging in personalities towards those who represent opposing parties. I wish to say in reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> defence of the position of the Vice-President of the Executive Council in this chamber that the only thing that struck me forcibly in his remarks was this : I wondered that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> did not on this occasion give voice to the very vigorous protest which he has expressed on other occasions with regard to the fact that the present Government have again followed the pernicious example of other Governments in appointing only two Ministers in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I also expressed the same opinion in regard to the late Government. I said that I thought they had made a mistake. It seems to me that the only way effectively to protest in this matter is that when, as is now the case, there is a powerful Opposition in the Senate, that Opposition should use its power in such a way as to induce the Government to realize thai it is necessary to appoint another Minister in the Senate. That is the only way to make our protests effectual. I do not complain or cavil that a Coalition Government has been formed. I am rather pleased to see it. I certainly cavil at the nature of the actions which led to the formation of the coalition. But that is the only part of the business to be ashamed of. Every earnest student of reform should rejoice to see that a Coalition Government has been formed, because it brings into Federal politics a new line of cleavage - a line differing altogether from that which has existed in our States Parliaments, and in the Commonwealth Parliament, in the past. It gets rid of the old line of cleavage between freetrade and protection. We now have! a clear line between those who favour collective effort in the public interest, and those who are in favour of individual effort for individual self-aggrandizement. The Labour Party ought to be the last of all parties to object to that new line of demarcation. The sooner that line is accentuated, the better for us. The recent .new movements in Federal politics have accentuated that line of demarcation, and have emphasized the fact that the real issue is between the respective parties which I have mentioned. In the past, in my opinion, the importance of the question of free-trade and protection was very much exaggerated. It was time that it was relegated to the back-ground. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in criticising the Opposition, wanted to know whether we deny that our programme is in a socialistic direction. No member of the Labour Party will deny that. We admit that our programme is in a socialistic direction. But because that is so, we do not admit that it naturally commits us to immediate Socialism. ' It is just as unreasonable for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to say that the policy of the Labour Party commits us to immediate Socialism, because some Socialists are extreme in their opinions, as it would be for me to say that because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is supporting a reactionary Government, therefore he is in favour of a complete reaction to barbarism. There are those who sit alongside <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> who are opposed to practically all measures which are introduced into the Federal Parliament. Those people would, if they could, push our progress back a few years. But it would not. therefore, be fair to say of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and his associates, that the majority of them are in favour of pushing our politics back to a state of barbarism. While Socialism may be our ultimate goal, I think that a good deal of misapprehension is created in the minds of people, and, perhaps, also, in the minds of politicians in regard to it; though I am not one of those who believe that politicians are usually led astray in reference to these matters. It must be remembered that we are all more or less Socialists nowadays. To a greater or lesser degree there is scarcely a business man or a member of the Employers' Federation who is not to some extent a believer in Socialism, or who is not prepared in some degree to regard the State as a socialistic entity, to increase or to advantage his particular interests. Wherever that can be done he is quite prepared to enter into socialistic schemes. It ill becomes these gentlemen to condemn all forms of Socialism, when they are prepared to take advantage of them when it suits their own interests. The attitude of the Labour Party is that, where any industry becomes a monopoly, which, to the injury of the community, is being used to the advantage of a few, we should make it an industry owned and controlled by the people. That is the interpretation which we put upon our programme in this respect. We have not attempted to deceive the people. We have plainly told them what our opinions are. We did not reach the Treasury benches or attain to our present strength by any subterfuge or any deceit, but bv the goodwill and the votes of the people of Australia. Therefore, it is idle to object to our presence here unless it can bp shown that it is likely to lead to some injury. </para>

                        <para>- The - tone of his speech to my mind indicated that objection. The honorable senator also said that the late Government, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> was a member, made the preference clause of the Arbitration Bill vital. The late Government were prepared to do that, but the members of the present Government did not give them an opportunity to do so, and took the business of the country out of the hands of the late Government, who, having some respect for their political Consciences, resigned. I wish to say, as an intimation to the present Government, that so far as I am concerned, I believe that the preference clause, without the amendment which was moved by a member of the present Ministry, is absolutely vital - that without such a clause we might as well be without an Arbitration Act. If the Government believe in arbitration - unless they are going to bring in a Bill which will take away from the workers of Australia the right to strike, or the right to take their cases to an impartial tribunal - they must insert a preference clause without the so-called McCay . amendment. I only hope that when the Bill is introduced here we shall see that when it leaves the chamber it is a measure just to the trades unions of Australia. I was surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> refer to what he called the enforced loans which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> foreshadowed when referring to the Banking Bill. I do not think that the term " enforced loans " is a proper one to use, but in any case I should like to as'k whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was not a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales at the time when the private enterprise banks of Australia took a forced loan from the people who had in good faith deposited money in those institutions? The banks at that time took a forced loan on which they never paid any interest, and, in some instances, have not yet repaid the principal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> objects to the Government taking what he calls a forced loan, though it ought to be remembered that the Government would pay both interest and principal, and safeguard the credit of the banks. Why did not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .</inline> Millen, in 1893, endeavour to bring about such legislation in New South Wales as would prevent the spoliation of private individuals bv the private enterprise banks? Then we find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> objecting to the political machine. Just fancy a member of the free-trade delegation from New South Wales objecting to machine politics ! Why, if there was any example of the working of a machine in Federal politics in Australia., it was the return of the free-trade senators from that State. </para>

                        <para>- The election was run on a ticket not chosen by an organization, but chosen by a newspaper editor and the leader of the free-trade party. That ticket was placed before the people of New South Wales, by the two party newspapers, and the free-trade senators were elected without cavil or question. The men who were fortunate enough to get on the ticket knew that they did not need to address a single meeting or issue a single manifesto. They knew perfectly well that the machine, though small numerically, and as an organization very little representative of the people, was powerful enough to elect them in spite of all opposition. I should like to draw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> attention to the difference between that kind of machine and the machine which was indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> The latter is not a machine of two men or two newspaper editors, but' of thousands and thousands of electors. The organization is open to every man and woman in the Commonwealth, who may not merely become automata members pulled by the strings of a newspaper office, but who may have an equal and effective voice in its control. If we 'have to make a choice as to which is the best machine in the interests of the people, surely we ought to adopt the one which is controlled by and composed of the people rather than a machine controlled by, and composed of two individuals or two newspaper prints. As to the programme which has been placed before us by the Government, we can, at any rate, say that the present Ministry do not mean to work us in such a way that we shall have much overtime during the present session. The programme put before us is more noticeable for what is left out than for what appears. However, I congratulate the Attorney-General on the fact that the Government have recognised that two Bills on the notice-paper are non-party, and are very useful measures. It would have been very unfair, even if one of those measures, though it may contain some party or contentious matter, had been thrown under the table. I desire to give the Government every credit for recognising that the two measures to which I refer will be very useful to the trading community of Australia, and tend to the protection of the people, and for taking those measures up just as they were left, fully prepared to send them on to the other Chamber to be dealt with. We are all pleased to hear that the Government are negotiating in order to carry into effect the Seat of Government Act. I trust that the full spirit of that Act will bc recognised. While there may be some room for negotiation as to area, I trust the Government will recognise that both Houses have distinctly provided that the area acquired must be ample. We must have an area sufficient for the growth of a considerable city - we must have so much that we shall know that whatever value is created shall be retained by the Federal authorities, and not be given to the State, simply owing to the small area acquired. I trust that some of' the parochial} statements which have appeared in New South Wales will, on further consideration, give place to a broader and more Australian sentiment. I trust that we shall have no more ot that spirit of 'hostility which has been displayed by some of the public men of New South Wales, but that they will meet the Federal Parliament and settle this question iri an Australian spirit. In regard to the Arbitration Bill, and the decision of the Government to proceed with it as it stands, I venture to say that when it comes before us we shall be able to take such action as will make it more in accord with what is required in a workable measure of the kind. I am rat'her surprised at the proposal of the Government, that the High Commissioner Bill shall be held over till next session. I notice that the Government state that they intend to call a conference of State Premiers on this matter. While it might very well be said that on some questions the Federal Government have every right to consult with the States Premiers, still I, as one who am jealous of the rights of this Senate, urge that we, more effectively than any States Premiers, represent the States. The High Commissioner Bill might well have been introduced to this House and passed, and the Status then given an invitation to arrange their State agencies, so as to fit in with the Bill, It seems to me that the Government, in going first to the State Premiers and asking whether they are agreeable to change their arrangements, are placing this Chamber in a secondary position. I understand there are various questions on which it is proposed to take the opinion of the States Premiers ; but I think the Government might first take the opinion of the Commonwealth Parliament. We find that, on the question of old-age pensions, the States Premiers are to be consulted, which simply means that we are going to ask the Premiers to make proposals as to finances of the Commonwealth. What can be the reason for consulting the States Premiers? Is it not that the Government contemplate that if a proposal for old-age pensions is made, we shall have to interfere with the amount of money now returned to the various States Treasurers? We are, therefore, to go cap in hand to the States Treasurers, and ask them if they will be willing to spare that amount of money - whether they will make a noise if we reduce the amount now returned. It is most certain that the States Treasurers will object, and we shall then be told that old-age pensions are not practicable, because, it may be, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler,</inline> of South Australia, or some other Treasurer, finds that he cannot spare the money. If the Government believe in old-age pensions, they ought to bring a proposal before the Commonwealth Parliament, and make the necessary financial arrangements, leaving the. State Treasurers to do their duty and make their arrangements ibr the revenue they require. If the people of Australia believe in old-age pensions, they are prepared to make the necessary sacrifice. The people do not vote for old-age pensions without knowing that they will have to provide the money, and they will be quite willing to make up any deficiency which may result in the revenue This is ons of the questions which the Government should refer to the Federal Parliament rather than to a conference of States Premiers. If the Government continue in office I shall, of course, be a critic, though a fair critic; and I hope that the measures which are passed will be for the benefit of the people of Australia- </para>

                    <para>- There does not seem to be very much interest taken in this debate, seeing that there is barely a quorum present. I was rather surprised that the Government did not put up a Minister who had not spoken, to reply to the leader of the Opposition, unless, of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> happens to be an honorary Minister. It would have been the course usually followed in such cases, and it was a compliment due, I think, to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> There are one or two faults I have to find with the present Ministry, and I shall deal not so much with their policy as with their personnel. Up to the present time in the Federal Parliament, each Chamber has been led by a protectionist, but now each is led by a freetrader. That causes me to look with some little suspicion on the present Administration. It would be idle for myself or any one to say that the leader of a House has no more power than any other honorable member ; as a1 fact, he does not count only one, but very often counts a good many, and on that ground alone I take exception to the constitution of the Government as in itself an objection in a protectionist Commonwealth. Another objection I have is as to the alleged equality in all things. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean</inline> are said to be " equal in all things." The very first step that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> took when he became Prime Minister was to issue a manifesto addressed to the people of Australia, but his other half did not even know that such was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid's</inline> intention until the manifesto was published in the newspapers. It seems to me rather a bad start for one-half of this double-barrelled Ministry to go off when the other was not even loaded. If they are co-equal, as we are assured on the highest authority - <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr. Reid</inline> - I wonder what would happen if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean</inline> were to resign. Would his resignation involve the retirement of the Government, and would it be sent to the Prime Minister or to the Governor-General ? It is absolute nonsense to talk about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean</inline> being on a footing of equality. I propose to make some remarks about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> the politician, and not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> the private citizen. No one can accuse me of having any personal feeling in this matter, for I have no recollection of ever having spoken to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> except to wish him good day. It is generally admitted that he is probably the best platform speaker in Australia. He cracks his jokes on the platform with the same easy facility that he cracks his alleged political principles off the platform. Australians do not mind jokes, but they expect something better from the man whom they place at the head of affairs in the Commonwealth. From the man who holds the highest position in their gift, they require consistency. The nation- has fixed a very high standard for the man who is at the head of public affairs. They do not want an opportunist with a political past, but a high-minded man to whom they can all look up. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> as we all know, slanders, abuses, and sneers at a man one day- </para>

                    <para>I was Premier for five years in New South Wales, during which the Labour Party had me in the hollow of their hand, but what was the result? I got my free-trade policy passed by protectionist labour men. </para>

                <para class="block">I shall point out how misleading that statement was to his audience. According to his own showing, he did a five years' grovel. He was under no compulsion to remain in the hollow of the hand of the Labour Party ; he was crawling and .subservient then. He charged <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton with being crawling and subservient to the Labour Party ; and yet he gets up and tells the public, when it suits himself, that he was in the hollow of the hand of the Labour Party for five years. The line of discreditable subserviency and cowardice must have been passed scores of times during that period, and his Government must have been a dishonorable tool in the hands of the Labour Party, as I intend to show. He said, at Bowral, that the Barton Government kept one eye on the Labour Party. It will be seen directly that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> kept both eyes on the Labour Party for very many years. The inference which he wished his listeners in Collins-street the other day to draw from his remark was that he made use of the protectionist-labour members and other protectionists in order to get his, free-trade policy placed on the statute-book, but the greater portion of the crawling and subserviency took place after his Tariff was assented to by the Governor on the 1  2  th of December, 1895. * propose to. show that he is a prohibitionist as well as an opportunist. In 1896, tenders were invited by the Government of New South Wales for the construction of a bridge over the Murrumbidgee River at Gundagai. A Victorian firm, named McKenzie and Sons, sent in the lowest tender, but it was put aside by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid's</inline> Government, although there was no restriction placed in the advertisement on the location of the tenderers, and the contract was given to a New South Wales contractor. McKenzie and Sons were well known as contractors in Victoria and New Zealand. They purchased plans and specifications from the State Government, and their good cash was accepted, but the contract was refused to them. A transaction of that kind in private life would be called by a very ugly name. If this firm and other contractors had been notified that it would be of no use to tender for the work because they were not resident in New South Wales, they would not have bothered to send in a tender. There was nothing against this firm, and yet the contract, I repeat, was given to a local man by the Reid Government. </para>

                        <para>- New' South Wales did not open her markets on that occasion to Victoria. I could understand a Premier in a protectionist State adopting the policy which is embodied in that resolution, but I cannot understand the head of the freetraders of Australia heartily concurring, in that resolution, and at the same time telling the people that he took a great pride in keeping the door open to the other Colonies. It seems to me that this was not very good free-trade, but it was excellent prohibition, both in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKenzie</inline> and in the other case which I have just mentioned. This gentleman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> who will not now take up the Iron Bonus Bill, says that he will allow every member of his Government to vote as he pleases with regard to the proposition contained in that measure. Yet this is the same gentleman who offered an advantage of 15 per cent, to those who would start iron works in New South Wales, to turn out 150,000 tons of steel rails. That, again, was excellent protection, but it was very bad free-trade. It shows that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> is prepared to throw his principles <inline font-style="italic">to the</inline> four winds of heaven whenever it suits himself. After he had passed his free-trade Tariff in New South Wales, the Labour Party there compelled him to pass other legislation which was in their interests. They held him in the hollow of their hand. In 1896 he passed the Mines Acts Amendments Acts. In 1896 he passed the Coal Mines Regulation Act. In the same year he passed the Factories Act. In 1896, and again in 1898, he passed the Elections Acts. In 1898 tie passed an Act for the exclusion of inferior races. I am quoting these instances from a pamphlet written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Black,</inline> who claims, and with apparently good " reason, that the Labour Party in New South Wales were able to force these measures from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid's</inline> Government. Was not that cringing and crawling to the Labour Party in order that he might remain in office? He could not have been doing it for any other purpose. It is really very funny ! Four years ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> came to Melbourne and delivered a speech in the Town Hall. He there stated - and it is to be remembered that Federation was then about to be consummated - that if he came into office he would throw the protected industries of Victoria into the water and let them sink or swim as they might. He expressed the opinion that if an industry after having been established for thirty years could not carry on without protection it was not worth protecting. This was his :dry-dog threat ! But it was very cheap politics. Iri the same way, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> might come over to Melbourne, and threaten all sorts of things, knowing that he had no voters to face on this side of the border. </para>

                        <para>- No; one had to get a ticket in order to gain admittance, just as though it were a soup kitchen ! Having passed his Tariff in 1895, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> did not place upon the free list several articles which were manufactured in New South Wales. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> who is a complete encyclopaedia on this subject, will know that that is the case. He will recollect that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> stated that he intended to wipe out the protectionist Tariff. And he did it to a certain extent. But he retained some items. He retained preserved and canned fruits, biscuits, confectionery, sugar, and certain other similar articles. In fact, at the end of 1898, three years after his Tariff came into force, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> himself brought in a Bill to repeal some portions of his own Tariff, in order that the duties might continue to operate. The duty at that time on sugar was ,Â£4 per ton refined, arid Â£3 per ton raw. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> imposed a duty of Â£1 more per ton on refined than on raw sugar in order that the raw sugar might be refined in New South. Wales factories by New South Wales workmen. This again was very excellent protection, but it was very bad free-trade. I am pointing out how subservient he was to the protectionists and to the Labour Party. But that is not all. He threatened, as I have said, that he would throw every Victorian .industry into the water, because he considered that an industry ought to be able to swim after thirty years of protection. But sugar cane had been grown in New South Wales for over thirty years. It was grown there be: fore we had a single protectionist industry in Victoria. At the time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> came into power there were over 30,000 acres under crop in New South Wales. But he did not attempt to throw that dog into the water. There were many thousands of votes behind the dog ! The Colonial Sugar Refining Company was behind it also. That meant many votes in the Legislative Assembly. Therefore <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> determined to keep his hands off that dog. He now fawns upon the farming industry - the country producers. He talks of the " great producing industries of Australia," and they cheer him to the echo. But that is not what he said at the Melbourne Town Hall in the speech to which I have previously referred. </para>

That is to say, that if he could get it down to a revenue standard the effect would be to shut up the protectionist factories in Victoria, and Great Britain would, therefore, have no serious competitors in the country. But he said that if he failed in that respect he and his party would devote their strength to granting a substantial preference to the mother country by making reductions in the present schedule of duties.

                    <para>Twenty-five years ago nothing would have seemed more unlikely than that the twentieth century would open with a scarcely veiled antagonism between Great Britain and Germany, and a rapidly growing conviction among Englishmen throughout the world, that the Germans are their enemies, the nation with whom they will have to reckon in the near future. It would have seemed incredible that in a few years they would develop national ambitions inconsistent with the continued existence of the British Empire, and would look forward eagerly to the time when they would be strong enough to challenge its naval supremacy. Yet this is exactly what has happened. It is as though a veil had been suddenly rent asunder, and we are able to see clearly what was before hidden from us, that a people whom we regarded as our best friends are really our bitterest rivals. The hostility of Germany to England is the dominant factor in the international politics to-day, and marks the opening of a new chapter in English history. We are again face to face with a power that, so far as present appearances go, will be satisfied with nothing less than our downfall. . . . They have made no secret of their longing to break up the British Empire, and. appropriate its most valuable portions, such as South Africa and Australasia. </para>

                    STYLES. England ought to open her ports freely to us, seeing that she opens them to Germany. What a difference there is between the leader in this chamber and the leader in another place ! The latter would admit German goods and any person who cared to come to this country, whereas ths Attorney-General would confine immigration to the British races.

Speaking generally, we are agreed that, if it is possible, we should make Australia the resort and the home of ourselves, of our children, and of all of the same blood who choose to come here - especially, I would say, of all of the same blood. I do not extend it even to the other white races. I am, and always have been, an advocate of keeping Australia - I would not limit it to Australians only - for those of British blood, so far as we possibly ,can. </para>

                    <para>The Conference, having considered the reply of the London office to the stipulation of the Hobart Conference with regard to the manning of the mail boats by white instead of coloured labour, recognises fully the force of the reason given by the Imperial Government against insisting lon the exclusion of coloured labour, viz. - the necessity of discriminating between various classes of British subjects ; but in reply, would respectfully point out that by some steamship companies, the labour of the contributing Colonies is excluded from employment, and an invidious preference given to the labour of countries which do not contribute to the maintenance of the service. No injustice would thus be done by the stipulation that the labour of the countries subsidizing the service only should be employed. And, therefore, this Conference is of opinion that the mails to and from Australia and Great Britain should be carried by ships manned with white crews only. </para>

                <para class="block">That telegram was sent from Sydney in the beginning of 1896, after the New South Wales Tariff was passed, and it was sent, as I say, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> who was Postmaster-General in the Reid Government.

The latter deals with only a corner of the British Empire, and a White Ocean is the initial step to what must ultimately become an Empire question. </para>

                        <para>- The black fellows would go back to their own land of curry and rice. They would say that the Britishers had paid them about one-fourth of what was paid to the white men, and that their accommodation had been very inferior, and under the circumstances they would not think it good enough to be shot at, and would go to their homes. But the greater danger would be with the white foreigners, and in my opinion every man on a British ship ought to be made to take the oath of allegiance. We train foreigners to be hardy, competent sailors, and there is no doubt that very naturally, and rightly, they would, in the event of war, go to their. own homes, and turn their country's guns against British ships.

                        <para>- The men were employed because they were cheap. It would be unfair to deprive the ship-owners of part of their profits. If, in carrying out any national policy, loss should be incurred, it should be made good to them in the same way as Germany makes good a similar loss to her ship-owners. We are told that the Britisher cannot go into the stoke-hold in the Red Sea. How do the Germans . work their vessels ? If a labour man were to go down to a German ship tomorrow, and offer to work for nothing, he would not be given a job. France does not object to lascars being employed along the coast, but she objects to foreign ships engaging in the coastal trade. Neither in France nor in America can a foreign ship trade from port to port along the coast. </para>

                        <para>- The House of Commons has begun to look into this question. At the end of 1900 it directed that an inquiry, should be made into the condition of the aliens in the British mercantile marine. An inquiry was held, and a report was laid before both Houses of the British Parliament in August, 1901, showing that during the fifteen years ending with 1900 the British mercantile marine had so increased that it employed 43,000 more men at the end of that period than it did at the beginning, that this number included 19,000 coloured aliens, 12,000 white aliens, and 12,000 boys of the bulldog breed, or a little over one in four. I should like to make a few more remarks- </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and I am going to show that it would be right to put him out as rapidly as possible, as he is an unsafe man to be there. I propose now to trace his career in another direction. I, in common with, I think, the great bulk of the people, believed that when the first Governor-General, after <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne had failed to form a Ministry, gave a commission to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton,</inline> a private citizen, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> was rather badly treated. But I have gone more fully into the matter lately, and I now think that Lord Hopetoun acted rightly. He was well posted in Australian politics, and in my opinion now he could not have done anything else than he did. </para>

Fourteen days afterwards he laid the draft Bill before the local Parliament. And four weeks later one of his supporters introduced a Bill to amend the Enabling Act, by increasing the minimum affirmative vote from 50,000 to 80,000. Any gentleman who had the appointment of a Prime Minister would look at an act of that kind two or three times before he selected <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid.</inline> The Convention Bill of 1898, it will be remembered, was wrecked because of that increase. Only 72,000 votes were polled, that is about 40 per cent, more than the original number required. In Victoria we framed our Enabling Bill on the lines of the New South Wales Enabling Act. We copied verbatim the provision for the 50,000 affirmative vote. </para>

                <para class="block">That was written fifteen months before Federation was consummated. It was urged that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> had run a straight course he might have been Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. It was the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> a supporter of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid's,</inline> which said that. Not knowing many of these things, I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> had been dealt with hardly, seeing that the Governor-General selected <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne as the first Prime Minister, and asked him to form a Ministry. It will be remembered that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne failed. If it were necessary that a member of the New South . Wales Parliament, holding a prominent position, should be sent for by the Governor-General, it seemed to me at the time that the fair and proper course, seeing that the Premier of the State had failed to form a Ministry, was to send for the leader of the Opposition, who at the time was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid.</inline> I held the opinion that at that time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> had done more for Federation than any other man in Australia. But <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne having failed, the Governor-General passed over <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> and asked a private citizen, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, to undertake the formation of the first Federal Ministry. It is true that that private citizen had been leader of the Federal Convention. But the Bill which that Convention prepared had been defeated by the people of his own State: So that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, to my mind, was really out of the running. The Bill that was accepted by the people of New South Wales was based upon the Bill which the Convention framed, but it had been revised and amended in vital points by the Premiers' Conference. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> called that Conference together. He was its moving spirit. The Bill which issued from it became our present Constitution, and not the Bill framed by the Convention. . These, it seemed to me, were strong reasons why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> should be sent for, and commissioned to form the first Federal Ministry, failing the Premier of New South Wales; it being admitted on all sides that the parent State had a kind of right to have one of its own citizens chosen to be the first Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- My own fixed conviction is that the Governor-General knew all the circumstances which I have related. Lord Hopetoun was a man who was quite abreast of Australian politics. He had been here before, and being a man of mark, we may rely upon it that he kept himself abreast of Australian affairs. </para>

                        <para>- I am only trying to show why I have no confidence in the present Prime Minister. I believe him to be an opportunist in politics, who trims his sails to catch every favouring breeze - a man who will cling to office as long as possible, and will need a locomotive to drag him from the Treasury benches1. I am thankful to honorable senators for having listened so patiently to me while, rather ruggedly, I am afraid, I have placed my views before them. There can be no personal feeling on my part, because I have never spoken to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> but when I re'ad of such things I begin to wonder whether, if he was not good enough to be Prime Minister in the first case, he has so improved as to be good enough now. </para>

I feel, however, that during the two last debates, the tone 'has deteriorated in comparison with the tone previously observed. On the two last occasions we have been treated to biographical sketches of the past careers of members of this Parliament, without any reference whatever to the larger questions which we are here to consider. I do not think that the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> or, to a certain extent, the speech of Senator McGregor, will cause the people of the Commonwealth to think that they are represented with that dignity which is their due. I feel it my duty to endeavour to fairly and equitably defend my leader from the criticism which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> has seen fit to apply. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> is too old a parliamentarian to be influenced by any personal feelings in a matter of this kind; but outrageous personalities in connexion with the political careers of members of the present Government had much better be omitted from our discussion, or, at any rate, left to those honorable senators who have knowledge and experience of the public men of the mother State. I venture to say that throughout Australia there is no gentleman, who, according to his lights, has carried on his political career more in the interests of his State and the Commonwealth than has the present Prime Minister, and I speak of him with many years experience as a close personal acquaintance. It is not necessary to go into details in order to defend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid.</inline> A gentleman who has had the good will of his- fellow citizens and has held the proud position of Premier for many years, should, at all events, be credited with good faith. When an honorable senator undertakes to give reasons why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> is not a fit person to become Prime Minister, he should make himself absolutely certain as to the particulars he wishes to prove. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> did not only go to England, but travelled throughout France, Germany, and other European countries, and produced a report which is regarded by experts as one of the most valuable ever produced on the question which he investigated, namely, old-age pensions. . When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> first undertook the commission it was not thought that he would take the immense trouble he did, or that his report would be of such a valuable character. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                <para class="block">Neild is not a rich man, and in view of the great work which he had done, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> volunteered to pay the expense absolutely incurred in getting the information together. That money <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> in his good nature, advanced ; and I may tell honorable senators what I suppose they know, that if the State Parliament had declined to authorize the expenditure <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> would have been personally responsible. There is no truth whatever in the insinuation that this money was paid with any intention of concealing the fact from Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- It has been stated over and over again by the leader of the Labour Party in New South Wales that the actual reason for the motion of -censure was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> would not consent to introduce an early closing proposal with arbitrary conditions in regard to small shops. There was not a single member of the New South Wales Parliament at the time who really believed in the principle of the motion for which he voted. I also believe there was scarcely a member of the House who did not justify <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> in advancing this money. The remarkable thing is that a subsequent Government, which for four years was dominated by the Labour Party - the party which voted for the expulsion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> from office - have since then spent thousands upon thousands of pounds without putting the proposals through tha routine of the House in the usual constitutional course. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that I could justly use the word " assisted," because I believe a good deal of the money would not have been spent but for the craving of the Labour Party. I left <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid's</inline> guidance, and went over to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> would not give his adhesion to the first Constitution Bill brought forward, though since then I rather feel that I was wrong, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rei'd</inline> was right. We should have had no Federation to-day, but for the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> gave his adherence to the Federal movement after the second Convention. When he did so, there was a shout of exultation from all Federalists, because they knew that Federation was an accomplished fact, so far as New South Wales was concerned. It must not be forgotten, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton had for years been acknowledged as the leader of the Federal movement, and he had certainly given much time and labour to his advocacy. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> had the same feeling as that to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> has given expression, and considered, so far as I know from indirect information, that he ought to have been " sent for." There were, however, others who, after <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne had formerly been offered the position, thought it only right that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton should be called upon, as the leader of the movement, to form the first Federal Government. The- insinuation that Lord Hopetoun formed such an opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> that His Excellency did not feel disposed to commission that gentleman to form a Government is beneath contempt. When I hear these strong fanatical view* of different parties, and leaders, expressed. I am reminded of a conversation I once heard in Yorkshire between two gentlemen. One of them said, " If I had my way I should drown Gladstone," while the other said, " I would hang Disraeli as high as I could if I had my way." That was how the leaders of two distinct parties in the old country were regarded by two educated gentlemen. The speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> with its narrow provincialism, was not of a character to foster the Federal spirit. On the contrary, it could only serve to keep alive the provincialist feeling, and to emphasize the fact that one man is from New South Wales, and another is from Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- No; but I formed an opinion from the circumstances which were placed before me. I believe that much of the ill-feeling which has been generated in connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> is due to the fact that he is regarded as the most powerful factor in the political atmosphere of New South Wales. I believe that there is no man who will do so much as the Right Honorable G. H. Reid, to bring about the brotherhood of the people Of the States, as I believe that, if he is given the opportunity, he will show the people of the Commonwealth at large that he is not only a representative of New South Wales, but a representative of the Commonwealth, and will do his best to promote the happiness and welfare of the people. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to say a few words on the labour caucus1. The statement has been made here that the decision of the labour caucus is only binding so far as it refers to the programme which has been laid down, and that no question outside that programme can be dealt with by the caucus. I desire to give an illustration which I think is not in keeping with that statement. When the pastoral industry of New South Wales was in tha't condition that no one knew whether it was going to be relieved or to be ruined ; when a condition of affairs existed in that State such as has never occurred in any other State in the Commonwealth, it was felt by some gentlemen that the State or the Commonwealth Parliament ought to come to the relief of the brave, struggling settlers on the land. A deputation waited upon the Prime' Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> in Melbourne, and he gave us very strong sympathy. The deputation also waited upon the Premier of New South Wales, and we got strong sympathy there, too, but nothing else. It was then thought that we_ might be able to do something with the Labour Party, because it was known that many labour members deplored as much as we did the condition of the country. Some of these gentlemen were approached, and a meeting of the Labour Party was held. The caucus sate for over three hours, but the vote was against anything being done to assist the struggling settlers;. I know that many members came away from the meeting with heavy hearts. They felt that in some measure they ought to do all they could to relieve the pastoral industry. But in the State Parliament the members of the Labour Party would not move their fingers to assist any one to bring forward a motion, or to support a motion when it was brought forward, simply because those who were in favour of granting relief were dominated by the caucus vote. </para>

They came to an adverse decision, and not a single labour member ever did anything in the State. Parliament to bring about the granting of any relief. </para>

                        <para>- I am in favour of a good deal in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I am sorry to say, however, that I am gradually weakening in the opinions which I have held. If the measure as it stands would be a means of settling industrial disputes it would be a great factor in promoting the happiness and prosperity of the people of Australia. If I had that belief I should be courageous enough to do the utmost in my power to secure its passage. But in our treatment of the Bill we must be guided by practical experience. We must be guided by the knowledge we have gained from those countries which have had an experience of an Arbitration Act during the last few years. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGregor</inline> was, if not the pioneer, one of the pioneers, who, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reeves,</inline> brought the Arbitration Act of New Zealand into existence. </para>

Australia, and also by reason of the increase of the export trade to South Africa. Yon may by legislation retard a country's progress, but you can hardly kill it. I do not say that the arbitration laws of New Zealand have in any sense killed the prosperity of that country, or that they have retarded it, but the opinion of these gentlemen is to the effect that those laws 'have been an injury rather than otherwise to the progress of their country. </para>

                        Tillett, secretary of the London Dockers' Union, submitted an important resolution to the thirty-seventh annual Congress of Trades' Unions, now sitting at Leeds. He proposed the appointment of a Minister of Industry, and the establishment of an Advisory Board of Conciliation and Arbitration, with a provision- that it. should be optional for unions and employers to register under compulsory or voluntary ;arbitration sections.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tillett,</inline>
                        in the course of his speech quoted the satisfactory working of Arbitration Acts in New Zealand and in some of the Australian States. Much opposition was given to the arbitration portion of the resolution, mainly on the ground that it would be unwise on the part of the unions to make strikes impossible.

                        <para>- I believe, further, that arbitration laws are causing ten times more friction than occurred, and ten times the number of absolute difficulties than existed, in connexion with trade before such measures were passed. It may be said by some that that is a reason why Arbitration Courts should be brought into existence. But I contend that it shows that those who are interested, not only in trade unions, but in connexion with the Labour Party, generally find, in many instances, that it pays them well to do their best to bring about friction between employer and employÃ©. </para>

                        <para>- I speak as a business man, with some knowledge of 'the facts. I will give an illustration of what took place three months ago in connexion with a firm in which I am interested. This firm employs between forty-five and fifty coopers. A deputation waited upon the firm and asked whether the employers were aware that two of their coopers were nonunion men. We stated that we knew nothing about that, and that all we wanted to know was that these men did their duty properly. They had been working for the firm for fifteen months, and they had wives and children at home. They had been working in perfect harmony with the unionists during the whole time they had been there. But the members of the deputation gave it to be understood that i1 those two non-unionist men were not discharged, they would call out the othct coopers. The remarkable thing was thai these two men had applied over and over again to be admitted into the trade union, and were rejected. In the very same week the secretary wrote, asking the two unionists to call at his office, and they were at once admitted to the union. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> the late Prime Minister, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> the late Minister of "External Affairs, have both said that they are opposed to the action taken by that union. They have publicly stated that they would not approve of converting the unions into what I may call close boroughs. But I give this illustration to show that there was a case in which a union used its authority in order to endeavour to turn these two men. who had wives and children to provide for, into the streets, so far as they were concerned. </para>

                        <para>- No ; it does not. But the instance shows that these gentlemen hold positions which depend to some extent upon their getting up disputes here there, and everywhere. Much friction has been caused which would not have existed had not the Arbitration Court been in existence. The experience in New South Wales has been that the whole of the trading community is, I was going to say, absolutely disgusted with the verdicts that have been given by the Arbitration Court, and also at the frivolous manner in which the affairs of that Court have been conducted. I will not say more, because the Judicial Bench of Australia is worthy of respect. We are proud of it, and I believe that the President of the Court to which I have alluded is carrying, out his duties faithfully according to his views, although to many of us it is unaccountable how he arrives at the verdicts which he has given. When the Arbitration Bill comes before the Senate, I trust that it will be dealt with not in a party spirit, but in a spirit broad enough to allow us to resolve that it must not be made an element of danger in regard to the future prosperity and growth of Australia. I thank honorable senators for the patience with which they have listened to me, and wish to state, in conclusion, that, as long as I am a member of this Chamber, I shall try to deal with the subjects which are brought before us in a spirit which is not actuated only by the interests of party, but by the interests of the people of Australia as a whole. </para>

                    <para>- I do not intend to deal at great length with the questions that have been put before the Senate. But in listening to the Attorney-General's presentation of the policy of the Government yesterday, I could not help observing the vast contrast between his effort on that occasion and on previous occasions when I have had the pleasure of listening to him. I have no doubt that if he speaks in reply we shall hear something of a more brilliant character than that to which we listened yesterday. Perhaps the reason for his lack of vigour and of ardour was his want of sympathy with the position in which he finds himself, and with the work in hand. We cannot fail to recognise that the policy outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is very largely the policy that has been advocated for years and years by this very much maligned caucus party. Therefore, I have no particular fault to find with the policy outlined by the Government in a general sense. Nor do I intend to say anything in connexion with the personnel of the Ministry, except this : I certainly do agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> that of all the leaders of political thought in Australia to-day, the present Prime Minister is the least representative of the general will of the Australian people. On that account I agree that he has no right whatever to fill the position which he now occupies. But the policy of the Ministry is in very strong contrast with the platform utterances of both its leaders - because there are two of them - and of several of their more ardent followers during the past few weeks. We have read reports of meetings where the only real business has been an attempt to ridicule, and even wilfully to villify. the intentions and the general attitude of the party known in politics as the Labour Party. The policy of that party has been altogether misrepresented, and knowingly misrepresented by the persons who have been making those utterances. A member of the Senate has publicly stated that the battle of to-day is between Socialism and anti-Socialism. . I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> who made such a statement when addressing a meeting of ladies at St. Kilda. I give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> this credit - that he uttered one or two sentences with which every one of us will heartily agree. He pointed out that those who hitherto had control of the welfare of the nation, and who were engaged in the industrial life of the country had been largely responsible for the great growth of this socialistic thought, as he characterized it. </para>

                        <para>- I am not doing so. I am merely pointing out that we have an excellent ally in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> so long as he continues to place before the ladies and gentlemen of this country such plain truths, showing that the present day position has been arrived at simply as the result of the education of the people that has been borne in upon them by the facts with which they are daily . confronted. There is one reason why I must compliment the Government and their supporters. I have tried, as an honest man will try, to steer a straight course through life. I have also tried to follow, as far as it was profitable for me to do, the advice given by men whom I considered to be infinitely and eminently capable of giving advice. But when it comes to the political arena I have an aptitude, it may be a very slow one, to somewhat think for myself, and possibly my thoughts have occasionally led me astray. When I have been reading those brilliant free-trade speeches, which have been made by the present Attorney-General, and when I have listened to eloquent protectionist speeches made by gentlemen who now sit with him in the same cabinet, I have been strengthened in the conclusion at which I arrived years ago, that on boih sides they were on this one question almost faddists. I have always been led to believe that there was a ring of insincerity about the politicians - great statesmen as they may claim to be - when they stood on the platform and tried to gull the public as a whole, by preaching to them, as the primary cause of all evil, or the primary cause of all good, either one or other of the fiscal systems. </para>

                        <para>-- I think it is very good that the honorable and learned senator and his friend should have done what they have done. They have shown to the people of Australia that there has been insincerity in the whole of their advocacy - that freetrade was merely a useful bogey to trot before the people of this great nation. They have shown also that protectionists ideas do not embrace the primary question with which the mind of Australia ought <inline font-style="italic">\o</inline> be occupied - that both systems in themselves are secondary, and very secondary, indeed, to the well-being of the people. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad to hear that ; and in a few more years I am satisfied that several more lessons will be taken out of the same book. The honorable senator who interjected will become convinced that the Labour Party have never yet asked a legislative assembly in Australia to place on the statute-book any law that is not humane in its every instinct - that has not for its ultimate object the uplifting and the general welfare of the people. Ardent leaders of freetrade and' protectionists' movements hesitated not, when the Labour Party with their sunken fiscal policy came into the arena, to show how infantile were our notions, and how useless our aspirations, inasmuch as it was utterly impossible for any man to enter politics unless he made either freetrade or protection his battle cry in life. Those gentlemen, in an endeavour to show the impossibility of our position; hounded us from every platform, and now they have given the great object lesson to the people that, after all, the insincerity must be dropped, and a position adopted precisely similar to that of the Labour Party. </para>

                        <para>- First of all, we are a Labour Party, and whatever else we may be, is a secondary consideration. There has been a good deal of fairly reasonable banter in connexion with the political machine - that instrument by which we are brought together, and through which our deliberations are transmitted from one to another. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> when speaking, referred in a disparaging tone to our machine politics), and I interjected that he had endeavoured to enter public life by means of the influence of that very machine. It was then the disturbance arose, the honorable senator stating that what I had said was false. Probably, judging from his intentions from the beginning, it may have been false, but to me it certainly appeared very correct indeed, inasmuch as on the 9th November, 1893, I sat in the next chair to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> at a large conference, which lasted for two days, of representatives of labour leagues, who were perfecting this machinery for the purpose of making our political existence sure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was then a delegate of the Labour Party, and if my memory serves me right he represented the Carters' Union of Bourke, New South Wales. Those are the facts on which I base my impression, and if the honorable senator's own position was false, that, of course, is not my fault. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator can change his mind very accommodatingly sometimes. I am somewhat pleased that the Government have placed so early in their programme the further consideration of the Arbitration Bill. Notwithstanding some of the remarks which have been made, I sincerely hope that that Bill will not pass in anything like its present shape. I should not like us as a Senate to do anything that would appear a travesty on legislation, and in its present form this, Bill is utterly impotent, and very far from realising the anticipations of people who are to be guided and controlled by it. It would be better to put it at once into the waste-paper basket rather than pass it in its present shape. I hope with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> that the Bill will leave this chamber as perfect a measure as our intelligence can make it, so that we may effect the object we have in view, namely, the prevention of the unsettling of any industrial arrangements on which the whole of our people depend. We know how disastrous every disarrangement of our industries is, but there is no analogy between the position of the people of England and the people in Australia. We cannot reason from the position of the English people as to the position in industrial matters here. </para>

                        <para>- I am not talking about capital, but about the comparison there has been an endeavour to draw between the position of Australian workers and the position of English workers, and I say that the cases are by no means analogous. Since I was a boy of very tender years there has been a form of conciliation adopted almost right throughout England. For the last thirty years there has been conciliation of a voluntary nature, but under such conditions as have made it operate almost in a compulsory way. Employers and workmen in England have for all those years had their joint committees, at which they sit at the same table, and there is that feeling of sympathy which can be created at close quarters, but which can never be created at a distance of thousands of miles. </para>

                        <para>- My. argument shows that the positions in the two countries are not analogous. Private employers are gradually dying out of industrial operations in England, and all are coming under the influence and power of trusts and syndicates. The result is that, whereas twelve years ago scarcely a worker in England would breathe a word in favour of compulsory arbitration, representatives at a union conference representing nearly 500,000 people have just declared in its favour. </para>

                        <para>- But twelve years ago there were 100 to one against compulsory arbitration. What does the English worker say? He says, "What! make strikes impossible? No!" He does not want strikes to be made impossible. We, on the other hand, hold that strikes ought to be made impossible. We want to establish a system which will keep our industrial wheels moving in sympathy and harmony with the surrounding conditions. If .we desire to secure industrial peace it can be obtained by that method, and it will be infinitely more profitable to us in the end than even the fiscal peace which has been so mildly arranged by the old parties. I do not propose to make any other comment on the programme of the Government, except to express my pleasure that they intend to bring down a Bill to authorize a survey of' the Trans-Australian Railway to be made. I am sorry, however, that it occupies so low a position on their programme. I believe that they will not get a chance to pass the Bill, but if they do, it shall have my. ardent support. I am satisfied that, having taken the project in hand, the Government, unless a day comes when they may cease to exist- </para>
