        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline>(Tasmania).- In this Bill we provide a term of fourteen years during which a trade mark shall be registered, giving power to the holder&#39; to re-register. . In the case of most of the States this provision will work equitably, but in the case of New South Wales there is no limit whatever upon the term for which a trade mark now is and in the past has been registered. There are a number of trade marks which are registered in New South Wales, and which will consequently, under this provision, run out absolutely at the end of fourteen years. So that, if the clause, is passed as it stands, at the expiration of fourteen years from the passing of this measure the registration of those trade marks will cease. </para>

                    <para>- When the holders proceeded to register under this measure they might find that in some other State of the Commonwealth there were persons having claims to the same trade marks. They would not be in the position of persons asking . for re-registration, but for a new registration under a Commonwealth Act, and there might be one, two, or three States from which successful opposition to registration might be encountered. Is it not the intention of this Bill, as far as possible, to secure existing rights? In the . second paragraph of clause 5 we read - </para>

            <para class="block">Every trade &#39;mark that is registered in New South Wales under the law of that State is perpetual, but in clause 7 we provide that at the expiration of fourteen years, from the commencement of this measure, the registration of a trade mark under a State Trade Marks Act shall- cease. Those provisions are diametrically opposed to one another, so far as this measure applies to the State of New South Wales. There is, perhaps, no conflict with regard to the other States. Persons who have registered trade marks have a perpetual right in them according to the State law of New South Wales. But this Bill steps in and- says that at the expiration of fourteen years all trade marks registered under the State law shall cease. Our object being to preserve, as far as possible, existing and accrued rights under the trade marks legislation of the States, I should say that if we pass the clause as it stands there will in many instances . be a bar to registration at the end of fourteen years. There will be many persons who, when they apply to the Commonwealth office for the registration -of a trade mark, will find that their application is resisted by persons in, perhaps, Western - Australia, Queensland, or elsewhere.&#39; Is it &#39; the intention of the Government to absolutely deprive those who are .registered under the Trade Marks Act of New South Wales, at the end of fourteen years, of their right to use their trade marks? </para>

                        <para>- I do not think there is any great probability of difficulties arising, because, as soon as this measure becomes an Act, the great majority of those persons who have trade marks registered, and who are doing business in Australia, will register under the Commonwealth law. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will see that the rights possessed by persons who have registered trade marks in New South Wales apply only to New South Wales. I do not think that those rights would be of sufficient value to them to prevent them from registering under the Commonwealth law. I see no objection to the clause, because everything will be clone to protect existing rights. I feel sure that people who are interested will be perfectly satisfied. If persons in New South Wales, possessing- trade marks rights, attempt to register under the Commonwealth law, and1 are opposed by some one in Queensland or Western Australia, my opinion i?, that, when the machinery of this legislation is set in motion, we can trust the officers to see that justice is done. </para>

                    <para>- My opinion is that clause 7 is one of the most valuable provisions of the Bill. While it is quite true that in New South Wales, so far as the limits of that State are concerned, the proprietors of trade marks have perpetual rights, yet at the same time the very object, and design, of this Bill, as of all Federal legislation, is uniformity. It would be quite impossible to obtain uniformity did not this clause exist in its present shape. If any serious hardship were done, we should give attention to it, but practically I do not think that any hardship will accrue. First of all, the registered proprietors of trade marks in New South Wales will now have the advantage of registration throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

But in regard to the point immediately under notice, the objection is, I think, first of all met by clause 27, particularly if it is amended in the way I have suggested ; and secondly, if my honorable and learned friend thought it wise to insert in that portion of the Bill relating to renewals of trade marks a few words to the effect that special regard should be paid to registration under State Acts, such a provision might be useful. Personally, I do not consider it necessary, and I do not conceive that any injustice will arise under the clause in its present form. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline>(Tasmania).- The answer given to me by the Vice-President of the Executive Council has hardly covered the whole of the ground with which I dealt. Clause 5 refers only to the application of .the common law to our trade marks law in Australia. I am not sure that there are not analogous cases in Queensland, but under the New South Wales law there are trademarks in force in that State which were registered forty years ago, and the holders of which have never been, and would never be required to re-register. The position in other States has been that the term for which registration has been effective has been fourteen years, and if a man, at the expiration of that time, desires to re-register his trade mark, he is entitled to do so under certain conditions. The holder of a registered trade mark in New South Wales has rights in respect of that trade mark, which are perpetual ; but in this Bill it is provided that a trade mark registered under a State Act shall cease, at the expiration of fourteen years from the commencement of the operation of this law, or from its last registration or reregistration under the State law. It is in that way that I say we are not, in this Bill, conserving rights which have already accrued and are in existence. That that is not the object of this Bill is indicated by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of clause 6, under which it is provided that the State Act under which a trade mark is registered, shall -continue to apply to that trade mark, so long as the registration under that Act remains in force. All these registrations in New South Wales will remain in force, even though it should be forty years since the trade marks were registered. They would remain in force under the New South Wales law perpetually, because the rights acquired by registration under that law are perpetual. The only solution &#39;of the difficulty which has been suggested by the Vice-President of the Executive Council is that it will be competent for persons who desire to continue to hold the benefit derived from the registration of a trade mark to re-register under this Bill. What I desire to point out is that as the Bill stands at present, and unless some amendments are made later on, an applicant desirous of renewing his right may find that some essential part of his trade mark has, not in New South Wales, but in other parts of Australia, come to be publicly used by more than three persons, and under clause 23 that is to be treated as conclusive evidence that it is common to the trade. And though he has secured perpetual rights in New South Wales under the law there, his application for the registration of his trade mark in the Commonwealth under this Bill may be blocked on that account. Unless there is an understanding that some alteration of clauses 23 and 27 will be considered, this clause should not be allowed to pass without comment. If it were sought subsequently to amend those clauses, it might be said that the matter should have been raised on this clause. Having called attention to the question, I am satisfied that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will consider with his officers the advisability of modelling the Bill somewhat differently in order to meet the circumstances to which I have referred. </para>

                        <para>- I personally think, and the officers of the Commonwealth also think, that the Bill as it stands meets all the requirements of the people of Australia. There may be some difficulty with respect to New South Wales, but when I was referring to clause 5 I said that I thought the application of the common law provided for in that clause to secure existing rights, would protect those existing rights in all circumstances. I do not think that any difficulty will arise, such as the honorable and learned senator has suggested, but when we come to consider clause 23 I shall have no objection to an amendment requiring that a trade mark must have been used by three persons in one State before it can be considered common to the trade. I admit that there might be four users of a trade mark, one in each of four States, and in such a -case it would be a hardship upon the holder of a trade mark in New South Wales, if, on such grounds, it were decided, under clause 23, that the trade mark was common to the trade. If such an amendment as I have suggested is made, the risk which might be run by holders of registered trade marks in New South Wales will be avoided. I have no doubt that the Commonwealth officers, when drafting the measure, had the existing law in New South Wales, as well as in every other State, in view. </para>

                    <para>- When we were considering the definition clause, I moved an amendment upon the definition of &#34; The Registrar,&#34; but had to withdraw it, and I omitted to bring the question up again. I shall, therefore, have to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council later on to recommit the clause. I have risen now to ask whether there is not in this clause a departure in the language which is used in giving the Deputy-Registrar, provided for in the clause, certain powers &#34; subject to the control of the Registrar.&#34; Hitherto, in Acts which we have passed, we have given the Governor-General in Council, or the chief officer concerned, power to depute or assign to a deputy such of his powers as he might think fit. It occurs tome that that is a better way of dealing with the matter than to provide, as under this clause, for the appointment of a Deputy-Registrar, upon whom the powers of the Registrar are conferred &#34; subject to the control of the Registrar.&#34; The Deputy-Registrar may give some decision which the Registrar may hold to be slightly outside of his functions. He may think that the Deputy-Registrar has made a mistake, and he may then begin to exercise his control. When we have to deal with judicial functions, the word &#34;control&#34; is, in my opinion, a rather dangerous word -to use. I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether the language here used is not a new departure, and whether he thinks it would not be better to provide that the Governor-General in Council or the Registrar might assign to a deputy such of his powers as he thinks desirable. </para>

                        <para>- No; but I point out that we may take a short cut in dealing with the matter by substituting the word &#34; person &#34; for the words &#34; individual or firm &#34; in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> because a person, according to the Acts Interpretation Act, includes a corporation, and by the amendment made at my instance in this Bill &#34; person and applicant &#34; include a body corporate and firm. The ground, therefore, would be largely covered by such an amendment as I suggest. In this connexion I point out, however, that the substitution of the word &#34; person &#34; for &#34; individual or firm&#34; would still be a limitation, because we should not thus include any trade name or style. To some extent, a trade name or style may be included in the word &#34; firm,&#34; but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moulton,</inline> who is a great authority on the subject, evidently does not think so, because he uses not only the word &#34; firm,&#34; but also the words &#34; limited or other company or corporation, or his or their trading name or style.&#34; I shall have to draw attention to other (amendments necessary later in the clause, but in the meantime I suggest to the leader of the Senate that he should leave out the words &#34; individual or firm &#34; and substitute for them the word &#34; person.&#34; </para>

Personally I think it would be sufficient in this case to substitute the word &#34; person &#34; for the words &#34; individual or firm.&#34; The object of the officers who drafted this Bill was to make it as short and comprehensive as possible. I should like to hear the views of other honorable senators. I am willing to accept the amendment, because I think it would be an improvement. It will be noticed that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> applies only to something which has been printed, impressed, woven, or stamped on goods. </para>

Ought not the words &#34; printed, impressed, or woven &#34; in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> to be placed at the end of the clause in order to qualify other forms of trade marks ? As it stands now, it is only the name of an individual or firm which is qualified by those words. But surely it would be more correct to put the words at the end of the provision in order to make them qualify all classes of trade marks. </para>

                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GIVENS</inline>(Queensland). - I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that the words to which he refers are necessary in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> but not in the other paragraphs. There might be a similarity of names at any time, and the essential thing in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> is that the name shall be printed in a particular and distinctive manner. Suppose, for instance, that the words &#34; John Smith &#34; were to be registered as a trade mark. The trade mark would not consist in the name &#34; John Smith &#34; only, because if it did that would deprive other persons of that name of the right to use it. The registrable fact would be that the name is printed in a particular and distinctive manner. In the case of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> a written signature does not need to be printed, certainly not in a particular and distinctive manner, because the very signature provides the particular and distinctive manner. Again under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> there is no necessity to have a distinctive device or ticket printed in a particular and distinctive manner. If we provided that a distinctive device should be printed in a distinctive manner, and a firm selling the goods wished to advertise them in all parts of the world, that would prevent anybody from printing the device. What necessity is there to print an invented word in a distinctive manner? The fact that an invented word is registered would prevent any one else from using it, and the invented word becomes a distinctive trade mark. &#39;I submit that it is only in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> that it is necessary to use the words - printed, impressed, or woven in some particular and distinctive manner. </para>

If we omit those words, will the name be that of a place, or of a man, or of a body? Supposing that a man were to take the name of an article and brand &#34;table&#34; in a distinctive way, how far would another man be entitled to use that in connexion with his mark? How far would it be regarded as being a mark in which the person registering it had some right of user ? What we wish to secure under this clause is that the essential portion of the trade mark shall be as far as possible separated from the additional matter. I doubt whether a person could register a simple shield in respect of goods. There would have to be about the shield something else which might be additional matter. </para>

                        <para>- The simple branding of the lion on the shield creates a distinctive label. It is the association of added matter with a simple device which gives the trade mark its distinctiveness. Then you can separate easily and accurately the added matter from the essential portion which comes1 under this clause; but if the words &#34; of an individual or firm &#34; are omitted from paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> the term &#34; name&#34; is so extensive that it does not qualify it at all. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CLEMONS</inline>(Tasmania). - I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> quite grasps the full import of this clause. To my mind it presents a series of alternatives, and nothing else. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> and I are encouraged to omit the words &#34; of an individual or firm&#34; by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e.</inline> It has been contended that a mere name is not sufficient, and that there should be added to the name something to connect it with an individual or firm or corporation. If honorable senators will refer to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> they will see that a far wider scope is offered there in the registration of a trade mark. There is one limitation only. What it practically says is, &#34; In making your trade mark, and applying for its registration, you can use any word, but you must use a word if you use a name.&#34; Subject only to this limitation it does not refer to the character or quality of the goods, or have a geographical bearing. We can all recollect a hundred and one different words which are registered as trade marks, and which do not refer to the character or quality of the goods, and which have no geographical bearing. It is quite obvious that in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> what is essential is that a name shall be printed, impressed, or woven. If a person were to propose to register a trade mark an inquiry would be held to ascertain whether the trade mark came under any one of the limitations in this clause. If it happened to be a name printed, impressed, or woven in a particular and distinctive manner, it would be accepted at once, because it complied with paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> It has not to comply with all the limitations, but only with one. I see no reason for the omission of that paragraph. Why should we not facilitate the registration of trade marks ? I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that the essential part of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> is not a name, and an indication of an individual or firm, but the operation of printing, impressing, or weaving. I can conceive it quite possible that it might be absolutely necessary for a trade mark to be woven into or impressed- or printed on certain articles. We have the authority for this provision in the English Act. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator BEST</inline>(Victoria). - I shall be only too pleased to withdraw my amendment, for the purpose of enabling <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> to move his amendment, but I think the Committee would make a mistake if it yielded to his suggestion. It has been laid down that paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a, b, c, d,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> are to be read independently, and not conjunctively. That was the subject of a dispute for many years, but ultimately it was decided that they were to be read independently. Therefore, in dealing with this matter, we have to look at the object of the clause. It has been held in English legislation that in connexion with trade marks, a word or words having no reference to the quality or type of the goods can be used. It is, therefore, necessary that, in dealing with this amendment, we should make paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> apply to the name of an individual or of a corporation or firm. If we alter paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> in the manner suggested by my honorable and learned friend, it would be quite competent to register as a trade mark the name of an article itself - such as rice, boots, or any other commodity which it was proposed to sell. </para>

                        <para>- They must be read independently. It was said ,that <inline font-style="italic">Solio</inline> in reference to photographic paper, referred to the quality of that paper, and consequently it was held that that name could not be used. Ultimately it was held that it could be used, and the general principle was laid down, as a matter of fixed law, that these provisions were to be read independently, and not conjunctively. Even in British legislation, we have it laid down as a principle of trade marks law, that it is undesirable that any &#39; word or words should be used which have any bearing or reference to the quality or character of the goods. If that is a sound principle, as laid down in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e,</inline> it is unwise, under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> to enable the character and quality of the goods to be shown by a trade mark. As I have already pointed out, if the words &#34; person or corporation or trading concern &#34; are not inserted in the way I have suggested, it would be quite possible to register &#34;easy walking boots&#34; as a trade mark. </para>

                        <para>- I think we are losing sight of the real object of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> That object is distinct from the object of every other paragraph of this clause. I would suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> that we should leave out the word &#34; individual,&#34; and substitute the word &#34; person,&#34; leaving in the word &#34;firm.&#34; He will recognise that tha word &#34; person &#34; has a very wide meaning under the Acts Interpretation Act, and that it will fulfil the whole object of the paragraph. I will show the object of it. Suppose there are a number of persons carrying on business. They may be named William Jones, John Jones, and Andrew Jones. Or there may be two or three persons named John Jones carrying on business in a particular part of Australia. They may all wish to register their names as their trade marks. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> provides that the name of a person or firm can be registered if it is printed, impressed, or woven in some particular and distinctive manner upon the goods sold. If the name &#34; John Jones &#34; were to be registered without being impressed in a distinctive manner upon the goods, the name would not be a trade mark. In that case, there would be nothing to particularize John Jones, of Swanston-street, from John Jones, of Footscray. But the clause provides that any number of persons or firms can register their names or the name of a firm, rio matter if it is the name of any other person or firm, so long as it is printed, impressed, or woven in a distinctive manner upon the goods. That is the whole principle of &#39; the provision. The object is to make the matter so clear that the public will not confound Thomas Brown, of one place, with Thomas Brown, of another. It is a necessary provision in a Bill of this description. If we substitute the word &#34; person. &#34; for the word &#34;individual&#34; it will, I believe, include a firm. But we must retain the paragraph. The other paragraphs would have no effect without it. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that such an alteration is really necessary. The more definite we make our legislation, the less trouble there will be in administering it. The object of this paragraph is simply to enable an individual, or firm, to register his or their name - that is, the written name, or a copy of the written name. That is the distinctive feature of this paragraph. The essential particular in this instance, is the written signature of the individual or firm. With respect to the difficulty pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> - and I am sure members of the Committee are indebted to the honorable and learned senator for the trouble he is taking in connexion with this legislation - if a firm is trading under the title of Johnstone, Jones, and Co., those particular persons may have been dead a long time, and the firm may be in the hands of Young and Brown, who are carrying on the business in the name of Johnstone, Jones, and Co. They would, of course, have a perfect right under this paragraph to register the written signature of the firm of Johnstone, Jones, and Co.. or a copy of it. I think it would be far better to leave the paragraph as it is. The draftsman has, in this instance very much simplified the matter. I believe the paragraph carries out all that is required, and I hope honorable senators will pass it as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- In my amendment I have adopted the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moulton.</inline> because he is such a recognised authority. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has suggested the leaving out of the words &#34; individual or firm,&#34; with a view to substituting the word &#34; person.&#34; That would be an improvement upon the paragraph as it stands, but the objection f&#62; that lies in -the fact that what is required here is trie written signature or copy of the written signature of the person, and as &#34;person&#34; includes a corporation, and a corporation has no written signature, but a seal, the result might be to restrict the meaning of the word &#34; person &#34; to some extent. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> lias any objection to the wording of my &#34;amendment, I suggest another alteration of the paragraph, which would be very simple, and readily followed. It is that the word &#34; person &#34; be substituted for the words &#34; individual or firm,&#34; and that, after the word &#34; thereof,&#34; the words &#34; or his predecessor in business &#34; be inserted. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator BEST</inline>(Victoria). - I desire now to draw the attention of the Committee to a matter to which I referred very fully when speaking on the second reading of the Bill, and to submit a further amendment. The object is to preserve old trade marks that are not registered. In this connexion, I am following the principles laid, down in British legislation on the subject. I move - </para>

                <para class="block">A somewhat similar provision was inserted in British legislation on this subject, for the preservation of old trade marks which had been in existence, I was about to say, almost for centuries, but at all events for a great many years. The date fixed in the English statute was some day in the year 1875, and what was provided was that trade marks in existence prior to that were not to be prejudiced by the Act. I submit this amendment on the same lines, in order to preserve a number of our old trade marks, and there are hundreds of well-recognised brands and trade marks in use in Australia, that are not registered. Only in the last day of meeting of the Senate an honorable senator mentioned to me a case which had come under- his notice professionally, where a trade mark had been in existence for twenty or thirty years, and under the law of South Australia the actual proprietors of it were unable to register if, because some of the essential particulars required under the State law prevented that being done. I contend that if a man has, by his enterprise, given great value to a particular trade mark, and by the expenditure of money has increased the reputation of his goods upon the market, and those goods are known to the public as meritorious, he should continue to have the benefit of his trade mark, and should not be prejudiced by our legislation. I am not in this matter introducing any novel principle, but endeavouring to follow practically the terms of British legislation on the. subject. I may be asked why I fix the date as the 1 st day of January, 190 1. It is necessary to fix some date, and as the Commonwealth came into existence on the 1st January, 1901, that was the date from which our legislation must start- it certainly could &#39; not go behind that date. I therefore suggest that that is a very proper date to insert in this instance. I believe that the adoption of this amendment would but do justice to a number of enterprising men who are the proprietors of well-established trade marks. </para>

It is my desire that the rights of the owners in these trade marks should be preserved by this Bill. I am not wedded to the 1st day of January, 1901 ; I should be content if honorable senators decided to go ten years back; but I think that the1st day of January, 1901, would be a date consonant with the Commonwealth legislation. </para>

There are some marks, the essential particulars of which, not from the legal or statutory point of view, but from the commercial point of view, consist merely of letters used in combination. We hear, for instance of &#34; G.B.D.,&#34; &#34;C.B.B.,&#34; and other combinations of that kind applied to particular classes of goods. We know as a matter of fact that it is only by reason of the fact that they are used in &#39;association with some simple device, which may be a circle, a wreath, or an oval-shaped device, that they have been registered as trade marks. </para>

                        <para>- They are generally the initials of a firm, and they are used in association with some such device as I have mentioned. A difficulty is that it is competent for other persons to use these combinations of letters when separated from the particular device. There have been one or two instances in Australia where people have claimed to use particular combinations of letters, which, from the commercial, if not from the legal or statutory point of view, form the essential particulars of trade marks ; and persons who have gained credit for a particular brand of goods having a certain trade mark, have thereby been defrauded. I am disposed to believe that the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> will meet that difficulty, and probably the honorable and learned senator intended that it should.

                    <para>- I cannot see the necessity for striking out of a trade mark such words as are mentioned in this clause. If a thing is <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> registered as a trade mark, and anything on its face indicates that fact, that gives further assurance to the public. What the clause means is that in future it shall not be competent for a merchant to use the words &#39; &#39; trade mark,&#34; &#34; registered design,&#34; &#34;copyright,&#34; and &#34; entered at Stationers&#39; Hall,&#34; in a trade mark. I am quite aware that the trade mark regulations of Great Britain contain this particular provision, but so far I have not been able to discover why it should exist. I would suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that the words &#34;trade mark,&#34; &#34; registered,&#34; &#34; registered design,&#34; and &#34; copyright &#34; should be omitted. I can well understand a representation of the King or the Queen, or other members of the Royal Family being excluded. </para>

                    <para>- I . am informed that this clause embodies the practice in England. In the absence of the provision, it might be found that those who had not registered trade marks might have written or printed the words &#34; registered trade mark &#34; or the word &#34; registered.&#34; If they were to simply use the word &#34; registered &#34; it would not be a false description under the Fraudulent Marks Act, and no prosecution could take place. The object of the provision is to prevent the use of these words in unregistered trade marks. </para>

                    <para>- We are not exactly following those lines, because this clause is really taken from the regulations made under the British Act. Clause 70 of this Bill reserves to the Governor-General in Council the power to make regulations, and for many reasons it would be desirable to leave out this clause, and, if necessary, to deal with the subject by regulation. If it is dealt with in a special clause, it will be a limitation of the power contained in clause 70. It will be much better to leave the whole question to be dealt with by regulations. In these circumstances it will not do any harm if we omit the clause. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> will see his way to embody in the Bill, at a future stage, the regulations which have been in use for many years in Great Britain and the several States. These have been approved by user so long that he will make the measure more complete by including them in a schedule. There will be no difficulty in complying with my suggestion, because I learn that regulations have been prepared, I suppose, in anticipation of the Bill coming into operation at an early period. I have spoken to some business men on this subject, and they all say that it would facilitate operations to have the regulations embodied in the Act. I shall ask my honorable friend to allow me to move in that direction at a later stage, if he should not see his way to take that course. </para>

                    <para>- I am aware that regulations have been drafted to classify the goods to which trade marks shall be applied, but I am not so clear that the readiest way to transact business would be to bring down an immense schedule, containing nearly all the goods which are dealt with in the Commonwealth. When the regulations are laid upon the table in accordance with the Act, every honorable senator will have an opportunity to examine them, and to move for the amendment of any objectionable regulation. We are living in a progressive age, and we can never tell when a new article of food or clothing may be invented. It is much easier to deal with a case of that kind by regulation than by a special Bill. But out of deference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> I shall refer the matter to the officers concerned, and get an expression of opinion from those who have been responsible for the drafting of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>- The first alteration I desire to suggest in this clause is the insertion of the words &#34; in his or its discretion &#34; after the word &#34; may &#34; in subclause 1. That word is sometimes read as &#34; shall,&#34; and it would be a fatal thing in many instances were it read as &#34; shall.&#34; It will be noticed that if a trade mark contains a matter common to the trade it may be rejected from the registry, or that if it is the case of an application for a trade mark in these circumstances it may be rejected. That would be manifestly unfair, because hitherto a particular brand or trade mark, such as the Lion brand or trade mark, has been registered by six different proprietors in six different States. And under sub-clause 2 of this clause most serious hardships might be worked. The second suggestion I have to make is that after the word &#34; persons &#34; the words &#34;in any one State&#34; ought to be inserted. I understand that, the Vice-President of the Executive Council will agree to this amendment, and, therefore, I move - </para>

                    <para>- I desire to take the sense of the Committee with regard to these appeals. In my opinion, we have rather too many of them. In connexion with this clause, there is only one appeal from the Registrar to the Law Officer, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> desires that there should be a second appeal from the Law Officer to the Court. In respect of applications, which are opposed, the. Bill already provides for two appeals. I think we might well cut out one of these appeals. I ask whether it is constitutional or .right to have an appeal from the Registrar to the Law Officer. The Law Officer will&#39; be the Attorney-General, or the Solicitor-General, and I can scarcely conceive, of a case in which any legal question may be involved, where the Registrar will not seek the advice of the Law Officer. In the circumstances, the Attorney-General, having the administration of the law, will not desire to have anything to do with its judicial features. </para>

                        <para>- If the Registrar is in doubt in connexion with any application, he will no doubt seek the assistance and advice of the Law Officer before he gives his decision, and in such circumstances of what use is it to give the applicant an appeal to the Law Officer when he will already have had that officer&#39;s opinion in the decision given by the Registrar ? In such a case it might be necessary to give the applicant an appeal to the Court, but there should be no necessity for an appeal to the Law Officer. In many of these matters we do not permit an appeal at all. I understand that under the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill it is proposed that the award of one Judge, which may settle questions of momentous importance, and involving thousands of pounds, is to be final. Why there should be two appeals given in this case I am at a loss to understand. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator BEST</inline>(Victoria). - I quite realize that there is some force in the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator &#39;</inline> Dobson, but we are incorporating nothing new in these provisions.; As a matter of fact, in the experience of the States, it has proved to be very convenient to be able to go to the Law Officer, whose decisions have, as a rule, been very satisfactory. If the applicant is to be obliged to go to the Court, that will simply mean increasing the expense which he will have to incur. So far as the Attorney-General is concerned, when he knows that it may be , his duty to adjudicate on trade marks matters, he will be most careful not to advise, and consequently the Registrar could not go to him for- advice. </para>

                    <para>- With regard to the apprehension of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> that, in some cases, the Registrar may be cut off from the legal advice of the Law Officer of the Commonwealth, I point out that, in such&#34; a case, possibly what the honorable and learned senator desires would be given effect to, and there would be a direct appeal from the Registrar to the Court. If the Registrar consulted the Attorney-General as Law Officer- of the Commonwealth in a doubtful case, and he refused an application, and if the applicant desired to appeal against that refusal, it is not likely that the Attorney-General would agree to sit in a judicial capacity to review a decision for which he was himself responsible. Under clause 43, if both parlies consent, an appeal may be made direct from the Registrar to the Court. If we provide that, in the case of unopposed applications, an appeal may be made by both parties direct to the Court, I am satisfied that in every such case as is contemplated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> all parties having, as they would, a sense of decency would agree to a direct appeal to the Court. The Attorney-General would not care to review his own decision, and certainly the Registrar would not ask the appellant to go with him before the Law Officer, who had already advised him to refuse the application. If we were to re-insert the clause, we might rely upon it that in every case where the Law Officer had been consulted the appeal would be from the Registrar direct to the Court. </para>

But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> says that if the Law Officer were consulted, and had a hand in guiding the decision of the Registrar, he would, as a matter of course, refuse to take the appeal. I take it that if the Act entitled the applicant to appeal to the Law Officer the latter could not refuse to take the appeal, and he would not advise the Registrar in such a way as to make himself judicially and officially responsible for the advice given. On the contrary, they would have a friendly talk over the matter, the Law Officer would advise the Registrar, though not so fully and thoroughly as he would&#39; do when appealed to, and a decision would be given. An appeal would then lie to the Law Officer, and, as a matter of course, it would have to be accepted. I am inclined to think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is wrong, but still I contend that we are unnecessarily giving the right of appeal to the applicants. </para>

                        <para>- No; by going to the Attorney-General. The matter would have to be heard by that Law Officer in a judicial capacity. This provision is inserted in the Bill because in many of these instances the Law Officer , is quite competent to decide whether the Registrar had or had not made a mistake, and to decide the point more expeditiously and less expensively to the party concerned than could the Court. If we were to take away that right, and compel him to appeal to the Court, he would not feel inclined to go to all that expense and bother. If, in a knotty case, the Registrar did consult the Attorney-General or the Crown Solicitor, and, acting on his advice, refused the application, the good sense and decency of the Registrar and Law Officer, and the demand of- the applicant himself, would combine to cause any appeal from that decision to be made, not to the Law Officer, but to the Court, if provision be made that by consent the parties can go direct to the Court. But a large number of the unopposed applications will, I take it, be refused by the Registrar, acting on his own sense of what is right and wrong, without reference to the latter officer. It would be entirely wrong in these cases to require a man, in order to assert his rights, to go to the expense of resorting to the Court. We ought to give him a simple, cheap, and expeditious mode of getting the matter settled by a competent officer, who may be called upon to act judicially in a matter which is outside his own Department. </para>

If an injustice were done to an applicant, or an opponent of an application, by either the Registrar or the Law Officer, he could go to the Court. In my opinion, it would be time enough for him to go to the Court when . the injustice was done. It is very wise to afford the public an opportunity of exhausting every means of settling their difficulties before they appeal to the Court.

One can quite understand that where an application is opposed, both parties may consent to a certain appeal ; but when it is desired to appeal against the decision of the Registrar, why should the consent of the latter have to be obtained by the applicant ? Personally, I must say, I do not like the proposal. If -an applicant chooses to avail himself of the more skilled, capable, and experienced tribunal, he ought not to be required to get the consent of the Registrar. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill would be better without the proposed new clause. Even if such a provision were inserted, it ought to be as a sub-clause of clause 33, which should deal with the whole matter. The case contemplated is where there is an application for registration, and there is no opposition except by the Registrar. If the applicant is not satisfied, he has the option to go to the Law Officer, and if he be dissatisfied with the decision of both Registrar and Law Officer, he may go to the Court. I do not see any necessity to give either the Registrar or the applicant the option of going to Court, without any reference to the Law Officer. </para>

I therefore suggest that the term should be made three months, and likewise that the two months for which the time may be extended should be made three months. I think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has himself suggested the very best reasons why the time should be extended. My attention has been drawn to this matter by one or two gentlemen who have had very great experience in connexion with trade marks, and they assure me that the time allowed by the Bill is not sufficient. </para>

                    <para>- I draw attention to the drafting of this clause. The words &#34;the opposition has been decided in favour of the applicant &#34; are curious as a form of drafting. We often hear of objections being made to an application, and the objection is heard, and the objection is decided in favour of the applicant. In clause 40 it is provided that the Registrar shall fix a day for the hearing, and shall decide - whether the application is to be refused or whether it is to be granted. </para>

                        <para>- What I have already said earlier to-day will go to show that there is a necessity for an amendment. If the proprietor of a trade mark is to be limited to fourteen years from the date of the original registration for a renewal of the registration, obviously there will be many people in New South Wales - and I think some in Queensland - who will be unable to register trade marks. It is thirty-five or forty years since many of these people obtained registration, and the rights they obtained as the registered proprietor of trade marks are not to be regarded if this clause passes as it stands. It seems to me that there should be some provision to enable the proprietor of a trade mark registered in New South Wales with a perpetual right under the State law, instead of merely a right for fourteen years, to obtain re-registration as from some other date under this Bill. </para>

There should be some modification of this clause to meet such cases. I hope that even though the clause should be passed in its present form, the Vice-President of the Executive Council will consider an amendment to meet these special cases before we finally dispose of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>With reference to clause 68, page 13, the opinion of mercantile houses interested in trade marks is that the consecutive period should not be less than five years, instead of two years, as proposed. Changes of fashion, the failure of markets and the inability to procure the raw materials, also the endeavour on the part of a manufacturer to supersede an article bearing a certain trade mark by another of a different brand, reserving the right to go back to the original trade mark if thought desirable, and many other arguments may be adduced in favour of a lengthened period. i have my doubts whether the clause is necessary at all, because it is hardly likely that a manufacturer of standing would care to use a trade mark which had been employed for a similar article by another firm, but it might give an opportunity to unscrupulous people to avail themselves of the established reputation of a mark in the event of a temporary cessation of its use. </para>

                    <para>- I am quite willing that this amendment should be made, because in Australia circumstances might happen which would make it almost impossible for a man to do business with the article for which he had registered a trade mark. In South Australia, for instance, a dairy factory or company might register, a trade mark in connexion with butter. If a drought were to come for two or three years, it would be impossible to produce the article, and when prosperous times did return the company might find that somebody else had registered their trade mark. I think that three years is a very fair compromise, and therefore I &#39;accept the amendment. </para>

                <para class="block">This subject was introduced by myself on a former occasion in an attempt to alter the definition of &#34;applicant.&#34; It was then pointed out, however, that the proposal would necessitate the alteration of a number of clauses, and that any slight difference between this particular kind of trade mark- and others, might lead to some confusion. On the whole, it was thought better, if the object desired had to be attained, to propose a new part, containing the necessary clauses. The new clauses, the first of which I have moved, are intended to enable a tra&#39;de union to. register a label or a trade mark, to be used for the purpose of showing that goods have been produced under fair conditions. This is by no means new legislation, so far as other countries are concerned. Several of the State Parliaments in the United States have passed Acts of a similar character, though legislation of the kind is somewhat new in the British Empire. In Western Australia, however, in the case of the Bootmakers&#39; Union, the provisions of the State Trade Mark Act were availed of to register a label, which was lent out to employers who worked their factories under fair conditions, and who used it to mark their goods. It was thought by the union that they had power to prosecute any person who used the label without authority, but the matter was never tested in the Law Courts. I am told by some of the legal members of the Senate, that if a union did register such a label under the Western Australian Act, such registration would not stand the test of law. Whether that be so or not, I am not in a position to say ; but, at any rate, the same object is gained in the United States under separate laws providing for the registration of labels, brands, or marks used by labour organizations. I have here the Act passed in the 120th session of the New York Legislature in 1897, which practically carries out the intention of the clauses which I now submit to the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- No, it is not. The object of the label is to give the buyer an opportunity to know that the goods which he purchases are produced under fair conditions, and the trade unionist is concerned in seeing t&#38;at those conditions are observed. In Western Australia there were boot factories, which were largely non-union, but which, because they were worked under agreement drawn up between employers and employed, were allowed to use the label. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly; and in what other manner could the matter be dealt with? There&#39; must be some responsible body ; and there is nothing to prevent a small body of non-unionists forming a union. But the arbiters in that case would be the great body of the public. There are no means of compelling the general public to buy these goods, and if the employer finds that the great body of the public do not like the label he will not use it. The employer depends upon the great body of the public to buy his goods. </para>

                        <para>- They determine the wages and conditions in Melbourne, but not in the country districts. It might be an additional inducement to the general public to buy goods if they knew that they were made under fair conditions. Consequently, its use might be an advantage to the manufacturers. I admit that the great body of the public, who are the great body of the consumers, .are not trade unionists, but I believe that the great body of the public are desirous to purchase goods made under fair conditions, whether trade union conditions or any other. Hence the advantage to the public of using a trade union mark. In no case in Western Australia did the trade unions ever attempt to force the mark on any employer. Usually, the employers were glad to have an opportunity to use the mark to show the public that their goods were produced under fair conditions, as against goods which were produced under unfair conditions. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of a case where I know that some goods were necessarily produced under unfair conditions. An amicable arrangement was made between employers and employes, and all the goods produced under those conditions could be stamped with the trade union label. Some employers, however, did not adopt those conditions, and did not have the advantage of using the label. The label was an advantage both to employers and employes as well as to the general public, who were able to say when they purchased goods - &#34; Here is a mark which denotes that this boot was made under fair conditions.&#34; This legislation will enable those who are the best judges to have an opportunity of registering, and becoming the proprietors of a mark. </para>

                        <para>- They would naturally do so. Honorable senators are looking at this matter as if the labels would be used by the trade unions in a hostile spirit. Their object in using them would be to encourage employers to produce their goods under fair conditions. To say that they would endeavour to constitute a monopoly is not reasonable. Is it not the object of trade unions to have a majority of the employers conducting their factories under fair conditions? That being so, they would naturally concede the use of a label to every manufacturer who cared to apply for it. </para>

The label would be the property of the trade union tha,t registered it, and they would have a perfect right to refuse the use of it to those who did not observe the conditions under which the use of the label was given. </para>

                        <para>- It would not dictate any conditions to the employers, but would say, &#34; If you adopt such-and-such conditions we are willing to let you use our label as an indication to the public that you have adopted those conditions.&#34; After all that is a power which should belong to any union or any employer. If the label served as an encouragement to buy goods, it would be an encouragement to manufacturers to conduct their factories under fair conditions. If the use of a label served as a discouragement to buy, the employers would disregard it. I am aware that it may be said that I am bringing forward something which is new so far as English legislation is concerned. But, nevertheless, the proposal is not to be condemned simply because of its novelty. It may be said, perhaps, by some of the legal senators that we are stretching very widely the interpretation of a trade mark. The old idea of a trade mark has been very much attenuated by some of the decisions which I have seen in reading the literature of this subject. We find that goods which have passed through a number of hands are finally branded with a trade mark by a person who had nothing to do with their origin. Here are goods in the manufactured state. The present owner of them had nothing to do with their manufacture. Yet we find them bearing a trade mark designating the name of a person who had nothing to do with their origin. The man who puts his trade mark upon them is little more than an agent. He has not added a single penny to their value, nor has he added a single process to their manufacture. That shows that the argument that a trade mark must denote the origin of the goods has been very much attenuated by legal decisions. </para>

I admit that my proposal is somewhat different from the old idea of a trade mark. It is an extension of the principle. But I contend that it serves the same purpose, inasmuch as a trade union mark is a mark which indicates to the buyer of the goods something concerning their origin. </para>

If a union were to exercise its power in a tyrannical and suicidal manner, and made the majority of the factories hostile to it, only a minority of the goods sold would bear the union mark. That would be so much the worse for the union. Their object from a selfish point of view is not to induce the minority of the factories to use their mark, or to have a minority of the goods sold bearing that mark, but to get the majority of the employers to use it and the majority of the goods sold to bear it. </para>

                        <para>- It has everything to do with the provisions of this Bill. I have to say, in answer to the interjection made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> that the provisions do not confer a monopoly upon any person. They will give a right to the use of a trade mark, but they will give the same right to any other body of persons in the community. If non-unionists consider themselves aggrieved by these provisions it is open to them, by adopting similar machinery, to become possessed of a trade mark, which can be attached to all goods manufactured under their conditions. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; there is no limit to the number of unions in the same trade that may be registered Under the Trade Union Law, which is in existence in every State of the Commonwealth. It is, therefore, idle for honorable senators to say that the men to whom they have referred would have no redress. I notice that some of my honorable friends opposite are eager to seize these provisions as a red rag; but I trust that they will not allow any prejudice, which may exist in their minds, as the result of the last few years of press education on trade unionism, to influence their opinions upon this question; nor will they allow the fact that these provisions are not to be found in English law to determine their vote upon these clauses. </para>

                    <para>- I hope, before I sit down, to convince even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> that I have no desire to approach the discussion of this new clause in that spirit of antagonism which is supposed to mark the bull at the appearance of a red rag. I desire to point out what appears to me to be an extremely . serious defect in the proposal submitted to/ the Committee. The honorable senator! has affirmed, and the clause indicates it, that the object of this proposal is to enable/ trade unions to register for themselves! a trade mark, and, having registered it tb permit employers who employ union labour to use it. The honorable senator referred to those who employ labour under* fair conditions, and I asked him, by interjection once or twice, who was to be, the&#39; judge of fair conditions. His reply was that the union which was the proprietor of the trade mark would be the judge. I am not now speaking against the general principle of these clauses, but I desire to point out a possible condition of affairs which I think would constitute a very gross injustice to probably a very large number of employers. Let me submit to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> a case in which, acting under a common rule, approved by the Arbitration Court of New South Wales, an employer was employing union labour under conditions which the Arbitration Court had said wert fair. Some little dispute arises between the men and their employer, in connexion with some minor matter, outside the award of the Arbitration Court, and they take the dispute before their union. The result is that the union says to the employer, &#34; Although you are employing union labour, we shall not allow you to use our trade mark.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The inducement might be to force an employer to make some concession other than that required by the Arbitration Court. The honorable senator has frequently referred to the fact that it might be an advantage to an employer to be able to satisfy the purchasers of his goods that they were made by trade union labour. I admit that there is a great deal in that contention, but it is just because of that advantage that the trade union proprietor of the trade mark would be able to exercise a process of leverage on the employer. \ If the honorable senator ^ would provide that any employer or manufacturer who employs union labour shall be entitled to use the trade union trade mark, my objection to the clauses would be very largely minimized. If his sole object is to have goods manufactured by union labour so branded, I am unable to see how the honorable senator can object to the. suggestion I now make, that all employers :r manufacturing goods by union labour shall rjL.be entitled to use the trade union mark. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> - I could not conceive of a union refusing so reasonable a request. </para>

                        <para>- I remind honorable senators that what we are dealing with now is not the practice which may spring up under the law, but the shaping of the law itself, and the practice to be developed will be in accordance with the way in which we shape the law. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says that he cannot conceive of a trade union refusing to any one employing trade union labour the right to use the union trade mark; but I still submit that a case may arise in which an employer, employing only union labour, might be refused the use of the union trade mark, because of some conflict on minor matters between himself and the unionists in his employ. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce;</inline> when asked who is to judge whether the conditions of labour are fair, in order that a trade union may decide whether the use of its trade mark is to be permitted to a certain employer, tells us that it is the very men who are concerned who must be the judges in their own case. If the} honorable senator would agree that any employer working in the Commonwealth with union labour, should have the right to the union trade mark, my objection to his proposal would largely disappear. But I cannot give a vote in | support of a proposal which appears to me to place in the hands of a trade union a power beyond anything ever attempted by any Arbitration Court, or any arbitration law, of which we have had any knowledge yet.

                        <para>- I take the cases with which I am dealing under the Arbitration law in New South Wales, and I say that I can mention many instances where men are employing trade unionists, and in all fairness they should be entitled to the use of the union trade mark. Does the honorable senator propose to take from those employers of? trades unionists the right to stamp on their goods the fact that they were made by trade unionists?If his object is merely to provide that goods made by trade unionists shall be so marked, there can be little objection to the proposal. But if he intends to leave it to certain people to say that certain goods made by trade unionists may be stamped with the union trade mark, whilst other goods also made bv trade unionists shall not be so marked, I must say that I am entirely opposed to his proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I understood the honorable senator to admit that ; if he did not, I withdraw what I have said; but I am under the impression that his admission went nearly to that extent.- I think that the honorable senator has himself shown that this is a State matter, and&#39; not a Commonwealth matter. We know there have been motions submitted in another place, by which it has been sought to have the industrial life of Australia brought under Commonwealth law, instead of the workmen of each State being subject to their own local laws. That has not yet been accomplished. This is, to my mind, a purely trade union and industrial matter, and has no connexion whatever with the question of trade marks. If the honorable senator will look at the last two lines of the last new clause he proposes, he will find that he absolutely prevents these trade union marks from being trade marks at all. One of the essential qualifications of a trade mark is that it is property which can be assigned, and dealt with, and which passes with the good-will. In the last new clause which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> proposes, he provides that - </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. An ordinary trade mark has a common law meaning and common law rights attached to it, and rights in every State of the Commonwealth. It has a distinctive meaning. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said thai what he wants is a trade union label to be attached to goods made under what he considers to be fair conditions, but we could not call a label of that sort a trade union trade mark. Supposing that one bootmaker had his window filled with boots bearing the label, &#34;These goods are made under fair conditions,&#34; and that the bootmaker in the next shop had his window filled with boots bearing no label, and supposing that the boots in each shop were offered at exactly the same price. On Saturday night the wives of working men would naturally go to-the shop in which the boots were labelled as I have described. I think it would be grossly unfair to give these labels a kind of legal sanction, and to imagine that other unions who made similar goods under fair conditions had not a right to label, them with those words. I cannot vote for these clauses, and the clause before the Committee will not become law with my consent. Let the wording of these labels be confined to the fact that the goods were made under trade union conditions, or under arbitration conditions, or under the award of an Arbitration Court. But it is not proper to give to any section an exclusive right to the use of the expression &#34; fair conditions.&#34; </para>

Apparently, what is sought is that trade unions, which are held by many, persons to be institutions of very great advantage to the public weal, should have the power to indicate, and give the right to traders to indicate, that certain goods were made under the conditions they prescribed. </para>

                        <para>- That is different from the point which was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> and which I aim dealing with. I take it that if the case assumed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> could arise no injustice would be done, because the device could only have a moral value. It could have no positive value unless what was behind it impressed itself on the minds of intending purchasers. That is the great point to be considered. If we assume, for argument&#39;s sake, that a trade union would damage the value of its mark by doing the extremely illogical thing which the honorable senator .indicates is possible-- </para>

Therefore, no injury would be done in that case, except to the unfortunate person who had bought the right to use the mark. </para>

                        <para>- I confess, at once, that the awards of Arbitration1 Courts are not covered by the provision, and I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> when he says that trade unions in this State would think the registration of a mark unnecessary. I think it is quite likely that they would. There might be in connexion with trade unions some conditions which the public would approve, but which had not yet received the sanction of the Legislature, and therefore a trade union mark might be of great advantage to a trade union, and to those who desired to purchase the products of trade unionists. I prefer to keep out of the discussion of the question of fair or unfair conditions. Of course, we started properly with the assumption that trade unions are organized for the purpose of obtaining fair conditions for their members. And it is a reasonable assumption that goods which are made under the rules prescribed by trade unions are more likely to be made under fair conditions than goods not so made - at any rate, fair to the trade unions. Of course, I know it is arguable . that trade unions may prescribe conditions that are unfavorable to the employer. But that is a question in connexion with the trade mark which rests entirely with the public. For the purpose of securing custom, trade marks are affixed to goods having specific qualities preferred by the public. I think that a very large majority of the people in the Commonwealth prefer trade union conditions, and would like to see them generally observed. There are many reasons why persons who approve most heartily of trade unions are not trade unionists. There are many avocations in which the difficulties of organizing are so great that persons who approve of . trade unions, and would, if they could, be members of trade unions, find that they cannot be trade unionists, but would be very glad to know&#39; how they could purchase goods which were marked as having been made by trade unionists, and thereby <inline font-style="italic">ba</inline> assured that, in connexion with their production, conditions were observed of which they approved. I cannot see how any injury could be done to any person by allowing A, B, or C, to register a device, and say, &#34; These are the goods that we make.&#34; I can see at once an objection to allowing them to say, &#34;These goods are made under fair conditions,&#34; and so deprive others of the right to publish that statement. That I admit at once might be a verv serious injustice, but it could be no injustice to any one to allow A, B, or C to say, &#34; These are the goods which we make.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- That is a bare possibility, and I do not like to strain an argument. It is highly improbable that a trade union would so act - to me so improbable as to be impossible; but if it did so act, the person injured thereby would at once take the opportunity of advertising the fact in such a way as to turn it to his account. It would be so suicidal an act on the part of the trade union that I, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> cannot conceive that it would be done. I see a difficulty in compelling a trade union to grant the right to employers employing union men. I see the possibility of a man employing ten union men and ten non-union men. In that case the employer could conscientiously say that he employed union men. But what this mark is intended to indicate is that the goods are made entirely under trade union conditions, and, therefore, a man who employed union men to half the extent of his establishment - : - </para>

                        <para>- That is unimportant for the present. Supposing, for argument sake, that there was a very strong desire in the public mind for the goods which were produced by red-haired men, and that the latter desired to register a trade mark. There might be black-haired men who were producing a splendid article and paying the same rate of wages. It seems to me that there would be no injustice done to anybody by providing the means by which the public could be assured of the fulfilment of that desire. Therefore, I shall support the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I should be glad, of course, if any practical guarantee against even the shadow of injustice could be afforded ; at any rate, I feel quite sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> does not desire to do any injustice. It is generally known that this legislation does not prevail in other parts of the world to any great extent, for the reason that trade unionists in the past have had very little voice in the making of the laws. Class legislation, which is now complained of, but does not exist, did exist in the past to a great extent. The term &#34; governing class&#34; had a distinct meaning ; and in many parts of the world, it has a distinct meaning still, namely, that the government is exercised by a very small minority, who control the whole of the people. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable and learned senator desires, I shall refer to present circumstances. What I say is that in the past the term &#34; governing class &#34; had a distinct meaning in the mother country, but as the governing class became extended, legislation was controlled by larger numbers of people, until, as in Australia, the whole people came to govern, greater security was afforded. In countries where such legislation does prevail, the franchise is extremely broad, and, as in Australia, the whole people govern instead of the few. I feel that no injustice is likely to rise out of these clauses. In view of legislation we have already achieved, to a considerable extent, .and which we are achieving from day to day, I question whether the same necessity exists for such provisions as has existed in the past. They can, however, do no harm, and in many instances will do good. At any rate, people will be afforded the opportunity to give expression to their views on this question in the course of their daily trade. We may adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> proposals, feeling sure that, wherever a union is so unwise as to adopt the course suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> the injury, instead of happening to the individual, will happen to the organization, probably with advantage to the individual. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> always appears to find us in a hurry when he desires us to fall in with his wishes. There is a fair and reasonable way of doing business which is generally followed by Governments. To pass from one Committee to another when there is no urgency, but with a possible object in view, is not a proceeding which commends itself to me. So far as the amendment is concerned, I want to very briefly state my position. I quite recognise &#39; that, in my opinions on this question, I am in a hopeless minority in the Senate ; and that being so, I have no intention of wearying honorable senators bv reiterating the objections which I feel to locating the Capital in the Monaro district. At the same time, I wish once more to place on record my opinion - of course I am in a minority, and must bow to the majority - that a serious mistake is being made - serious, not only as regards the interests of my own State, but also as regards the interests of the Commonwealth. A large portion of the session of the Federal Parliament must be during the winter months, owing to the date on which the Senatorial elections take place, and for that reason I think we are making a serious mistake when we place the Federal Capital at an elevation of 2,500 feet in one of the coldest districts of New South Wales. </para>

I believe that in the interests of Parliament itself, and of the members of the Parliament - in the interests of the satisfactory conduct of business - we are making a great mistake. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to place once more on record my opinion that the best proposed site was Tumut. That site is approached by railway communication, and is half-way between Melbourne and Sydney, while it possesses a climate which would, at all events, suit our friends from north of the tropic of. Capricorn. Dalgety will be very cold in winter, and I find Melbourne quite cold enough for me. It is enough to freeze one&#39;s blood to think of spending the winter months in a place swept by cold westerly&#39; winds from the snowcapped mountains. Although I lived in Scotland in my youth, I spent twenty-five years in Queensland, so that I can well appreciate the difference between the climate of one site and another. However that may be, this Government will, I think, have the honour of settling this question, provided they are reasonable, and do not ask New South Wales for an area of anything like 900 square miles. Dalgety is admitted to have the best water supply amongst the sites proposed, and that is a great advantage. But, unfortunately, judging by the appearance of the country, it will be a long time before there are any decent-sized trees there. There are certainly some magnificent granite boulders, but, I fear, rather poor soil. I hope that we shall not ultimately regret the selection we may make. I give my adherence to Dalgety as probably the second best site, but I do not depart from my preference for Tumut. </para>

                        <para>- I was present, and know what we decided. I will put it in another way. I am aware that certain honorable senators think that the Capital site should have access to the sea. I suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> agrees with me with regard to that. I am also aware that certain honorable senators voted in favour of a site in the Monaro district, because they considered that it gave us access to the sea. The selection originally made by the Senate has been considerably changed ; and while the Vice-President of the Executive Council is apparently inducing honorable senators to believe that the site selected will have access to a port, and that the decision of the Senate in that respect is not. in any way interfered with by the amendments which have been sent up from the other House, I say that the position is considerably changed. I shall probably be told to look at clause 3, and that I shall find it stated there that the territory to be granted should contain not less than 900 square miles, and have access to the sea. I believe that some honorable senators are sufficiently gullible to imagine that the Bill, as it stands, gives us that right. But I say without the slightest hesitation that it does not. If we have a sufficiently large area to include Eden, of course, we have the same access to the sea that we originally desired. But the words which have been inserted in clause 3 do not give us what we desire. </para>

                        <para>- If we have a sufficiently large area to carry the Federal territory down to Twofold Bay, we shall have access to the sea. But the clause, as it stands, does not give us that access. Personally, I am not very much concerned with that aspect of the question, and am not going to quarrel with the House of Representatives. But I think it is a perfectly fair thing to point out what the meaning of the Bill is. The words which have been added to clause 3 are not worth anything at all, and if any honorable senators desire to insist upon the point of accessibility to the sea, they should not accept the third amendment. </para>

                        <para>- The matter is put in this form, because the Federal Government have no absolute power to compel New South Wales to concede any territory. It is only an expression of opinion, and as such it is an extraordinary thing to appear in an Act of Parliament. But the circumstances are unprecedented. The only justification 1 can find for it is that the Bill itself is absolutely unprecedented. We have no possible parallel to it in the whole history of legislation. We are practically creating a new precedent, and I suppose that is a justification for the insertion of words which do not ordinarily appear in an Act of Parliament. I do not wish to deal with the question at any greater length, but if I have created any doubts in the minds of honorable senators, I can only say that while I am prepared to support the Bill, and while I am glad to see that the whole question is now practically settled, at the same time I think it is somewhat unfair to some honorable senators who are not present, and who have had no opportunity of knowing that a final decision upon the question is to be arrived at in the Senate to-night, that the Bill should be taken at this hour. I think it is a mistake, under these circumstances, that the Vice-President of the Executive Council should have projected this measure into the Senate at this time. So far as I am personally concerned, however, I have no objection to what. is being done. </para>

                        <para>- If that point is clear, I have no objection to make. I trust that the Committee will unanimously agree to the amendments which have been made by another place, because, as has been pointed out, the territory which has been chosen by the House of Representatives includes the territory which the Senate favoured. As the House of Representatives are practically agreeing with us, and have simply fixed the site more definitely, there is no reason why we should not agree with them. We have been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that the choice is a very unwise one. Considering that we have been dealing with the matter for nearly four years, and have had an enormous amount of information concerning the different sites, I do not see how we could arrive at any wiser decision if the selection were delayed. I place no reliance upon the evidence of interested people. I place little reliance upon the objections of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker.</inline> In some cases, in order to defeat legislation to which he is opposed, he points out that one-half of the Commonwealth is unfit for habitation by white people, owing to the climate being too hot. On this occasion, with the object of defeating another provision to which he is opposed, he tells us that the place which has been selected is too cold for white people. But the race -from -which we have sprung is not a tropical race by any means. There are several honorable senators who come from the northern portion of the British Empire - from the mountainous districts of Scotland. Those who come from the colder regions are amongst the healthiest and most vigorous people we have amongst us. It may be that it will prove to be an advantage to the Commonwealth to fix the Capital site in a part of Australia where we shall be able to rear a hardy and vigorous race. </para>

                        <para>- Probably we shall be able to rear a race of people who will go about with bare knees, looking exceedingly picturesque. I think that Dalgety is about as good a place as could have been chosen. I have seen all the sites which are favoured by considerable numbers of honorable senators, with the exception of Tooma. Bombala has some advantages over Dalgety, but at the same time Dalgety has very considerable advantages which Bombala does not possess, notably, in respect of the magnificent water supply, which is sufficient for a very large population, and at the same time gives us an opportunity of generating almost unlimited electric power of the very cheapest kind, by the utilization of the powerful streams of water which flow in the vicinity. Therefore, I shall vote with the very greatest pleasure for the final selection of Dalgety, as the site for the Federal Capital, and I hope that the time is not far distant when the Senate will be sitting there and enjoying the benefits which will accrue to us from the magnificent climate of that district. </para>

                    <para>- I must extend my sympathy to my New South Wales friends in their sorrow at seeing this measure rushed through in <inline font-style="italic">thi</inline> manner now proposed. After the many protests which the New South Wales senator. have entered against the slow manner in which the Government have dealt with the selection of the Capital site, they must have undergone a considerable transformation, since to-day we find them joining <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> in protesting against undue haste. Considering that they have never been pleased at the speed which has hitherto been manifested in dealing with this question, and that they are now protesting against haste, we must arrive at the conclusion that this Bill has been responsible for a most remarkable change in their minds. With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons&#39;</inline> protest against the adoption of the amendments of the House of Representatives, I would point out to him that practically what has happened is that the other House has come into line with the Senate. We have always been in favour of the selection of a site in the Monaro district,, with, a port. In the last Parliament the Senate declared itself almost unanimously in favour of the Monaro district. At the elections a large majority of honorable senators who favoured that district were returned, proving conclusively that the people of Australia are in favour of fixing the site there. It is also a fact- that the majority of the Senate was of opinion that Dalgety was the best site in the Monaro locality. Therefore, the House of Representatives has practically come round to our view. I claim this Bill as the product of the Senate. </para>

Perhaps if we were dealing with an Act of Parliament, which should be interpreted entirely upon its verbiage, the honorable and learned senator would be right. But it happens that we are dealing with a measure which is properly an expression of opinion in connexion with the matters with which it is concerned. The only affirmation in it that is positive is, that the Federal Capital site must be within a certain area. The amount of land that is to be acquired is a matter for negotiation. </para>

                        <para>- If it were narrow enough it would take us there and bring us back again. The honorable and learned senator has said that the expression &#34; and have access to the sea &#39; &#39; means nothing, but I say that, in view of the fact that this Bill will be considered, together with the discussion that took place in passing it, it is largely an expression of opinion for the purpose of future negotiations between two independent Parliaments. There is not the slightest doubt that these words &#34;access to the sea,&#34; will be interpreted not as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has suggested, to mean that we should have access to the sea over some one else&#39;s territory, but that we should have access to the sea through Federal territory. Therefore, for all practical purposes, that clause is as definite as it need be. It is as definite as it could be made for practical purposes. Clearly, the object of Parliament in saying that we should have access to the sea is, that we shall have that access through Federal territory the whole way. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly ; and for that purpose it is sufficiently definite. But I do not desire that it should go forth that it was not clearly indicated that the access to the sea should be all the way. through Federal territory. If that impression were to go forth it might then be argued in the negotiations that the Federal Parliament recognised that the expression did not mean anything more than that there should be some route by which we could get to the sea, and not necessarily through Federal territory. </para>

                        <para>- Great minds often run together. I regret the amendment which practically shuts out Bombala, because I think it would have been better to have retained the widest possible range of choice within the area we had described. My own view is that Dalgety is the better site, but I am still sorry that the amendment to which I refer has been made. However, I do not think it of vital importance, or that we should lose the Bill because of it. It is, however, of very great importance that we should settle this question, and .that a perplexing, vexing, and disuniting bone of contention should be removed. I feel now that there will be a more rapid .approach to the proper Federal spirit that should exist, and does very largely exist, and which I believe will in the near future be complete and entire. In my opinion, this question while hung up had more influence than any other I can think of in keeping apart in sentiment and mind at least two, and possibly more, of the States of Australia. When this Bill is passed we shall not necessarily proceed immediately to this place, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has said is too cold for white men. but a cause of dissension will have been removed, and we shall be able to settle down to the consideration of the next question which presents itself to us - the question of ways and means. We cannot erect the Federal Capital without funds. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite likely ; but a year or two, or three or four years, are nothing in the life and history of a Commonwealth such as ours! I think, however, that it is of importance that the question of the location of the Capital should be settled, in view of the fact that such a strong feeling has existed in the minds of many persons on the question. Though we are in splendid temper this evening, I could not but deprecate the slightly sneering, or perhaps I should say the bantering tone of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> when he got up to congratulate the representatives of New South Wales. I think that we should, so far as possible, forget that we represent New South Wales, Victoria, or any other State, and should always feel that we represent Australia. The removal of this question will probably do more than anything else to bring about that very desirable feeling amongst honorable senators. </para>

If we are going to treat the transcontinental railway in the way in which we have treated this question, honorable -senators from Western Australia will only have to sing loud enough to secure the construction of that line. They will tell us it is necessary in order to maintain the Federal and national feeling which should follow the adoption of the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- I do, but. it is not going to be brought about by honorable senators on one side clamouring for something as if they ought to get it at once, and the rest of us, like a parcel of children, giving in to the clamour. I do not propose to decide any question in such a way. I have yet to be shown that the choice of a Capital site, at which half the members of the Committee are sneering, will allay the feeling which is said to exist in New South Wales. I have yet to see whether the pledge, if it was a pledge, made by the Prime Minister is to be carried out. That honorable gentleman said that any one who would advocate the building &#34;of the Federal Capital at an early date would be guilty of the grossest extravagance. I remind honorable senators that in the opinion of the Prime Minister the Federal Capital will not be built for twenty years to come. </para>

                        <para>- I have yet to learn that the indecent haste with which we are now proceeding with this matter will allay any feeling whatever, or bring about any broader or more Federal spirit. I do not agree that Ministers are to be congratulated upon the undue haste with which they have asked us to deal with this matter. We have on three occasions busied ourselves with the Trade Marks Bill, and have three times considered the clauses submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and now when we have got them well into our heads the debate upon them has been adjourned, and we have been asked to consider the question of the Capital site. Many honorable senators who have taken a great interest in the settlement of this question are not present, and there is not one absent who could have had the slightest idea that this matter would come on for discussion this evening. Ministers have no right to ask us to enter upon the consideration of this question at this time of the night. I have an amendment to propose, but before I move it I should like to say that I recognise that a large majority of honorable senators will probably be against me. Personally, I should be glad if the Committee did not consent to the amendments made in the Bill in another place. Honorable members in another place have restricted our choice to a site within seventeen miles of Dalgety. It is possible that Dalgety is preferable to Bombala, but by adopting the amendment of another place we shall be restricting our choice and restricting the choice of the experts who, with their instruments and levels, will have to decide on the best place for the Capital. If the words of the clause as passed by the Senate, &#34;within fifty miles of Bombala,&#34; take in Dalgety, and the port of Eden. I should prefer that those words should be retained. I can see no reason why we should be. asked to accept the amendment, except that it is thought we should deal with this matter with undue haste, or that possibly Ministers are expecting an early political death, and they desire to have the credit of passing this Bill. </para>

They are entitled to much credit on many points, but they are not entitled to credit for postponing the consideration of the Trade Marks Bill in order that we might proceed to consider this Bill. The point referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has not been quite disposed of by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> I am inclined to believe that if the High Court had to construe the words referred to, it would possibly give them the interpretation which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has indicated. But why should there be any doubt on the subject? It is a matter of very great importance, because I do not hesitate to say that Southern Monaro or Dalgety was chosen by the Senate and by the House of Representatives simply because it was felt that a selection in that district would give us access to a port. Surely it is a right thing for us to see that . we get that access. But I am not quite certain that we shall get it. The words used are - </para>

                        <para>- My suggestion is that we should disagree with the amendment of the other House, because the clause, as it left the Senate, would give a wider choice to the experts. I would ask honorable senators to consider how we have wobbled about in. this matter, how on every occasion we have started before we were ready, and how at the last moment a site has come to the front which many of us have never seen and none of us had heard of until the last few weeks. Tooma secured almost as many votes as Lyndhurst. Let it be borne in mind that when a number of us travelled by coach and visited Dalgety not one of us saw with the skilled eye of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest that it was a good site, or dreamed a few months ago that it was preferable to Bombala. We did not take sufficiently into account the question of water supply - the potentialities of the Snowy River which runs through the territory. We did not attach sufficient importance to the enormous electric power which could be generated by means of that water. We have made all these mistakes by proceeding with undue haste, and without that expert evidence which is necessary. We have now chosen the site, although one expert, who was expressly sent&#34; to make an official report, told us that we ought not to choose Southern Monaro without making a more thorough and exhaustive inquiry into the climate. At Bombala I was told by at least a dozen persons that in a severe winter the snow lies on the ground -for three or four days together, and that when the winter is not severe it lies on the ground for about six hours. But I was pleased with Southern Monaro. At the same time, our experts tell us that we ought not to make a choice until we have made further inquiries. </para>

If we wish to give an expression of opinion to our Government the proper way for each House to proceed is by resolution. In that way we could ha&#39;ve given the Government some definite expressions of opinion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson.</inline> - Does the honorable senator object to the Government negotiating with New South Wales? </para>

                        <para>- I object to loading the Bill with a mere expression of opinion. I do not think it will reflect on our legislative wisdom if we make a mere expression of opinion the subject of an enactment. While I strongly support the selection of a site, and believe that practically the best site has been selected by- the Houses, I do not consider that by assenting to these amendments I am necessarily committing myself to any large expenditure. I think that we should be acting directly in opposition to the wishes of the people of Tasmania generally, and of all sensible people throughout the Commonwealth, if we were to indulge immediately in any very large expenditure. It is a consolation to me to know that the disposition of this Parliament is not to borrow. I recognise that if the money has to be provided out of the annual revenue we shall proceed cautiously enough. </para>

                        <para>- The members of the present Government resisted the use of that word, as I did. It was decided by the Senate, to send the Bill down to the other House, with the word &#34; shall &#34; in this clause, trusting, however, to the good sense of the Government of New South Wales, to recognise that there was no attempt on the part of this Parliament to coerce that State, or to usurp any legislative rights, but that it merely wished to adhere to a legislative word, which should be used in such circumstances. Last night another place was asked to again exhibit deference to New South Wales, by substituting &#34;should&#34; for &#34;shall.&#34; I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> that this clause is an affirmation of something which should not be found in a legislative enactment. It is not an enactment, but a mere recommendation, or an expression of a pious wish, and its proper place would be in a resolution passed by each House, as an instruction to the Government, that when they approached the Government of New South Wales, they could say just as easily as they can say now, and with far better grace, &#34;We come to you with this Bill, and these instructions, which express the will of our Parliament, so far as it can be . given legislative form, and beyond these instructions we are not to go in negotiating with you in those matters which must be dealt with by* us, as a matter of contract or bargain.&#34; However, the clause is there, and the object of those who are considering the interests of Australia generally, and not the interests of the few, whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> seems to, is to see that this Bill is dealt with as speedily as possible. As soon as it has been dealt with, and our Government can proceed to negotiate with New South Wales, no doubt a great deal of the present irritation and friction will disappear. I, for one, feel that, although we shall have passed the Bill, yet, even if our Government succeed in selecting a site ultimately, neither this nor a succeeding Parliament will launch out upon extravagant expenditure, as so many persons, who are opposed to the selection of a site for the Capital, are so fond of telling the &#39;people. I am confident that we shall proceed cautiously and slowly, that we shall cut our coat according to our cloth, and that the Capital, though its construction be entered upon early, will not be completed before a generation or two has passed. I trust that we shall take such steps as are necessary, under present circumstances, to establish a territory in that portion of New South Wales which will ultimately be decided upon, which shall not belong to the people of any State, but shall be the common property and heritage of the citizens of Australia for all time, and that we shall gradually, as the years go by, make a centre which shall be worthy of this Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- I believe that it was a great mistake for us to insist upon using the word &#34;shall,&#34; because we had no constitutional right to do so. We must bear in mind that, until the territory &#34; shall have been granted or acquired &#34; by the Commonwealth, and vested in and belong to the Commonwealth, we have no right to fix on a site. We are passing an Act of Parliament, but really it is merely a means of informing the State of New South Wales what our desire is. According to the Constitution the area shall not be less than 100 square miles ; but does any man in his senses believe that the High Court would decide that we could take 200 square miles without the consent of New South Wales? </para>

                        <para>- But no rainfall in a poor country is worse. Very rich country with very little rainfall is not half so good as poor country with a heavy rainfall. &#39; I have judged this site from the reports of others, and have paid _ special attention to the report given by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. That gentleman was in no way interested in any particular site, but made his investigation with an open mind. He was at one time a surveyor, and, with his full knowledge of land, gave his opinion unmistakably in favour of Dalgety. Personally I should have liked the site to be nearer Twofold Bay, because it is important that the Federal Capital should be connected with a port. But we cannot get everything we desire ; and we know that at Dalgety there is sufficient water power to generate electricity for railways and for manufactures within a certain distance, at the least possible cost. . As to climate, I prefer cold to heat, as I think the majority of people do. Those who come from the north, and have been enervated to a certain extent by tropical conditions, will at Dalgety be braced up for future usefulness. As to the necessary expenditure, my idea is that no money should be borrowed in connexion with the Federal Capital ; that all expenditure necessary for providing accommodation for Parliament ought to be met out of the revenue. We have lately heard a great deal about Socialism, and have been told how inadvisable it would be to establish anything like socialistic conditions on the Federal Territory. All I have to say is that if the Commonwealth Government, when they acquire the land, are foolish enough to part with the fee simple, the people of Australia will curse them in the future, because no greater mistake could be committed. We know what the result of parting with the fee simple has been in other parts of the world.&#39; In the city of Adelaide I know of acres which originally sold for , &#163;5 or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10,</inline> but which, on their unimproved value, are now assessed at&#163;20,000. I was never more struck in my life with the importance of not parting with the fee simple as I was during a visit I paid to Singapore. I called upon the Governor, and, speaking of the magnificent buildings I had noticed in the town, I asked him on what tenure the land was held. He informed me that it was leased by the Government for fifty years or ninety-nine years, there being a clause stipulating for certain improvements; and the result of the system is that in the course of time the whole of the property will.. fall into the hands of. the Government. Very little taxation is required there at present, and the possession of this property will render taxation unnecessary in the future. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; some&#39; extremely socialistic plans are tried in Crown Colonies, very often with a considerable amount of wisdom. I am exceedingly glad that the House of Representatives has practically come to the same conclusion as has the Senate in regard to the site for the Federal Capital. I was afraid, from what had taken place previously, that there might be considerable difficulty ; and it is exceedingly gratifying that the result is so good, so far as we have proceeded. </para>

                    <para>- Some remarks which have been made this evening may create a feeling approaching alarm amongst the people of the district in which the proposed Federal territory is situated. It has been affirmed that after the passage of the Bill there is no intention to borrow money for the purpose of carrying its provision into effect. I wish to point out that once the Federal territory is acquired it will be absolutely necessary for the Commonwealth to borrow an amount sufficient&#34; to pay for private property . which it may be necessary to take over. </para>

                        <para>- Having assumed this territory, we cannot allow it tq remain for the periods which have been mentioned - periods ranging from four to twenty years, or from one to two generations - without paying for the property which is claimed. The remarks as to the delay which will take place before any money is expended or borrowed apply only to the building of the Capital, and not to the compensation of those whose private property may be interfered with. </para>

I believe a large majority of honorable senators recognise the advisability of having access from the Federal Capital to the seaboard, and for that reason I shall not occupy time in recommending this amendment.
