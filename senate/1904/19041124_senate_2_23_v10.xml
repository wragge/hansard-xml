                            <para>- This notice of motion cannot be on the notice-paper at the same time with two orders of the day, which seem to me to refer to the same question. There are four standing orders, the intent of which is to prohibit the Senate from discussing twice over the same question. Numbers 126 and 195 state that the same question cannot be twice discussed, and numbers 118 and 405 prohibit the Senate from anticipating any notice of motion or order of the day which is on the notice-paper. The object of the four standing orders is to prevent the same matter from being discussed twice over. The honorable senator now wishes to give notice of a motion which is, in effect, at all events to a certain extent, the same as two orders of the day. </para>

                            <para>- No ; but it is quite competent for an honorable senator to give notice of a motion identical in terms with a notice of motion on the notice-paper, provided that he will abandon the l'atter. What I wish to point out is that the honorable senator desires to place on the notice-paper a notice of motion which will, in effect, lead to the discussion of the same question as is contained in two orders of the day. An order of the day - is a Bill or other matter which the Senate has ordered to be taken into consideration on a particular day. </para>

So long as honorable senators see what the effect of this procedure is, and decide upon it, well and good; but in support of your view, sir, I would point out that my honorable friend is now giving - and I shall be glad to facilitate in every possible way, his view, if it is in conformity with Parliamentary practice and the Standing Orders - notice of motion. This is the fourth notification, so to speak, which -will be  on the notice-paper, at least temporarily, dealing with the same subject. The honorable senator has given notice, for a future day, of a motion which is in terms exactly the same as notice of motion No. 4. Since that notice of motion is on the notice-paper, the standing order and the practice,, as laid down in May, forbid the new notice from being received. In addition to that, sir, there are two orders of the day which, on a previous occasion, you ruled, deal with part of the same subject-matter. </para>

We must not get further into what you, sir, have so well described as a tangle. I venture to submit with great deference to my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> and with great, respect to you - because it is in conformity with what you have already indicated - that first of all we should get rid of the motion upon the notice-paper. It will be for the Senate to decide whether it will discharge that order of the day. Some honorable senators may say, " I will not permit it to be discharged." The Senate ought to have an opportunity of taking that position. My honorable friend cannot anticipate the action of the Senate as to future courses of action by giving notice of motion that he intends to deal wilh the same subject-matter as is covered by a motion standing on the paper. You have already indicated that one notice of motion ought not to be upon the paper at all. Therefore, it ought to come off. My honorable friend himself is entitled to move to discharge a motion from the paper, and the Senate will have to take that motion into consideration when it is brought forward. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend says that he is going to give the terms in detail later on. I suggest that the regular course will be, in conformity with your ruling, to remove from the paper the notice of motion now upon it. In any case it cannot be moved, because it is out of order. Then my honorable friend can move to discharge the order of the day, and the Senate will deal with the subject. Later in the day, if he gets the leave of the Senate, my honorable friend can give notice of a fresh motion. That is the clear course, it seems to me. </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has said. If my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> gives a general notice of motion for a future day, and if before that future day arrives he gets rid of the order of the day upon the notice-paper, and then fills up his general notice of motion with the same terms as those of the motion previously on the paper, will not the new notice be out of order? ' If not, the Standing Orders would be evaded. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> gave his notice of motion <inline font-style="italic">in extenso</inline> now, it would be out of order. Can he avoid that by saying, " I will give notice of motion in general terms," and then, next week, place upon the paper a motion in the same terms as the motion already on the paper? My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> has laid his finger on a very serious question, because if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is out of order in giving notice of motion <inline font-style="italic">in extenso</inline> now, he must be equally out of order when his motion comes on for discussion. </para>

                            <para>- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is not out of order. If honorable senators will consider t'he reasons for the four standing orders to which I have referred, they will see that they are to avoid the same question being discussed twice in the same session. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> does not move the motion standing upon the paper in his name - and no one can make him move it - and if he gives notice of a new motion, the subject-matter will not have been discussed at all. We shall not 'have discussed the same matter twice over; and that is what I understand to be the fundamental reason for the standing orders referred to. If the order of the day is discussed, and I subsequently find that the motion of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> gives notice is similar in substance to the order of the day, then I shall rule that t'he new motion cannot come on, because we have already discussed the matter. But if the Senate discharges the order of the day, and it is not discussed, we shall not then have discussed the same matter twice, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild's</inline> new motion is considered. The object of these standing orders is to prevent the discussion of the same matter twice in the same session. Do I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> means to read out his notice of motion, or shall we take it as read? I will take it that the honorable senator gives notice that he will call attention to the report of the Select Committee on Privileges, and will move a motion dealing with the subject ; and that he will hand in the terms of his motion at least one day before he moves it. </para>

You are the sole repository of the practice of the Senate, and are also our guide in all these matters. I ask for your direction on this subject for the guidance of the Senate. I am afraid that a tendency has grown up to set out in questions extracts from newspapers and other documents; and to ask for documents which might more properly be moved for, and be laid on the table in the ordinary way, and might, if necessary, be ordered by the Senate to be printed.

                            <para>- No ; I am asking for a general direction in this matter. It seems to me that parliamentary practice does not permit of questions being used for this purpose. The questions immediately before us practically set out a number of documents under cover of the form adopted, and I venture to submit that if documents or papers are asked for it is right that the whole of them should be produced, and not mere extracts which it may not be desirable to place on record. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to take the President's ruling on the subject for our guidance. It is not pleasant to refuse to answer questions, and honorable senators will understand that there should be no desire, or at all events, no frequent desire, on the part of Ministers to refrain from answering questions of any sort. I point out with respect to these particular questions that they give a number of extracts from papers, and also convey imputations and personal reflections which may or may not be well founded, but which if intended to be charges against any man should be submitted in the form of charges, in. order that they might be dealt with, and not merely left on the records of the Senate without any opportunity being given to those concerned to meet them. The rule to which I wish to direct attention is taken from <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> and the references to the matter will be found at pages 238 to 239. </para>

                            <para>-Col. Neild. - The Attorney-General has raised a point of order, but has not attempted in support of it to show that his objections are within the purview of our own Standing Orders. The honorable and learned senator has founded them upon alleged instances in the history of the British House of Commons. Rightly or wrongly, this Senate, in framing its own Standing Orders, was careful to avoid any reference to the Standing Orders of the House of Commons. We have provided Standing Orders' of our own, and I therefore submit that, however apposite the honorable and learned Attorney-General's remarks might be as regards the practice of the House of Commons, they are not by any means necessarily applicable to our Standing Orders. I think that the President will be disposed to take the view I take that, entirely apart from the outside suggestion which the Attorney-General has submitted, as reasons for an adverse ruling on my question, the fact remains that those questions are within the terms of our own Standing Orders, and are not, therefore, to be wafted aside by the suggestions which the honorable and learned senator has put forward, and which may, or may not, be accurate. I submit that my questions are within our Standing Orders. </para>

                            <para>- Before the President's ruling is given I should like to emphasize the point mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> that we deliberately struck out of the Standing Orders proposed for the Senate a clause stating that where our Standing Orders did not meet a case under review, the House of Commons' procedure should be adopted. I distinctly remember that that was done, because it was held that we were quite competent to establish our own precedents, and build up our own procedure under a Constitution which is unique amongst those of the Parliaments of the world. I would ask whether, in standing order 94, the words " nor inference, nor imputation " do not refer to Member's of the Parliament ? Suppose that a member of the Senate had information that a breach of the Customs Act was being committed, and wished to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs, through the Attorney-General, whether it was a fact that a certain firm was committing a breach of the Customs Act, would the honorable and learned senator contend that the question was out of order? </para>

                            <para>- But is there not an inference and an imputation there? Senator Symon appears to think that the words 1 nor inference, nor imputation ' ' might be applied to persons outside the Senate, and certainly if t'hat be so the range of questions will be somewhat strictly limited. I take it that what is meant by the standing order is that we must not by inference or imputation make any reflections upon Ministers, whom we may ask questions, or any member of the Senate who has charge of a Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Before answering the direct question put to me I would ask the indulgence of the Senate to say a few words generally- on the subject of questions. I am afraid that we have developed rather an objectionable practice with respect to questions. Questions ought to be such as ask for information. It may be my fault, or partly my fault, but I am afraid that many questions which have been addressed to Ministers in the Senate have not asked for ' information, but have given information and have asked for opinions. I have carefully considered the matter, and in allowing this practice to grow up I have not acted in advisedly. I have given due attention to the fact that if any honorable senator considers a matter of public importance, and desires that it should be brought forward, he will effect his object in one way or another, and if he is not permitted to do so in the form of a question he will do so by way of motion. A question may be disposed of in a few minutes, but if a motion is tabled the debate upon it may occupy a great many hours. It may, therefore, save some time if latitude is allowed in the putting of questions. It seems to me, however, that we should lay down "some general rules concerning questions in addition to our Standing Orders. In reviewing the practice of Parliament, not only of the British House of Commons, but of the States Houses, and of the Federal Senate and House of Representatives in America, I find that general rules have been adopted, in addition to their standing orders. One of these general rules, which honorable senators will find laid down in the practice of the British House of Commons, is this - </para>

                        <para> A question affecting the conduct of an individual is irregular and will not be allowed to appear on the notice-paper, and after the honorable member has received the usual intimation from the Clerk, it is irregular to attempt to bring the matter before the House, and any motion which seeks to bring forward a question already declared to be irregular will not be put by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">The reason for that rule, it seems to me, cannot be controverted, because when a question is asked and the answer is given, the matter cannot be debated, and it is manifestly unfair to make imputations on the character of any individual in the form of a question when that individual cannot be defended either by his friends or by Ministers who have cognizance of the matter. It seems to me, therefore, that that is a rule which we should adopt, and it should be agreed that questions should not attack the character of any individual. There are many other limitations to questions, which are contained in books of reference concerning all Parliaments. I have no doubt whatever that a great many of the questions which have been asked might have been objected to, though, technically speaking, they no doubt were within the terms of the Standing Orders. It seems to me that the members of the Senate ought to consider the position of the Senate, and exercise due discretion in asking questions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone,</inline> in a celebrated speech referring to the Constitution of Great' Britain - and his remarks apply also to our Constitution - said - </para>

                        <para>More, it must be admitted, than any other, it leaves open doors which lead into blind alleys, for it presumes more boldly than any other the good sense and the good faith of those who work it. The undoubted competency of each reaches even to the paralysis or destruction of the rest. The House of Commons is entitled to refuse every shilling of the supplies. That House, and also the House of Lords, is entitled to refuse its assent to every Bill presented to it. The Crown is entitled to make a thousand peers to-day and as many to-morrow ; it may dissolve all and every Parliament before it proceeds to business; may pardon the most atrocious crimes ; may, declare war against the world ; may conclude treaties involving unlimited responsibilities, and even vast expenditure without the consent, nay, without the knowledge of the Parliament, but in reversal of policy already known and sanctioned by the nation. But the assumption is that the depositaries of power will all respect one another; will evince a consciousness that they are working in a common interest for a common end ; and they, will be possessed together with not less than an average intelligence, of not less than an average sense of equity and of the public interest of right. </para>

                    <para class="block">Although that refers to grave concerns, it also would apply to the smaller matter of asking and answering questions. I ask honorable senators to consider the dignity of the Senate by not referring to every tittle-tattle in the newspapers, and thereon asking questions - by not referring to every enunciation of opinion bv some outside authority. I cannot say that questions of this nature are out of order, but I deprecate the practice of asking them. In this particular matter the point raised is whether the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline> Neild is an attack on the character of Major-General Hutton ; and if it is I do not think the question ought to be asked. But I am not prepared to say that it is an attack on the character of Major-General Hutton. 1 think the question is objectionable, and that questions of the kind ought not to be asked; but I am not prepared to say that it is contrary to the standing order. I therefore must rule that the question may be asked, although 1 hope that questions of this nature will in future not be put. </para>

                <para class="block">Pacific, more especially in regard to the Marshall Islands. That nation is endeavouring to inaugurate a new policy which, if persisted in, will seriously affect our trade and interests in the Pacific Ocean. The trade of the Commonwealth in the Pacific has already assumed very large proportions, , and there is every prospect that it will increase and expand if we are allowed fair play in the neighbouring islands. Last year the trade of Australia with the Pacific Islands - exports and imports - came to over £1,000,000, the exports alone representing £600,000. That was a trade which was particularly valuable to Australia, because the islands took our manufactured products, and in return we obtained raw materials which were worked up in our manufactories, and exported' to other parts of the world. A valuable oil is manufactured from copra and the residue is used for cattle food, while the fibre of the cocoanut can be manufactured into coir matting, which Is an important article of commerce. These industries can be built up and the products exported to various parts of the world. There is another aspect of the case to be considered. We have subsidized a line of Australian steamers to run to these islands, and we are gradually building up an important" mercantile marine, manned exclusively by Australians, which is of great commercial importance to the Commonwealth, and which is of great importance in regard to our future defence considerations. The present action of a great European power in the Pacific is likely to cripple that expansion of our shipping which is so necessary in the interest of Australia. </para>

We must admit at once that it is the inherent right of every nation either to grant preference to its colonists in trade between the sovereign State and the Colonies, or between the Colonies, or to see that other nations do not trade with them. We admit that legal aspect of the case. But seeing that we extend to Germany, as we do to all other nations, absolutely equal trading facilities throughout this continent, and give them every opportunity of trading, not only with us. but from port to port throughout the continent, we should not allow such a wanton crippling of our industries to pass without a very strong protest. I am prepared to go even further, and say that if that protest be ineffective it should be supplemented by some retaliatory action in the way of reprisals for their exclusive action where their interests are concerned. The whole trend of the world's fiscal and maritime legislation is to carve out certain restrictive and monopolistic spheres of trade which are appropriated by the State owning the territory. If this system, which is extending in all parts of the world, is not objected to, those nations which do not adopt a similar policy are preyed upon. They are not allowed to trade with the foreign nations', and at the same time the latter take every advantage of their opportunity to trade fully with them. If we turn' to the Tariff of the three greatest mercantile nations outside Great Britain - Germany, France, and America - we shall find that they give a, large preference to their Colonies. Speaking generally, the French Colonies are allowed to import into France at half the ordinary Tariff rates. In the case of America, articles grown or produced in the Philippine Islands come in at 25 per cent, less than the ordinary Tariff rates. They give a further preference by various shipping laws, which are designed for the purpose of preventing the shipping of other nations from trading from port to port in a sovereign State, and in some cases from that State to the Colonies, or between the Colonies. If we take a glance at the various nations we shall find that Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Spain, and the United States .reserve their coastal trade. Even in the case of Egypt, the trade is reserved from foreign nations. The trade between Russia and her possessions in the Pacific is reserved. In the case of the United States there is an absolute exclusion of foreign nations from the coastal trade, except on the St. Lawrence River. It is very important to understand the position which the Americans take up with regard to their Colonies - </para>

The law is that no foreign vessel shall carry either goods or passengers between ports in the United States, or between any port in the United States and Port Rico or Hawaii.

                <para class="block">So that the tendency I mentioned is expanding, and a prohibitive trade interest and a monopoly of the trade between the Colonies in the sovereign State is being extended by the various nations throughout the world. But all this legislation does not prevent any nation from trading with these Colonies or with the sovereign State, and no modern legislation attempted to restrict that freedom until the German Government took action with regard to the Marshall Islands. This is a new and startling aspect of international trade rivalry - something which has not been attempted since the days of the Dutch and British East Indies Companies. The evident intention is to make the German possessions in the Pacific an exclusive trading ground for German vessels. When we come to consider the area and importance of the German Colonies in the Pacific, we shall see at once that such action must be very detrimental to the interests of Australia. All the islands in the area north and north-east of New Guinea practically belong to or are under the protection of the German Empire. The Germans practically propose to place a ring fence, with barbed wire entanglements, round an area comprising 3,600,000 square miles of the Pacific Ocean. They have inaugurated a policy which, if carried out, will practically prohibit any nation from trading with that immense area, extending for 3,000 miles from east to west, and about 1,200 miles from north to south. It includes German New Guinea, the Pallao Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago, the German Solomon Islands, the large Caroline group of islands, and the Marshall Islands. Their action in regard to the Marshall Islands is probably the first instalment of a more extensive system in the South Seas. They have instituted this policy first of all with regard to the Marshall Islands probably to see how it will be regarded "by other nations. If they should be content, and turn the other cheek, the Germans will adopt a similar policy with regard to their other islands, which would be a most serious injury to the Commonwealth. They would probably have another subsidized company to take on another group of islands, and in that way they would create a system of absolute exclusion from all their possessions in the Pacific. It is stated that the Jaluit Company has been granted a similar monopoly with regard to all the Caroline Islands except Ponapi, the capital. This company is a very powerful combination. It is an amalgamation of three companies, and has four or five trading vessels under its control. It is very heavily subsidized by the German Government. Their purpose, of course, is to extend German influence and German exclusion in the Pacific Ocean. It has been stated that no other company is given any privilege with regard to that area, and that if another German company was to come in it would be placed under exactly the same disabilities as an Australian or American company. But that is the merest quibble and subterfuge ; because there are no. other German steamers running to those Islands, and Germany has no intention of granting a subsidy to any other lines. Therefore, the Marshall Islands! are practically placed under the control of that company, with a view to its having an absolute monopoly of the trade for the German Empire. If any other German company comes in they will say, " We will treat you in exactly the same way," because they know that there is no other German company in existence to 'trade! with those Islands. It will be quite possible for them to say, " We will charge our own boats exactly the same wharfage rates and duties," because, as they hold those islands very much as a chartered company holds territory, it would be only taking money out of one pocket to put it into the other. This Jaluit company sends its boats down to the Gilbert and Ellice groups of islands, which belong to the British, and trades freely with them. It is also a common practice with the company to run its boats down - comparatively only a few miles - just a few weeks before our subsidized steamers arrive, and take away all the copra, and the produce that is ready for export, giving its goods and wares in return before our vessels arrive. They practically say, " We will trade with your islands and take your trade away, but we will not allow you to trade with ours." </para>

Germany has unfortunately for some time past adopted a very high-handed and grasping policy, not only in the South Pacific, but in other parts of the world. We all remember the case of the annexation of German New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago. We know that their action was a violation of all diplomatic usage. We know that Lord Derby notified the German Government that it was the intention of Great Britain to establish a protectorate over the whole of the eastern portion of New Guinea, and that Baron von Plessen asked that the question of the annexation of the northern portion should be made a .subject for diplomatic negotiation. Great Britain agreed to that request, but before, any diplomatic notes had passed, and before the matter had been considered, the information came that a German man-of-war had been sent out, and that the territory had been .annexed. </para>

I may mention in illustration that in the case of the bounty -fed sugar of Germany, the head of the Cartel system made a boast that in a few years' time the Cartel would ruin every sugar-cane growing industry in the world. All the other nations consequently adopted a .retaliatory system by putting on countervailing duties ; and at a conference held in Brussels, Germany had to forego the continuance of the bounty system. </para>

                    SMITH.The statement was made by the president at one of the meetings of the Cartel. Germany has allowed Great Britain to come under what is known as the most favoured nation clause, and Great Britain has allowed Germany to do the same. The treaty made between Great Britain and Germany necessitated that Great Britain should not give to any nation a preference greater than the preference given to Germany. At a later period the Right Honorable Joseph Chamberlain pointed out that the treaty contained certain stipulations with regard to the British Colonies that did not permit Great Britain to grant a preference to her Colonies unless Germany got a similar preference.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline>
                    had that clause of the treaty struck out. In spite of this Germany affected to still consider that Great Britain, in undertaking not to give preference to any other nation unless the same was given to Germany, had also undertaken not to grant preference to her Colonies. In- other words, the British Colonies were to be considered as foreign nations for the purposes of the agreement. The result was that when Canada proposed to give a preference to Great Britain, Germany said that it was a contravention of the most favoured nation clause, and that she would impose extra duties against Canada. The idea of endeavouring to interfere between Great Britain and her Colonies, and that the British Government could not grant preference to one of them, or
                    <inline font-style="italic">vice versa,</inline>
                    raised such a storm of indignation throughout Great Britain that Germany soon altered her tactics. I merely mention this in order to point out that when Germany does adopt these aggressive tactics she can be met only in one way, and that is by reprisals which are injurious to the German people. As I have said, it must be admitted that Germany has a perfect right to do all these things. There can be no possible question about that. And, no doubt, she will continue to do them until some action is taken. If we supinely agree to accept all that the German Government chooses to do, no doubt they will continue their present policy very much to the injury of the Australian trade, and the trade of the Empire.

                        <para>- I cannot believe that they are; but in any case, we cannot judge from isolated facts like that. Their trade extends over an enormous area, and we cannot allocate a certain amount of profit to any particular part of the trade. The German people have adopted, as they had a right to do, certain legislation, or have come to certain decisions in regard to excluding Australian shipping from their ports in the Pacific. It is quite competent for us tq do the same thing to them. What is sauce 4for the goose is sauce for the gander. If we treat them in somewhat the same way, we shall probably find that Germany will come off second best ih the bargain. I myself believe that retaliation under conditions like that, with a view to securing fairer conditions, is justifiable, and advantageous to a nation. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to have another friend's commendation. The Germans would find if they came to such a pass as that, and if Great Britain said, " We will adopt retaliatory measures if you are going to exclude us absolutely from trading with your possessions," that they would have the worse of the bargain, because they would be excluded from practically one-quarter of the world. I am not at all sure that Great Britain is not waking up to the absolute necessity of some such action being taken.

                        <para>- I have said that I have no desire to prevent the Germans from trading with Australia. Other portions of the Empire are seriously considering the necessity of adopting some retaliatory policy with regard, not only to Germany, but other nations who refuse access to British ships to trade between their possessions and the sovereign State, or to participate in their coastal traffic. At the Colonial Conference held in London in 1902, between the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Prime Ministers of the self-governing Colonies, the following resolution affecting the coastal trade was passed : - </para>

                <para class="block">That, of course, is with a view to the establishment of a system of reciprocity in regard to shipping. If we turn to the Navigation Bill which was introduced at the beginning of this session, we shall find some excellent provisions to meet such a contingency as I Have outlined. That Bill provides that foreign ships trading from port to port in Australia must be licensed; that they must pay the Australian rate of wages, that they must not be subsidized, and that they must be properly manned. Those are conditions which, if enforced, would practically preclude foreign shipping from trading in Australian waters. Clause 306 of the Navigation Bill provides - </para>

                <para>That simply means that while we should impose these restrictions upon all foreign ships, they would not be put in force by the Governor-General in the case of ships belonging to foreign nations that allow British ships the same rights and privileges in trading as we should allow, were the restrictions to which I have referred removed. Such a clause should be very valuable, and if the Germans persist in their policy of excluding British ships from their waters, I for one' will readily support such a provision. Its object is not to impose exclusion upon foreign shipping, but to force Germany to relax those stringent conditions in connexion with her Colonies, which are so injurious to the extension of Australia's interests and trade in the Pacific. For my own part, I hope that such legislation will not be found necessary. I hope that the German Government will see that its policy of endeavouring to obtain the absolute monopoly of trade" with German Possessions, is one which is likely to lead to reprisals on the part of Australia, and of other parts of the British Empire. If such a course is persisted in, Germany is the nation which will suffer most, because we possess the greatest trade and coast-line of any nation in the world. </para>

                    SMITH.I have stated that such clauses as are contained in the Navigation Bill would admirably, meet such a contingency. They would «be retaliatory clauses, which could be put .into operation to preclude German ships trading in Australian waters, unless Germany allows our ships to. trade in her waters. Clause 306 of the Navigation Bill, to which I have referred, will, in my opinion, meet the case admirably While I think that it would be highly regrettable if Australia were forced to adopt such measures, there can be no doubt that if other nations are to adopt "the selfish and exclusive policy of absolutely prohibiting the ships of other nations trading with them, or with certain portions of their territory, we shall be forced to adopt an attitude which will be calculated to make them reconsider such a policy.

                    SMITH.That has nothing to do with this question. I am dealing with the action of Germany in preventing us from trading with certain portions of her territory. The question for us to consider is whether we are to supinely allow Germany to continue this policy, or whether we shall say that unless she reverses that policy we shall preclude her ships from trading in Australian waters. I believe that if Germany is given to understand that unless she relaxes her stringent conditions that will inevitably be the result when our Navigation Bill is passed, she will see that in her own interests it is desirable that these restrictions should be removed, and that we should be given fair trading facilities with her possessions. Honorable senators, I am sure, will admit that it is of great importance that some action should be taken in this matter. We are aware that the Home authorities have been communicated with on the subject, through the Minister of External Affairs, and strong representations have been made with a view to inducing Germany to reverse her policy. But I believe that a discussion of the matter in the Senate is advisable, because it is just as well that the German Government should understand that it is not the intention of the Australian people to allow this injurious legislation to continue without taking action which will be far more detrimental to Germany than is the exclusion of our trade with German possessions to us. I hope that it will be found that the German Government will not insist upon its present policy, and that we shall be allowed to continue the friendly trading relations which we have hitherto had with our powerful neighbour, and that all our relations in the future with other nations in the Pacific will be of a character" mutually beneficial to ourselves and to them.

                    <para>. - My honorable friend, in closing his most interesting and, I think. I may also say, instructive speech, alluded to the fact that the statement referred to in his motion is one of very high importance. Of that there can be no doubt. We shall all assent to the honorable senator's statement that if the matters to which he has called attention, and the steps which, so far as we know, appear to have been taken in these islands by the German authorities, are substantiated, it will be a consummation devoutly wished that the Imperial Government will, when they know the facts, deal with them from the point of view of seeking to arrive at a friendly arrangement, so that we in Australia, and the British residents in some of these islands, may live and carry on their business with the German population in a spirit of amity and harmony. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> will not expect me to traverse the various matters to which he has referred. The speech the honorable senator has delivered, and the information he has supplied, will be of great assistance to us in Parliament and elsewhere, I hope, in considering the matter when the fitting time arrives;. Having accomplished his object, and given expression to his views in the way in which he has, I hope the honorable senator will not think it necessary to press his motion to a division. There are two points to which I should like to refer. The first has regard to. the terms of the honorable senator's motion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> asks that the Government shall take all steps possible to counteract the injury which is dona I do not investigate the foundation of the motion, because my honorable friend is more familiar with the matter than I can be at this moment. But I can assure him that the Government have under serious consideration the matters which have been recently made public. As the honorable senator is aware, very strong representations have been cabled by the Prime Minister, as Minister of External Affairs, to the Imperial authorities, with a view to diplomatic negotiations on the. subject being opened up with the German Empire. </para>

As has been pointed out, the islands to which reference has been made are not ours. Some belong to Germany, whilst ot'her islands in the Pacific are under Imperial control, but are not part of the Commonwealth of Australia, and therefore our only means, short of another course which was indicated, to bring about a better state of things- commercially and nationally, is to adopt a diplomatic process. That may take time, and may try our patience. There is, of course, the other alternative which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> though not seriously, I think, has suggested by way of interjection. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has also, with great force, put the point as to reprisal ; but, I think', the less we talk about reprisals at the present time the better. </para>

All I venture to do at present is to deprecate the discussion of reprisals, or anything in the nature of retaliation, as a practical way of dealing with a matter which is at present under consideration from another point of view. I think that is all I need say at present, except that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> was good enough to call my attention yesterday to some notice of motion in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, in regard to suggested reprisals. The observations I have already made apply also to such proposals. I am afraid that, perhaps, in the heat of necessary provocation, an consequence of the information we have received, steps may be taken which had better be avoided in the way of motions or resolutions. At any rate, I am indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> for the great amount of information he has given us, and also for the views he has so clearly expressed. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> of the sympathy of the Government in reference to the measures which have been taken, and of their desire to create, as he has himself expressed it, a friendly basis for commercial intercourse throughout those islands. I shall ask the honorable senator, when the discussion is closed, to withdraw his motion. </para>

                    <para>. - If I felt at liberty, I should consult my own inclination by refraining from taking any part in this debate. This is a matter which, as I said on a former occasion, ought not to have been made the subject of inquiry by a Select Committee. An inquiry has, however, taken place, and the Select Committee have presented a report containing certain findings and recommendations. As I do not agree with the findings, I cannot support the recommendations ; and I feel bound <inline font-style="italic">to-</inline> give my reasons for the conclusions to which I have come. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs, Chairman</inline> of the Select Committee, has moved the adoption of the report in a speech - a report of which appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> - and I shall first refer to one or two points on which I do not agree with that honorable senator. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> was submitting that motion, I felt called upon once or twice to interject, but I may say that that was only to enable him to develop his argument in order that I might be informed on what he was relying, and not with the slightest intention of throwing him off the track, or hampering him in anyway. I mentioned incidentally, also, when the honorable senator was speaking, that I felt it to be rather a disadvantage to be personally acquainted with nearly all the officers whose names have been mentioned in connexion with the inquiry. I am far from desiring to take up the position of a partisan; and I hope that in anything I have to say referring to the evidence, I shall be absolutely just and impartial. If honorable senators should think that I in any way misrepresent any portion of the evidence, I may rely on them to put me right at once. In regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> my feeling accords with the opinion expressed by nearly every one of the witnesses, namely, that as a man and a gentleman, nothing can be said against him. The whole question resolves itself into whether <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was the officer who, under the circumstances., could be spared with the least detriment to the Military Forces. The Select Committee starting to do justice to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> in consequence of a complaint made by him, have, in their endeavours, unwittingly done less than justice to other officers. I think I shall be able to show that they have not been just to the late General Officer Commanding, that they have not been just, in some instances, to other officers who are conducting the military affairs of the country, and that, especially, they have not been just to two or three officers - and more particularly one officer - whose names have been mentioned, as in the opinion of some persons those who could be more easily spared than <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline></para>

I propose to refer first of all, to one or two points contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs'</inline> speech, and then to run hastily through the evidence with reference to what are called' the reasons for <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll's</inline> retrenchment, as contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Hutton's private letter. Having done that, I wish to refer to the evidence bearing on the question whether <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was the officer who could be the more easily spared. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with all the grounds if honorable senators will not insist on my anticipating. Major-General Hutton, in two or three places, gave that as the ground of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll's</inline> retrenchment, and so long as his information and his judgment were correct, that was a sufficient reason, namely, that he was called upon to retrench, and, on making inquiries in Queensland, he came to the conclusion that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was the officer who could be spared with least detriment to the Public Service. Subsequently, the Minister of Defence asked Major-General Hutton to furnish reasons for the action taken, and he, in response, wrote a letter in which he not only gave that reason, which, I am of opinion, must be regarded as the real one, but also a statement of the information which had come to him with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> That letter, which was marked " private and confidential," and was written in response to a private letter from the Minister, was made the basis of inquiry by the Committee, as though the contents constituted a number of separate charges against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline></para>

                        <para>- In reply to my letter saying that some members desired to be informed on this subject, Major-General Hutton wrote a letter which substantially contains the same statements as the private and confidential letter which had previously been addressed to my predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. But the letter which was made the basis of this inquiry was that of 14th November. I feel sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> must be mistaken in this respect. I think he will bear me out in this statement - that all these private letters written by Major-General Hutton are in his own handwriting. He must have been an exceedingly busy man to have done the work he did in connexion with the Defence Department. Six' months after he took a certain action he was called upon by the Minister to give his reasons - apparently to give fuller reasons- and next day he sat down, and with his own hand dashed off this letter of 14th November, which was made the basis of the inquiry. </para>

                        <para>- I intend to deal separately with the statements taken from the letter. When we' come to the second finding that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> has been treated unjustly, and that he should be reinstated, I endeavour to show that the substantial reason for his retrenchment has been fully borne out by the evidence. I desire to refer to one or two matters in the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs.</inline> In the first place, I wish to allude to the assumed destruction of documents. When the case was first brought under my notice by the honorable member for. Oxley, and <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> it was represented to me that shortly before that officer arrived from South Africa the papers, containing the records of his service, and so om, were destroyed. The matter was put to me in such a way that it appeared to me to imply a most serious charge against officers in the Department, and it was that which first strongly attracted my attention to the case. I made inquiries - and subsequently further inquiries were made, partly at my instance - and I came to the conclusion, as I stated when the Select Committee was. asked for, that there was' absolutely nothing irregular, that if any one had been attracted to take up the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> on the ground that there had been anything like a conspiracy against him prior to his arrival from South Africa, the evidence showed that nothing of the kind occurred, and that he did not suffer from the periodical destruction of papers, which took place by the orders of a board. </para>

Honorable senators are aware that a board was appointed under the King's regulations, for the periodical destruction of papers which had accumulated in the office. The practice of such a board is to take account of the papers which are to be destroyed, in order that a record of them may be kept. </para>

                        <para>- When the matter first came before me it was mentioned prominently, and led me to think that there was a suggestion that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> had been very unfairly and improperly treated in connexion with the destruction of documents. I made some inquiries, and was satisfied that his case had not been prejudiced in any way by that incident, and that is borne out by the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Colonel Price. Senator Higgs</inline> was rather unfair in some of the remarks he made with regard to the production of papers. He considered that the Department had been at fault in not bringing forward papers which ought to have been brought forward. He stated that when the Select Committee first asked for papers concerning Major Carroll it received some papers; that when it made a second request, it received more papers ; and that when it made a third request, it got more papers ; and that then he unearthed one particular document, being the proceedings of a Mess Committee. It is very unfair to suggest that because that paper was not produced in the first place, and was not produced until my honorable friend discovered it in some way or other, it was being deliberately kept back by the Department. Surely the Department could not suppose that, when it was asked to produce all papers relating to this case, it was to produce every paper in the office in which the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> occurred ? How could there be any unfriendliness ? </para>

But, in any case, I cannot see that the honorable senator in producing the paper has helped <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> The charge which, was made - of course it is a trivial matter to refer to, but it must be done - was that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> when a junior officer attached to A Battery, was in charge of the mess accounts, that they got into disorder, that there was a deficiency, and that he was charged with gross carelessness by a superior officer. His explanation was that while he was away, presumably on duty, the stock of the mess had diminished, and that the deficiency arose in that way. The paper which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> produced is a record of the proceedings of the Mess Committee, and the finding was that £5 6s. 9d. of this account was to be paid by him. Surely the Department - even if it had suppressed a document of that sort - could not be said to have suppressed it in order to injure <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carrol]</inline> ? He was charged with gross carelessness ; his defence was that there was no carelessness ; that while he was absent on duty other persons had consumed the supplies of the canteen, and the finding of the Mess Committee was that he should pay £5 6s. 9d. </para>

If it is said that it was a mere voluntary service, I think it hardly likely that an officer would voluntarily discharge such duties after being called upon to pay ^5 6s. od.

                        <para>- I think that the honorable senator was unfair to Colonel Plomer in regard to that matter. Colonel Plomer was not Commandant in Queensland at this particular time. He was not appointed Commandant until quite recently, and had nothing to go upon except the records. Colonel Plomer, in the document referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> says that Lieutenant Carroll had not passed his artillery examination as a lieutenant then, or at any other time. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> refers to an entry that has been made that Lieutenant Carroll had been appointed captain; and he also points out that Colonel Plomer says that if he had seen that entry he would have accepted it as proof that Captain Carroll had passed, presumably in artillery. The whole incident, in my opinion, shows that the records in the Brisbane office cannot have been kept as they should have been. The Committee went to Brisbane, and I presume that they called for an explanation with respect to the examination. The practice in Brisbane, as I know very well, was that when examinations took place, a printed report was sent round to every candidate. Every man who had been examined was told exactly what he had done. If he had passed his name was given. I see that in this certified copy the name of Lieutenant Carroll is mentioned. If the candidate does not pass for the grade for which he is standing his name is not given, but he is indicated by a number, so that he can find out from the record exactly how many marks he got in any subject in which he passed. It seems to me that copies of those reports ought to have been kept. It ought to have been possible to find out at once exactly when <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> passed his examination. </para>

It is a pity that the documents were not available to show exactly what examination <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> had passed; but I am rather surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> himself, who seems to have been a very exact and methodical man in many things, was not able to show the examinations which he passed, and when he passed them. At the same time Colonel Plomer must be acquitted of having deliberately said anything that was not correct. Against the statement which was made, that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> had not passed any artillery examinations, we have the fact that .in 1889 he passed as a lieutenant, and that in 1898 he was appointed captain, having passed part of his examination in Queensland, and having also per- formed some services at Hythe, in England. From those facts, we may conclude that he had passed his examination in the artillery as a lieutenant when he was in Queensland. But there again I do not think it is right to charge  Colonel Plomer  with having deliberately stated anything that was incorrect. </para>

The age of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> cannot be looked upon as a reason, or even as one of t'he reasons, for his being retrenched. But there seems to have been a feeling in the Department that when officers were retrenched junior, and not senior, officers should go. The policy of the Department appears to have been that age was not to be considered a special reason for keeping a man in the service, but that the contrary was rather to be the case. The explanation is that the younger men are supposed to be more capable of acquiring information and of learning new methods. It stands to reason that the minds of the younger officers are in a more receptive condition. </para>

                        <para>- It is not alleged that he was too old, but that he was older than other officers. The report of the Committee states that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> is pursuing certain studies in bacteriology. There is no reason why he should not do that. No doubt there are other avenues of employment which <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> might pursue with advantage. It is also stated that he has written a book, and that the proof-sheets are in the hands of the publishers. But that is no reason why he should not be retrenched from the service at his age in preference to younger men. The, feeling in the Department is that a younger man is more able to grapple with new subjects, but there is no reason why, because a man is retired from the Defence Forces on account of age, 'he should not succeed in other walks of life. There is no reason why he should not, after he retires, write a book on a military subject. I can well understand that a retired officer might be well fitted for work of that description. In referring to the other reasons for the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> I shall leave out matters which I shall have to refer to afterwards in dealing with the question of whether or not <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was a person who could be spared without detriment to the service.

                <para class="block">That statement is described in the report as being incorrect, as may be seen from a book in which we find that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was a Provisional Lieutenant on the 24th November, 1898. Is not this an instance of the unfairness of the Committee in dealing with matters in this way ? Major-General' Hutton, in a private and confidential letter, makes a statement that the date of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll's</inline> appointment to the Permanent Forces was the 1st February, 1899. It is treated by the Committee as though that were all that Major-General Hutton said in his letter of the 14th November, and that he was therefore suppressing the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> had been in the Defence Force of Queensland, though not in, the Permanent Forces, in 1888. But when we turn to the letter itself we shall find that that statement is contained in it. Major-General Hutton's letter of the 14th November, 1902, will be found in the minutes of evidence at page 15, in answer to question 185. He states - " Captain Carroll - Aged 37 years and 8 months; date of appointment to Permanent Forces, 1st February, 1899." </para>
                <para class="block">And a few lines further down there is this statement - " He joined the Queensland Permanent Artillery in 1888 as an officer on probation for three years." </para>

                        <para>- What I have quoted, is in Major-General Hutton's handwriting. I am pointing out the unfairness of the Committee in referring to Major-General Hutton's statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> joined the Permanent Forces in 1899 as being a misstatement, because he was attached to A Battery in Queensland in 1888, which statement is actually made in the same letter by Major-General Hutton, and there cannot, therefore, be any suggestion of misrepresentation. The matter becomes important when considered in connexion with the length of service which is claimed for <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> The question is raised whether <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll's</inline> services as a provisional lieutenant in j 888, the period during which he was on ' the Unattached List, and the period during which he was on the Retired List, should count as service, but if these matters are important, I submit that a full statement of the case has been given bv Major-General Hutton. Tt is a matter of opinion, and a matter in dispute, whether the service of this officer should count from 1888, but even if it should, Major-General Hutton has not misstated anything in his letter of the 14th November. It is clear that his statement that the date of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll's</inline> appointment to the Permanent Forces is 1st February, 1899. is absolutely correct. </para>

                        <para>- I beg the honorable senator's pardon, there could not be, because <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> then Lieutenant Carroll, was a militia officer in 1888, and was attached to . A Battery, which is the Instructional Corps in Queensland. He was not then a member of the Permanent Forces, but. a militia officer attached to A Battery as a provisional lieutenant. At the end of 1888 he passed his examination, and in January, 1889, he became a full lieutenant, but he was not then a member of the Permanent Forces ; and Major-General Hutton is perfectly correct in saying that the date of his appointment to the Permanent Forces was the 1st February, 1899. 1 submit that that statement could not have been misleading, seeing that Major-General Hutton in the same letter referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll's</inline> services in Queensland in 1888. Then we have statement <inline font-style="italic">c -</inline></para>

                <para class="block">The Committee say that they find some contradiction between the oral and documentary evidence giving General Finn's opinion of the officer in question. I have read both, and I can see no contradiction. In answer to question 879, Brigadier-General Finn says of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> - " That he was only a fair instructional officer and that he had much to learn." </para>
                <para class="block">The certificate, which is the documentary evidence that is considered by the Committee of more value than the oral evidence of Brigadier-General Finn on oath, will be found on page 272, Appendix No. 20. In this certificate, it will be found that General Finn states - " Practical proficiency in drill and in the field - <inline font-style="italic">As an instructor</inline> fair and improving in infantry drill. Judgment fair. Tact fair." </para>
                <para class="block">There is a foot-note which is not printed in the appendix, to this effect - " Fair and moderate " cannot be accepted as satisfactory in regard to any qualification in which an officer can improve himself by more attention to and study of his profession. </para>

                    drill in the certificate referred to is described as " fair, and improving in infantry drill," and as this officer claims f fourteen years of service, his would be a case in which I think " fair ' ' would not be considered as being a very satisfactory report. However,, that is Brigadier-General Finn's opinion, and I may have to refer to the matter again when I come to deal with what I consider to be the main question. Then we have the report of Lt.-Col. Neild.

Neild was a commanding officer, under whom <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was serving. I have seen what <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> has said in his evidence to the effect that he had had an interview with Lt.-Col. Neild, and that after some talk he understood that this report had been as good as withdrawn. I heard what Lt.-Col. Neild said here only the other day that, perhaps, on consideration, he might have been misinformed by some other officer, and might have proceeded on incorrect information. But honorable senators cannot get away from the fact that Lt.-Col. Neild did make certain reports to his superior officer. </para>

I think that the statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was reported as a poor instructional officer is amply borne out. The only possible difference to be found is, that while he is described by one as a poor instructional officer, he is described by Brigadier-General Finn as " Fair, and improving in infantry drill," but the latter states that "fair" is not to be taken as good in a case where an officer has had an opportunity to improve himself bv diligent attention to his studies.

                    <para>Major-General Hutton, in his sworn written statement before the Committee (Q. 345)5 said that at the time of his arrival in the Commonwealth on the 27th January, 1902, he had no personal acquaintance with Captain Carroll, but " information was given him at first hand which enabled him to form a correct judgment in the matter." He further said - " Having concluded a preliminary investigation as regards the officers whom it would be possible to retrench, I, in May, 1902, proceeded to Queensland to arrange on the spot the drastic retrenchment which it was found necessary to carry out in accordance with the expressed desire of the Queensland Government, and, in accordance with the directions of the Minister of Defence and the Commonwealth Government </para>

I found that the information which I had already obtained as regards Captain Carroll was correct. It appeared that he had been attached to the Permanent Artillery as a probationary officer - 1889 to 1891. It appeared that although he had passed a simple artillery examination, as laid down for young militia artillery officers, he had failed to pass any of the examinations laid down for officers to be appointed to the Permanent Artillery of the State. I further found that he had once been placed under arrest, and that his service generally was of such an unsatisfactory character that his probationary appointment was not confirmed. After having been attached as a probationary officer to the Permanent Artillery, and having failed to qualify or to satisfy the conditions for a permanent appointment, he went to England and was placed on the unattached list of the State." </para>

The matter of saluting was referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> and no doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was in trouble once or twice with his superior officers, but that may not be of much importance. The statement which is said to be inaccurate and misleading is, I presume, that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was found unsatisfactory. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was three years a military officer attached to the battery, and. although he passed as lieutenant, he did not pass as captain at the time he was retired ; and I understand his probationary appointment was not confirmed. It may be a matter of opinion as to whether he was or was not satisfactory. General Hutton, on the information he had received from his officers, considered that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll's</inline> three years' service in Queensland was not satisfactory, and I cannot see that the Committee really had any evidence on which they could say that the Major-General was wrong in that respect.

He was informed of the fact, and, in acknowledging receipt of the letter,, he expressed the desire to be given a permanent position in the Defence Forces of Queensland. Then the Commandant, Colonel Gunter, on the 22nd December, 1898, wrote a letter to the Chief Secretary, suggesting that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> should receive an appointment. In 1897, the Jubilee Year, the Premier of Queensland was undoubtedly in England, and no doubt other Queenslanders were visiting the old country at the same time. In fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> has said that he saw <inline font-weight="bold">Major King, Sir Horace</inline> Tozer, and others in England, who might perhaps have been able to say a word for him in Queensland. But there can be no doubt that when he was appointed to the Permanent Forces, in 1899, the fact, according to the evidence of several officers, caused surprise, and many suggestions were offered as to the reasons why this appointment had been made. Turning to Major-General Hutton's written statement, on page 33, I find this evidence - </para>
                <para>It appeared that in February, 1899, Captain Carroll was appointed to the Permanent Staff of the Military forces of Queensland. The reasons of the appointment were unknown, but it was stated to me that his appointment was made by then Premier of Queensland, acting, probably, on representations of a favorable nature made in regard to this officer. </para>

My aide-de-camp will tell you that that is the opinion of every officer in Queensland. Nevertheless, it has not a material bearing upon this case.

                        <para>- I do not say that it was political influence; it might have been social or other influence. An officer serves for three years without any distinguished credit, is put on the Retired List, and goes to other parts of the world ; and if he receives an appointment on the Permanent Staff, to his own great surprise, in 1899. it gives rise to the thought that he must have 0had " a friend at court." I cannot put my 'hand on Colonel Gunter's letter, but in the evidence there is a letter in which he recommends to the Chief Secretary the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> to this position, and which suggests the question, whether he was interesting himself on the officer's behalf. Honorable senators will quite understand that when <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> did receive this appointment, to his great surprise - and it was one which clearly was not due to his military services - it was not at all strange that it should have given rise to a rumour amongst officers that he had probably " a friend at court." We all know how rumours occur. The rumour reached Major-General Hutton in a 'distorted form. When he was called upon by his Minister at short notice to state his grounds for having arrived at his decision, it was not surprising that he should have been verbally inaccurate in making the connexion between the service in Queensland in 1888, and the appointment in 1899. </para>

                <para class="block">There is some evidence by Lt.-Col. Spencer Browne as to the opinion which Colonel Aytoun had formed. It is a curious thing that here, as in other parts of the evidence, witnesses who came forward to testify in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> showed the kindliest possible feelings towards .him personally. Here is a case that is brought up, as showing the inconsistency of  Colonel Aytoun,  though the evidence goes to show that  Colonel Aytoun  expressed opinions adverse to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> and his service in South Africa. When, however, it came to the question of enabling <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> to draw a gratuity of £100, which had to depend upon Colonel Aytoun's certificate, the colonel marked1 his services as being quite satisfactory. It is also said that Colonel Aytoun met <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> and said that it was a shame that he had been retrenched. That does not mean very much, because  Colonel Aytoun  was not saying whether <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> ought to have been retrenched in preference to any one else, but he looked upon it in the light that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was a good fellow, and he was sorry that any officer should be retrenched. The same feeling is also exhibited in the letter sent by Major-General Hutton, in which the late Commandant expressed his regret at having to retrench many valuable and deserving officers'. There was a disposition, not only on the part of Colonel Aytoun, but on the part of every one else, not to say anything unkind concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> if it could be helped.

But it is hard on these six officers that . their military qualification should have been called in question without even allowing the officer who mentioned their names to be cross-examined about them. </para>

Not a word was said against them, except by one of the witnesses, who insinuated that' they were somewhat inferior in some respects to Major Carroll. I complain that Captain Niesigh was not even allowed to cross-examine Colonel Tom Price with respect to these officers. It will be seen on page 215 of the evidence at question 5444 that a comparison was made between <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> and two captains, whose names are mentioned. The witness was asked questions about these two captains, whom he said should have been retired before <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> Then at the foot of page 215 it is reported - </para>

                <para>It was exhaustive so far, perhaps, as the subjects were concerned, but it would be unreasonable to suppose that the Major-General could give the full particulars and details in private letters. Statement <inline font-style="italic">p</inline> says - </para>

The case was dealt with by him (Major-General Hutton) on its merit with all the facts before him as regards Carroll's past and present . services. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>The finding of the Committee upon that is, that Major-General Hutton ignored <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll's</inline> past and present services. Any one who takes the trouble to go through the evidence given by Major-General Hutton, must see that he was apprised of the facts in connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll's</inline> past and present services, and there is no reason to doubt that he took them into' consideration. It may be said that a Committee appointed to travel from State to State, and which examines fifty-six witnesses, will, if it is diligent, find out more than Major-General Hutton could find out by visiting Queensland, and calling upon such officers as he could take advice from. I' point out that the Committee visited Queensland, and took the evidence of a number of militia and volunteer officers. They were not officers permanently connected with the Defence Forces, and I believe that in almost every case they were officers under whom <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> had never served They were his brother -officers, and I have no desire to say anything to their detriment. They gave evidence, as did nearly all the witnesses, of the gentlemanly character of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> and also as to the work he did. But the Committee seemed to think that because they had these volunteer officers brought before them to give evidence, Major-General Hutton should have been able to avail himself of similar sources of information. It must not be forgotten that the militia and volunteer officer has his own business to attend to. When Major-General Hutton, in the discharge of his duties, went to Brisbane to find out from officers on the spot which men could best be spared, he necessarily went to officers in the permanent service of the Commonwealth. Naturally, on such an occasion he would not be in touch with the militia and volunteer officers, who would be attending to their private business during the time he was in Brisbane. It was, therefore, not unreasonable that Major-General Hutton should have said that he dealt with this case with all the facts before him in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll's</inline> past and . present services. He could not inquire of militia and volunteer officers what they knew of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> but he called on the State Commandant, and the chief-staff officers and officers of the Permanent Forces in Brisbane, and got from them all the information he could obtain with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll's</inline> services There is another matter mentioned in the report, and also in the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> to which I must briefly refer, that is, with respect to misstatements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> dealt' with in. statements <inline font-style="italic">r</inline> and sin the Committee's report. I should say that this matter arises out of a letter from. Major-General Hutton to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, who was at that time Minister of Defence, and dated 19th July, 1903. This letter' will be found at page 16 of the minutes of evidence. It was written in reply to a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, stating that' it was necessary that good reason should be . shown for retrenching <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> Statement <inline font-style="italic">r</inline> embodies the substance of the letter, and is as follows : - </para>

                <para class="block">This matter is disputed. The fourteen years of Queensland service is reckoned in this way : <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was appointed lieutenant provisionally in 1888. He was for three years attached to A Battery, Queensland. He afterwards left Queensland, and was placed on the Unattached List. Later on, inadvertently or wrongly, he was removed from the Unattached List to the Retired List. He remained on the Retired List until 1898, when he was brought back to the Unattached List with the rank of captain, and in 1899 he was appointed to the Permanent Staff. On this <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> made the statement to the Minister of Defence that he had had fourteen years' Queensland service, and he still holds that that was a correct statement.

                <para>I do not propose to go through all the evidence on this branch of the subject. I say at once that I am very sorry that, the term "eccentricity" has been introduced at all, because it is a very elastic term. </para>

                        <para>- No. I think that he should not have used a word which is so elastic in its meaning, and which might be taken to convey a great deal more than was really intended. I disavow its use myself, from my personal knowledge of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> whom I know to be a most zealous, painstaking, and hard-working officer. I should not like it to be thought for a moment that I held the view that any one would be justified in attaching to the word " eccentricity," as applied to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> the meaning attached to it by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> in the remarks which he made.. I do not believe that any of the witnesses, in using the word, intended that it should bear such a meaning. We have here an officer whom every one liked and admired, and who took to the military profession, though not early in life, as he must have been 24 or 25 years of age. It is evident that he. liked military ' life, and wished to excel in it. He was zealous and diligent; and worked hard, but in spite of all he has not been a success: That is . as much as can be said. He was attached to A Battery in Queensland, and that gave him the very best opportunities to distinguish himself by passing his examination. He left the battery at the end of three years without having passed his examination as captain, whilst many men with nothing like his abilities in other respects would probably have successfully passed the examination in less time. This is what we find throughout the evidence. If we look at the evidence with respect to his services in South Africa, we find him spoken of as a very brave man, and " a great goer." Inf act, his courage has .never ! been called in question, and yet officers like Colonel Aytoun, who cannot be said to be actuated by any but the most friendly 'feelings towards him, give him unsatisfactory reports so far as his actual work is concerned. I shall have to refer later on to the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper,</inline> under whom <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> served in .North Queensland. I do not think that the Committee was justified in shutting out the documentary evidence submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper. Major Carroll</inline> was under this officer in North Queensland, and his report of him is unsatisfactory. </para>

Of course the expenses would then have had to be paid by the Department. But the Committee took up this position : They said - " You must answer these interrogatories, and make a statutory declaration." This they had no power to compel <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> to do. They further said - " If you will not do that, we will not summon you as a witness, and because you are not here to give evidence under oath, we will repudiate and take no notice of the documentary evidence supplied in the report you have already submitted." </para>

                        <para>- The Committee did not ask for a statutory declaration as to the truth of the statements, but for a statutory declaration in regard to certain questions which were to be submitted to him by the Committee at the instance of both sides. That was an administration of interrogatories, which was not in the power of the Committee ; and it was then that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> replied that he could not say anything in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> and would not voluntarily say anything against him. Why should <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> voluntarily make a statement against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> if he did did not desire to do so? </para>

                        <para>- Most certainly. In the matter of an accusation against another person, how could <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> have been protected? Evidence given on oath before a Select Committee is privileged ; but there is no such protection for a voluntary declaration. Captain Niesigh wanted to bring <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> down, but the Committee, in order to save expense, did not have him summoned, and, because he did not answer the interrogatories, the Committee have no right to ask us to ignore his report to the Commandant. The Select Committee will surely not ask the Senate to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper's</inline> report is altogether unreliable, simply because he was not called as a witness? The object is to do justice between <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> and Major-General Hutton, and how can justice be done if most important evidence is de- . liberately ignored? With regard to the statements in the letter which the Select Committee have discounted as not being borne out, I only wish to say that in my opinion those statements are substantially supported. The evidence shows that Major-General Hutton was amply justified in writing the letter of the 14th September, to the Minister of Defence. There may have been slight inaccuracies, but substantially, that letter was a correct statement of the grounds on which Major-General Hutton had taken action with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> As to the first finding of the Select Committee that the reasons given are unsound, I submit that the statements in the letter were substantially correct. The Select Committee find that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was not justly treated by the military authorities of the Commonwealth, and they recommend that he should be reinstated. The injunction of Parliament that there should be retrenchment still stands - it has not been suggested that the policy should be departed from. And, therefore, if <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> is <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be retained in the service, some other officer must be dispensed with, and the names of six have been mentioned in this connexion. There is, at all events, ample evidence to show that Major-General Hutton had grounds to justify him in deciding to retrench <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> ; and even if the Select Committee, after examining all those fifty-six witnesses, have arrived at a different opinion, what does that amount to? Suppose the Select Committee had taken evidence in regard to the qualifications of those six officers, and had come to the conclusion that one of them should be retrenched instead of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> would that have shown that Major-General Hutton did wrong, or that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was treated unjustly? I do not think so; all of us, and all institutions, are human. The Major-General was called upon to retrench and dismiss officers, and he did the best he could. He went to officers whom he could trust, and, on their opinion, decided who should be selected to go. Suppose it did happen that the -Major-General made a mistake, where is the injustice? Every officer in the service must admit that there is no infallible power to. decide as to exact qualifications. We must trust somebody, and in this case I submit it was the Major-General who should be trusted to make a selection. There is not the slightest suggestion that Major-General Hutton was actuated by any bias. This took, place in 1902, when Major-General Hutton had not met <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> and knew nothing of him. The General Officer Commanding simply went to Queensland and made inquiries without knowing anything good, bad, or indifferent of that officer, and there cannot be any possible suggestion of bias. </para>

                    <para>. - It may be convenient if I very shortly state the result of the consideration I have been able to give to the suggestions made by various honorable senators, with a view to make this Bill more effective. As I stated last evening, it will, I think, effectually carry out the purpose as it is; but I admit that, the point to which attention was then directed may well be provided for, and, therefore, with the permission of the Committee, I shall refer to the four amendments I propose to make with that object. In the first place, I think I ought to call attention to a very valuable suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> with a view to make the measure apply -to ships carrying cargo between port and port in a State. The Bill as prepared goes a little beyond what the American and New Zealand legislation embraces, by including ships carrying goods from one State to another State. My honorable friend called attention to the position of Queensland - and his remark equally applies to other States - and suggested the advisableness of inserting an amendment which would make it so applicable. That involves a very difficult question as to the Federal power to deal with shipping within a State. </para>

This question was the subject of a good deal of investigation, and argument, and final decision, with the result that it appears to be held that shipping, even from one part of a State to another, becomes national if it is carried on upon the high seas, and is under Federal control. But it is difficult to define the line between that portion of Intrastate shipping, to adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> expression, and shipping under Federal control, where they part company. And it is still more difficult to say what language one can use in order to reach the Intrastate shipping to which the provisions of a Bill of this description would apply.

                        <para>- That is a difficult point. We have commerce and the instrumentalities of commerce. These are all questions which would have to be determined by the Court, but, in my view, under the words of the clause as it stands, the control would not be limited to the cargo taken from a port in one State to a port in another State, and exclude the calling of the ship at intermediate ports, and so on, because the whole thing would be governed by the object of the voyage, which would be Inter-State. </para>

                        <para>- That is Inter-State, and under the authorities, as far as I have been able to gather, once it becomes an Inter-State voyage then the applicability of the Federal law continues, even although in the course of that InterState voyage a local traffic is carried on.

                <para>In <inline font-style="italic">Lord</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Steam-ship Company</inline> suit was brought I against the owner of a vessel engaged in trans- 1 portation from San Francisco to San Diego, to recover the value of freight lost, and it was contended that the provision of thfe Federal statutes limiting the liability of owners of vessels for loss or destruction of freight had no application to transportation between points in (the same State. It was held, however, that transportation upon the high seas was necessarily national in character, and within the. Federal control. The vessel was navigating with the vessels of other nations, and, while not trading with them, was engaged in commerce with them. If, in the course of her voyage, she inflicted a wrong upon another country, tne Federal Government would be responsible. Such navigation is clearly a matter of national concern, and subject to national control. </para>
                <para>Then the authors refer to another instance, in which there was a State regulation of rates, and the same rule was applied there. </para>
                <para>In <inline font-style="italic">Pacific Coast Steamship Company</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Board of Commissioners,</inline> the same rule was applied to State regulation of rates for transportation by sea between points in the same State. Such transportation, it. was said, is under the exclusive control of Congress. Only that transportation which is within the State during its entire voyage is subject to its regulation. </para>
                <para>Of course that is subject to modification too, because, in my opinion, it is Federal if it goes beyond what is referred to in the other passage - the three-mile limit. </para>
                <para>As the ocean is an international highway, so the navigable waters of the United States are national highways, and subject to Federal control. State regulations of domestic commerce may not, therefore, be given an operation which will embarrass the carrier in its relations to the vessels of other States, and interfere with the operation of Federal laws. </para>
                <para>Then comes the discussion of the point to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> referred. The question whether a vessel is an instrumentality of commerce under Federal control is determined by what happens at the moment she leaves the port of departure, and its subsequent movements do not lessen the obligation to be under the Federal law. </para>

                    <para>It was clear, however, that no legislative power would be adequate unless it was as extensive as the Admiralty jurisdiction given to the Courts. All jurisdiction over Admiralty cases had been taken from State Governments. The necessities of the case, therefore, required legislation by Congress, and this legislation the Courts finally supported. The Federal legislative power, the Court said, " is not confined to the boundaries or class of subjects which limit and characterize the power to regulate commerce; but, in maritime matters, it extends to all matters and places to which the maritime law extends." </para>

                <para class="block">What 1 suggest is that, as the great object of this immediate legislation is to deal with cargo carried over-sea, together with a provision with regard to carrying cargo from one State to another State, all such commerce will be brought under the operation of this law ; but for the present we had better not endeavour, by inserting any other words which may bear a doubtful constitutional construction, to enlarge the operation of the measure, as we can deal with the whole question of our powers in regard, to trade and commerce when we have the Navigation Bill before us. I propose, as I intimated last night, to make one amendment, which might effect an improvement in the Bill. I propose to insert the word "illegal" after the words "shall be" in clause 4. Two points were very strongly put - with which"", so far as the legal interpretation is concerned, I agree - by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> anci, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> Other honorable senators also referred to them. One is as to the imposition of a penalty, and the other is the point which was more especially emphasized by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> as to declaring by this Bill that the law to be applied to the construction of a contract entered into by the parties to a bill of lading is the law of the Commonwealth.

                        <para>- I may indicate how the demand for a penalty arose. It was suggested that there was a possibility of tramp ships coming to our ports, which were, not represented by any permanent agent in Australia, and that such ships might give a bill of lading containing a clause which this Bill declared to be null and void, and t'hat that might prevent the recovery of damages unless action were brought in the country to which the ship belonged. *I do not think that that is likely to happen, but it was suggested that at least there ought to be some penalty to prevent the possibility of such provisions being inserted. I fall in with that suggestion, which in some respects makes the Bill stronger. Therefore, I have framed this clause. I am content to leave the amount of the penalty to honorable senators. I think that these three amendments will make this the most effective measure which I have seen. But the amendment suggested bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> involves constitutional considerations, as it affects the relations between the Federal authorities and the States. </para>

                    <para>- There is one point upon which the Attorney-General might satisfy honorable senators concerning the legal position affecting this Bill. There are ships which trade from' Hong Kong and Eastern China to the coasts of Queensland. These are not Australian vessels, nor has the Commonwealth any control over them, except by laws such as we are endeavouring to pass. Say that a vessel comes from China or Japan with a cargo for different ports in Australia. At the same time she might carry a cargo from one port in Queensland to another. Say that she is a vessel over which we have limited jurisdiction. It is just as well that we should know how legislation of this character would affect s'uch vessels. Is it not possible, even before the Navigation Bill is passed, that on entering into the Australian trade from port to port within a State vessels of that kind would be affected by this legislation? The Attorney-General has told us that Inter-State trade would come within th-2 provisions of this Bill, but I should like also to know whether trade between different ports of a State would be affected by it. The fruit-growers in the southern portions of Queensland may send produce to the northern portion, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> Those shippers require just as much protection as do shippers who send fruit from Tasmania to Victoria. If there is no State law to protect them it is wise that our law should do so. </para>

                <para class="block">I am of the necessity for such an amendment, but he thinks that the difficulties in the way are so great that we should allow it to stand over until we can deal with the whole subject comprehensively in the Navigation Bill. It is extremely important that our Commonwealth legislation on so far-reaching a subject should be uniform. Shippers, shipowners, consignees, and every one who is interested in trade and commerce should know what their position is. It is true that each State can deal with the subject within its own borders, but it can only legislate to a limited extent, and States Acts must not come into conflict with the Federal law. Even if we had the absolute power to deal with it, the result might be that we should have six different State laws, in addition to the Federal law, and that would be exceedingly undesirable. An effort might be made to secure the passing of uniform legislation in the several States ; but we know that that would be exceedingly difficult to accomplish, because honorable senators are aware that it is almost impossible to get the different Legislatures of the States to adopt the same language in their Acts of Parliament. If it can be done at all, it should be done in this measure. In Queensland, commerce is carried on every day in the week over a coast-line extending for over 1,500 miles, and, from the point of view of that State, it is very important that there should be a uniform law relating to the sea carriage of goods, and the care which shipping companies should be compelled to take of the goods they handle. In the case of South Australia, it might be necessary to send goods from the southern part of that State to the most northern part of the Commonwealth, in the Northern Territory,,, and it would be ridiculous to say that a Federal law should not apply to trade of that sort. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it is either ; but if it is not doubted, why should we not deal with the matter in this Bill, and make it sufficiently comprehensive to apply all round? Queensland is as much interested in this Bill as any other State can possibly be, because a particular export from that State is absolutely dependent upon the care taken by shipping companies. I allude to the export of frozen meat. There is a very large export of frozen meat from Queensland, not only to the old country, but to the other States of the Commonwealth. Sometimes it is Carried from one port in the State of Queensland to another, in order to complete shipments' which may be destined for some place over sea. _ </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it would. It has been admitted by the Attorney-General, and it has been laid down by the United States Courts, that directly commerce goes outside one marine league from the shore, it comes under Federal control. Commerce may be carried on between one port and another in the same State., but if it extends to more than one league from the shore, it comes under Federal control. There are very few cases in which, in conducting the trade between port and port in the same State, vessels have not necessarily to go more than a marine league from the shore. It is, therefore,' clear that the bulk of the InterState trade must come within Federal control. It has been held by the American Courts, in interpreting a Constitution almost exactly similar to ours, that when an instrumentality of Inter-State trade engages in commerce within the limits of a State, it comes under Federal control. From what I have been able to read of American law on the subject, from books kindly lent me by the Attorney-General, I have concluded that we have even greater powers than I have suggested. In Prentice and Egan's work on the <inline font-style="italic">Commerce Clauses of the American Constitution,</inline> I find the following passage at page 86, in addition to what was quoted by the Attorney-General - </para>

                        <para>- I had intended to convince honorable senators by a quotation from this work which" I cannot find at the present moment. 1 shall, however, look it up during the discussion, and I shall be able to inform them that, although they are very dogmatic in their opinions, so far as the interpretation of authorities is concerned, they are making a mistake. It is recognised that the Attorney-General is an authority, and the honorable and learned senator admits that my reading of the law in this respect is correct - that directly an instrumentality of Inter-State trade, whether a steamer, a train, or anything else, carries goods from one point to another in the same State, it comes under Federal control, according to the reading of American Courts of a provision in the American Constitution which is exactly similar to the provision of our Constitution, under which we are now working. The Attorney-General has pointed out that there is only one word of difference between them, and that is not material. It is material only by reason of the circumstance that we are not a sovereign power in the same way as is the United States. We are dealing with other countries under the same sovereign authority as ourselves, whereas the United States is not in that position. Clause 98 of our Constitution provides - </para>

The facts being as stated, it is extremely desirable in the interests of all the States, and I am sure they would welcome it, that our law in this respect 'should be uniform.

                    <para>- I think the Attorney-General has shown wisdom in refraining from including in this Bill anything which he doubts our Constitutional power to enact. Apart from that, I believe that, while what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> suggests would avoid injustice to some shippers, it would be the means of greater injustice to others. We must recognise that there is a large traffic in small boats between port and port in each of the States, and that that traffic is carried on under conditions which make high freights almost impossible for the shippers. Those small boats carry deck cargo in what may be termed a " hand to mouth ' ' method ; and if they are brought within the scope of this Bill a great injustice will be done, which, so far as the small shippers are concerned, will more than out-weigh the advantages of the measure. Large numbers of small parcels of fruit and. other goods are brought from Warrnambool, and other places, and delivered at Melbourne and Geelong in from twelve to sixteen hours, and, under the circumstances, it would be undesirable to compel bills of lading, and all the machinery of the Bill to be brought into operation. </para>

                        <para>-I would give the small shipper all the protection which we consider equitable, but if he is to be put to expense an injustice will be done. However, I think that the Bill is a necessary one, and! that the Attorney-General has shown wisdom in avoiding anything which might be deemed unconstitutional. </para>

                    SYMON.We shall do well to confine our discussion within the limit presented by the clause as it at present stands, because we shall then be on solid ground. Seeing that the essence of the Bill is the control of the export trade, mainly from Australia, and from State to State, it would be well to avoid introducing any, proposals, the intention of which it would be difficult to express in language.

                    referred to China boats carrying cargo from one port to another in Queensland, but in my opinion this Bill would not apply in such a case. The starting point of the measure is, so to speak, the loading of produce in Australia, first, for ports beyond our border, and, secondly, for ports in another State. We shall do well to take one step at a time, and not, by endeavouring to secure too much, perhaps create confusion m the interpretation of the Bill. I, therefore, ask the honorable senators to pass clause 3 as it stands.

                    <para>- I cannot understand why the Attorney-General has any objection to the Bill being made more comprehensive. The measure was not at first introduced altogether in view of the export trade. The Attorney-General, in making his second-reading speech, intimated that it was introduced more on behalf of the shippers of small consignments than on behalf of those sending large consignments, who could probably get better terms than the former. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill will apply to men who ship large quantities of fruit from Victoria to New South Wales, where the passage is only a couple of days, and also to shippers from Tasmania to Sydney or Brisbane, where the passage may be five days; but it will not apply to shippers of perishable products at Brisbane for the northern parts of the continent - products which cannot reach their destination in less than three weeks. .The greater part of the fruit supplied to Northern Queensland has in a great many cases first to be sent from Tasmania to Brisbane, and then shipped in boats, some of which are, and some of which are not, Inter-State, for all the ports in the north, such as Rockhampton, Port Mackay r Townsville, Cooktown, Thursday Island,, and Normanton, a distance of over 2,000- miles, and in a much warmer climate tha ) is experienced in the southern parts of the continent. Shippers to those northern ports should have protection just as much as shippers from New South Wales to Queensland, who do not run nearly so much risk from carelessness from stowage and from pilfering. The vessels to the far north have to call at five or six ports, and that gives greater facilities for neglect and for ullage, and there is,, as I have said, the greater dis: advantage of a much warmer climate, calling for greater care in every direction. Then, again, large quantities of tropical fruit are brought from the northern parts of Queensland to the southern States of the continent, and most of this is carried on Inter-State boats. Those shipments are first of all carried along the northern rivers to, say, Townsville, where it has to be transhipped; and it is here that the Bill would give a considerable amount of protection, were it extended to the carriage of perishable products within a State. The Bill provides that such products shall not only be well stowed, but must be carefully handled ; and it is in the handling that a great deal of fruit goes adrift. If the Attorney-General had seen some of the shipments of fruit from the north some time ago, he would not have wondered at much of it going bad, or that those engaged in the industry get practically no return, because of the carelessness in the handling, especially in transhipments. </para>

                        <para>- If it is competent for this Parliament to insert an exactly similar clause in the Navigation Bill, surely we ought to give protection to men who ship perishable products from port to port in a State, especially when there is a long coast-line like that of Queensland. I hope the Attorney-General will agree to some amendment which will extend the Bill to people engaged in shipping coastwise in the various States. I know that Queensland would reap as much benefit from such an amendment as it would from a law of the kind applying to exports beyond the States. </para>

                    <para>- I join in urging the Attorney-General to extend the operation of the Bill, if possible, in the way suggested. The .north-west portion of Western Australia is entirely dependent on the eastern States for the supply of fruit, which is first taken to Fremantle and then transhipped into small boats, which do purely a State trade. Under the Bill as it stands, the shipper at Fremantle would have his remedy, but the shipper at Geraldton would have no protection. The latter would be compelled, as he is now, to contract himself out of the law. </para>

                        <para>- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> proposes to legislate for the Commonwealth. But even in New South Wales there is a strong opinion that it would be unwise to make the amendment. That State is represented by a considerable number of members in another place, and supposing that they hold the same views as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> on this point, it is quite obvious that the Bill could not be passed this session, and that, therefore, we should lose the very large amount of good which it would do in a vain attempt to extend its operations. Some honorable senators have spoken as if this Bill would inflict hardships. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens'</inline> suggestion were not adopted, existing hardships would be continued for a little while, It would not create any new hardships, but it would make things a little better over a very large area. </para>

                        <para>- In view of that fact the Attorney-General has taken a proper stand in urging that the Bill should contain as little contentious matter as possible. It is extremely important that it should become law this year, and as 'early as possible, because we are very rapidly approaching the season when large quantities of fruit will be exported. The immediate cause of" the Bill is a protest from fruit exporters. I attended the deputation which waited upon the Prime Minister, and I congratulate the Government upon the promptitude with which they have dealt with this matter. It is only a few days since it was prominently brought under their notice by the deputation, and, considering all the circumstances, this Bill is extremely comprehensive, although not so comprehensive as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> and I should like. There is a doubt as to the wisdom of putting in the amendment. I do not know how far it extends, but if it extends to any considerable number it would cause delay, and thereby frustrate the passage of the Bill this year. I ask honorable senators not to persist in this endeavour to make the Bill more comprehensive, particularly as we must have within a few months a Bill to deal with the whole question of navigation, when, of course, however much time it might take, we must endeavour to cover the- whole area. </para>

                    <para>- When I rose with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> it was with the object of emphasizing the point which he has so well and ably put. The Bill complies strictly with the request of those who felt that they were suffering a serious disadvantage; indeed, it goes a little beyond what they asked, and in a very proper direction, too. The deputation which waited upon the Prime Minister had in view, mainly, if not completely, over-sea traffic. </para>

                        <para>- Take the shipping within the limits of Victoria. If our coastal trade were regulated as desired by honorable senators, the probability is that it might result in a serious increase of the freights. Take, for instance, the trade between Melbourne and Geelong, where the ships have to compete with the railways. This amendment if made might result in serious disadvantage to the producers of that district. I wish to get some information from the producers as to the effect of this legislation upon Intra-State trade. Having got that information, the probabilities are that special legislation will be required. I admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> have made out a splendid case_, so far as Queensland is concerned, but our great difficulty is that by reason of the enormous difference in area between the several States, it is difficult to make the same rule apply both to Queensland and Victoria. Perhaps what would be an advantage, so far as Queensland is concerned, would be a great disadvantage in the case of Victoria. As the Attorney-General has expressed himself in favour of dealing with the matter in the Navigation Bill, perhaps they will accept his promise. In the meantime, we shall be able to get further information. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to labour the point. I am satisfied that much has been done by the discussion to call attention to the matter. My object was to secure an absolutely uniform method for all the States. It is extremely unlikely that the States themselves can be induced to legislate in exactly the same manner, and, therefore, I thought it was highly desirable to have a uniform law as regards commerce beyond the seas. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> think that my proposal would have the effect of raising freights, and would, therefore, do more injury to shippers than would be the case if they were left outside the scope of the Bill. If that is a good argument, it is good against the whole Bill. As a matter of fact, the President of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures has actually predicted that result. </para>

It must be remembered that the voyage, say, from Brisbane to Normanton, in Queensland, is longer than the voyage from Melbourne to Sydney, which traverses three States. Surely those who ship produce between ports in the State of Queensland should have the same protection as those who ship produce from Melbourne to Brisbane. I have no desire to delay the passing of this Bill, and suppose that for the present I must rest satisfied with the assurance of the Attorney-General that the whole matter will receive consideration in connexion with the Navigation Bill. </para>

I have the fullest sympathy with the object he has in view. But the difficulty is that while I am: perfectly satisfied that this Bill, as it stands, will not produce any constitutional conflict - I cannot conceive it possible that any constitutional question could arise as to the applicability of clause 3 - a grave difficulty might arise if we endeavoured to extend it. It might immediately raise a conflict between State and Federal jurisdiction. If that were so, a small shipper on the coast might have to accept a bill of lading which contained provisions involving a constitutional fight between himself and the shipping company. I should be very sorry to induce honorable senators to believe that there was any likelihood of a situation of that kind being avoided if the amendment suggested were carried. It is from that point of view, and through my desire to keep this Bill, which is urgent, as free as possible from constitutional difficulties, that I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has done well in agreeing to accept the clause as it stands. </para>

                    were not altogether fair, if they meant that we were endeavouring to get this Bill so far extended that we should probably endanger its passage. We have no wish to do that.

We w'ish the same protection to be given to them as is to be given to shippers who may ship perishable products on Inter-State boats.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    speaks of boats trading between Melbourne and Geelong. This Bill refers principally to perishable products. There is no shipper of perishable products who does not want to get the best price possible for his goods. Every shipper knows that the wav to get the highest price is to land his goods in the best condition. An increase of price in that respect would mean fa.r more to the shipper than a slight increase of freights, even if they were raised in consequence of the passing of this Bill.

                        <para>- That fact is not to the discredit, but rather to the credit, of the Government. At the same time, it must not be forgotten that the ship-owners of Australia practically know nothing about the Bill. Between the present time and1 its consideration in another Chamber, they may have opportunities to study some of its details. I am sure that the Senate desires to do only what is fair and just. I am sure that it is not desired to place the ship-owners of Australia in a position which would be insufferable, but I make these remarks simply in order that this clause may not pass without comment, "and the presumption follow that no possible objection could be urged against it. </para>

As we are passing a law to deal with a new state of affairs, and as I think there is no case which has dealt with neglect on the part of a ship-owner with regard to refrigerating and cool chambers, it would be better in this clause to go a little more into detail. Would it not strengthen the clause, if, for instance, after! the word " hold " we inserted the words " and refrigerating and cool chambers therein." </para>

                        <para>- It is a very modern part of the ship, and is set apart for experimental purposes. A shipper told me only to-day that the fruit export trade is even now only in the experimental stage, and there is a difference of opinion as to the temperature in which fruit should be kept. I am doubtful whether this clause will cover refrigerating and cool chambers. I am afraid that it would be possible for ship-owners to make contracts in such a way as to lessen, weaken, or avoid their liability in respect of the carriage of goods in refrigerating and cool chambers. In the event of any difficulty, the Court would have to consider what are the liabilities of ship-owners with regard to these experimental and scientific chambers. I am not aware that any question in connexion with them has yet been raised, and the Court would have to take a stand', for itself, and lay down its own policy in the interpretation of the Act. </para>

I am satisfied that the words " ship's hold, and other parts of a ship in which goods are carried," will include every part of a ship, whether a refrigerating chamber or not, in which goods are carried, but I feel that the whole of the difficulty is not yet met. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> was right in pointing out that in this Bill we have set ourselves deliberately to cover the case of fruit and other produce which is to be stored in cool chambers. We all know that it is essential to the proper carriage of this class of produce, not merely that great care and diligence should be exercised, but that a considerable amount of expert skill should be applied by some one on board the ship in order to secure an even temperature in the refrigerating chamber, and such a temperature as shall be scientifically ascertained to be the best for the preservation of the goods on the voyage. </para>

                        <para>- It would be all right if we could take that short cut, but the question is a more difficult one. We cannot in this Bill say that a ship-owner shall take care to preserve the temperature in his refrigerating chamber at 32 degrees. In my opinion, it is not sufficient - to say that all parts of a ship in which goods are carried shall be kept " fit and safe for their reception, carriage, and preservation." These are the words which, to my mind, govern the clause, and if any honorable senator will analyze what is meant by them he will see that they are not sufficient. I am not prepared at the present moment to suggest. the words which are necessary, but I feel that if the clause is passed in its present form we shall be leaving something to be desired. The special care required in connexion with a refrigerating chamber must be expert in its character, and I think it would be perfectly easy for a ship-master to plead that he had kept his hold and refrigerating chamber "fit and safe." There is not much force in these words, nor do the words " reception, carriage, and preservation " supply all the deficiency. Some stress has been laid on the word "preservation," but it does not cover all that is required. I should be sorry if the clause is passed in its present form, because, while I believe it aims at what we all desire, I am afraid that without some necessary verbal alteration it will faiL </para>

Australia is rather a big place, and it will be weeks before new bills of lading can be prepared, and orders sent from the great shipping centres to the outlying parts. Some time ought to be allowed to ship-owners to make preparations to comply with the Bill, and surely there is some common sense. even in the Senate, in regard to matters of this kind. When we take into account the distance between place and place, it will be found that the fixing of the 15th February leaves very little margin in time. There are the Christmas and New Year holidays, and, considering all the circumstances, I do not think the period should be shorter. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - I am sorry I cannot see my way to reduce the period I have proposed. I think honorable, senators are not dealing fairly with the ship-owners, seeing that the Bill is one of the most drastic ever passed in Australia. It is absolutely necessary that a fair and reasonable amount of time should be allowed. I think that the 15th February is the earliest date on which the Bill ought to be brought into operation. I am not sure that a later date ought not to be chosen. If honorable senators, . instead of saying that they prefer some other date, would explain to me how all this_ work could be done before the 15th February, I should 'be pleased.

Surely they ought to be treated with a little regard for the exigencies of business. Honorable senators are carried away by their desire to bring the Bill into force, to such an extent, that they lose sight of geography and everything else. Time and space are as nothing to them, but still they exist. I ask honorable senators to be reasonable in this matter. </para>

                    <para>- I am opposed to the exemption of ship-owners from their legal obligations for any longer time than is absolutely necessary. The suggestion of the Attorney-General to accept the 1 st January as the date is an eminently reasonable one. In this Bill we recognise the fact that the ship-owners have been treating the public unfairly for a very long time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> proposes that we should allow the ship-owners an extended time iri which to continue that unfair treatment of their customers. Practically, the. ship-owners have been cheating the shippers by being allowed to contract themselves out of their common law obligations, and now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> proposes that that privilege should be continued to them. It is a monstrous thing that when a Bill is introduced to remove a gross injustice on the part of ship-owners, a proposal should be made to give them a further exemption from the common law which every one else has to obey. In fact, I am surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has not suggested that some compensation should be given to the ship-owners for depriving them of the right to continue to cheat the public. </para>

                    <para>- I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> to agree to the Bill coming into force on the 1 5th January. I agree with his view, and shall vote with him if he calls for a division. It' must be remembered that this is the most drastic measure which has been passed' by this Parliament. It will become absolutely necessary for the ship-owners to thoughtfully consider the best manner in which they can carry out practically its provisions. We are legislating not for a year, but for many years, and we shall act very unwisely if we rush this Bill through the Parliament and ask the ship-owners to conform to its provisions before they have had time to turn round and think about the bills of lading which they will require to use. I am as much in sympathy with the objects of the Bill as is any honorable senator. The firms with which I have been connected have felt the ill effects of the present system, and the want of such legislation. But I think it would be wrong to legislate in such a manner as to cause serious inconvenience to shipping companies. I would therefore ask the Committee to compromise as to the date. I understand that if its coming into operation were delayed until the 15th January, it would give ample notice to the shippers of fruit. </para>

                    <para>- There would be much force in the arguments of Senators Pulsford and Gray if this discussion were being conducted in secret, and if the communications between the persons interested in the export of produce and the Prime Minister had taken place in secret. This subject has agitated the minds of those who are interested in shipping produce for some considerable time, and the shipping companies,, if they are alive to their own interests, must be aware that for a considerable time there has been an agitation afoot for legislation of this character. They must know that the Prime Minister was waited upon, and promised to bring in a measure, that it is being discussed in the Senate, that it will pass to the other Chamber, and probably receive its assent and become law. Many bodies throughout the Commonwealth have dealt with the subject. The argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> would be correct if it could be assumed that the shipping companies would know nothing of the existence of this measure until it reached the statute-book. But they know what has been going on, and ought to be prepared to conform to the new conditions. It is argued that it will be necessary to print new bills of lading. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> must know that it will not be necessary to do so, even if the companies are taken by surprise, or receive only twenty-four hours' notice that the. law of the Commonwealth had been altered? He has, no doubt, seen, as I have seen, on the back of ordinary passenger tickets, certain clauses with regard to- quarantine struck out or altered before the companies had had time to issue new tickets. It would only be necessary for the companies to strike out of the bill of lading the clause by which hitherto they have exempted themselves from the ordinary common law responsibility attaching to carriers. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and their present ones could be easily altered for the time being. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has mentioned the 15th February as a very convenient date on which to bring the Bill into operation. He said he was assured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> that the fruit exporting season :'n Tasmania would not start until the 20th February. But surely Senators Pulsford and Gray do not for a moment think that the fruit exporters come to the vessels at Hobart, and commence to negotiate with the shipping companies there and then. They have to go weeks and months beforehand to the companies to secure space. They enter into a contract to secure space by a certain vessel leaving Hobart on a certain date, and arriving in London at a certain time. A contract, if entered into before the Act came into operation, might be so construed as to debar the shipper from getting the benefit of these provisions. It is not for us to wait until the very moment when the fruit is being exported, and then to say that the Act shall come into operation. Any shipment after the 20th February would be subject to a contract entered into early in January, if not in December. It is necessary and desirable, in the interests of those exporting produce, that we should have this legislation as soon as possible. There is not a shipping company that is interested in shipping produce, which will not know tomorrow, or, at any rate, before the end of the week- in the remotest part of the Commonwealth - that the Senate has decided that this measure shall come into operation on the 1 st. January next, and that it will be necessary for the House of Representatives to give its. assent to the Bill, and on that date they will be quite prepared to conform to the new conditions. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has pointed out, the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> proves too much, because, if the Bill is good at all, the shipowners must have been enjoying an advantage to which, in the opinion of the community generally, they were not entitled. Yet the honorable senator would perpetuate their enjoyment of that advantage to the great detriment of the producing interests of the Commonwealth. I hope that, in the interests of those who will be shipping produce during the coming season, and who will have to take the earliest possible opportunity to secure space, the Bill will become law as early as possible. I hope, too, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> will see that the sense of the Committee is against him, and that the 1st 'of January is a date on which the Bill can come into operation with justice to both the shippers and the shipowners. </para>

                        <para>- Just so. There is no doubt that this Bill is brought in primarily to deal with the export of fruit oversea. Everybody who knows anything about the companies which have been carrying fruit, especially during the last two or three years, knows very well that not one of them has made a penny. Under these circumstances, when these foreign-going companies have not made any money, in spite of all their care, their clauses and covenants, honorable senators might be a little more guarded in their expressions with regard to them. If I felt that it was reasonably possible for the necessary arrangements to be made at an earlier date than the 15th February, I should not "hesitate for a moment to accept a much earlier date. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has told us how many hours it takes to print bills of lading. We all know that when an order is given, a printer can turn out a large number in the course of a day, and we did not need to be told that he could. These papers have to be sent from Melbourne and Sydney to the remote parts of Australia, and they may take three or four weeks. Instructions have also to be sent. The , Christmas and New Year's holidays will intervene while the new arrangements are being made. As a commercial man, I say that the 15th February is the earliest date at which this Bill can reasonably be brought into operation. </para>

                    seems to think that the, Tasmanian apple-growers are the only producers who have to be considered. But immediately we shall have the growers £&gt;f apricots, peaches, and other fruit exporting their products from one State to another. What does
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline>
                    wish to protect the ship-owners against? This Bill requires them to do nothing but what they should always have done. It merely says that they shall exercise ordinary care in regard to the carriage of goods. It is ridiculous that any honorable senator should, in the name of commerce, seek to extend the time after which people shall commence to do what they ought always to have done. The Bill is designed to protect shippers against the carelessness and negligence of ship-owners and shipping agents, who take charge of their goods. The bills of lading can be altered in two minutes. The companies are only required to take the usual care which commercial men ought always to take of the goods intrusted to them by other commercial men.

                    (Tasmania).- I have' not been convinced by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline>
                    who, I think, misunderstands the whole scope of this measure. I quite admit that fruit is taken from other States than Tasmania. Butter and meat are also taken: But, as a matter of fact, the Bill will hit' the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Companies more severely than any others. Surely the agents for those companies ought to have time to communicate with their head offices. They cannot send this Bill to England before Wednesday next. They require to ask for instructions.

                        <para>- There is such a thing as justice, and the Attorney-General knows far better than I do that there is no question about which the law is so emphatic as the question of notice. We have no business to pass a Bill altering the whole of the conditions which previously existed, without giving the parties ample notice. I desire that the companies shall have till the 14th January, instead of to the 1 st January. That is reasonable enough. I do not like the idea of extending the date until 15th February, as, if the agents write to England on Wednesday next, they will be able to receive instructions by cable before the 14th January. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>
                    has spoken of the shipping companies, to which we in the Commonwealth of Australia owe a debt of thanks. Those companies have had the pluck to spend millions of money in order to bridge over the distance between Australia and the -old country. It has been no light business for them to adapt themselves to modern needs, and to expend a large amount of money on what was to a considerable extent an experiment. We should, at all events, recognise that if the bills of lading of the companies have not Hitherto been all we desire, the fault has not been theirs, but that of the Legislatures of the States. The shipping companies are not philanthropists, 5ut business concerns, carried on in a business manner, and it is not fair for us to impose this new condition without giving them sufficient time in which to adapt their arrangements to the new requirements.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>
                    spoke of the companies as though they were a set of pirates, who have taken advantage of the people of Australia. As a matter of fact, one of the large companies has not paid a dividend for eight years, and the last dividend it paid was only a small one. If we have to place this new obligation upon them we should do so with a knowledge that in the past they have served us well, and should not treat them as individuals to whom no reasonable time should be given to adjust themselves to new circumstances and conditions. I protest against it. The Attorney-General entirely misunderstands the position of the agents of the large snipping companies. It is absolutely certain that they will have to communicate with their boards of directors for instructions to enable them to do what is necessary in order faithfully to carry out the obligations of this measure. We ought to consider that we are legislating for years to come, and that a few days extra to give the companies time to communicate with their principals would be fair and equitable treatment.
