                        <para>- I wish to point out, in reference to notices of motion, Nos. 3 and 4, standing in the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline> Neild, that they are not altogether in order. It will be observed in the first place that two matters which have no relation to each other are mixed up in notice of motion, No. 3. The Senate is asked to affirm that the conduct of Major-General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir E.</inline> T. H. Hutton towards <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline> Neild, is a contempt of this Senate. That is a proposition which stands by itself, but in the same notice of motion the honorable senator also wishes the Senate to affirm that all evidence received by Select Committees on privileges, should in future be taken on oath or affirmation. That is a general proposition which has nothing to do with the conduct of the General Officer Commanding, and a notice of motion, embracing two matters, which have no relation to each other, is not in order. For that reason alone I should decide that I ought not to put section No. 2 of notice of motion No. 3, but there is another reason why it ought not to be put. The Senate has already affirmed the proposition in question by carrying the second reading of a Bill providing that Select Committees may take evidence on oath. Standing order No. 126 provides that where the Senate has resolved any proposition, either in the affirmative or the negative, that proposition shall not be again debated. There is, therefore, no necessity for the honorable senator to ask the Senate to affirm a proposition which has already been affirmed. But there is yet another point, namely, that the two notices of motion seem to cover the same ground. I think they are an infringement of the rule that the same question shall not be twice debated. In notice of motion No. 3 the honorable senator asks the Senate to affirm that <inline font-weight="bold">Major- General</inline> Hutton -  has been guilty of a breach of the privileges of this Senate, and has committed a contempt of Parliament -  in consequence of his recommending -  that Lt.-Col. Neild be placed upon the retired list of the Military Forces of the Commonwealth, partly in consequence of speeches delivered by him in this Senate ; and (2) attempted to interfere with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> in the discharge of his duties as a senator. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>That is a general proposition. The Senate is invited to review the whole of the proceedings of the Committee, and the matters into which it inquired, and to affirm the proposition that the General Officer Commanding has been guilty of contempt. I have not seen the evidence in print, but I think I am right in presuming that the letter of 3rd March, 1904, to which reference is made in notice of motion No. 4 forms part of the evidence taken before that Committee. Therefore, if Ave discussed these two matters, we should, first of all, discuss the general proposition of which the letter of 3rd March, 1904, forms a part. </para>

I wish to say at the present stage that, as the printing of the evidence of the Select Committee is not yet complete, I am not in. a position to proceed to-day with either of these notices of motion, whether they be in order or out of order. I desire, therefore, that they shall&#39; be postponed. I think that you will not strain your authority so far as to rule out of order a motion to postpone a motion in advance of any statement of facts. I do not dispute the accuracy of your judgment if it be applied, if you will permit me with great respect to say so, at the proper time. </para>

They spared no pains ; they heard some fifty-six witnesses in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. The witnesses were not, as is very often the case in inquiries by Select Committees, allowed to give their evidence without being sworn, and in my opinion the evidence and the demeanour of witnesses are certainly much more satisfactory when the oath is administered. <inline font-weight="bold">Major J.</inline> W. M. Carroll was retired on the 31st December, 1902, having received prior notice to that effect from the General Officer Commanding. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, who was then Minister of Defence, wrote to Major-General Hutton, on the 1 2 th November, 1902, asking him to look into the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> As honorable senators will see at page 15 of the minutes of evidence, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest wrote - </para>

                        <para>It is not fair that the career of a man should be ruined by the official opinion of any one, and it is easy for a Commandant to say that this man or that is not much good, when perhaps he is little good himself. Great care is necessary in retrenching to act justly, and I am fearful in some cases we may not do so. I feel sure these are your feelings also. Please, therefore, let me have good grounds for my actions in Carroll&#39;s and all other similar cases. </para>

Members of another place appear to have pressed for an inquiry, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest wrote again to Major-General Hutton on the 3rd July, 1903, some eight months after his first letter, and inclosed a <inline font-style="italic">precis</inline> of the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.

                        <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> is still in the prime of life, ;T cannot understand how he was recommended for retrenchment, when officers of less service, and no more experience, were retained. I must, therefore, have good reasons for such exceptional treatment, because, so far as I can see at present, he does not appear to have received either consideration or justice. The whole question will probably be brought before Parliament, and, if it is, I feel certain a Select Committee will be appointed to investigate the matter; and unless I receive reports that will satisfy me, I shall have to appoint a Commission to inquire into the whole case, and thus anticipate Parliamentary action. </para>

                        <para>You will observe that by your letter of 15th November, this officer has clearly made three misstatements. ... I should be sorry to impute any wilful intention on his part to state what was not true, but his conduct in this respect confirms the impression which I held, and which is similarly held by Brigadier-General Finn and by Lt.-Col. Neild, that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> has shown unmistakable signs of eccentricity, which may or may not have been caused by his recent services in South Africa, but which, in any case, show that his qualities as an officer are such as to render it undesirable that he should be retained in the service, especially at an exceptional period, when only those officers are retained who are likely to be of great value to the Military Forces of the Commonwealth. </para>

Major-General Hutton repeated most of the statements as to the reasons and grounds, as may be seen from his letter of 14th September, 1903. In that letter he invited the then Minister of Defence to place the facts before the member of the House of Representatives who had the case in hand. A few days afterwards there was another change of Government, when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton resigned and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> became Prime Minister, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Austin</inline> Chapman as Minister of Defence. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman</inline> also went into the case, and. after careful consideration, he came to the conclusion that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> rendered good service in South Africa, and that he was a good and zealous officer on whose character no imputation of any kind rested. </para>

Honorable senators will recollect that it was shortly after the Watson Ministry took office that the motion was submitted in this Chamber for the appointment of a Select Committee. As I have already stated, the contents of Major-General Hutton&#39;s letter of the 14th November, 1902, have been alphabetized for convenience from A to N, and other statements made in subsequent letters have also been alphabetized from N to S. The first statement in the letter is, as marked by the Committee : - </para>

                            <para>- But are those traits qualifications in which an officer can improve himself by more attention to and study of his profession? A man&#39;s judgment is something which to a large extent he&#39; inherits. Tact is also something which comes to a man from his natural disposition. I do not feel disposed to say that the report as a whole was unsatisfactory to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> because Brigadier-General Finn states that his general proficiency was good, and his general ability was good. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> while in New South Wales was Instructional Officer to the 7th Regiment New South Wales Rifles English Rifles, and the 8th Regiment New South Wales Irish Rifles. Only one officer of those two regiments came before the Committee and said that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> services in New South Wales were not satisfactory. That was Captain Kirkland of the 7th Regiment. <inline font-weight="bold">Major R.</inline> B. Cropley, and Lieutenants Davis and Parker gave evidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> favour. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Cropley</inline> under examination said that from what he had observed, he had every confidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> and looked upon him as a good man and a good officer. Lieutenants Davis and Parker gave evidence to the same effect, as honorable senators will see at page <inline font-style="italic">20</inline> of the &#39;report, or at questions 3768, 3520, and 3875 of the evidence. The evidence of the officers of the 8th Regiment, commanded by Lt -Col. J. P. H. Murray, a gentleman who has lately been appointed to the chief judicial position in New Guinea, was very much in <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> favour. Lt.-Col. Murray spoke most highly of him. He said that he had observed <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> on many occasions giving instructions; that he appeared to have a very good knowledge of infantry drill, &#39;&#163;0 be a very good instructor, and to have the gift of imparting instruction to the men. That evidence will be found in answer to question 2163. He also said that he was very sorry to lose <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> as instructor of the regiment. <inline font-weight="bold">Major F.</inline> B. Freehill, who was officer commanding the 8th Regiment in the absence of Lt.-Col. Murray, in answer to question 3304, said that he regarded <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> as a very capable officer. Captain H. D. L. Wood and Captain J. P. L. McCall also gave evidence to the same effect. The </para>

                    <para class="block">Committee had to place the evidence of four officers of the 8th Regiment, and of the three officers of the 7th Regiment, who have been mentioned alongside the evidence of Captain Kirkland of the 7th Regiment, who said that as far as drill was concerned, he thought <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> services were not to the advantage of the regiment, that he could not say that he had confidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> that the orders that he gave were generally wrong ; they were unnecessary, and they were not correct. That evidence will be found in answer to questions 2639, 2696, and 2707. As honorable senators will see, the evidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> favour was overwhelming, and the Committee could come to no other conclusion than that his services while in New South Wales as Instructional Officer to the 7th and 8th Regiments were satisfactory. Statement D in Major-General Hutton&#39;s letter of the 14th November was to the effect that Lt.-Col. Neild, who was <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> immediate commanding officer in the 7 th Regiment, made a special point of coming to Major-General Hutton in <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> regard. </para>

                    <para>There is a qualification in that statement. It would appear that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> joined as a probationer, was found unsatisfactory, and! that his services were dispensed with. Now, not a single witness - and this was a very important part of the Committee&#39;s inquiry - who knew <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> during the period 1888 to 1891 came forward and stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> services were unsatisfactory. Some witnesses came forward and said that other men had told them that his services were unsatisfactory. But evidence of that kind is never accepted in any court, and the Committee did not see their way to accept it. Colonel Plomer, who was Acting Commandant of Queensland, and who was evidently regarded as a most important witness, as he came to Melbourne to give evidence on Major-General Hutton&#39;s behalf, said in reply to a question, &#34; I have had very little dealings with him <inline font-weight="bold">(Major Carroll)</inline> personally.&#34; He was asked (Question 1566) &#34; Did you ever have occasion to find fault with. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll?&#34; Colonel Plomer</inline> said. &#34;Not myself.&#34; He was asked whether he had ever had an opportunity to observing <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> qualification as a military officer, and he replied &#34; that he had formed his opinion from the statements of other officers.&#34; Question 1652 reads as follows : - </para>

                        <para>But you cannot, from your own personal knowledge, give us an opinion with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> military capacity as an officer? - Not as observed personally myself. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>This officer was under examination by the Committee for several hours. He said that he had searched the record&#39;s in Queens land concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> and that he found that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was absent from parade on the Thursday prior to the 16th November, 1899; that there was a deficiency in his mess accounts in 1890 ; that he was absent from parade at 6.30 a.m. on 3rd January, 1890; and that he did not return <inline font-weight="bold">Major Grieve&#39;s</inline> salute on the 16th November, 1894. There is no doubt that three of these alleged offences might be considered as trivial in the case of so young an officer as <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> then was. The alleged offence which appeared to me at the time to be most serious was that there was a deficiency in <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> mess accounts, but Colonel Plomer pointed&#39; out that there was no desire to suggest dishonesty on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> in regard to this deficiency. Honorable senators will observe that this was one of the records which induced  Colonel Plomer  to give his opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> services from 1888 to 1 891 were satisfactory. There was a deficiency of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;18</inline> in his wine account.- I must say that when I first heard of this I thought that it looked rather bad for <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> It looked rather the worse for him, because Colonel Plomer said that he did not suggest dishonesty, and he also said that amongst the officers in Queensland^ <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> had always been nicely spoken of in his personal capacity.

                    <para class="block">No questions were put to this officer by the representatives of the General Officer Commanding, and there was absolutely no attempt to shake his evidence. In reading over the evidence taken at Brisbane on my return to Melbourne, it occurred to me that if Lt.-Col. Adams had held an inquiry some record of it should be obtainable. I therefore caused a letter to be sent to the Defence Department, asking to be supplied with the report of that Committee. Will honorable senators believe that, although the Defence Department had repeatedly told us that all the papers concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> were before us, the entry concerning the result of this inquiry was .not submitted to us? That entry goes to show that the Committee decided to write off <inline font-style="italic">?10</inline> of the deficiency, and that it did not censure <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> but actually appointed him secretary of the new Mess Committee. I cannA understand Colonel Plomer&#39;s action in this matter. He went through the records, and discovered a deficiency in <inline font-weight="bold">Major Car.mi&#39;s</inline> accounts, but he did not bring thi* finding of the Committee before us. lie did not tell us as a set-off against this deficiency that <inline font-style="italic">?10</inline> had been written off - probably for the reason suggested by one of the Committee - not did he tell us as a set-off against the statement that the man&#39;s services were unsatisfactory, that he had been appointed secretary to the new Mess Committee.

                            <para>- The honorable and learned senator will find a reference to the matter at page 269, and the letter is given as Appendix B3. In an advertisement in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> of that date it was stated that the appointment was to take effect from 24th November, 1888. Colonel Plomer also told the then Commandant of the Queensland Defence Force, Colonel Price, that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> had never passed as a captain in the Artillery. The evidence shows that, as a matter of fact, he was appointed on 17th February, 1898, according to the seniority roll, and that  Colonel Plomer  was aware of that fact. As  president  of the Board appointed to destroy certain letters,  Colonel Plomer  destroyed a communication from the Under-Secretary of Queensland stating that  Lt.  Carroll was to be appointed captain. Evidence as to this will be found on pages 29 and 30 of the report.  Colonel Plomer  stated that he destroyed this letter because it appeared to him to be an absolutely superfluous document, in view of the notice which appeared in the Queensland <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> of 26th February, 1898, Vol. <inline font-style="italic">69,</inline> No. 53. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that there is. It may be that in some cases an officer receives promotion without passing an examination, for certain special and valuable services; but whatever view we may take of Lt. Carroll&#39;s promotion to the rank of captain, the fact that he was so promoted must be recognised as evidence that his services were not unsatisfactory.

                            <para>-Question 2324. It may be convenient at this stage to draw attention to a very singular feature of the case. When Major Carroll was retrenched he wrote to the Department, asking for the records of his career, and was informed in reply that some of his records had been destroyed. It was stated that while some of the records had been destroyed, others which were considered to be superfluous had not been preserved. I would draw the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">precis</inline> of the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> in which it is shown that after the Department of Defence had stated that certain correspondence relating to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> could not be found, a further request was made to them, with the result that they discovered certain letters. They were then asked to make another search. They did so, and found more correspondence. The Committee had occasion to ask that certain papers be furnished, and was informed in reply that it was already in possession of all the papers relating to the case. But honorable senators will be surprised to learn that, after the Department of Defence had stated in black and white that there was no evidence that it had received certificates showing that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> had performed certain services in England, the Committee, while in Brisbane, discovered the Queensland seniority roll. That roll is referred to in Lt.-Col. Lyster&#39;s evidence at question. 5913, and it appears that it had been in the possession of those very men who were instructed to inquire into <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> case, and find out his record. </para>

Can you tell the Committee how Captain Forsyth came to write in this volume the entry beginning - &#34; This officer was placed on the Retired List?&#34; - Probably by my direction, because this book was under my control. 5910. If you told Captain Forsyth to write the entry - &#34; He attended several courses of instruction from time to time and obtained certificates,&#34; from what source would you get that information ? - It must have been from information supplied to the Commandant. </para>

But the Committee had to consider that while <inline font-weight="bold">Major Deacon</inline> found <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> perfectly &#34; useless &#34; as an officer, he allowed <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> to hold most important positions&#39;. He allowed <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> to take charge of the advance guard, and to go on outpost duty. He also recommended <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> as provost marshal, to Colonel Gallway. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Deacon</inline> suggests that he gave <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> those appointments in order to get rid of him ; but there was the striking fact that he allowed <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> to be in charge of the advance guard, that is, the screen which is expected at any time to come in contact with the enemy. Against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Deacon&#39;s</inline> evidence, we have .that of Lt.-Col. Spencer Browne, which commences at question 5229. Lt.-Col. Browne, Captain Parker, Captain J. W. &#34;Berry, and Captain Gehrman say that so far as they know, and they had opportunities to judge, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> services in South Africa were not unsatisfactory. The next statement is- </para>

                        <para>This is not a fair statement of the facts. When <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> returned from South Africa bes rejoined his regiment, the Fourth Queensland Imperial Bushmen (Q. 36), and was appointed squadron leader by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Deacon</inline> (Qs. 685 and 689). He was appointed as provost marshal under  Col. Gallway  (Qs. 515 and 516), and while in that latter position he met with an accident, and he went into hospital two days before the contingent left for Queensland - (Q. 36) - on leaving the hospital he was attached to the Royal Field Artillery (20th Battery, R.F.A.); he commanded the Twentieth Battery R.F.A. during that period of1901 when <inline font-weight="bold">Major King</inline> was in command of the column. (See appendix <inline font-style="italic">B,</inline> No. 3) </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Whilst attached to the Twentieth Battery, R.F.A. , Captain Carroll was promoted to the rank of <inline font-weight="bold">Major by</inline> Lord Kitchener. There is some confusion as to this promotion. It is claimed that officers who remained in South Africa received promotion because they were willing to extend their services, and not because of any particular capacity as military men. But, if <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was so useless and unsatisfactory as was stated, he would not have been attached to the Twentieth Battery of the Royal Field Artillery. Honorable senators will remember that at that time, 1901, officers in command had had considerable experience of the men under them, and were not likely, two years after the war had commenced, to attach a &#34;duffer&#34; to the Twentieth Battery. The next is - </para>
                    <para class="block">Statement J. - Captain Carroll is unmarried. </para>
                    <para>On this, the Committee came to the conclusion that in the event of enforced retrenchment, it was fair to retrench unmarried men, providing the married officers were equal in ability and experience, and also that no unmarried officers of less ability were retained. Statement M of Major-General Hutton&#39;s letter is to the effect that - </para>
                    <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline>had never represented his case to General Finn or General Hutton, and that if he had submitted his grievances to the Minister of Defence he had committed a serious breach of military discipline. </para>
                    <para>There is no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> did wrong in going to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. He states that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest was known to him, and that he approached him, not as Minister of Defence, but as a private gentleman, and said that it was very hard that he should be retrenched. He stated his case, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, in his breezy way, said, &#34;I will look into the matter.&#34; To be candid, this action on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> in seeing <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest may possibly account for what happened to him afterwards. Major-General Hutton seems to have taken very great offence at it, for he said to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> &#34;You have been behind my back, and you will get no more employment in my time.&#34; </para>

If he had not all the facts before him, the Committee cannot believe that he investigated <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> case &#34;upon the spot, with infinite care,&#34; as stated by him in his reply to question 346. Major-General Hutton takes all responsibility, in the following letter, written to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> as Minister of. Defence, and referred to in page 8 of the Minutes of Evidence : - </para>
                    <para>After careful inquiry and personal investigation, I considered it to be in the public interest that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> should be included among those officers whom it was considered advisable to retire. I was well aware at that time of every circumstance connected with the officer in question, both as regards his previous service in the Permanent Artillery of Queensland, his efforts at improved military training and education on his part in England, of his services during the campaign in South Africa, and finally, of the work done by him as a general and instructional Staff Officer since his return. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Committee came to the conclusion that Major-General Hutton ignored the facts as regards <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> past and present services. Statement R was to this effect - </para>
                    <para>That <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> had clearly made three misstatements - (1) that he had &#34;asked General Hutton&#39;s permission to see the Minister, and that General Hutton had no objection &#34; ; (2) that &#34; when the Minister had asked Carroll if he had placed his case before General Hutton, Carroll said he had fully done so&#34;; (3) that &#34;Carroll told the Minister of Defence he had fourteen years in the Queensland service.&#34; </para>
                    <para class="block">There is no doubt that the first two statements - are inaccurate. On the evidence <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> had not Major-General Hutton&#39;s permission, and he had not placed his case before him. With regard to his statement that he had had fourteen years in the Queensland service, the Committee examined, in Brisbane, <inline font-weight="bold">Major W.</inline> G. Cahill, Under-Secretary of the Department of Justice in that State, and a military man of considerable experience, and also Lt.-Col. A. J. Thynne, who stated that he helped to pass the Queensland Defence Act, and both those gentlemen agreed that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> is entitled to say that he has had at least twelve years&#39; service in the Queensland Defence Force, and possibly fourteen years&#39; service. He joined in 1888 and resigned in 1891, and went to England to undergo a course of training in several military departments. He had made arrangements with the Queensland Defence Force that he should be kept on the Unattached List. He was for several years on the Unattached List, and in 1896 he was struck off and placed on the Retired List, where his name remained for the period of some fifteen months. When he discovered that he was on the Retired List he wrote to the Queensland authorities, and his name was reinstated on the Unattached List. The witnesses who were examined in Brisbane agreed that, if it was a mistake on the part of the Defence Force authorities in Queensland to strike <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> name off the Unattached List, he had a right to count the time during which he was on the Retired List as service. There can be no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> had very good reasons for believing that he was right in claiming to have had fourteen years&#39; service in the Defence Force when he made that statement to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. The most serious statement made by Major-General Hutton concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was that made in one of his later letters, written eight months after 14th November, 1902, in which he said - </para>
                    <para>That he (Major-General Hutton) would he sorry to impute any wilful intention on <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> part to state what was not true; but <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> conduct in this respect confirmed the impression which he (Major-General Hutton) held, and which was similarly held by  General Finn and Lieut.-Col. Neild, that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> had shown unmistakable signs of eccentricity which might or might not have been caused by his recent service in South Africa, but which, in any case, show &#39;that his qualities as an officer are such as to render it undesirable that he should be retained in the service. </para>
                    <para>That seems to me to be a most serious statement to make, and it is the more serious because it was made in a confidential manner. There was only one meaning to be attached to it, and that is the meaning which was attached to it by the Minister of Defence at the time, the Honorable Austin Chapman, which was that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> brain was affected, and that it could be only the condition of his brain which would make him eccentric. Such a charge as this is one which it is sometimes very hard to disprove. &#34;It certainly had an effect upon the members of the Commonwealth Parliament. I remember that when <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> came to me, having been unable to get members to take up his case, and to inquire into it, that I invited some members of this Parliament to assist in an inquiry, and&#39; they suggested that it was a mistake to take up the case. They said practically that this man was out of his mind. Honorable senators know how a Member of Parliament will hesitate about taking up the case of any man, and more especially will they hesitate before taking up the case of a man who is deemed to be a little bit &#34; off his head,&#34; or who is suspected to be a faddist. It was a most cruel, and, as the evidence shows, a baseless thing to say about <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> The Committee examined several witnesses without securing a trace of evidence with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> alleged mental incapacity. Major-General Hutton, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Deacon,</inline> Brigadier-General Finn, <inline font-weight="bold">Major MacLagan,</inline> and Lt.Col. Chauvel were asked to give specific instances of Major Carroll&#39;s eccentric conduct, or to mention any expression on his part that would lead them to believe that he was not perfectly sensible. They could not give specific instances. They spoke of their impressions. <inline font-weight="bold">Major MacLagan</inline> said he had formed the impression that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was eccentric because he once saw him waving his arms about when standing easy on parade, and he was called to attention by Colonel Bayley - improperly called to attention, as I understand, because the troops were standing easy at the time. A man cannot be said to be eccentric because he stretches his arms at such a time. <inline font-weight="bold">Major MacLagan</inline> himself said that such a thing might be done by any one. That was the class of evidence that was adduced to prove that this man was out of his mind. We examined Lt.-Col. Foxton, Lt.-Col. Browne, Lt.-Col. Adams, Lt.-Col. Thynne, in Brisbane;  Colonel Roth,  the principal medical officer for the State of New South Wales, and <inline font-weight="bold">Major Mullins</inline> - men who were associated with <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> and who stated that there was nothing in his conduct or demeanour that would in any way lead them to believe that he was eccentric. </para>

                            <para>- No; he simply said, &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> gives me the impression that his mental balance is not all there.&#34; Personally, I did not know <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> except that I had a nodding acquaintance with him, until this case commenced. After the case began I had frequent opportunities to meet him. He was under my notice every day the Committee sat; but I did not discover anything in him which would lead any one to believe that his mental balance is not all that it should be or that he is eccentric. I say again that the statements to that effect were most cruel and absolutely baseless. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> who desires to say a word or two on this matter, is called away on urgent business, and therefore I do not desire to make any further remarks at this stage. I hope that the report will be adopted. It is fair that it should be adopted, and I trust that the Government will carry out the wishes of the Senate as expressed in the report. A great wrong has been done to this man. It was unfortunate that any officers had to be retrenched, but if retrenchment was necessary, the last men who ought to have been retrenched were those who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> had seen service. He has undergone training in England, he has acquired considerable military knowledge, he is an enthusiastic student of his profession, and he has seen active service in South Africa. Active service surely fits a man in a special degree to be an instructor. If retrenchment is necessary, whoever has 10 go, it seems to me that the services of a man like <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> should have been retained. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> was to have been called as a witness. He was at Charters Towers. Captain Niesigh, who represented the General Officer Commanding, stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> sent a telegram to Colonel Plomer to say that he did hot care to make a statutory declaration concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> unless called upon by the Select Committee. The Committee then decided to inform the representative of the General Officer Commanding and <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> that they ought to frame questions which could be sent on to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper,</inline> and be answered in the form of a sworn declaration. In the meantime, when <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> refused to make a statutory declaration unless called upon by the Committee, Major-General Hutton sent a telegram through his officers to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper,</inline> calling upon him to make a statement concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> for the information of the General Officer Commanding. When the General Officer Commanding received that statement, he handed it to the Committee. The Committee sent up the questions to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper,</inline> and we received a wire from him stating that he declined to make a statutory declaration, because he did not consider that the Select Committee had power to order him to make one. When Colonel Plomer was under examination, and submitted <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper&#39;s</inline> written &#39; statement, he was asked, &#34; Was this statement made voluntarily?&#34; He said, &#34;No.&#34; &#34;Was it made under compulsion?&#34; He said &#34;Yes.&#34; He was asked &#34; What would have happened to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> if he had not done this?&#34; Colonel Plomer said that he did not know. He was asked &#34; What would you, as an expert, have done with <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> if he was under your command and refused to make this declaration?&#34; He said, &#34; I suppose I should have put him under arrest.&#34; So that, when <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper,</inline> after stating that he would make a declaration when called upon, refused to make a statutory declaration when he was called upon, the Committee came to the conclusion that he was not a witness whose evidence could be relied upon ; or, rather, that he was giving his evidence under compulsion. We came to that conclusion more especially as we had before us Captain Woodyatt, an officer who gave his evidence under oath, and who said that he was present in Charters Towers when <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper,</inline> at a valedictory gathering, commended <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> for his services as an officer while he was in Charters Towers. </para>

                            <para>- Captain Niesigh asked that the Committee should call <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper,</inline> but. as I have already stated, we were not calling witnesses. We were not making ourselves responsible for the expenses of any witnesses. When we were in Brisbane we said we would wait there four days, in order that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> might be brought down. Captain Niesigh informed the Committee that the General Officer Commanding wanted him to be called, but the Minister of Defence would not agree to pay the expenses of any witness not called by the Committee. That is the reason, I suppose, why <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> was not brought down. We did not choose to call <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> arid pay his expenses, on account of his peculiar action in first refusing to make a statement, and when called upon by the Committee to do so, saying that we had no power to order him. But he could have made a statement without any trouble whatever if he had been prepared to substantiate what he said. He could have sworn an affidavit before a justice of the peace, and forwarded it to Melbourne. But the Committee would not consider his written statement, because it was not sworn to, as was the evidence of other witnesses. </para>

I make no reference to those reports, but I wish to say that I did not communicate with Major-General Hutton, that I did not ask to see him, and that I did not see him in any such manner as alleged. During the three years that Major-General Hutton has been the General Officer Commanding in the Commonwealth, I have only seen him at his office twice. On one occasion I saw him at his request, in order to discuss the impropriety of a senator who was an officer, speaking on military matters. On the other occasion - without going into any particulars - I was informed that the General Officer Commanding wished to see me in reference to my view as to the permanency of the Volunteer movement in New South Wales. It was at that interview, when the matter which he had sent for me to discuss had been discussed, that a short conversation took place - not at my solicitation - not at my request. It was started by Major-General Hutton asking me something about <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> What the conversation was, of course, I cannot state here, but, at least, I am justified in stating that it was not such a conversation as the evidence leads the reader to believe. </para>

                            <para>.- People&#39;s memories are sometimes at fault. In these matters, my memory is very clear. I wish to add this : that so far as I know anything of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> he is an exceedingly enthusiastic, courteous officer and gentleman. He laboured under a serious disadvantage in New South Wales in this respect - that without any preliminary training, he was brought to another country where the regulations, and as far as I can see, the methods were entirely different, and before he had any opportunity to gain a knowledge of local conditions he was supposed to discharge instructional duties&#34;. </para>

I have no desire to make any further reference to the case, for the very good reason that I have had some personal connexion with it; but I wish to deny absolutely that I perpetrated an outrage on military discipline by going to the General Officer Commanding. I should have had no right to go to him, so far as military usage is concerned. The proper officer for a regimental commander in New South Wales to go to is the State Commandant, and I take it that the General Officer Commanding would not allow a regimental commander to pass over the head of that officer. I did not seek the interview that is alleged, nor did I make such representations as are conveyed in the evidence. </para>

At the time in question the infantry drill of the Commonwealth was upside down, and it remained in that condition for something like twelve months. The drill for one month was altered at the next School of Instruction, and I did not know myself what the particular drill was in many cases It was a period of transition. </para>

My object in rising was simply to say that the allegations as to the representations made by me are so entirely erroneous that it is my duty to contradict them. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to ask the Attorney-General, for a reason which I shall name, to afford the Senate an early opportunity to deal with this case. The honorable and learned senator knows very well that it is one of the first principles of British law and jurisprudence that there shall be no unnecessary delay in providing a remedy for any grievance under which a person labours. The Attorney-General said the other day that the Parliament was the highest Court in the land. We have now before us a specific case, which has been hanging fire, so to speak, for an exceedingly long time. The officer in question has appealed to us, and we shall do him a palpable injustice if we delay the consideration of his case, and fail to treat him in accordance with what has been the recognised practice of British law for all time. The case has been pending so long that it must have been a source of much anxiety to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> and it is the duty of the Government to afford the Senate every facility to deal with it at the earliest date. At present it may be discussed only during the time allotted to private members&#39; business, and, as the Government are not prepared to proceed with its consideration to-day, they might very well devote to it a day which would otherwise be given up to the consideration of Government business. </para>

                            <para>- I would cordially indorse what has been said as to the necessity for dealing with this case without delay. I am at a loss to understand why the debate should have been adjourned. The report was laid on the table of the House some weeks ago, and it is only reasonable to surmise that honorable senators have made themselves familiar with its contents. In view of the fact that the Government were not prepared to proceed with the case this afternoon, I think it is only reasonable that they should afford us an opportunity to deal with it on some day other than that regularly set apart for private members&#39; business. </para>

                                <para>- I shall tell the honorable senator. Judging by the apparent heat evinced by some of my honorable friends opposite, it seems necessary that we should have an opportunity to calmly and deliberately consider the exceedingly valuable and able speech to which we have listened from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs.</inline> The Select Committee&#39;s report covers 275 pages, and we have also listened to an exceedingly able speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> which has been the result of much study and careful examination of the evidence. So far, I have only read about one-fourth of the report. I felt that the proper thing to do was to wait until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> had stated his case, crystallized the evidence, and pointed out those portions of it which bear upon the report of the Committee that we are asked to adopt. Surely that is reasonable. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HENDERSON</inline>(Western Australia). When progress was reported last night, I was advancing a few reasons, from a miner&#39;s point of view, why the proviso to clause 55 should not remain in the Bill. I asked honorable senators, particularly honorable senators from New South Wales, to glance at the industrial history of that State, and to endeavour to realize the fact that large numbers of men there follow an occupation which has practically compelled them to take political action almost from the inception of trade unionism. The remarks which apply to New South Wales in this connexion, also apply closely to the other States, with the exception that in New South Wales, there have been left permanent records of negligence on the part of those who controlled the great mining industry - records which show an absolute disregard of human life, and human welfare. Under such circumstances, I cannot conceive how honorable senators from that State can conscientiously raise a voice foi the retention of a provision, the aim of which is to prevent men from remedying existing evils, and insuring safety and fair play in the future. Of course, the suggestion may be advanced that miners are not contemplated in this legislation j and it is evident that in the minds of some people, there is an idea that the Bill is intended to operate in regard to two particular bodies of men only - the seamen and the shearers. On this point the Attorney-General has entirely eschewed the role of prophet, as other honorable senators may well do, and be prepared to accept the practical facts Of life as presented to us under the growing conditions of Australia. One reason urged for the retention of this provision is that trade unionists use their funds for promoting active political organizations ; indeed, some honorable senators have gone so far as to say that coercion is used by trade unions to enforce their demands. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. During my long connexion with trade unions I have never known other than the most legitimate action on the part of both members &#39;and officers. From a political point of view we have done just what all organizations do - we have endeavoured to persuade every member, by candid logic, that his welfare lies with his own people - that it is to his advantage to vote for parliamentary representatives who are most likely to promote and conserve his interests. Every honorable senator who is opposed to the omission of this provision does exactly the same sort of thing. For instance, there is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> who is so energetic in stumping &#34;Victoria in the interests of the phase of politics he represents, that he cannot sleep a,t night. Even at 6 o&#39;clock in the morning, we find him abroad and active in propagating his cause, and, to my own knowledge, he has kept himself busy in this way to as late as 10 o&#39;clock at night. There are senators opposite who would deny the trade unionists the right to actively promote and advocate the cause which they have at heart. Such honorable senators claim that as employers and supporters of employers they may carry on propaganda work, and devote to it whatever funds they choose, but they would prevent workers endeavouring to convince their fellows as to the right course of political action to be pursued. They would prevent us from persuading our fellow- workers to return representatives most likely to promote their interests. </para>

                        <para>- It is absolutely a fair way. It is the only way which the language of the provision permits, and it is based on absolute facts. As to coercion, I never knew any member of a union to be compelled to vote for Tom, D:ck, or Harry. The trade unionist is usually a square-headed man, whom no senators would be likely to lead by the nose or drive. As a rule, trade unionists are men, of independent thought, who have pi ofl ted by the wise teachings of experience, and they know that if they desire to better their conditions they have to depend on their own efforts. Hence trade unions are, and must be political : and I should protest against any denial that they are political organizations. </para>

                        <para>- That I could never tell the honorable senator. But in the days of old, as I remember reading in a book - and I suppose the honorable senator has read the same kind of thing - a great many employers in the old land, when organization of labour first took root, made it a condition of their forced recognition of unionism that the members of trade unions must not enter the political life of the country. I am sorry to say that, though the old employers have gone, some of their tory ideas still prevail. Though the Legislature of the country had recognised the right of combination, the employers refused to recognise that right, and when at length they did so their recognition was based upon the condition that trade unionists must not take any political action, but, as of old, they must doff their hats, and record their votes for the squire of the parish, or for whomsoever he thought it necessary they should vote. </para>

But I can give, and I&#39; think I have given good reasons why trade unions are political organizations, and why they should continue to remain so. I have &#39;said that unfortunately the idea to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has referred, still prevails, and if we take the case of The Amalgamated Miners&#39; Association, who have passed this exclusive rule, what do we find&#39;? The whole of the members of that union have discussed the Mines Bill which is now before the State Parliament: of Victoria. How could they avoid doing so? I ask honorable senators to consider the conditions under which miners have had to labour, and are labouring still. Their lives absolutely depend upon the proper ventilation of the mines in which they work, and the general provisions made for their safety. Honorable senators must see that miners&#39; associations must continue to be political organizations. As their industry changes, it is necessary that new provisions should follow each change. In New South Wales, before eighty-two human souls were blown into eternity, everything in connexion with the management of mines was considered to be right. You might go into a mine, and find that you had to carry the , man who had been walking alongside of you to the main air-course, in order that he might be resuscitated after having lost consciousness by reason of the noxious gases he was breathing. Men were carried out of mines time and again in an unconscious condition, but that was an ordinary matter. By political efforts we were battling for the betterment of those conditions, and to what extent did we succeed? Let me inform honorable senators that the records of the New South Wales Parliament will show that we had a Bill for the better regulation of mines before that Parliament for twenty -two years. When did we succeed in carrying that measure? In the year 1892, shortly after members of the Labour Party had been returned to the New South Wales Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Very likely. I am sincerely glad to hear it, and I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> took a part in it because such legislation is worthy of the efforts of any man. I point out that while the New South Wales Parliament was considering whether that legislation should be passed, the Bulli colliery was blown up, eighty-two human souls were launched into eternity, and forty-seven widows and over 170 children were left to the care of a cold world&#39;s charity. All this was simply an <inline font-style="italic">in memoriam</inline> of the bad laws which then existed, and the carelessness and apathy of people in. power in neglecting to insist upon better conditions for miners. Can honorable senators imagine for a moment that miners will give up their desire to form political organizations, or can they conceive of any men following such an occupation being prepared to subject themselves to such a condition of things as I have described, in order that they might obtain this preference which has already been conceded as an absolute and logical right to which a unionist is entitled as a man, and in view of the status which he holds in our civilization? We say that to attempt to force such a provision upon these men is almost a crime. It is asking men whom they know cannot possibly give up their right to political action, to surrender all the power which they have had to insure the betterment of their condition, in order that they may become once more merely the slaves of circumstance. I tell honorable senators candidly that there is not one miner throughout this vast Commonwealth who will allow any one to interfere with his political rights. </para>

                        <para>- What is the meaning of this provision? As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> told us last night, this is the price that we, as a Senate, are asking our masters, the people outside, to pay for preference. Is it the price of their deliverance? If it is, I am satisfied that they will prefer to remain in the slavery in which they stand to-day, rather than accept any such deliverance. It would be a gross neglect on our part as legislators to allow such a provision to pass, when we know that it will be harmful in its effects, that it will nullify the operation of this measure, and that it will result in men remaining unorganized, and we shall be as liable as we have ever been to industrial disturbances. I trust from the remarks of some honorable senators who have opposed what we desire, that their opposition does not go so far as to influence them to endeavour to uphold conditions which are recognised to be harmful and unworthy of the age in which we live. </para>

                    <para>- I have listened with very great interest to the speeches of honorable senators opposite on this question. It seems to me that they have overlooked the special scope and intention of this measure. The whole of their arguments have been addressed to the gross injustice that will be done to existing trade unions if this particular clause is allowed to remain as it stands. Honorable senators appear to have entirely overlooked the fact that it would be absolutely futile for existing trade unions to attempt to register under this Bill, because it deals only with disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. That is the whole object and scope of the Bill. Honorable senators opposite have made speeches which would be amply justified if we were dealing with such a clause in a Bill applying to arbitration in a State, and my sympathies in such a case would be entirely with them. </para>

                        <para>- I am coming to that point. The whole of the arguments of honorable senators so far have been with respect to the injustice which would be done to existing organizations if this clause were allowed to remain. Numbers of existing organizations have been mentioned. The honorable senator, who hals just salt down, has mentioned the miners&#39; association. Others have mentioned other trade organizations, and have endeavoured to prove that none of the existing organizations would dream of registering under the Bill. With that postulate I entirely agree. I do not suppose that any existing trade organizations will dream of registering under this Bill while this clause remains. If they did, they would undoubtedly lose rights which they already possess in the States. </para>

                        <para>- In this Bill we are deliberately attempting to force all the members of the community to join one of two classes. My desire is to force the employers into general employers&#39; unions, failing which they will fail to get the benefit of this Bill, and to force all the employe&#39;s, in their own interests and in the interests of the community, into general unions of employed. But, in order to do that, I certainly most strongly feel that to use the funds of those two classes for political purposes would be improper. </para>

                        <para>- It simply means the fresh registration of every individual in a new organization created under this measure, and worked under regulations approved of by the Registrar under this measure. Those regulations would absolutely debar any use of the funds of the associations either for political or for any other outside purposes. The organizations would simply he registries defining those who are entitled to the privileges of preference in employment, the result being that -there would be a general inclination to join them. The last speaker before he sat down said that there was no case on record of any political pressure being brought to bear upon members of a union. I have here a cutting dealing with rule 57 of the Australian Workers&#39; Union. That was a union registered under the New South Wales Act. </para>

The fact that the rule had to be withdrawn, illustrates the drawbacks that will arise from political questions being introduced in connexion with these organizations. That is one of the things that we should be particularly anxious to avoid in this Bill. Rule 57 was as follows: - </para>

                    <para>- Before I cast my vote I wish to say a few words showing the exact position I take up in regard to this clause. Our honorable friends of the Labour Party pleaded with very great force for preference to unionists, and urged that if it were denied them the Bill would be practically useless. It is necessary for us to see what that really means. What are unions? We are informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> that they are political bodies. That is admitted, and I ask myself what must be the effect of granting preference to unionists? I voted for the principle, believing that under certain conditions they deserved some little protection by way of preference. But if, by granting that preference, we are going to practically compel a large number of persons who do not belong to unions at the present time to join political associations under the name of trade unions, we shall do that which we have no right to do, and should not do under any circumstances. We have no right to induce or compel any man to join an association of a political character. Honorable senators of the Labour Party urge that the position I take up is not a correct one. Have we any right to compel a man to join an association of a political character? </para>

                        <para>- There can be no doubt that that would be the effect of granting preference to unionists, if the clause were not passed as it stands. Directly the Court gives a decision granting a preference to members of an industrial association, those who are following a trade or calling to . which it relates, will find it unmistakably to their advantage to join that organization. They will recognise that by joining it they will have an opportunity to secure employment which they might otherwise fail to obtain. That is the whole position in a nutshell. We cannot get away from it. We have no right to force men into political organizations, and we have the admission by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> that trade unions are political organizations. </para>

                        <para>- And because my argument, based on that admission, is too telling, they now say that their unions are no more political organizations than are our churches. No church with which I have had any association has been apolitical organization. A great many of our clergymen will&#39; not discuss political questions. My father was a Baptist minister, and as such in the early days of South Australia was stationed at Mitcham. I was then a lad of thirteen or fourteen years of age, and I well remember that at that time there was a great fight as to granting State aid to religion. The parties were divided into two forces : those who believed in State aid to religion, and those who did not. The former had a blue flag, while the latter had a blue and white flag. I was one of those who did not believe in State aid to religion. Young as I was, I was taking some interest in politics, and I well remember obtaining possession of a blue and white flag and carrying it on to the roof of our stable, where I set it on a little pinnacle. My father deliberately ordered me to take down that flag, because he would not allow anything to be displayed on his premises showing that he believed either in the blue of the one side or the blue and white of the other. He always contended that ministers of religion should keep clear of political conflicts, and therefore he would not allow the flag to be hoisted. As a matter of fact, however, he voted all right. He was in favour of the abolition of State aid to religion, and the flag would have merely indicated that the occupants of our house, at all events, did not believe in the principle. I know that all ministers of &#34;religion do not refrain from taking part in politics. </para>

                        <para>- No; I am simply arguing for the recognition of fair principles. We have agreed to give preference to unionists, and that fact will in- duce large numbers of men, from motives of self-interest, to join unions, but we have no right bv legislation to compel any one to join a political association. We cannot get away from that. My honorable friends of the Labour Party are silent so far as that point is concerned. We should not do anything that is unfair. There are many persons in the Commonwealth who are not unionists, and we have no right to force them to join unions. If I were a working man I certainly should be a member of a union. It is a mistake for a man not to belong to an organization that is really looking after his own interests ; but I would not, by Act of Parliament, compel any one who might think differently to join any political association. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Honorable senators may talk about old and young trade unions, and about what&#34; has been done by them. We all admit that good work has been done by unions both in England and Australia, but we know that all the improvements which have been made in our social conditions have not been brought about solely by these organizations. I do not suppose that the late Lord Shaftesbury, who worked for the abolition of child labour in the manufacturing districts of England, belonged to a trade union. I should rather imagine that John Bright and Cobden did, and yet we know that they were opposed to anything of the kind. </para>

As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has said, they would have to join these organizations for the sake of their bread and butter. But honorable senators of the Labour Party say, in effect, that a non-unionist should not have a chance to get employment while there is a unionist out of work. That is rather hard on the non-unionists. </para>

The question is, are unions political organizations in the sense that persons joining them might be compelled to sacrifice their political convictions ? The honorable senator denied that the church of which his father was a member would, under any circumstances, take part in political matters. Churches, however, hold land, which they sometimes desire to sell, and to obtain power to sell they have often to come to Parliament. </para>

I should be very glad to agree to a provision which would prevent trade unions from coercing their members in any direction involving the expenditure of funds for political purposes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> referred to the fact that a Government in South Australia, of which he was the head, passed the Employers&#39; Liability Act. A kindred law is that which provides for the inspection of boilers and machinery, in which those chiefly interested are trade unionists, the men who are working in proximity to the machinery. They occasionally, in self-defence, have to call the attention of Ministers of the Crown to the fact that the law is not being properly administered. Would that be, a political act? </para>

                        <para>- If it can be made clear that certain kinds of political action may be taken by trade unions, we may arrive at a solution of the difficulty. But the language of the clause is at present too wide for the purpose. I should be delighted to adopt any language which would prevent trade unions from compelling persons to join their ranks, and afterwards requiring them to vote on certain political lines. The clause, however, speaks of the application of funds to political purposes. What is a political purpose? The words are so difficult to define that litigation would take place in connexion with every conceivable action of a trade union for the enforcement of existing laws. Suppose that in the opinion of certain shop employes, the Early Closing Act was being flagrantly violated, and they appointed a deputation to wait upon the Minister to bring the facts under his notice, the loss of wages involved in the loss of time being made up to the members of the deputation out of the funds of the association, would that be the application of funds to political purposes ? </para>

                        <para>- The point ought to be made clear. In my opinion such an act would be a political act within the meaning of the clause, and it is worth while finding out exactly where we stand. Suppose, for argument&#39;s sake, that the law at present in existence was, in the opinion of people employed in shops, inadequate for their protection - that it did not give the protection intended when the legislation was passed - and that they waited as a deputation on a Minister or the head of a Government to ask that a specific amendment might be made. Would that be a political act? </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General is an authority, and his opinion is entitled to very serious weight, in the opinion of laymen, at any rate. I certainly had an entirely different view until the Attorney-General made his statement, and I still think there are a great number of innocent actions, in. a political direction, which should not make a society a political organization. I am anxious to insert such words as will clearly prohibit what we all believe to be improper political action, and which will leave free from liability a great many actions which might be called political, but which are not political in the sense we have in our minds. For instance, it would be monstrous for an organization to pass a resolution that every one of its members should vote for A, B, or C. Indeed I would go further. It would be monstrous for an organization to have power to compel its members to vote for some special political principle and bind all its members to advocate that principle. Take, for instance, free-trade, or, what is better, protection. No society should have such a power as I have indicated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> argued, and, I think, fairly, that preference should be given to unionists. </para>

                        <para>- But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> thinks there is power in trade unions to coerce persons in political matters, in regard to which all men ought to &#34;have the greatest possible liberty of action. In that view I agree; but if the clause is left as at present it will absolutely take away preference under all conceivable circumstances. It is quite impossible for a trade union to make itself so completely nonpolitical as not to render itself liable at&#39; some stage or other in respect of some resolution or action of a political nature. The essence of modern legislation is to interfere with the action of the individual in the interests of the whole. </para>

                        <para>- That may be, but the rule is not observed. There is no labour organization in Australia of ten years&#39; standing that has not during that period taken, some political action, though I do not mean the sort of political action contemplated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford.</inline> I have been a member of an industrial organization for over thirty years, and I have never known any effort to be made to coerce me in connexion with my political convictions. No doubt a large number of my fellow-unionists and myself held political views in common, but we never dreamed of coercing a man who differed from us politically. But the organization of which I am a member has repeatedly had to interview Ministers of the Crown, and has more than once had to ask for specific legislation. </para>

                        <para>- I think that would be the better course, seeing that there is no need for the proviso. In my opinion, there is no danger such as that anticipated, but if there be any fear on this score, I am willing to go as far as anybody in providing against the suggested possibilities. Words might be inserted to the effect that no organization shall permit its funds to be expended in the support of any particular political party, or in the support of any particular candidate; and I think that would cover the whole ground. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know anything about that ; I am. merely expressing my own opinion. The proviso, to my mind, is useless, because it is unnecessary, and even if it be necessary, it goes further than it ought to. I know there are some who do not agree with me that it is unnecessary, and I shall assist those who think it is necessary, to make it effective and to meet any danger they contemplate. But I ask them to assist me, and others who agree with me, to remove from the proviso its objectionable comprehensiveness, if I may so express myself. I strongly urge on those who think that trade unionists could, and would, coerce their members into voting against their convictions, to endeavour to Revise some means of prevention, without giving the wider power in the clause which would practically render it impossible for any organization of which I have any knowledge, to take advantage of the preference provision. </para>

                    <para>- I protest against the retention of this proviso. I am perfectly satisfied, after the instances given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> that the supporters of it express the intention of its original framers. The answer given by the Attorney-General did not, I think, satisfy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> or the Committee generally, because all the honorable and learned &#39; gentleman said was that in his opinion no Court in Australia would hold that those instances come within the prohibition. But the Attorney-General, as a lawyer, expresses only his own opinion. We are now once more asked t&#39;o trust the Court - to wait until the Court has let us know the meaning of ;he clause. From the slight opposition that we have heard expressed in words - because we realize there is, and always will be, strong opposition to legislation of this character from honorable senators opposite - we can only draw the inference, particularly from what has been said by representatives of New . South Wales, that the great fear is of the political power possessed by trade unions. I have no doubt that the trade unionists in New South Wales have awakened to a sense of the mistake they made in not exercising their power more freely at the recent general election. </para>

The freetrade horse, which has been so successful in the past, has now been driven to death; and at the next general election, another and a greater issue will be raised, and I believe the .result will be that either myself, or the representative who succeeds me, will meet many of the present honorable senators as respectable, quiet, law-abiding private citizens.

                        <para>- I have no doubt that that is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> opinion. In Western Australia, the Amalgamated Workers&#39; Association extends throughout the goldfields, and from the. earliest days of the gold-mining industry, that union has been an active force. It developed from a union of workers for industrial purposes into what was practically the first roads board. It was the first body with a political committee to advocate the construction of roads and bridges, the first to ask for the creation of municipalities, the first to advocate the erection of State batteries, and the first to advocate a Mines Regulation Bill. It was the body which, associated with the local Trades and Labour Council of Kalgoorlie, raised what is known as the &#34; Fresh Air Fund,&#34; for sending children from the gold-fields on visits to the coast. It is such work as this that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> is going to make impossible for trade unions by the retention of this clause. I am afraid that the organization will look askance at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> if he votes in the direction he has privately indicated. </para>

Similar rules exist in some cases to-day, and the reason for their adoption is that, unless in the case of a union formed at the time of a strike, when employes determined to form a union, they sought the consent of their employer, because they knew that if they did not do so they would be victimized. The secretary of the proposed union was sent round to the employer to consult him in the matter, and he would say, &#34; Send me a copy of your rules, and I will let you know what </para>

I beg to inform the honorable and learned senator that I take a very different view. My views on the subject were expressed personally at various meetings I held in New South Wales. I have never altered them from that time to the present, and the electors paid me the compliment of returning me to the Senate at the top of the poll. What right, then, has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> to say that I do not represent my constituents? After the very conclusive speeches delivered by Senators Matheson and Playford, our honorable friends opposite should see that organizations ought to be registered under this measure merely for the purposes of the Bill. But the cat is now out of the bag. and we have been given to understand that what honorable senators opposite desire is a political, and not an industrial Bill. If I remember rightly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and some other honorable senators have said that every organization is more or less political. </para>

What advantage does the community derive from &#34; picketing &#34; ? I remind honorable senators also that the proviso to which they object applies to employers and employes alike, and we have not heard any one say on behalf of employers&#39; unions that they object to be kept out of politics. We know that many of the members of employers&#39; unions are manufacturers, and there are protectionists and free-traders amongst them, and they are not united politically. </para>

Under this measure what is desired is the registration merely of organizations of employers and employes, and there should be no necessity for preference. It is an old story that &#34; Threatened lives live long,&#34; and in view of what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft,</inline> some of the representatives of New South Wales in the Senate will probably prove the truth of the saying. In the late elections for the Senate in that State, the Labour Party put forward a very strong man in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Griffith. He was supported by the protectionist party, and notwithstanding that fact he was nearly 80,000 votes behind my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> who was third on the list of those elected. </para>

They have expended all their energies and all their money, and have invoked the assistance of the capitalistic press throughout Australia in a vain effort to bring about such a result. </para>

                        <para>- I will show the honorable senator. I ask what possible chance would the trade organizations have of improving the condition of their members, and also of non-unionists, unless they were in a position to bring political influence to bear. All the privileges which working men and working women enjoy to-day have been won by the efforts of the political labour organizations. The very fact that we are able to hold meetings as trade unionists is due to the political action that has been taken by labour organizations in years gone by. Up till 1870 trade unionism had not been legalized. And it was not until 1894 that the trade union organizations were placed upon a proper legal footing in all the States of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Within the last century a number of workmen in Great Britain met in accordance with an Act of Parliament, which gave them permission to do so, and endeavoured to arrange for united action with a view to securing an advance of wages. They partially succeeded, but some of their number were indicted for conspiracy, and were transported to Botany Bay for a term of seven years. A great agitation resulted, strong protests were made through political channels against such unjust treatment being meted out to these men, and not long afterwards free pardons were granted. In 1893 the memorable Broken Hill strike occurred. A number of men concerned in that strike were indicted under the old conspiracy laws of George III., and some of them were sent to gaol. After they had served their term of imprisonment, they were returned by an overwhelming majority to the New South Wales Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Until 1893 it was nor possible for men to freely meet together, and discuss matters connected with the wages and conditions of labour to which they had to submit because they were liable to be indicted upon a charge of conspiracy. At the outset I made bold to say that this provision was an insidious attempt to place fetters upon trade unionists. Not very long since sweating prevailed to an alarming extent in Victoria. The trade organizations, however, by means of public meetings and the expenditure of their funds, focussed public attention upon the evils that existed, and were eventually able to secure the passing of a Factories Act, which afforded immense relief to thou- . sands of men and women. If there had been upon the statute-book a Bill containing a provision such as that now under discussion, it would not have been possible for the trade unionists to carry on such an agitation, or to spend their funds in doing so. I shall read some extracts from the report of the Victorian Chief Inspector of Factories, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> Ord, for 1902, in order to show honorable senators what has been accomplished by legislation in the direction I have indicated. Honorable senators may gather from the facts which I intend to present to them, some idea of the immense advantages that have been conferred upon the workers by means of political influence brought to bear by the trade organizations. If the trade unionists are to give up their right to strike, and if they are not to be able to participate in any political movement for the advancement of the workers, what a huge price they will be called upon to pay for the high-toned Bill which is now offered to them. </para>

                        <para>- Trade unionists have been accused of want of sympathy with those outside the pale of their organizations ; but there is no ground for that accusation. Honorable members must know that non-unionists have shared in the benefits which have been secured through the trade organizations, and that but for the unions, they would be in a very much worse position than they are to-day. The Factories Act came into operation in Victoria in 1895, and at that time it was said by its opponents that it would be inimical to the well-being and happiness of the people, would impede progress, cause factories to be closed, and throw men and women out of employment. The same thing is said to-day by the supporters of the provision now under discussion. </para>

The proprietor of the&#34; Sunshine Harvester Works desires more protection, and I say that if his request is to be granted, the workmen should receive some advantage in the shape of better wages and improved working conditions generally. </para>

                        <para>- Probably that was owing to the fact that the honorable and learned senator was at the head of the Government. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ord&#39;s</inline> report, in 1895 there were 2,573 factories in Victoria, in which 36,000 hands were employed. In 1896 there were 3,370 factories, and 40,000 hands; in 1897, 3,739 factories and 45,000 hands; in 1898, 3,777 factories and 45,000 hands; in 1899, 3,895 factories and 49,000 hands; in 1900, 4,050 factories and 52,000 hands; in 1901, 4,238 factories and 56,000 hands; and in 1902 4,252 factories, with 59,000 employes, male and female. A prediction was made that the Factories Act would bring about disaster, but these figures prove that the prophets were altogether astray. For many years in Victoria a number of trades had to contend against manifestly unjust conditions and vile competition. For years and years the Chinese had a monopoly of the furniture trade. A number of Australian-born men walked about the streets of the various cities in the States while the Chinese were employed every day, including Sunday, and were not complying with even sanitary conditions. The Furniture Trade Society held public meetings in almost every suburb of Melbourne, and so rivetted public attention upon the evils of this competition that they were able to secure the passing of an Act which did give them a measure of protection, because to-day the Chinese are supposed - I do not think the law is rigidly observed in some cases - to observe the eight hours principle, are not permitted to work on Sundays, although they dodge that provision not infrequently, and are compelled to observe sanitary conditions, and brand all their furniture &#34; Chinese made.&#34; If this Bill had been in existence, would it have been possible for the Furniture Trade Society to carry on that political agitation? No. </para>

                        <para>- Just so. Would it be possible for (the Builders&#39; Labourers Society to carry on an agitation in favour of the passing of a Scaffolding Act in order to safeguard human life ? Are they to be deprived of that privilege? Recently, a deputation from the Builders&#39; Labourers Society waited upon the Government of Victoria and desired that there should be appointed an inspector who should properly supervise the scaffolding which was put up by a number of contractors; some of whom have more consideration for profit than for human life. </para>

                        <para>- I trust that the honorable senator will be made aware of the fact before this debate is concluded. I ask honorable senators to listen to an account of what took place at the deputation to which I have just referred. One member of the deputation, who, for fear of getting the sack, wished his name to be suppressed - instanced a suburban job on which he was employed. One of the scaffolding poles used in this job was like a fishing rod. He was called to hoist a heavy girder with a rope, the strands of which were &#34; played out.&#34; . He asked the clerk of works if he would not condemn this work, and the clerk said it was out of his line. If it was bad building material he would be able to condemn, but he had nothing to do with the rope, though he admitted that it was rotten. The winch used in the same job was almost in pieces, and was so old that it must have been used in Noah&#39;s Ark. The barrel had to be levered over. The clerk of works, however, would not condemn it. The same speaker went on to say that when the contractor had run out of scaffolding cords he had been sent to the grocer&#39;s for clothes lines. He had seen a scaffolding pole &#34; footed &#34; on to the joist of the floor sixty feet from the ground. The pole was not even nailed down. </para>

                        <para>- He was not responsible, because there is no Act giving that measure of protection to the men who are engaged in this trade. We have had brought under our notice recently, sad cases in which a number of hard-working men have lost their lives from the use of defective scaffolding. In the baking trade in this State sweating was rampant. Men were working under insanitary conditions for as long as ninety hours per week, and in some instances for 30s. The Bakers&#39; Union placarded Melbourne, expended union funds, and carried on a political agitation in condemnation of the evils of sweating, and because of that agitation they were brought under the provisions of the Factories Act. I could cite other unions which have been engaged in similar work, and which have been benefited because of the agitation which they carried on. I wish to show from the report of the Chief Inspector of Factories the advantages which have been gained by unions from carrying on a political agitation. As regards the boot trade, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has dealt exhaustively with some instances which happened to himself as a boot operative and trade unionist. His case is typical of many others. Some few years ago, in Victoria, men who had served a long period to the boot trade, were getting, in some instances, wages which were inadequate for a youth. Like other tradesmen who desired to be brought under the provisions of the Factories Act, they carried on an agitation, and it resulted in their betterment. In 1896, before the determination of the Wages Board came into force, the average wage was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 6s. rod. for males and 13s. 4d. for females, the general averag being &#163;1 3s. 2d. After the passage of the Factories Act, and in the year 1892, the figures indicate an average increase of 5s. id. per week to each employe, as compared with 1896. It must be remembered that the permanency of this Act depends entirely upon united, vigorous political action on the part of all trade organizations. It depends upon the &#34;eternal vigilance&#34; of unionists and non-unionists to see that the Act is not evaded, and is kept on the statute-book. The brush-makers are also under the provisions of the Act, because of their political activity. In 1891, before the determination of the Wages Board came into force, the average wage for the trade was <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;i</inline> 3s. id., while in 1902, after the determination had been in force for a few months, the average wage was &#163;1 6s. 7d. These figures indicate an average increase of 3s. 6d. to each employe in the trade. A few years ago it was very difficult to bring about an organization . of the men employed in the butchering trade, but by incessant energy and zeal on the part of those men who desired to help on their fellows, a fairly strong organization, numerically and financially, was brought into existence, and by reason of their political activity, the butchers have been brought under the provisions of the Factories Act. In 1900, before the determination of the Wages Board came into force, the average wage for the whole trade was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 17s. 8d. In 1 901 it was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 1 8s. 8d., while in 1902 it was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2 os.</inline> 4d., showing an average increase of 2s. 8d. to every employe-, as compared with 1900. Take the clothing trade. In 1896, before the determination came into force, the average wage for the whole trad&#39;e was &#163;1. In 1901, it was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1 2s.</inline> nd., while in 1902 it was;&#163;i 2s. 5A, showing an average increase of 2 s. 5d. to each employe, as compared with 1896. In 1900, lief ore the coopers engaged in political activity, the average wage for adult males was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 2s. per week, while the average wage for all males was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 15s. 7d. per week. In 1902 the average wage was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 9s. for adult males, and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 3s. 5d. for all employes, showing an average increase of 75. for adult males, and of 7 s. iod. for all the employes, as compared with 1900, before the determination of the Wages Board came into force. Let me now take the case of the engravers. It is quite true that in this calling a large number of men were not employed, but they were employed under conditions which seemed to them unsatisfactory, and for that reason, they set to work, and at last were brought under the provisions of the Factories Act. In 1900 the average wage for the trade was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 16s. nd., while in 1902 it was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 9s. iod., showing an average increase of 12s. 1 id. to each employe, as compared with 1900, before the determination came into force. I shall now quote some figures to show the improvement which has been made in the furniture trade from a pecuniary, sanitary, and living point of view. </para>

                <para class="block">In 1896, before the determination of the Wages Board came into force, the average wage was &#163;1 9s. 7d. for all males, and 14s. id. for females, the general average being <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;i</inline> 9s. id.

As compared with the rates for 1896, those figures show an increase of 10s. 5d. per week to every person employed in the trade. We know that they cannot maintain these improved conditions unless they engage in political work, as the supporters of the provision in this Bill well know. Are trade unionists, some of whom have been victimized and boycotted, being asked to pay a fair price for this so-called preference to unionists&#39; provision? Take the plate-glass workers. In 1900, before the determination came into force, the average wage for all males in the trade was &#163;1 7s. 6d., and for adult males, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 3s. 3d. In 1901 the average wage for all males was &#163;1 15s. iod., while the average wage for adult males was ^2 10s. 4d.

In the pottery trade, before 1901, the average wage was ,&#163;1 8s. id., and for adult males it was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 17s. 7d. In 1901, under the determination of the Wages Board, the average wage was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 15s. 9d., and for adult males <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 4s. 6d. Last year the average wage for adult males was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 5s. 8d., and the general average for the trade was <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;i</inline> 1 6s. 4d., showing an average increase of 8s. 3d. for each employe. In the bookbinding trade in 1901, before the determination came into force, the average wage for all males was ^1 ns. id.; for all females, 11s. 7d., the general average being 19s. 9d. Last year the average for all males was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 12s. 4d. ; for all females 12s. 6d. ; the general average being <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 2s. id. These figures indicate an average increase of 2s. 4d. for each employe in the trade. I come next to the printing trade. The agitation for factory legislation in the printing trade, commenced in the first instance by the employe&#39;s, received the active support and cooperation of the employers - that is of those, who desired to recognise fair working conditions. The employing printers had for a long period to contend against boy-labour and cut-throat competition. They desired, in order to minimize, if .not absolutely to prevent that cut-throat competition, to be brought under the provisions of the- Factories Act. In 1901, before the determination of the board in the printing trade for the metropolitan district came into force, the average wage for all males was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 17s. 2d.; for all females, 13s. nd. ; the general average being <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 16s. iod. Last year the average for all males was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> os. fid. ; for all females, 13s. id.; the general average being <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 19s. These figures indicate an average increase of 2s. 2d. for each employe in the printing trade in the metropolitan district. As for the printing trade outside the metropolitan district in 1901, before the determination came into force, the average wage for all males was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 11s. id., the general average being <inline font-style="italic">-&#163;i</inline> 11s. Last year the average wage for all males was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;,1</inline> 17s. 8d., the general average being <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 13s. id. These figures indicate an average increase of 2s. id. for each employ in the printing trade outside the metropolitan district. I hope that I have not wearied honorable senators by these quotations from an official report, but I felt justified, in making them, desiring to show honorable senators that what they are asking the trade unionists to do will never be done. They are asking the unions to agree <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be brought under the provisions of this Bill, so that-they shall not be enabled to strike, but shall at the same time be debarred from engaging in any political action as organized bodies. Trade unionism and political organization seem to me to be inseparable. They go hand in hand in almost every country on the face of the earth. But here, in a so-called democratic country, an attempt is being made to throw back the cause of unionism to the condition in which it stood 100 years ago. So far as I am able to exercise a vote arid to raise my voice, I shall give no assistance in any such direction. Personally I should like to see the provision knocked out altogether. Those who express so much sympathy for the poor non-unionist never show any regard for him, except on occasions like these. </para>

                        <para>- The so-called &#34; unfortunate &#34; employers in the State of Victoria have, in many instances, desired to be brought under the operation of factories legislation. Many of them are men who are imbued .with humanitarian principles, who desire to pay their men fair wages, and to work them under reasonable conditions, with reasonable hours. But they are severely handicapped by employers who do not wish to recognise fair labour conditions, and have no desire to pay decent wages. The cry about the unfortunate non-unionist is a mere bogy. The non-unionists are not at all likely to be frightened by it. In the majority of cases non-unionist working men and women invariably record their votes for, and do all they can to return, Members of Parliament who do not desire the retention of provisions df this kind in Acts of Parliament. The poor non-unionist is like the poor widow of whom we heard so much at the time the agitation for factories legislation was in progress in Victoria. We never heard of the poor widow or of the old and slow worker until the Labour Party desired to make better conditions for unionists and non-unionists alike. Every labour senator, as I said on a previous occasion, has been returned by the active support and by the votes, not on&#39;ly of unionists, but of non-unionists; and if to-morrow the non-unionists of this country had to choose between voting against capitalistic conservative candidates such as those who seem to desire to retain this provision in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill and a labour man who desired to extend the principle of trade unionism, their votes would undoubtedly be recorded for the Labour Party. I have said sufficient to convince those who are open to argument that this provision is pernicious and that it is intended to be harmful and destructive of the growing labour movement. Because I feel that such is the case, and because I am satisfied that many of the supporters of it are the enemies o&#39;f the labour movement, I desire to see it struck out. I am convinced that the great body of the working men and women of this country, unionists and non-unionists alike, will agree that in our desire to strike out this provision we are actuated by a wish to promote their happiness and well-being. </para>

                    <para>- The earnest deliverance of the honorable senator who has just resumed his seat would be justified if the basis upon which he made it was correct. But, as a matter of &#34; fact, the honorable senator has completely evaded the provisions of this Bill. He has indicated to the Committee that a deliberate onslaught on trade unionism is intended. At times the honorable senator&#39;s &#34;speech approached violence in his resentment of this alleged onslaught. If his statements were in the remotest degree justified by the provisions of the Bill, the honorable senator&#39;s deliverance would be praiseworthy; but, as a matter of fact, probably every honorable senator is prepared to admit at once the valuable work that has been done not only in Victoria, but in the other States, by trade unions. It is not necessary for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> to enumerate the agitations which &#39;have resulted in the passage of Factories Acts, and to enlarge upon the splendid work achieved by the Wages Boards in the State of Victoria. We admit it all. We admit the many advantages which trade unionism has secured to the workers generally. But the proposal before the Senate does not in the remotest degree attack or injure any trade union. Every union will be at liberty to carry on under its State law, in precisely the same way as at present. The unions are not debarred from political agitation such as they have hitherto carried on. The very spirit of the Bill is that they shall be permitted to continue as in the past, and shall not be in any way prejudiced. There has been an agitation on the part of the workers generally, and on the part of those who sympathize with them, in favour of this Bill, and I- should have thought that the members of the Labour Party would be the most earnest in their desire to pass a reasonable measure, even if it meant the expenditure of a little trouble, in order to achieve the advantages and benefits of compulsory arbitration. I wish to point out to them that they can keep their trade unions at work if this provision is passed, but they are invited by the Bill to eliminate the political complexion of their unions for Federal purposes only. The members of the unions can federate if they like. There is very little trouble attached to duplicating the unions, and if they amalgamate, the various political organizations which have been associated with them in the past, and which are largely constituted of the members of the unions themselves, can be continued. </para>

All that trade unionists are asked to do - and they will readily do it - in order to gain the advantage accruing under this measure is, so to speak, to duplicate their unions, and make them organizations. Whether they are made organizations by duplication or otherwise, is a matter of no moment. They have simply to register an organization in order to secure the privileges conferred by this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I am showing honorable senators how it may be complied with. I am pointing out to the honorable senator that it will not be necessary to disturb in any way the trade unions which have done so much. I argue that they should be permitted to remain intact, but that the members of them under this clause will simply have to go to the small trouble of creating an organization in the spirit and terms of the measure. Surely nothing could be fairer or more reasonable? I admit, as honorable members opposite will admit, the difficulty of exactly defining the words &#34;political purposes.&#34; It is quite impossible to define them. If, with my honorable friends opposite, I could arrive at any satisfactory definition, I should gladly do so; but they recognise the difficulty as well as I do. It is all very well to say that the words &#34; political purposes &#34; mean political party agitations and operations. If that were their meaning honorable senators opposite would, perhaps be more or less agreeable to such a provision. . But they do not know exactly what the words &#34; political purposes &#34; mean, or where they might land them. The argument they seek to adduce in that respect, however, may also be fairly advanced from an opposite stand-point. As a matter of fact, the only object is to protect those who do not happen to belong to a trade union from undue oppression, and to give them the same fair freedom of conscience and action as they have hitherto enjoyed, notwithstanding all the great advantages of being associated with unions. I have sought to demonstrate, although, perhaps, I have not done so, to the satisfaction of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> that whilst I admit all that he has said with regard to the value of trade unions, this Bill does not in the remotest degree attack those unions or discount their advantages. </para>

                <para class="block">It has been asserted during the debate that this clause is an innovation, and that we do nor find its parallel in any Conciliation and Arbitration Act in operation. The last division has gone against honorable senators on this side, and whilst we recognise that in giving away anything in this regard we are temporizing with the principle that the political rights of any section of the community should not be interfered with by law, we feel that it is necessary to do something to minimize that interference as much as possible. Before unionists would be able to take advantage of the principle of compulsory arbitration, they would be compelled, under the clause as it stands, to give away some of their rights as citizens. We are all anxious that that invasion of principle shall be avoided as far as possible, but we recognise that the argument, that by granting preference to unionists we may force men .to join unions whose political faith differs from that of the original members, deserves some consideration. I think it has been admitted by every honorable senator who has spoken that it is impossible to arrive at a reasonable definition of the words, &#34; political actions.&#34; The difficulty was clearly pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> and I agree with him that the ramifications of these words are so great that it would be almost impossible to embody in the Bill itself any satisfactory . definition of them. Every society in Australia, whether it be a trade union, a religious body, or a medical league, participates more or less in politics. </para>

                        <para>- When this clause was being debated in another place, two members of the medical profession showed that the British Medical Association interfered in political matters to such an extent that it actually had a parliamentary committee. Why does it require such a committee, if it takes no part in politics? The honorable senator must see that even the medical societies dabble in politics just as every religious sect does. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has reason to know that they certainly take an interest in the&#39; divorce laws. It cannot be denied that they take part in politics. It has been argued that men might be forced into unions to support a political party. The members of the Labour Party should be the last to do anything of that kind. Political liberty has been fought hard for by the party to which I belong, and we recognise the unfairness of compelling by law any individual to support any political party. We hold that political liberty, should be given to every member of a union, and the amendment which I have moved will, I think, meet all the reasonable objections of those who had scruples about supporting our last amendment, for fear that it would allow members of unions to be forced to support political parties. Under my amendment, no member of a union will be required to subscribe money for, or to vote at elections for, any political party. That is as reasonable a safeguard of the political liberties of members of unions as can be looked for. We must not, however, take from the unions the right to move in any political direction they may choose, so long as they do not force their members to support any political party. I would remind Senators Smith and Matheson of the actions of the organizations in Western Australia with which&#39; they are familiar. In that State the trade organizations, with other public bodies, take a hand in almost every public movement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> will remember that the trade unions of the gold-fields, together with the trade unions of the coast, the municipal councils, friendly societies, road boards, and even some of the churches, took a hand in the work of the Separation League, of which he was president, and which forced the hand of those who were opposing Federation. </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree with the honorable senator. So long as a union has 100 members, it may register under this Bill, whether it is or is not affiliated to unions in other States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> while Mayor of Kalgoorlie, presided at a convention in that town whose object was to secure the extension of parliamentary representation to the goldfields. At that convention there were represented trade unions, municipal councils, road boards, friendly societies, and other public bodies. A trade union registered under the Bill could not take that action. Honorable senators must see that if we prevent the unions from interfering in matters of this kind, we shall be doing great injustice. There are many social reforms which have been agitated for by trade unions. The ventilation and sanitary condition of the mines of Victoria is. perhaps, as bad as are to be found in any part of the civilized world, but if the Amalgamated Miners&#39; Association, which has always declared that it has nothing to do with party politics, were registered under the Bill, it could not set going an agitation for the better ventilation of the deep levels of Ballarat and Bendigo, and at the same time take advantage of the preference which is offered. These seem to me good and sufficient reasons why honorable senators should consider if they will act wisely in opposing the amendment. I appeal to them not to allow their party feeling to so influence them that the Bill will be useless. So far as Western Australia is concerned, not a union there is likely to register under the measure. At any rate, they do not require it so much that they will be willing to prevent themselves from taking political action in order to secure the advantages which it offers, since the State Arbitration Act is sufficient for the settlement of their disputes. They are not likely to be affected, whether the Bill is passed or thrown into the waste paper basket. </para>

                        <para>- I see no reason for striking out the proviso if the half-loaf argument is to prevail, and honorable senators are content to allow the organizations to be half instead of wholly political. In the first place, I should like to know why it is proposed to insert the amendment after the word &#34; rules.&#34; If the words &#34;or other binding decisions.&#34; are left in, and the operation of the amendment is confined to the rules, the object in view could be defeated by the passing of a resolution. </para>

I assure the honorable and learned senator that I attach to the word &#34; rules &#39; &#39; the same importance as does the average trade unionist. At meetings of trade unionists the rules of the union are referred to with as much solemnity as though they were the Holy Scriptures themselves. Honorable senators can rely upon it that trade unionists will stand by anything which appears in their rules, but they do not attach the same importance to what might be called resolutions&#34; or binding decisions. I omitted the reference to binding decisions in my amendment, because the same importance is not attached to them by trade unionists. </para>

                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator TRENWITH</inline>(Victoria).- I gathered from the tone of the Attorney-General&#39;s remarks, that it seemed to him that, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie included the words &#34; or other binding decisions &#39; &#39; in his amendment, that would be sufficient. The honorable and learned senator has said that that is not so. I have no quarrel with him on that account. I point out that all along it has been claimed that there was a danger that if preference were given to trade, unionists by an award of the Court, the effect would be to compel persons to become unionists, who would not otherwise do so, and in view of the fact that unions are political organizations, persons who joined them would be compelled to subscribe to political doctrines in which they did not believe. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s amendment removes any possible danger of that kind? If it is agreed to, any organization which, through its rules or other binding decisions, permits its funds to be used to support any political party, or. permits its members to support the election of any party candidate, will be deprived of any preference we give under this measure to trade unionists. The amendment will not prevent trade unionists from doing these things but it will prevent them from&#39; getting preference under this Bill if they do them, and that is all that is sought. </para>

The amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is explicit and definite, and any one can see at a glance exactly what it means. The question for us to consider now is whether . it goes far enough to remove the danger&#39; which exists &#39;in the &#34;minds of some honorable senators. I have several times said that I see no danger, but I admit that it is reasonable on the part of those who do that provision should be made to guard against it. I venture to submit that if the declarations of those honorable senators are <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline> and if the danger which they profess to see is of the character they describe - and I do not doubt their professions for a. moment- the amendment will cover all that the)&#39; desire, unless they wish to go to the extreme length indicated in some of the speeches of this afternoon. I have ventured to submit some instances in which political action of a certain character is absolutely imperative, in connexion with every organization of which I can conceive, but political action of such a character as to present no public menace. I mentioned instances which are typical of hundreds, and possibly of thousands of instances which may be eked, in which organized bodies might be called upon to take political action, and with respect to these instances, the Attorney-General said that this .proviso would not apply, as the political action to which I referred would not be political action within the meaning of the clause. I have no desire to twit honorable senators who contend that there is a danger, which the clause is required to meet, with insincerity, but I admit that the danger they have presented, and the evils which they have contended might result if there were no restriction upon the political action of trade unionists, will be sufficiently guarded against by the amendment. Under the amendment trade organizations, by their rules, or any other binding decisions, must not permit- </para>

                        <para>- Speaking for myself, I would say that if it would satisfy the Attorney-General and honorable senators who object to the position taken up by myself and others, I should have no objection to the use of the word &#34; permit &#34; in the amendment, but it must have reference to the special&#39; form of political action contemplated. What I object to is the extension of the proviso to any and all political action. That would be too wide and far-reaching, and under such a proviso we should never know when we would be safe. I desire that whilst providing a safeguard against the dangers which have been suggested, the proviso on which we agree should not extend to what we might all admit is perfectly legitimate political action. I earnestly beg of the Attorney-General to give consideration to the amendment, and I beg honorable senators on this side who have opposed the striking out of the proviso to consider whether - now that the Committee has not been able to agree to the omission of the proviso - it would not be a fair, reasonable, gracious, and safe thing to accept what those who desired to strike out the proviso are willing to substitute for its vague, indefinite, and far-reaching terms. I hope we shall be able to settle this question on the basis now laid down. The amendment involves restrictions deplored by some of those who are prepared to vote for it, but, speaking for myself, I have no regret about that. I think that the danger which has been suggested does not exist, but I .say that if there is the shadow of a danger that persons may be coerced or tyrannized, it should be removed. The amendment will remove every possible danger that might arise under the clause as it now stands. </para>

At the same time, having arrived at a very strong conviction on the various points of controversy in the Bill, it will take a good deal of argument to unsettle my mind or induce me to deviate from the words of the clause which. I think, are very well considered. My honorable friend has come one step towards me- </para>

I am sure my honorable friends are perfectly sincere in their advocacy of this amendment, and I should have been glad if they had been candid enough to tell me of their intention to move the amendment, so that I might have given it fuller consideration at an earlier stage. </para>

                        <para>- No; and I shall give my reason for that. I want honorable senators opposite to respond to an appeal similar to that which was made to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> and consider whether they should not withdraw the amendment. I think that they will agree with me that, in view of their own arguments in favour of striking out this provision altogether, their amendment would be absolutely worthless, not from their point of view, but for the purposes for which the provision was inserted in the Bill. I think that it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> who said that there was no compulsion in the rules of any of the organizations, either to subscribe to the funds or to support any particular political party. </para>

                        <para>- No. I cannot understand why an effort should be made to restrict the operation of the provision - if it is to have any operation at all - to organizations which have rules compelling members to vole for or subscribe to the funds: of any particular party, and why it should not be made equally applicable to organizations which are political, because they permit their funds to be used for political purposes. It seems to me that if an organization has political as well as industrial objects, the vice in that respect is just as great and is just as much to be guarded against if it permits its funds to be used as if it compels its members to subscribe for such purposes.

Perhaps it will be convenient for me at this stage to say a few words in reply to some remarks which fell from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> yesterday. He asked whether it was intended to destroy the Labour Party as a political organization, to sweep away any semblance of political organization - whether it was intended to destroy the political Labour Party as such. I assure honorable senators that there is no such intention. I tried to make that clear yesterday, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> made it absolutely plain in the course of his interjections, and the speech he delivered earlier this afternoon. </para>

                        <para>- That may or may not be ; I do not think so. Every trade union and association is entitled to make its organization political as well as industrial. It is entitled to enter into political fights as much as it pleases, to spend its funds, if its members permit, as freely as it likes in support of the Government on the one hand or of the Opposition on the other. My honorable friends must remember that they are now His Majesty&#39;s direct Opposition, and (hat every trade association which is, as they say, a political association as well as an industrial organization, is an instrument not only of political propagandism, but of party political strife, and would be used, as it may be perfectly right that it should be used, for the purpose of promoting the interest of the political party which was working in the direction it desired. This Bill is not intended to destroy the political character of the unions or their political power.

                        <para>- That is a matter to be determined. All this clause does is to define as far as it can - the definition is difficult - an organization which is political as well as industrial. Consistently with this amendment, the unions have a political status altogether untouched. An organization might be an active political association, because, provided that it had no rule compelling or requiring its members to vote for or subscribe to the funds of any political party, it might permit its funds to be used for political purposes, and to be expended for the purpose of any electoral campaign in aid of its own party purposes. </para>

                        <para>- My . honorable friend draws an inference different from that which I deduce. I desire to emphasize what was stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> this afternoon. It must be remembered that an organization under this Bill is not an existing organization - it may consist of the same members - but must be subject to registration under this Bill, and as an organization for the purpose of the Bill it has no business to be political in any sense of the term. I cannot understand the contention that it should be political, or have any political object. I do not agree with the further extension of the idea expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> as to the necessity of having Federal organizations all over the Commonwealth, but &#39; everybody must agree that under the Bill there must be registration, and that registration is complete if it is effected in conformity with the terms of the Act, which requires, in the case of employes, the association of at least 100 persons. What I wish to point out is that, consistently with this amendment, an organization may be an absolutely political body, the only reservation being that if the rules compel the members to vote for or subscribe to the funds of any political party they shall not enjoy preference. If honorable senators are prepared to go that far they ought to go the whole length, because the question is whether the objects of the organization are political. </para>

                        <para>- But your amendment will not prevent it. My honorable friend must see that any organization which permits its funds to be used for party purposes is just as much a political organization as if it had a rule compelling a member to subscribe to party funds. The funds which are referred to in his amendment, are not the funds of the union, but of an outside political party. </para>

                        <para>- That is not my honorable friend&#39;s amendment, and if he says that he cuts the ground from under his feet, and there is no reason why he should not support the clause as it stands. I admit the difficulty of definition. In many cases, the English language is not capable of securing an absolutely scientific definition of many things. We can only get as near to it as we can. This proviso is simply a definition of the political character of the organization which is not to have preference. </para>

                        <para>- No; what I mean is that the Seamen&#39;s Union in South Australia, if it is a political; as well as an industrial union, is not interfered with in the slightest degree. It may be used as a political organization to-morrow. But when they, or a hundred of its members, register as an organization under the Act, I presume with a different set of rules, then, if they form a political organization, they can get no preference, and there is no reason why they should. The view I take of the amendment is that it does not touch the object aimed at by the proviso, that consistently with the amendment, if it were included in the proviso, the vice would still exist. If, as I understand, the carrying of this amendment will involve the omission of the remaining words, it will be simply substituting something which will destroy the whole effect of the proviso. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators who advance that argument must refer to the definition clause. An existing association may register as an1 organization under this Bill. That is clear. It undoubtedly has that privilege. It may take proceedings before the Arbitration Court in order to assert its rights, and have justice done to it. It may obtain an award, and may obtain preference. But if it is a political organization, or has a political purpose, it cannot get preference. That is all. It is simply a question of whether it is to be entitled to the privilege of preference or not, the preference being as between two men, the one a member of the organization, and the other not a member. The man who is not a member of the organization must go to the wall as regards employment, or he must become a member of the organization in order to be placed upon the same level as a member of it. If he is opposed to its political platform, supposing that it has a political platform, he must sacrifice his principles to that extent for the sake of being put upon the same level as his fellow, who is a member. </para>

                        <para>- I think it will be so even in that case. That being the state of things the amendment originally proposed was that no such organization should be entitled to submit any industrial dispute to the Court. That was a very far-reaching proposal. For my own part, I say frankly that I only desire that this Bill shall, as far as possible, make it clear that no man&#39;s political freedom shall be in any way entangled or affected by any provision of the Bill. The highest and most precious possession we have is our political freedom. What I have explained was what was originally proposed. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to point out who are the men to whom we are indebted for the words as they stand. During the debate it was said by the present Prime Minister, that the object of having some such provision in the Bill was - to let the judge know before he exercises his own sweet will upon the subject that there shall be no element of choice as between politics and bread. </para>

                <para class="block">The present Prime Minister said &#34;I Bo.&#34; Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> said. &#34;I agree with him.&#34; The idea of inserting this provision as a condition of preference, is the idea of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs,</inline> and his friends, who cannot be said to be out of sympathy with my honorable friends opposite. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> said, yesterday, that those who supported that proposal did so with a view to stem the progress of the Labour Party, or something of that kind. It was said that it was intended to draw the chains tighter, and to infringe upon the privileges of the trade unions. My honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> said, &#34; I cannot say who invented this, but whoever invented it must have been inspired by malignity, and by a desire to emasculate the clause.&#34; That is very strong condemnation to use concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom.</inline> It is a very strong condemnation of those who said this was a fair thing. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> had given expression to that idea, it was taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom,</inline> who moved the amendment to strike out what had been previously proposed, that political organizations should not be entitled even to go to the Court or to institute a suit ; and he proposed to substitute merely the words as they stand now, depriving the unions of the privilege of preference if they were political organizations. When that was done, my honorable friend the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> said that he accepted &#34; the spirit &#34; of that amendment. The amendment having been moved, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> again said that he was prepared to accept an amendment - which would have the effect of preventing preference being given to unions if they have in their rules anything relating to politics which is likely to detrimentally affect any persons who may desire to join them. </para>

                <para class="block">So that these words are not the words of those who are in opposition to my honorable friends opposite, but they are the words of their friends and allies; and I think that we are entitled to assume that words of that character are to be taken as fully expressing the intention of all parties. </para>
