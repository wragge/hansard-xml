                        <para>- I know that it has.' But I have thought over the matter, and come to the conclusion that it is a most objectionable practice for honorable senators to move motions, without notice, even with the consent of the Senate. There may be only twelve senators present, and, if no one objects, a motion may be moved and carried of which the majority of the senators have had no notice. This is one of the matters, in which I think that a practice ought to be laid down. I do not think that a motion ought to be moved without notice unless the Standing Orders are suspended, which' can be done at any time by an absolute majority pf the Senate. Standing Order 100 was made to prevent motions from being moved without notice, and carried, to which the majority of the Senate may be opposed. But if motions are moved- without notice, simply by leave of the Senate, when possibly only twelve senators are present, all of whom may be favorable to the motion, the other twenty-four senators, who may be strongly opposed to the motion, will have no opportunity of voting against such motion. I think that the practice is objectionable, and ought not to be permitted. I acknowledge that this has been done, but it has been done inadvertently. I believe that this practice may lead to most undesirable results. In my opinion, motions ought not to be moved without notice, unless the Standing Orders are suspended. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> will give notice of the motion for to-morrow, the Government will have no objection to its being treated as formal business. I shall endeavour to have the paper with me, when I will lay it upon the table, and move that it be printed before the notice of motion is called on. </para>

It seems to me that so long as that standing order remains as it is, every senator has the right to take advantage of' it, and that practically we ought not to repeal its operation without very grave consideration.

                        <para>- There is no doubt, sir, that the reasons given by you are exceedingly weighty reasons for the Senate to give this concession with great caution. They are very strong reasons to be taken into consideration by the Senate before- granting leave, but I think that it would be a dangerous thing for us to whittle away the right which the standing order confers on honorable senators. The reasons which are suggested might, on a particular motion, be very strong reasons for withholding the leave; but, in introducing the standing order into our code, it was recognised that, in cases of urgency, or in cases where it was unnecessary that notice should be given, or in cases where the Senate might be unanimous, there ought to be, no obstacle placed in the way of any honorable senator from moving a particular motion. Under the standing order, the Senate has the power in its own hands. </para>

                        <para>- That course is intended for a different purpose. A senator can only move the adjournment of the Senate, with a view to ventilate a subject of urgency ; he cannot submit a motion on a subject. But standing order 109 places it in the power of the Senate to allow a senator to move a motion which may be carried, and may produce some result. If the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> is one which the Senate feels might well be moved at once, it is a pity that he should not be permitted to move it, otherwise it is throwing doubt on the efficacy of the standing order. </para>

Before he moves his motion, if it can be moved, we ought to deal with notices of motions and questions, the answers to questions on notice, and the re-arrangement of business. </para>

I should be very happy to compile one which might have some weight with honorable senators in inducing them to select Bombala as the site of the Federal Capital. What is now proposed appears to be a very peculiar way of bringing pressure to bear on honorable members to induce them to select a particular site, because the obvious intention is to influence honorable senators in their determination. I hope we shall be told whether the report asked for was compiled by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest after he resigned office as Minister of Home Affairs. </para>

                    If this is the same document, I should be glad to know it before I am called upon to vote on this motion.

If an unofficial document of this character is to be laid upon the table, some honorable senator should make a motion to that effect. </para>

Still we might have it for what it is worth, and I can see no objection to its being laid upon the table if honorable senators desire to see it. I am one of those who wish to obtain all the information which can be got in connexion with the proposed sites for the Federal Capital. I have not been able to visit them myself, and I have, therefore, to depend very largely on the opinions of others. If from any source we can get further evidence to guide us in the selection of a site we should do no harm in obtaining it. </para>

                        has scarcely put the position fairly in asking us to regard the report called for as. being entirely an unofficial document. The fact is that the preparation of the document was begun by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline>
                        Forrest when he was Minister of Home Affairs, and it, therefore, carries with it something more than an unofficial stamp. As it probably throws some light on the merits of various suggested sites, I do not see why it should not be laid upon the table. I cannot understand the conflicting attitude of Senators Pearce and Millen.

                    <para>- A great deal that I intended to say on the motion has already been said by other honorable senators. I shall not oppose the motion for one reason already given, that had <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest remained in office a few days longer, the report now asked for would have been an official document. Another reason is that this document may throw a little more light on the subject, because we are aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest is a surveyor by profession, and is in a position to give evidence of value in helping us to arrive at a proper conclusion. I make the statement straight out that I am in favour of Bombala, no matter what is contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> John Forrest's document. I have already read the substance of the document in the press, and I saw nothing in it to induce me to change my opinion. There may be something in the document which will cause honorable senators who are now in favour of Lyndhurst to look with more favorable eyes on Bombala. No harm can be done by agreeing to the motion. This cannot be considered as a precedent, because no other paper of the kind can be laid upon the table without a motion first being moved. </para>

The report for which I am asking is really the balance of a general report, prepared by

                    Forrest, and started when he was Minister of Home Affairs. The right honorable gentleman determined to report on three sites, the Monaro site, Tumut, and Lyndhurst. After he had reported on two of the sites, the tenure of office of the Ministry of which he was a member came to an end.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline>
                    Forrest subsequently visited Lyndhurst, and made the report which I seek to have placed' upon the" table.

                    Forrest, as Minister of Home Affairs, will be of very little use to us, unless we have the document for which I am asking, as it is but the completion of that report; and we require it for purposes of comparison. We have a report on Bombala, and the merits of that site are compared on a specific basis with important features connected with Tumut. Without a report on the advantages or disadvantages of Lyndhurst, for purposes of comparison, the portion of the report which we already have will be of little value.

                    <para>- I wish to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council, if, without entering into any details, ha can intimate whether the Bill he proposes to introduce is substantially the same as the Merchandise Marks Bill, introduced by the late Government. My reason for asking is that I carefully compared the Bill introduced by the late Government with the English law on the subject, and found that it was substantially a reproduction of the English law. I do not wish to have to go through the same process in connexion with this Bill if it is substantially the same.' If the honorable senator could give the intimation I ask for, it would te of great convenience. </para>

                    <para class="block">In introducing this Bill, I am only carrying out a work that was commenced by the previous Government. This Bill differs in but a very small- degree from that which was previously before Parliament. I shall point out the differences as I go along. Every honorable senator will recognise that there is nothing of a party character in the measure. I believe that every honorable senator has his own opinion with respect to the most suitable site for the Seat of Government for the Commonwealth, and will be prepared to express his opinion in support of the site he favours, as compared with any other. Like the former Ministry, the members of the present Government are divided in opinion as to the locality which should be chosen for the seat of Government. Some think that one place, and some that another, is the most suitable for the purpose. There should, therefore, be no opposition to a measure of this kind because the Government introduce it. I . should like to give some reasons why we should, as soon as possible, fix on a site for the Federal Capital. The first reason is, that it is plainly indicated in the Constitution that as soon as possible the Government of the Commonwealth should be carried on within territory, and at a Capital entirely controlled by, and belonging to, the Commonwealth. That is indicated by the Constitution, and it is our duty, I think, as soon as we possibly can, to carry out the intention of the framers of that Constitution. There are other reasons of a different character. While Melbourne, in the minds of some people, would be a very pleasant place in which to carry on the Government, there are others who may think that Sydney would be a pleasant place. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> according to his opinions, expressed in the Convention, would rather have Mount Gambier selected. We all differ in that respect. </para>

                            <para>- Naturally, I entirely agree with the honorable and learned senator in that opinion ; but the Constitution does not permit us to select either of those places. There is also this to be said. According to our experience up to the present time, the Commonwealth is paying quite enough in respect to the cost of government in Melbourne to justify lis in. selecting a place of our own. In Melbourne we have to obtain - sometimes after a considerable amount of difficulty - offices to carry on the administrative work of the Government. First of all, we- have a difficulty in getting such offices. When we do get them, we find that in many instances they are not at all suitable for the purposes for which they are rented. We also have to pay such a very high rental that it would be far better for us to be somewhere in the bush where land values would be lower, and where we could get much better accommodation for a smaller amount of money. </para>

                            <para>-At present, in rent for offices that are necessary, we pay an amount of over .£3,000 per annum. But, supposing that it were ultimately decided to remain in a place like Melbourne, and we were permanently to occupy a building like this, do honorable senators think it would be fair to expect the State Government to allow us to do . so without paying rent? I am sure that no one would expect any such thing. This building, up to the present time, has cost over £800,000, and before it could be finished it would cost nearly £1,250,000. We should be expected to pay the interest ' on that amount. That will give honorable senators an idea of what it would cost the Commonwealth Government to remain in Melbourne. If we went to Sydney, I dare say it would not cost a penny less. On the other hand, suppose we were not to continue in occupation of this building, but. nevertheless, decide to remain in Melbourne, or go to Sydney. What should we have to do i We should have to resume, or acquire, or have granted to us. some place on which te build an edifice such as we have here. We might not go to the same expense as has been incurred on this building. But what would it cost to buy either in Melbourne or Sydney suitable land on which to build? It would cost at least £500,000. When we had acquired the site, we should be expected to put up buildings somewhat in harmony with the surroundings, and those buildings would not . cost less than £500,000. So that honorable senator:-, can form an ' idea of the expenditure that would be incurred in remaining in Melbourne. But there is another consideration. If 'we were to go to a territory selected in the State of New South Wales, as provided by "the Constitution, and were to put up buildings there, even if they cost us £1,000,000, the value added to the territory would belong entirely to the Commonwealth. But if we spent money in Melbourne or Sydney, the Commonwealth would receive very little in the way of return. It would go mostly into the pockets of private land-owners or speculators. We have no desire to do anything that would injure these gentlemen, but -we have also no desire to do anything to put money into their pockets at the cost of the people of Australia. That is one of the most substantial reasons why, as soon as possible, we should shift to a Capital of our own. . Some people imagine - and expression has been given to the idea in the press, and from many a platform in Victoria and New South Wales - that we are going to spend the money of the people of Australia lavishly in some bush capital, amongst kangaroos and emus. How absurd such an idea is ! Yet some people spend hours in endeavouring to demonstrate that it is true. </para>

                            <para>- Well, such people are hardly accountable for their actions or opinions. I think I have indicated what it means to remain settled either in Melbourne or Sydney or in any State capital; and J shall show later on that such n course had never, or seldom, been followed by any of the federations or confederations that have been formed. If we do go to one of these outlandish places where there are no roads, railways, bridges, or anything of that description, and the territory becomes the absolute property of the Commonwealth, every pound we spend in the erection of Commonwealth buildings, such as Parliament Houses, offices for carrying on the administrative work, roads, streets, bridges, water conservation, or railways, will be adding value to property that belongs to the people of Australia. That is a position which we should look at seriously; and it furnishes a very good reason why, as soon as we possibly can, we should shift to this bush capital that we have heard spoken of so often in derision. Before asking honorable senators to consider or to vote on the clauses of the Bill, or to make amendments in it, I think it would be desirable as far as lies in my power to give the Senate, as shortly as I can, an account of the1 e'xperience of other countries. I intend to deal entirely with English-speaking peoples. If we turn to Canada, what position do we find there? We find that before 1840 Canada was divided into two Provinces - Upper and Lower Canada. The people came to the conclusion that if they formed a kind of union or alliance - or whatever it might be called - it would be well for them to have a common Seat of Government. They left the Governor to decided where it should be. He selected a place called Kingstown; and I think that that would be a very good name for the Federal Capital. Dickens' opinion, when he visited that place, was that Kingstown was a place, one half of which was burnt down, and the other half not yet built up. But he had no idea how that place would turn out in days to come. Instead of its being a delapidated town now, we find that it has a very important commercial position. Then the people of Canada decided to make Montreal the Seat of Government. But, for one reason or another, the people of Montreal thought that things' were not going as they ought to go, and the mob behaved in such a manner as to set lire to the Parliament House. This conduct disgusted the representatives of the people, who then thought that the best thing they could do was to adopt a suggestion very similar to that put forward here by my honorable and learned friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> That was that they should have a migratory Seat of Government ; and as there were only two Provinces, Upper and Lower Canada, they made up their minds that they would hold the Seat of Government alternately in Quebec and Toronto. They carried on this system for a little while, but it was very unsatisfactory - just' as any proposition such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has indicated would be unsatisfactory in Australia - and, not being equal to the settlement of the question themselves, they asked Her late Majesty Queen Victoria to settle it for them. In 1857 she decided that the capital of the Dominion should be on the banks of the Ottawa, and Ottawa was mentioned as the name 10 be affixed to the locality where Her Majesty - no doubt, with the advice of those in authority - selected the site. In the first instance, the Canadians rejected the proposed site, but next year they accepted it; and from the time of the acceptation of Ottawa as the Seat of Government of Canada I do not think that any regret has been expressed up to the present. I want to point out the differences in ths situation between Canada and Australia. I think that the Seat of Government in Canada was selected in 1857. The Federation of Canada did not take place until 1867. So that really the Canadians had a Seat of Government provided for them before Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick - which were the original States of the Canadian Union - became federated. In 1870, 1871, and 1873 respectively, Manitoba, British Columbia, and Prince Edward Island came into the Federation. A magnificent place was made of Ottawa - a place for which almost every Canadian who has ever visited it, or has any knowledge of it, has a great feeling . of patriotic pride. The Canadians regard their capital city as one of the most glorious places in the world ; and from every description of it which I have seen or heard, I think they are justly entitled to entertain those feelings. It took them a very long time before they established a city of any importance in that part of the world. But in 1891 the population of Ottawa amounted to over 44,000 souls. Those figures show how it grew, and there is every possibility that the Federal territory which will be granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth Government, will show the same, or even greater, results in the way of progress. Adjoining Canada is another Federation - the United States of America. Most honor- able senators know, from the history of that country, that when the United States seceded from British rule, they had a kind of Federation, and were looking for a Seat of Government. But it was many years before they came to a decision in that regard. Their experience was exactly of the same character as that of Canada. First the Seat of Government of the Federation was located in Philadelphia. They had some trouble with the soldiers there, and they removed to Princetown, in New Jersey. That locality did not satisfy them, and from time to time - from motives exhibiting selfishness, and the same parochial feelings, that we sometimes see exhibited in Australia - the claims of New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore were advocated. I dare say that a score of other places whose names to-day can scarcely be found on the map, were also advocated. But something occurred in the United States that assisted them in determining on a site for their Federal Capital - something that I do not think will ever occur in Australia. That was in connexion with the assumption of States debts by the Federal Government. The representatives of two parties, Jefferson and Hamilton - one representing the North, and the other the South - were both in favour of the assumption of the States debts. They determined that they would do all they possibly could to bring about that end. They thought that the easiest way to do it was by granting to Virginia and Maryland the honour of having the Seat of Government in their territory. The whole thing, according to the accounts I have ' read, was settled at a banquet over champagne and sherry. I do not think that we have had to do anything of that kind yet. </para>

                            <para>- I hope -there is a "good time coming." I want to point out the situation that existed in the United States, and the difference between that situation and the one existing in the States which form the Australian. Federation. Here we have every one of our States feeling that it will lose something; and if they are not ' afraid of losing something themselves, they are afraid that another State will gain an advantage over them. But in the United States, New York offered the Government of .the Federation the use of its Parliamentary buildings and offices; Philadelphia did the same; and Baltimore actually offered to raise the money to build new offices for the Federation. I do not hear of any State Government in Australia rushing to do anything of that description. When, through this agreement between Jefferson and Hamilton, it was ultimately decided that the seat of government should be ceded to Virginia and Maryland, what did the States do? If they were granted the Seat of Government, Virginia was prepared to pay $120,000 towards the cost of resuming land, and the erection of public buildings, on condition that Maryland should provide two-fifths of the amount, namely, $72,000. Afterwards the Government of Maryland lent the Federal Government a sum of $100,000 ; and I do not know whether it has ever been repaid. Here are the States of America rushing to assist the Federation to accomplish the object of good government, but we cannot get any offers of that description from the States of Australia up to the present time. Victoria is the only State that has really made a sacrifice, because she has given us the free use of her Houses of Parliament, and her Government House. The American Constitution provided that the Congress was to fix the Seat of Government, and that it was to be in a territory not exceeding ten miles square, that is 100 square miles. The Federation . has regretted that stipulation ever since, and has had to make many attempts to enlarge the area. It was from, the American experience, I believe, that the members of our Convention took the idea of having an area of 100 square miles, but, instead of saying that the area was not to exceed 100 square miles, they wisely said that it was not to be less than 100 square miles, thereby giving the people of the Commonwealth, through their representatives in Parliament, an opportunity of selecting an area in accordance with the' circumstances of the situation. Every one must recognise that in one locality it might be quite sufficient to have an area of 1,060 square miles, but that in another locality it would be much better to have an area of 5,000 square miles, and we must look at the question from that point of view. I wish to show the opportunities and advantages which the States of Virginia and Maryland gave to the Government of the Federation. They threw open for selection a piece of country extending from the eastern branch of the Potomac to Williamsport ' at the mouth of another tributary. The President of the Republic was deputed to select a site, and he had a range from the eastern branch of the Potomac to Williamsport, a distance of 'over 80 miles in which to make his ' selection. That is one reason why it would be wise to give whomsoever is to make the definite selection of a site for the Commonwealth, as wide a range as possible, always subject to the assent of this Parliament. The territory in which Washington is situated was described by those who were opposed to any proceeding of the kind, as nothing but a " howling, malarial wilderness," just as we in Australia have been told that the localities we have been considering are in the desert or the wilderness, and all that sort of thing. My desire is to warn honorable senators against those persons both inside and outside Parliament who talk about hot winds, dust-storms, and cyclones in one position, and blizzards and frosty biting winds in another. When the site was selected in America the landowners in the area gave to the Government all the land which was necessary for the purposes of public avenues, streets, and public reserves. Are we likely to get anybody in the Commonwealth to do this thing? I hope so, though I hardly expect it. In America, the rest of the land required was purchased from the owners, and it was purchased in a manner that was very advantageous at that time, although it may not have turned out so since. The Government took so many blocks, arid they only reserved so many blocks. From the sale of the blocks that they took, the Government got sufficient money to pay for the purchase. The original owners, by securing the unearned increment in what they still held, made very large profits, but 'still the Government got what they really required for absolutely nothing. I am afraid that we are scarcely in a position to make a similar bargain in any portion of New South Wales. But I do not think that we desire to do so. I hope that the people of Australia, through their representatives, will provide that all the unearned increment in whatever territory may be selected, shall belong to the Commonwealth. I might state that, up to a very recent date, the total sum spent on the buildings in Ottawa was about 8,000,000 dollars, or ^1,600,000; and the total sum spent at about that time in Washington was about 41,000,000 dollars, or .£8,200,000. Originally, both Ottawa and Washington were started in a very humble way, and I think that the progress which they have made has justified the action of their founders. We hear some persons saying that Australia is in an entirely different position from either Canada or America. They remind us of the area and the population of America as well as Canada, and they ask why should a population of less than 4,000,000 persons aspire to have a Federal Capital. In 1867, when the people of the North American Colonies decided to federate, they had a city which was suitable for the purposes of a Federal Capital - their population numbered only a little over 3,686,000 persons, while the people of the United States, when they went in for a Federal union and a Federal Capital, numbered only 3,639,000 persons. When, in 1901, a Constitution was drafted for Australia, which provided for a Federal Capital, its population numbered about 3.773,000; <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> that we were in exactly the same, if not a better position, than was either Canada or America at this time. We ought to take a lesson from the example of those countries, and I hope that we shall make the same progress as they have since they went in for a Federal Government. The Constitution Bill which was drafted in Sydney in 1891 provided that the Seat of Government should be determined by the Parliament ; that, until it was so determined, the Government should be carried on in some place within the Commonwealth, selected bv the Governors of the States ; and that, in the event of their not agreeing, it should be selected bv the Governor-General. The original draft of the Constitution Bill of 1897 provided, in clause 124, that the Federal Capital 'should be selected by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, ' and should be in a territory belonging to the' Commonwealth, and that, until that decision was made, the course prescribed in the Draft Constitution of 1891 should be followed. New South Wales, or some of her representatives, thought that the interests of that State had not been sufficiently well considered. In the Convention an attempt was made to provide in the Constitution that Sydney should be the Seat of Government ; but the proposal commanded -only five supporters. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr., now Sir, Alexander</inline> Peacock then moved that the Seat of Government should be in Melbourne, merely with the intention of showing that the representatives of Victoria were just as unselfish as the representatives ' of New South Wales, and his proposal commanded only three supporters. In the Draft Constitutions of 1891 and 1897 it was left entirely to the </para>

                    <para class="block">Parliament to say whether the Seat of Government should be in New South Wales or anywhere else. New South Wales did not accept the Constitution Bill of 1898, and; therefore, something had to be done. At the Premiers' Conference in Melbourne -a new method was adopted, and so section 125 of the Constitution provides that the Parliament of the Commonwealth shall select the Federal territory in New South "Wales, and that it shall not be less than 100 square miles in area, and distant not less than 100 miles from Sydney. It was provided, in order to satisfy some of the other States, that the Seat of Government was not to be within 100 miles of Sydney, and, in order to satisfy Victoria, that the Parliament was to sit in Melbourne until it selected a site. </para>

                            <para>- In every journal I have read except the labour journals, which are impartial. Some difficulty may arise in connexion with the acquisition of the territory in which the Seat of Government is to be' fixed. It will be remembered that section 125 of the Constitution not only provides for the selection of a site for the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth, but also provides for the territory in which that Seat of Government is to be located. And a difficulty has arisen in the minds of some persons with respect to the area which should be included in that territory. I have heard some persons say that the Government of New South Wales, unlike the Governments of Virginia and Baltimore, why rushed to the assistance of the Federal Government, not only with territory, but also with money, will not grant more than 100 square miles to the Commonwealth. The section also provides that the Federal territory is to be granted or acquired by the Commonwealth, and is to be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth, and that any Crown lands contained in that Federal territory are to be granted to the Commonwealth by the State without any payment therefor. I wish to say something else in connexion with that. When we come to deal with the question of area, we should consider what are the powers conferred on the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the Constitution. It is said that, because "not less than 100 square miles " is the term used in the Constitution, that only- means 101, 102, or 103 square miles; that, in fact, a very little additional area may be considered as fulfilling all the requirements of the Constitution ; but that, if we desired to secure an area of 200 or 2,000 square miles, that would be a. breach of the conditions laid down in the Constitution under which we federated, and which the people adopted. Those who hold such opinions should look at another portion of the section, which says - - shall be not less than. 100 miles distant from Sydney. </para>

                    <para class="block">If the section meant that the area to be acquired should be, say, 101, or 110 square miles, and that that would fill the conditions of the Constitution, the same thing should apply in. connexion with the distance from Sydney ; but no one has ever attempted to put that forward as an argument. If we can go 300 miles from Sydney to select a site for the Capital, we have just as much right to acquire 3,000 square miles as 300 or 100 square miles. </para>

If honorable senators will turn to section 52 of the Constitution they will find that the Commonwealth Parliament has power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to all places acquired' for public purposes, and if they turn to section 11 1 they will find that the Commonwealth Parliament can take any country under its control that may be ceded to the Commonwealth by a State. When these sections are taken in connexion with section 125 it will be seen that the Commonwealth Parliament has power, when the time arrives, to say, " This is the territory we want, and under our Property Acquisition Act we have power to take it." </para>

                            <para>- We could leave the people of New South Wales that territory, but it would not be necessary to do what the honorable senators suggest. I point out that we are required to acquire territory on "just terms," and it w.ould not be just to New South Wales to take away from that State any extent of territory which would be detrimental to its interests. But if it could be shown that we could take 5,000 square miles, not only without injuring New South Wales, but that by doing so we should be conferring an advantage on that State and the Commonwealth at the same time, the condition with respect to "just terms" would be fulfilled. If that could not be shown, the terms on which it was proposed to acquire that area would not be just. There are circumstances in which we could take 5,000 square miles without injury to New South Wales. The point I wish to make is that it does not matter what the people, of New South Wales think. They may, if they choose, cup up "rusty" ; but the Commonwealth Parliament has power to do what its members think proper in order to carry out the provisions of the Constitution. I hope that no friction will ever arise. I hope that when the Commonwealth Parliament has decided where the Seat of Government is to be we shall enter into peaceful negotiations with the authorities in New South Wales, and that -we shall find that they will be just as willing to carry out the provisions of the Constitution as are the authorities in any other State of the Commonwealth. I am convinced that they will. At present there may be a little friction, but that is only because- there is jealousy' and rivalry, between one proposed locality and another. </para>

                            <para>- We are on a different point now. Under section 125 there may be some room for doubt as to its interpretation with respect to the Government of New South Wales ceding to the Commonwealth all the land in the Federal territory that is Crown land. If the Crown lands to be ceded were of a worthless character, and unoccupied, no difficulty might be raised in New South Wales to the granting of them to the Commonwealth. But if those lands were leased and returning a considerable rent to the Government of New South Wales, or if the Government were deriving a considerable amount in taxation through their occupation, there might be some objection in the minds* of the people of that State to granting them to the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- That is a different thing. The section says also that all Crown lands within the territory shall be granted. But " acquired " in that section means acquired from an individual or the State of New South Wales. I now refer to other Crown lands ; and if there is a difference of opinion with respect to what are "just terms" in the proposed acquisition of Crown lands that may be occupied, and returning revenue to the State by way of rent or taxation, is there not the High Court to go to for the settlement of a question of that description also? </para>

                            <para>- But the people of New South Wales or the Parliament of that State may object to it, and I am pointing out that there need be no difficulty in settling the question through the medium of the tribunal which the Constitution has established above even the Commonwealth Parliament. With respect to the. area to be acquired, though I may differ from other honorable senators, and from other members of the present Ministry, I have always expressed the opinion that we should have a sufficient area, so as not to allow the unearned increment which will follow the building and improvement of the Federal Capital to extend beyond the bounds of the Federal territory. In this respect, I point out that 100 square miles is nothing. If we take Melbourne, for instance, what will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> tell us is the boundary of the influence of the improvement of this city? It extends beyond Mordialloc, sixteen or seventeen miles from here. It extends beyond Williamstown, and beyond Braybrook. </para>

                            <para>- And the Federal authorities have been sorry ever since that they did not secure 3..000 instead of 100 square miles. We hope that in the near future the Capital of the Commonwealth will be a city of importance. It will greatly depend on the locality in which it is to be situated, how soon that time may arrive. If the Capital is established in one place it may never be important. It may be as Kingstown was in Canada, for when that city was burnt down it was abandoned. It may be as Princetown or Germantown was in the United States of America, never occupied for any length of time. Germantown was approved in one session and rejected in. the next,- and it was 'rejected for very good reasons. Here we should have a territory in which the Federal city will have some chance to improve, and I am trying to show that it must comprise an area of much more than 100 square miles. If we go east, west, south, and north, for fifteen miles to reach the boundaries of the growth of greater Melbourne we have an area of over 450 square miles, and I ask honorable senators what the area will be in 100 years? </para>

                            <para>- I hope that continued improvement will alter conditions to a much greater extent in the near future. The result is that fewer people are required to live on the land, and a greater number in the manufacturing centres. That is an economic truth which no one will deny. I am not in favour of centralization any more than is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> but I am pointing out that with respect to the cities I have mentioned 100 square miles is not one-tenth of the area which is required for them. So far as my private opinion is concerned, it would be much better if the Commonwealth Parliament elected to acquire a territory of 5,000 square miles. </para>

If honorable senators will take the 36th parallel of latitude from the sea to its junction with the River Murray, and take the Victorian border east from there, they will see that a territory is included which has not been developed to any material extent by New South Wales. The Government of .that State is getting very little revenue from that territory, and is never likely to do much with it.

If, on the contrary, the Federal Capital is located at Lyndhurst, or Bathurst, in some little valley where there is no room for expansion, in a country which is not worth living in, and where there are only crows to keep one company, we shall be endangering the prospects of its growth, and . doing an injury and an injustice to the Commonwealth. I have endeavoured to explain the experiences of other countries. I have given a history of the means devised for securing this Federal Capital for New South Wales, and have shown how they have been developed by the different Conventions which have been held for the establishment of the Commonwealth. As I have no desire to occupy the time of the Senate at too great a length, I think it is my duty now to deal with the Bill itself. If honorable senators will take the trouble to look at the measure, they will find that it is only a short Bill of four clauses. Clause 2 provides that the site shall be selected somewhere twenty-five miles from "blank." </para>

I know where I should like it to be, and probably other honorable senators are in the same position. We have had reports on the various sites, and honorable senators have had opportunities of visiting them. I think that our minds ought to be made up by this time. Clause 3 provides for the area of the Federal territory. There has been a slight departure from the propositions put forward by the late Government in this instance. Under this Bill the area of the territory is to be " not less than the area contained bv a square whose side is thirty miles in length." </para>

Such an area would certainly include Twofold Bay. It will be seen from the construction of the clause that it is not absolutely necessary that the area should be a square. It must be an area equal to a space whose side is thirty- miles in length; so that the territory may be of irregular shape. </para>

                            <para>- I do not suppose that the Government will resign if the clause is altered to "not less than a thousand square miles." The fourth clause provides for the granting and acquisition of the territory. I think that all these clauses are absolutely necessary in a Bill of this description. I have every confidence in putting the Bill before honorable senators. I believe they will give it fair play; and when it is passed by the Senate - as I am almost certain it will pass - and goes down to another place, I think that the discussion that will take place here and the influence of the vote that is given by the Senate will so affect the opinion of honorable members in another place that the probability is that within a very short time we shall have fixed the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth of Australia. When that is done I hope that we shall have done something that we shall never have any reason to regret, but that, on the contrary, in hundreds of years to come, the people of this country, instead of finding fault with what the Commonwealth Parliament did in 1904, will remember them with respect and with reverence. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister began bv assuring the Senate that - as we had previously understood - the subject matter of this Bill is not really in its essence, whatever it may be in some of its details, a party question. But I think we must all have been struck with amazement that the Minister should have managed to infuse so much vehemence into a speech dealing with a non-party Bill, in proposing its second reading. It seems to be not so much what is in the Bill, as a sort of unexpressed and reserved land nationalization, which is not in it, that has animated and stimulated my honorable friend's eloquence. I think, too, if he will bear with me for one moment, that it was undesirable that he should have uttered the jibe that fell from him because of a perfectly courteous interjection from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser.</inline> My honorable friend made a mistake in asserting, even controversially, that nothing would satisfy that honorable senator except to have the Capital site on one of his own stations. </para>

                            <para>- These questions of land nationalization, of non-alienation, like murder, will out, even in a speech dealing with a non-party measure. This Bill, in essence and principle, is one to which the Senate may unanimously give its assent. We have done that before. We shall do it again. It is a Bill, the object of which deeply concerns New South Wales. But it also deeply concerns the entire Commonwealth. It concerns New South Wales because it is in fulfilment of a pledge given by the Constitution, on. the faith of which New South Wales came into this Union; and I think we must all feel that New South Wales is entitled to have that pledge redeemed, and the question definitely settled at the earliest possible moment, in order that, at any rate, that source of friction or discontent may be removed. In the next place, it deeply concerns the people of the Commonwealth, 'because it is desirable in the interests of the Commonwealth that this little question - because, after all, it is a small question - should be settled and got rid of. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend is quite right. I do not dissent from the eloquent expressions he made use of in his speech. It is an important question in one sense. But it is a small question in another. It is determined by the Constitution that the Seat of Government of this Commonwealth shall be in New South Wales. There is not getting away from that. </para>

                            <para>- I will tell my honorable friend in one instant, but I should like to finish what I have to say in reference to the exceedingly appropriate interjection of the Minister - namely, that the question is important. I said that it was in essence a small question; he said it was important. I say that it is both. It is important from one aspect and sm'all from another. It is small in this respect, that it merely involves the choice of a locality, which must be within a particular State. We are altogether free from the difficulty and the trouble which was encountered both in the United States and Canada, in consequence of the absence of such a provision as the Convention inserted in our Constitution, with the aid of a Conference of Premiers, and with the consent of the people of Australia, eliminating the struggle on the part of one State as against another to have the Federal Capital within its limits. As long as the Constitution remains as it is, the Federal Territory can only be within the State of New South Wales. Therefore, the small point of the problem is all that remains, namely, what part of New South Wales is practically the most convenient, is best in the interests- of the people of the Commonwealth, and from the point of view of the administration of the affairs of the Commonwealth for the site to be in. Conditions of health, conditions of convenience of access - all these things are elements ; but are only elements which have to be considered. The introduction of the other matters to which passing allusion was made, are entirely, it seems to me, with all respect, beside the question. Let us determine the site. It is right that we should. It is in fulfilment of good faith that we should. Let us determine it now. We may do what we like when we come to provide the money "for the purpose of building. We may postpone it, or cut down the Estimates. We may, if we chose, say that Parliament shall assemble in a bark hut. </para>

I am putting it as to what may be done under tha auspices of any Government with less extravagant opinions, and which might cut down the expenditure in such a way as would lay us open to commendation for our economy. But these are all details, and, therefore, in aid of what has already been put to the Senate, I urge that it is beside the question to say that we should postpone this matter until another day. The people of Australia do not .want us' to postpone it, because we are not proposing now to incur one ha'porth of expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. We have heard something about the open door. In this case there happen to be nine doors open. Originally there were a great many more. As my honorable friend points out, in dealing with this matter we are releasing the people in the sites which are not chosen from uncertainty, and allowing them to go about their daily business, without being harassed by the prospect of the untold wealth which is to be spread amongst them in consequence of the establishment of the Federal Capital. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> - and I refer to this because I respect any 'interject - ion that comes from him - has asked me how I know that New South Wales was affected in coming into the Federaion by this question. At the first referendum the minimum of votes was not obtained in New South Wales, and consequently the Commonwealth Bill was rejected. Union was impossible without New South Wales. Every one recognised that. Then came the Conference of Premiers. One of the elements which was of essential influence in bringing New South Wales to support the union, was the provision that the Federal Capital should be in her territory. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, the honorable senator can call any bargain a bribe. I do not grudge him the use of a phrase which may be offensive to' New South Wales if he chooses to put it in that way. We may call it a bribe,- or part of a bargain. At all events, it was one element in the bargain. If it be a bribe, it must also be remembered that one of the conditions conceded to Victoria was that the Seat of Government should be in Victoria until the Capital was finally selected. </para>

                            <para>- I know all about that. The provision was put in to meet the wishes of New South Wales, and to achieve the Union by making it fairly certain that she would have the Capital within her territory. Whether we call it a bribe or a bargain, or a condition, or anything else we please, it was upon the face of that provision that New South Wales came in. Victoria was placated by the joy of our being temporarily here, and she was also satisfied to remove the selfishness of Sydney by giving New South Wales the Capital permanently. Having got New South Wales into the Federation in this way, are we going to turn round and repudiate the bargain? That is a novel principle in political bargains. But I do not believe that my honorable friend would put himself in that position. I do not believe that Victoria wishes to do so. </para>

The prototype of this Bill when introduced in the last Parliament was a little different, and was the subject of three amendments. These amendments, or, at least, two of them, were not persisted in. One amendment, moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Higgs</inline> against any alienation of the lands within the territory, was ruled out of order; but, speaking from memory, I think an intimation was given that if it had not been ruled out of order, it would have been withdrawn. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> moved an amendment, which would have had the effect of extending the territory from the 35th parallel of south latitude to the River Murray, extending eastwards, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> also submitted an amendment, providing, I suppose in the interests of Tasmanian shipping, that the territory should include Twofold Bay. </para>

                            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is not present, I shall leave it to the Minister for Defence to distinguish between dates. On that occasion, I pointed out that as it seemed to me, a Bill framed as that was - and as the present Bill is - was scarcely one in which to give effect to the constitutional position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> who was then leading for the Government, differed from me on that point, but I think that there was a little misunderstanding between us. I did not venture to suggest that a Bill was not a proper way in which to give effect to the will of 'Parliament, but that it was not a proper way in which to give expression to a mere wish on the part of Parliament. I contended that the better way would have been to pass resolutions conveying the desire of Parliament for a particular locality or particular area, which should then be made the subject of what has been described as peaceful negotiations with the New South Wales Government. </para>

My view is that the territory, as distinguished from the Seat of Government, which has to be placed within the territory, is the subject of cession on the part of the New South Wale's Government, and not the subject of acquisition bv any enactment that the Federal Government can pass. </para>

                            <para>- The object of that part of the Constitution is the same as the corresponding part of the United States Constitution. There is to be a territory ceded by a particular State - in America it was by State or States, while here it is by one State - and when that territory has been defined and ceded - that is, when the control of New South Wales over it has been given up- the land, so far as it is Crown land granted to us without price, or private land, for which we can pay at any time, is ours to do what we like with under the Constitution. Then is the time for us to determine the absolute site of the Seat of Government, the territory being Commonwealth property. If honorable senators will look at the section of the Constitution referred to, they will have no difficulty in seeing that that was clearly the intention. What has to be determined by this Parliament is the Seat of Government; but that is something distinct from the territory to be ceded and acquired, as is shown by the next two lines - and shall be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council has not quite grasped my point. In my opinion, it is an absurd proposition that New South Wales shall be called upon to hand over to us any territory we like, which shall then become ours and be controlled by us. The language of the Constitution in this particular may not be as accurate as it should have been, but, when we contrast it with the language of the United States, Constitution, we see at once that the two provisions were intended to be on the same footing. The intention is not that the Commonwealth Parliament shall ride roughshod over New South Wales, and confiscate the property of that State. </para>

                            <para>- My friends must not think that I am asking, anybody not to agree to the passing of a Bill expressing the wish of Parliament. I think the desire ought to be expressed in other language, but, while I do not differ with the Bill on that account, I want to express my view plainly. My friends from New South Wales, and those honorable senators who think differently, will then plainly understand the attitude I take from the constitutional point of view. We ought not to approach this subject with the idea that we are legislating adversely to New South- Wales, or to the New South Wales Government or Parliament. I think it inadvisable, on constitutional grounds, and certainly inadvisable on the grounds of expediency, to attempt to dictate to the New South Wales Parliament, and declare willy-nilly - if I may use a common expression - what territory we are determined to take for Commonwealth purposes. </para>

                            <para>- It has also to be remembered that the land involved is not a piece here and there, but that " territory " is the expression used. That is to say, we are to carve out, or New South Wales is to cede to us, a portion of terri-. tory, the soil of which, and not merely the governmental jurisdiction of which, is to become the property of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- They would be- Crown lands, subject to mineral leases. Is it part of the policy of the Government, for instance, to confiscate the Broken Hill mines? It is said that the Federal territory has to be nationalized - that there has to be' no alienation. Suppose we desired to aid our revenue, and included the Great Cobar Mine within the territory, do honorable senators not think that New South Wales would have something to say ? I cannot believe it possible that any man can have such an insane idea as that the Commonwealth would do such a thing in defiance of New South Wales and her interests. </para>

                    <para class="block">Government of New South Wales, and we further hope that that Government will fall in with it, as I am sure they will, unless there is some overwhelming reason to the contrary. It must not be supposed that because we use the word " shall," New South Wales has finally and irrevocably to submit. That is the view I take in regard to the Bill generally. It is not competent .for us, even as to the territory itself, to say that it shall be - that is, that it shall irrevocably, without the consent of New South Wales- - be in a particular place. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in an interesting portion of his speech, referred to the story of the adjustment of the Capital sites question in Canada and the United States. In some respects his narrative was historically accurate, but in one important respect it was not. Canada was not at all in the position of Australia; the Canadian people were not spared the difficulty of settling in what part of the Canadian provinces the Capital should be placed. There was a struggle for the Capital' between the different provinces, and it was in consequence of that - and not the much lesser difficulty with which we have to deal-, of merely expressing our wish - that the question had to be referred to Queen Victoria, who finally chose Ottawa. But when the Vice-President of the Executive Council came to deal with the United States, I think he had been misled, particularly in regard to the area. ' He alluded to the mode in which Washington was chosen, and to the arrangement made between Jefferson and Hamilton, which led to the settlement. That was not a very admirable or very praiseworthy episode in the history of either of these two men. It forms one of the few blemishes on, not the eminent, but the super-eminent,, reputation of Alexander Hamilton. There was a contest between north and south as to whether the Capital should be in one or the other, and there was a difficult financial question which - amongst other financial questions, left to Hamilton, with a genius never equalled, to solve for the United States - in the throes of discussion. Hamilton gave away the. claims of the north, in order to secure the support, or neutrality, of Jefferson, in regard to the Capital site. He agreed that if Jefferson supported, or did not oppose his financial proposals, he would withdraw the competition of the north. </para>

The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in dealing with this matter, was mistaken in one thing. Under the Constitution of the United States, the area was limited to not more than 100 square miles, and instead of the United States finding that insufficient, and struggling against the restriction, the Government, as late as 1846, restored to Virginia a portion of that State which had been included in the original area. And the Federal area in the United States now is not 100 square miles, but only seventy square miles. </para>

The whole argument that my honorable friend has addressed to the Senate for the enlargement of the area, founded on the experience of America, utterly crumbles and falls to the ground, because it has been found, and is now found, adequate for a capital, which contains 240,000 people, and meets all the necessities of the Government, not of a population of 4,000,000 such as we have in Australia, but of a population of nearly 80,000,000; in a country which, by reason of its resources, wealth, and enterprise, stands in the front rank of all nations. My honorable friend told us that the people of that country were dissatisfied with the area of the Federal territory. But I have shown that the dissatisfaction was in their having too big an area, and that it was reduced. I should like to- see the evidence of any dissatisfaction with the more limited area of sixty-nine and a quarter square miles. </para>

Until my honorable friend made his explanation, I thought that it meant a square, or a rectangle, with each side thirty miles in length. If it is to be simply an area of 900 square miles, it may wander like that celebrated gerrymandering scheme of American notoriety from the north of New South Wales to the south, or from the Pacific Ocean on the east to the borders of South Australia. </para>

                        SYMON. There is nothing definite in that. But, passing from that point, why is it to be 900 square miles ; why is there to be this increase of area? If it is to be 900 square miles, why not make it 3,000 square miles? As my honorable friend said, the Ministry have no policy about it. They will agree to 5,000 square miles if any one will move an amendment to that effect. If it is merely the expression of a pious wish on the part of this Parliament to have 900 square miles, and that is to be the subject of peaceful negotiation with New South Wales, well and good. But if by this Bill we are to "indicate that the territory to be granted or acquired by the - Commonwealth shall contain an area of not less than 900 square miles, we might just as well provide that it shall contain the whole of New South Wales outside the 100-mile limit.

                            <para>- My, view is that the limit is 100 square miles, or thereabouts, or so much more as New South Wales will consent to give. Under the language of section 125 we can take as much as we like, but that is not its spirit or intention. If we are going to take 900 square miles, there is no reason given why it should be limited to that area. </para>

                            <para>- The object of the provision in the Constitution, as I think every one will agree, was to provide for a Capital site, and not to provide for experiments in land nationalization. Another reason which my honorable friend gave was that it was to prevent the overflowing of the unearned increment beyond the boundaries of the Federal territory. If that is to be the reason, where is that to end? If it is thought that 900 square miles will suffice, some of us may think that it will take 10,000 square miles to keep all the benefit of the Federal Capital from reaching beyond its boundaries, and the- position would be that we should be practically taking from New South Wales her territory and setting up a new State of our own. Honorable senators will recollect another part of the history of the United States to which "my honorable friend did not refer. The principle of Federation is that the Federal entity should not have any territorial power except that which is absolutely necessary for the particular purposes of its own Government The whole essence of federalism is against territorial jurisdiction. The exceptions are ingrafted on that principle for the purposes of necessity. That is, if you have a fortification, if you have various other things which are provided for in the Constitution, then, of course, they come under Federal jurisdiction. But federalism, in its essence, is utterly opposed to territorial jurisdiction. For instance, in America, the territory of Columbia has no representation in Congress. It is not a State, it has no municipal government. Its affairs are administered by two or three commissioners appointed, I think, by the President, -with the consent of the Senate. That is probably how the affairs of our territory will be governed. Do honorable senators suppose that we could have a senator or a member "in the House of Representatives to represent the Federal territory ? We could not ; nobody would consent to it. </para>

                            <para>- Under the provisions of the Constitution the Federal Parliament may give the residents of the Federal territory municipal powers, or appoint Commissioners, or do anything else. And when the population gets large enough to make up the quota which is necessary in respect of other constituencies, it may even give them representation in the House of Representatives, under the Constitution. But do honorable senators think that, for many a day to come, the Parliament would give these persons six members, or even one member in the Senate? When will it be that these people will have a member in the House of Representatives? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> pictured London and Manchester as having a big area. He pictured greater Melbourne with an area of 450 square miles. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> interjected that the metropolitan area was 132 square miles. When shall we have that area in the Federal Capital ? Never within the lives of this generation, and many generations yet to come. The object in withdrawing the Federal Capital from great cities like Melbourne and Sydney, and chiefly, I suppose, from Adelaide, is not to prevent the possibility of a great mercantile centre being established. The object is that we may sit in dignified solitude and isolation, away from those malign journalistic influences which my honorable friend incidentally alluded to, and which are to him the embodiment of all parochialism and narrow local influence. But we are not going to establish a great commercial capital, as everybody knows. Therefore all these illustrations drawn from London Manchester, Melbourne, and Sydney are beside the question ; they do not really affect the question one whit. </para>

I should like very much to see the Federal territory abutting on a river just as the Federal territory in the United States abuts on the -Potomac. But, on the other hand, I have no sympathy with those who desire to include Twofold Bay or any port. I doubt if New South Wales would consent to a valuable port being given away to the Commonwealth. </para>

All I say is that I have no sympathy with that desire. At the same time "I should like very much to see the Federal territory planted by a river-side. If that could be done on the Murray, the great river of Australia, or if not on the Murray, on some other useful and permanent stream, that condition would be satisfied. However that may be, I feel that I ought to oppose, and I hope the Senate will not consent to, the provision for thirty miles square in the imperative form of expression to be found in clause </para>

                            <para>Probably anything I say will have no influence with the people or Parliament of New South Wales, but I sincerely hope that in the Interests of the Commonwealth, whatever may be said of their own interests, they will not agree with the proposal contained in this Bill. I hope we shall keep as near as we possibly can to the area of 100 square miles mentioned in the Constitution. I sympathise with mv honorable friends opposite in their desire to try an experiment in the direction of the non-alienation of land, but I think an area of too square miles would be sufficient within which to try such an experiment, at present. If the reason which moves honorable senators in proposing an increase of the area is only that the field of that experiment may be widened, or the other reason suggested, that possibly the wave of unearned increment, which will have its origin in the Federal Capital, may flow beyond the area of too square miles, and extend over an area of 900 square miles, or even beyond that, I may say that .1 do not think that those are questions which ought to be imported into this Bill, or to be dealt with or even debated on such a measure as this. The more we can restrict this measure to a mere expression of the view of the Commonwealth Parliament as to where the Federal Capital is to be situated the better. I do not say that we should limit the area proposed to be acquired under this Bill to 100' square miles, but it should approach as nearly as possible the limit prescribed in the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that we shall get unearned increment ; it is the Vice-President of the Executive Council who has said so. Every one must know quite well that for many a day the population of the Federal Capital will be chiefly confined to Commonwealth officials, and .the members of the Parliament, when it happens to be sitting. These are the views I take with regard to the constitutional position. I desire as fervently as anybody to see the matter settled, for the reasons I have stated. There is a choice of places, and last year I voted for Bombala, because, so far as I could see, it was on the whole the spot which at that time seemed to me to fulfil most adequately the conditions which ought to influence us in our selection - the conditions of climate, convenience of access, and other points which have been so fully dealt with by the various Commissioners. I said at that time, however, that although I voted for Bombala on that occasion, if the question was not then finally dealt with I reserved to myself the liberty to change my mind when the matter came up on another occasion. </para>

                    <para class="block">I shall not disappoint my honorable friends. If I exercise that liberty by giving up my first choice, it will probably be because the report which we have had from the late Minister for Home Affairs, on the Dalgety site, has made so considerable an impression on my mind that I am not sure that if the matter were put to a vote to-day I should not be found voting, in the first instance, for that site. I do not now speak finally, because I desire to listen to what honorable senators have to say. Many of them have made an inspection of several of the sites, and they are more familiar with the practical aspect of the question than I am.. I shall be largely guided by them, but my choice will, I think, be between the two sites, Dalgety and Bombala. I shall take great interest in all that may be said in comparing these two places ; but I may say that I think there is no likelihood of my view being diverted in favour of places further to the north, such as Tumut and Lyndhurst, to which I am aware that some of my' honorable friends from New South Wales attach more importance and which they think far more suitable than either Bombala or Dalgety. I thoroughly agree with what the Vice-President of the Executive Council has said as to his hope that by this Bill we shall settle the question, so far as the Commonwealth Parliament is concerned, during the present session. I hope that by passing this measure, in harmony with the desire of Parliament, we shall be able to remove all cause of bitterness and discontent, and such criticisms and cavillings as may arise from the selection of a locality as favouring Victoria against. New South Wales. I hope we shall also remove difficulties which may arise from those notions, by whatever name they may be called - notions of economy, or otherwise - which have justified some persons in speaking against the selection of a Capital site at once, and have induced them to contend that it would be better to delay the matter for some time to come, when really delay is adding to the mischief to the Commonwealth, and affecting the character and reputation for good faith of this Parliament in postponing the doing of something which the sooner it is done the better, if it is to be done at all. were well done if done quickly. </para>

The matter has been held over for something like three yea-rs now. During that time efforts, more or less serious, have been made, which have suggested to the people of New South Wales that the matter" would be indefinitely postponed. There have been proposals for a six-months' adjournment, and proposals to put the settlement of the matter off for twenty years. The inaction of the late Government naturally induced in New South Wales the idea that there was no serious intention anywhere to complete that part of of the Constitution, which provided for the selection and establishment of the Federal Capital. For these reasons the present Government in attempting to carry out this provision of the Constitution promptly are entitled to the congratulations, not only of the Senate, but of the whole of the people of Australia. </para>

Federal territory should contain an area of 20,000 square miles. He was speaking then from the Opposition corner. The honorable senator then wanted a quarter of New South Wales, more or less. He did not want merely a Federal territory, such as that suggested in the Constitution, but a new State. He claimed everything south of the 35th parallel of latitude. Nothing less would satisfy the honorable senator when he sat on this side. </para>

When the honorable senator spoke from this side of the Chamber, he not only advocated a Federal territory of 20,000 square miles, but affirmed that nothing less than 2,000 or 3,000 square miles would suffice for the Federal Capital. In view of his very emphatic declarations to that effect, I am entitled now to congratulate the honorable senator upon the acceptance of more moderate views. </para>

I shall not associate his moderation with his altered position, but I shall merely draw attention to the fact that the proposal which he now submits to the Senate is very different from that which he submitted only a few months ago from the seat which he used to .occupy in this Chamber. One matter with which the honorable senator dealt when he spoke last I shall deal with now, because he has been silent upon the point this afternoon. When he previously discussed a Bill, similar to that now before us, the honorable senator pointed out that although we were asked to select a site, there need not be any fear that anything would be done after the selection had been made. So far as. I can remember, he said that there would be ten or fifteen years delay after the selection of the site before anything practical would be done in the way of establishing the Federal Capital. </para>

The honorable senator when he addressed the Senate previously upon the question, pointed out that those who wished for delay need not be afraid, because it would be ten or fifteen 5-ears after the selection of the site before anything could be done in a practical way in the erection of buildings into which the Federal Parliament could move. The honorable senator has said - nothing upon that point to-day, but I desire to address myself to it. Touching the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> in the sentence in which he said that we should place upon the statute-book an announcement of the redemption of - our pledges, I should like to say that it can hardly be called a redemption of the constitutional pledge if we merely select the site and do nothing with it. </para>

                            <para>- Just so; but the honorable senator, speaking a few months ago, expressed the opinion that in the natural order of events it would take ten or fifteen years to establish the Federal Capital. I say that it ought not to take ten or fifteen years. If we are to establish a Federal Capital at all some practical step should be taken without any waste of time after the site is selected, and without undue extravagance. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to say to those who urge expense as the reason for delay, that no New South Wales representative advocates any lavish expenditure. I venture to say - of course, I have no right to speak for my colleagues, but I believe that they agree with me - that the general feeling in New South Wales is entirely favorable to reasonable economy. When it is urged on the ground of expense that the building of the Capital ought to be delayed, I reply that that is an argument which might have applied before the Constitution was adopted, but ought not to be heard of afterwards. If those who urge that argument believe in delay on the ground of expense, they ought to have gone round and asked the electors not to adopt the Constitution, because it would involve the imposition of this expenditure upon them. </para>

                            <para>- -It would have been a reasonable argument to point Out to the electors as a fault in the Bill, and as one reason why they should vote against . it. that they should shrink from it because it would impose upon them these financial obligations. But it is no argument whatever, seeing that they accepted the Bill with the knowledge that that Bill would require an expenditure, which they, at that time, were prepared to meet. I want to deal now with the question of the enlarged area. The other matters to which the Bill refers can be more properly dealt with in Committee. But the question of the enlarged area is important. I do not suppose that New South Wales is going to be at all niggardly about a few acres, or for the matter of that about a few thousand acres. But without stating - as I have no authority to do - what area New South Wales is prepared to give, I think I am safe in saying that New South Wales will willingly give up any area which is requisite for Federal purposes. </para>

                            <para>- I am satisfied to take the Constitution. It mentions the purposes for which the territory is to be acquired. I say that if New South Wales is prepared to give up any area which is necessary for Federal purposes, and does give up that area, she gives up all that we have a right to ask her to give up. The question is whether 100 square miles is sufficient for Federal purposes. </para>

                            <para>- There are only two good reasons which I have heard urged in favour of an enlarged area. The other two reasons which have been urged are, first that the increment resulting from the establishment of the Federal Capital shall be reaped by the Federation, and secondly that an enlarged area will permit of an interesting experiment in land nationalization. First of all, as to the Federation acquiring the increment of value which may be created : I ask, is it a Federal purpose to acquire land in order to obtain the increment which may result from the creation of the Capital in New South Wales? I say, on the contrary, that when the Capital was given to New South Wales, a portion of the benefit from it was expected to be secured by New South Wales. </para>

It was intended that New South Wales should secure some benefit from having the Federal Capital within her territory. If we so enlarge the area as to secure the whole of that increment in value to the Federation, what benefit will New South Wales secure? As to the land nationalization idea, I ask fairly and squarely, what is the Federal purpose there? Is it set out in the thirty - nine articles of the Constitution? Is there any word in the Constitution that gives the Federation power to deal in land nationalization ? </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing with the arguments used in favour of this larger area, one argument being that if we acquire a larger area we can carry out a scheme of land nationalization. I say that that is not a Federal purpose. Land nationalization is a matter of State policy. People who believe in land nationalization can endeavour to go in for it through the instrumentality of the States Governments. If they do, I only hope they will have a more hopeful field for the experiment </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator would not use language of that sort if he had a little more knowledge of the subject. Any man who has any knowledge of land questions in New South Wales will agree with me that there has been no more pathetic failure than is written in the history of the Homestead Selection and Settlement Lease policy of that State. In confirmation of that statement let me briefly trace the history of that land policy. Many men in New South Wales, like myself, originally believed in the leasing system. Shortly after this system was adopted, when the Farmers' and Settlers' Association met, a proposal was made to enable them to convert their holdings into conditional purchases. </para>

                            <para>- Arguments have been used as to why the Commonwealth ought to have this larger area, and I am giving reasons why it should not. A few years ago, as I have said, the Farmers and Settlers' Association scouted the idea of converting these leaseholds into freeholds. A year or two afterwards, when the matter came on for discussion again, the division of opinion upon the subject was practically equal. But more recently On two distinct occasions they have affirmed the principle of converting these leasehold areas into freeholds. These areas are held in blocks of from 200 to 300 acres up to 1,200 acres. </para>

                            <para>- No; but there is less humbug in having Government inspectors coming on to the settlements and seeing what the. growers are doing and what they are growing. We have never in New South Wales had a fair appraisement of land values. In some cases the Government were getting more than they ought to get, and in other cases they were getting too little. </para>

                            <para>- They are not less competent than are the officials on the Victorian side of the river. I am acquainted with the conditions on both sides. I have now dealt with the two principal arguments in favour of the larger area. I do not want to be drawn into a general argument upon the policy of land nationalization, but I say - and here is mv objection to this enlarged area - that it is no part of the conditions of the Federal Union to go in for. land nationalization schemes, and that' we have no right to ask New South Wales to surrender more territory than is necessary for the purposes set out in the Constitution itself. If New South Wales desires that its Crown lands shall be dealt with under a land nationalization scheme it can deal with them in that manner. It owes no obligations to the Federation in that respect. When the Federal Government goes to the Government of New South Wales for the acquisition of territory in that State, I feel perfectly satisfied that in regard to any request for an area sufficient for all legitimate Federal supplies - such as a water supply, or for any of the proper accessories of a Capital site - New South Wales will meet the Federation in a generous mood.. But she must not be blamed if she puts her foot down, and says, " We are not' prepared to give you a large area of land that is not required for the purposes of establishing a Federal home, or for legitimate Federal purposes but for other reasons - for some social experiments with which you have nothing to do. At any rate, if you want to have something to do with them, you are not going to do it at our expense." For these reasons I shall certainly, when we get into Committee - probably without much hope of success - move for the limitation of the area. </para>

I recognise that in matters of this kind people who want to get something are not likely to be shifted by any arguments which I am likely to address to them. I recognise their attachment to the land nationalization ideal. But I think they have altogether mistaken the arena in which that experiment ought to be carried out. That is one amendment which I shall seek to have made in the Bill. The other is on. a smaller point, and simply relates to putting in better language the provision in regard to tha area which it is proposed to acquire. </para>

                        <para>- I, like the New South Wales senators, think that the time is quite ripe for the settlement of this Federal Capital question, and I am glad that the Government have seen fit to bring it forward as one of the first measures for this Senate to deal with. ' I also join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in saying that it will not be sufficient to merely select the site, and then allow the matter to remain in abeyance. If we are to have a settlement of the question, it must be a genuine settlement; the selection of the site should be followed by a real commencement with the buildings and necessary offices for the Parliament and the Public Departments. I vote for the Bill on the distinct understanding that the measure is not merely " bluff." but is to be followed by action in the direction I have indicated ; and I believe that is the position of other honorable senators. I am pleased to see that the somewhat strenuous opposition which at one time Was offered to this project, especially in Victoria, has almost died out, and that now Victoria and Victorians, and the press of Victoria particularly, are coming to recognise that this is a contract which, in all honour, should be respected and carried- out. The Bill before us is on the same lines as that previously introduced, and in its provisions has regard to the opinions expressed in this House last session. The proposed area has been enlarged; and I am somewhat surprised at the arguments of Senators Symon and Millen against this proposal. Those senators say that, because the Constitution provides that the area shall . not be less than 100 square miles, we must take that as an indication of the maximum area. I wonder if those honorable senators will extend the same line, of reasoning to the provision which prevents the Federal Capital being fixed within a certain distance of Sydney. Because the Constitution says that the Federal Capital shall not be within 100 miles. of Sydney, are we to contend that the site shall not be more than 100 miles away? Are we to say that the ring drawn around Sydney by the framers of the Constitution must touch some part of the Capital site? </para>

                            <para>- Of course it would ; and Ave have only to look at the proposition to see how ridiculous it is. If it is ridiculous to say that, because of the language of the Constitution, the Federal Capital must not be more' than 100 miles from Sydney, then it is equally ridiculous to apply the same reasoning to the Federal area, because both sections are exactly the same in language, namely, " shall not be less than." The framers of the Constitution laid down the minimum in both cases, and left it to this Parliament to say what the maximum should be. . It is left to us to say whether the area shall be 200 square miles or 900 square miles; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> asked us what would be the position, supposing 900 square miles were asked for, and Kew South Wales refused to give such an area. It is the province of this Parliament to determine what shall be the area of the territory,, and that is what we are now doing for the purpose of keeping the bargain which the people of Australia entered into with New South Wales. If New South Wales, in a spirit of obstinacy, says - " Notwithstanding that you were clearly given powers by the Constitution, and that you are exercising those powers according to your judgment, we, in our judgment, think you are doing wrong, and will place every obstacle in- the way of carrying out the contract" - if New South Wales took up such a foolish position, that State must expect the logical result, namely, that the Commonwealth would reply, " Very well, if you will not allow us to carry out the contract, we shall take other means; if you carry your obstinacy so far as to refuse to come to an agreement, except on your own terms, we shall appeal to the people of Australia to give us power to approach some other State of the Commonwealth." I 3e 2 point out to New South Wales representatives, and to the New South Wales Parliament, that we have always  had that reserve power in the event of obstinacy being carried to such an extent. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt a few acres might suffice. For instance, it might be very difficult to prove that a water supply is necessary for carrying on the functions of the Federal Government, and a five-acre block on the banks of the Snowy river, with a few feet of the river, might be all that was requisite. If the New South Wales Parliament are to be permitted to say that we shall have only as much territory as is requisite to carry on the parliamentary functions of the Federal Government </para>

                            <para>- Judging by the arguments used in regard to limiting the area, I give the New South Wales State Parliament a good deal of credit for what it might do. It seems to me that it would be in the best interests of New South Wales if the Commonwealth were allowed to take as large an area as possible. If we obtain one of the areas suggested, that very fact will increase the value of land for hundreds of miles around, and will provide settlers with a local market, which they do not at present possess. Surely New South Wales representatives should take such facts into consideration. The more successful the Federal Capital may be from a commercial stand-point, and the greater population there may be settled there, the greater will be the advantage to New South Wales outside the Federal area. In a Federal Capital I suppose a population of 2,000 people is all that would be necessary for carrying on the functions of the Government; but if we can obtain an area sufficient to guarantee that there will be a commercial, as well as a political city, we may reasonably anticipate a population of perhaps 50,000, which would manifestly be of great advantage to farmers, gardeners, timber getters, coal-miners, and producers for hundreds of miles around. In that way New South Wales would reap a substantial advantage from the establishment of the Capital. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in attempting to combat the arguments in favour of land nationalization, made rather an unfair comparison. In order to prove that it would not be of advantage to the Commonwealth to have a system of land nationalization in the Federal territory he instanced the experience of New South Wales, as alleged in respect to the leasing of agricultural land. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, on ground rents, derived from land which was obtained from the State, in the first instance, for a mere song. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> can give more information than I can as to the Kalgoorlie municipality, which -derives a very substantial rental from lands let out on building leases to various tradespeople, who have erected very good buildings. The leasehold system is in operation in every one of our great cities, where, in very few cases, will it be found that the actual shopkeepers are the owners of the land, the owners, many of them, living in England or elsewhere on the rents. The difference is that the owners, instead of being the Government or the people, are private individuals. </para>

                        said that, according to the later reports, there is a distinct bias in favour of Dalgety. If we vote in this particular for Bombala we shall be in this position - that while we might have a majority here who are in favour of Dalgety, as being the best of the Monaro site's - Bombala is the term which is generally used to cover all the Monaro sites - if we vote for Bombala because of Dalgety being more than twenty-five miles distant, we shall leave out Dalgety. I think that, instead of putting in the word " Bombala," it would be better to put in the words " Southern Monaro." I throw out this suggestion for the consideration of those who favour a Bombala site, and, if necessary, I shall move an amendment to strike out the 25 miles and to fill the blank with the words " Southern Monaro," leaving the Parliament quite free to choose the .best site in the Southern Monaro district.

I should prefer, if it could be done - and I believe it is practicable - that we should take a ring of country round the harbor of Twofold Bay, and a strip, say, half-a-mile broad for a railway from Twofold Bay up to Bombala, where the Federal Capital would be established.

                            <para>- Yes ; and it would be a very good figure of speech, too, because the Capital would be the nucleus of our military arm, and the other end of the dumb-bell would represent our naval arm. Seeing that the Parliament, which is to control the defence of Australia, will be assembled, perhaps, at Bombala, and that the naval force will be stationed in Sydney Harbor, or, perhaps, scattered among the ports of the Commonwealth, and the Naval Department will necessarily be housed near the head-quarters of the Fleet, I think that there is a distinct advantage in having the port of Eden included in the Federal territory; but to take a square block, would necessitate our going somewhere near the area of 50,000 acres, which was at one time suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> I suggest that it is advisable to pass the clause in this form, as it would allow us to take a port, the necessary land for a railway line, and a site in the interior for the Capital. With regard to the amount of compensation, I think that the Government have been very lenient to the land-owners. .They might very well have gone back, and fixed the value at that . which obtained at the establishment of the Commonwealth. </para>

But if we -are to understand that no port is to be given, I must' say that, after the visit to Tumut, I see very little to choose from between Dalgety and Tumut. Certainly the Tumut land is richer, and I believe would support a larger population, but one of the great advantages in taking a site in the Monaro district, is the proximity to a port, and, therefore, the advantage from the defence point of view. </para>

I have some personal interest . in this matter, inasmuch as, perhaps, I was more responsible than any other person for the fact of the Constitution providing that the Capital should be somewhere in the State from which I come. I was the member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales who carried through all its crucial stages in that House the measure popularly known as the 80,000 vote Act that caused the rejection of Federation on the first referendum. That was followed by the Premiers' Conference in which the provision for placing the Capital . somewhere in New South Wales was agreed upon. </para>

                            <para>- I did not say that. I accept the responsibility for the passage of the Bill which brought about the failure of the first referendum vote. But I did not agree with the bargain which was subsequently made,, because, as -regards the limit, I subsequently moved in the Legislative Assembly an amendment to provide for a maximum of 200 miles as an addition to the minimum of 100 miles. I maintain that the people of New South Wales never for one moment supposed that the provision in the Constitution limiting the choice to an area more than 100 miles from Sydney was to be strained to its greatest possible limit, and the site of the Capital was to be on the very borders of the State. I understand that there are practically only two sites in the running at the present time, namely, Lyndhurst and Dalgety. </para>

                            <para>.- There are supporters of Tumut ' as there are of Bombala; but I am not attempting to say who is in favour of one or other of the sites. I am speaking of the concensus of opinion in this Parliament, and taking the opinion by and large, as the mariners say, of the members ,of the two Chambers, I have come to the conclusion that there are now only two sites in the running, namely, Lyndhurst, on account of its present and increasing centrality; and Dalgety, on account of its water supply being superior to that possessed by any other site or by any capital in Australia. I remember how I was reviled by a section of the Sydney press six or seven years ago for stating in my. place in the Legislative Assembly that it would be five years before a Federal Capital was established. I said that it would take at least two years to select a site, and at least three years to erect the buildings. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; it shows that L made a very liberal estimate. By the enthusiasts in our part of the Commonwealth, and by a section of the daily press, I was fairly reviled for making a statement which was considered utterly unworthy of the true Federal spirit that ought to actuate all Australians. A period of over three years has passed, and still the site has not been selected. We hear something this afternoon about the possibility that, if we do select the site now, we may have to wait fifteen years for the buildings. I feel sure that any one in this Parliament who entertains such an extreme view must be in a most minute minority. When I compare clause 3 of this Bill with section 125 of the Constitution Act, I find that an enormous departure has been taken. The Constitution, in section 125, says that - </para>

                            <para>D-. - I have already indicated my feeling of dissatisfaction with the provision in the Constitution which limits the selection of the site of the Federal Capital to some place not less than 100 miles from Sydney. I have regretted that when the distance from Sydney of 100 miles was fixed as a minimum there was no maximum fixed, and for the same reasons I should like to see a maximum as well as a minimum area fixed by this Bill. At present no maximum is fixed, and the area is to be 900 square miles, and as much more as perhaps some Ministry less reasonable than the present might wish to grab. It is impossible to suppose that the, present Ministry have any desire to filibuster the territory of New South Wales in any unreasonable manner. -But it is just possible that, owing to the casualties of political existence before this matter is settled, some other persons may be intrusted with the government of the Commonwealth. . ... : , ' </para>

                            <para>.- If my honorable friends have achieved the elixir of political and human life, they are more singularly fortunate than any similar number of gentlemen with whom I have had the pleasure of coming in contact. I point out that there are casualties in the lives of Ministries, as well as of individuals, and if we pass this measure in its present form, and proceed to enter into those charming negotiations to which the Minister for Defence has referred, we may find that before those intricate, ' troublesome, and onerous negotiations are completed, in the course of long years, some Ministry less reasonably disposed may have . come into power, and, acting on the authority of this Bill, they mav claim a great deal more than the 900 square miles stated here, not as the maximum area to be acquired, but merely as the minimum area, which may be exceeded to any extent that the necessities of , the Ministry of the day may seem to require. For these reasons I shall, in Committee, support any action which may be taken that will have a tendency to limit, in some more reasonable form, the area which it will be open to the authorities of the Commonwealth to acquire. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has been good enough to tell us of all the calamities which may fall upon the people of New South Wales if they are not disposed to give any area, from  900  square miles and upwards, that may be demanded under this Bill. The honorable senator promised us an alteration of the Constitution. I do not know where Bombala "would be then, poor thing," as the nursery rhyme has it. We might then, perhaps, find that instead of being somewhere in New South Wales, the Federal Capital might be located in the interesting locality known as Coolgardie. That once pleasant sea-port, Albany, might be fixed upon, and in fact all sorts of things might happen if the honorable senator's threat were carried into effect. I do not think, however, that the people of Australia will be called upon to alter the Constitution in any such direction. I think there will be sufficient good sense displayed between the Federal Parliament, the State Parliament of New South Wales, and the people of that State, to enable them to arrive at a.  reasonable and just determination, particularly when difficulties which cannot otherwise be adjusted, can, no doubt, on appeal, be presented to the High Court, and the High Court can determine what is necessary under the Constitution for the purposes of the Commonwealth. It cannot possibly be that it is the duty of the Commonwealth to seek huge areas for, say, agricultural or pastoral experiment. If it is not competent for the Commonwealth to take large areas for carrying out a project, say, for growing cabbages for all Australia, it cannot, to my mind, be any more a duty of the Commonwealth, imposed by the Constitution, to seek large areas even for so admirable an. experiment as that of land nationalization. When the last  speaker  was concluding his remarks, something was said about leaseholds in the vicinity of Sydney, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has made reference to the unfortunate, and as he phrased it, " the pathetic failure," of leaseholds for agricultural and pastoral purposes in New South Wales. I can also refer, not perhaps, to the failure, but at least tq the extraordinary disability imposed upon large areas surrounding the city of Sydney, in consequence of the 99 years' lease system existing there. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware that these interruptions are made in a kindly spirit and in perfect good humour ; but they are still somewhat disturbing to one who is seeking to submit certain propositions. My proposition is that we may have a large area for our Federal territory - it could not be said that <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> was required for the Capital, because no city that ever existed, or ever will exist, in Australia, a country with a limited rainfall, could require 900 square miles for its accommodation. We shall never have one that will require ninety square miles to accommodate it. A limitation of human occupation has been fixed by the scanty rainfall which, so far as we can learn from science, has existed in Australia for all time, and is likely to continue to exist. On that account we are never likely in this part of the world to have a city requiring accommodation for such a huge population as has been suggested. But, apart from the site, what are we going to do with the rest of the Federal territory? It is proposed, with a view to obtaining the unearned increment, as it is called, that we shall run. some system of leasehold. It may be called land nationalization or simply leasing, as it comes to very much the same thing with the State as landlord. If we have that system in force within the Federal area, how will land within that area compete with the freehold land of New South Wales existing immediately outside it? In our experience in New South Wales the man who can obtain freehold will prefer it- to leasehold in ninety - nine cases out of 100. </para>

                            <para>.-- Precisely ; that is the point I made just now. It makes a difference of one, and frequently of two per cent, where a man requires to borrow money. I can refer honorable senators to the great areas in the vicinity of Sydney on the Holt-Sutherland estate, with charming water frontages, railway accommodation, and proximity to one of the: greatest parks in Australia, and yet the land cannot be let at 7s. 6d. an acre per annum, or thereabouts. There is very little settlement upon it, with the exception of a few people who are keeping poultry farms, whilst freehold land in the immediate vicinity fetches a good price. I point out that, if we are to acquire a great area as Federal territory, we shall, in human probability, be merely burdening the Commonwealth with an area of land which will be more of a nursery for noxious weeds and a haunt for noxious birds and beasts than anytheng else. </para>

                            <para>.- Some years ago a law was passed in New South Wales dividing all the pastoral holdings into, presumably, equal parts. The pastoralists continued to hold one-half of their holdings, whilst the other half reverted to the State, and was let on short leases. What was the result? Nearly the whole of those portion of the holdings which reverted to the State, and were subsequently dealt with as leaseholds, became but nurseries for noxious weeds and the haunts of noxious animals. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who has, perhaps, a larger knowledge of the western country of New South Wales than any other man I ever met, will bear me out when I say that those resumed areas, as they w«re called, in scores and hundreds of cases became a -perfect curse to the occupants of the adjacent holdings. </para>

                            <para>.- There is no doubt that it must be the same wherever we go. These difficulties are not peculiar to New South Wales. In every place where human occupation goes on, and is largely limited or controlled by questions of finance, it is clear that where men cannot borrow money on an unsatisfactory freehold title, they cannot borrow on an unsatisfactory leasehold title, and there is this further difference, that whilst a freehold title may have some flaw iri it, which renders it unsatisfactory, the mare fact that it is leasehold makes the title unsatisfactory in the other case. It makes it unsatisfactory, because, however willing people may be to lend money on properties of the kind, trustees cannot do it. Until very recently trustees in England could not lend money on colonial securities. Exactly in the same way trustees cannot lend money on mortgage of leasehold properties. That limits the amounts available for investment on such properties, and hampers the unfortunate occupant who desires to improve his holding. It is all very well to say that people should not borrow. The world could not go on without borrowing. Australia could not have been developed without borrowing. We should not be sitting in this building without borrowing. We should not have a mile of railway to travel on without borrowing. If the world's operations were limited to a cash basis it would be reduced to such a state that the crash of another planet falling on it would be a small disaster in comparison. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> gave utterance to a sentiment which I should have used had I. spoken first - and which I now cordially indorse - that so far as New South .Wales is concerned, I believe that every representative of that State, no matter in which House he may sit, will willingly subscribe to the proposition that a suitable area for the needs of the Federal City should be granted. There would be the utmost willingness to provide all the additional land which was requisite to secure the purity of the* water supply of the Federal City. Personally, I should be willing to vote for any area that it could be shown was at all necessary to secure an abundant supply of water and the control of the watershed. </para>

                            <para>.- I should undoubtedly prefer gravitation to pumping. In that way it seems to me that if we are going to discuss what particular sites we may favour, there can be no question that Dalgety takes first place for water supply amongst possible sites. The drawback is that there is no line of railway to Dalgety, and many miles of additional railway are requisite to make a through connexion either with Melbourne or Sydney. While I desire to see the fulfilment of this obligation of the Constitution, I certainly wish to see the Federal Capital established in a position, that will give through traffic between the great cities of Australia. I do not want to see the Federal Capital established at the end of a railway siding, or a siding 100 miles long.-, ' There ought to be through communication between the great cities. When </para>

                    <para>I' say the great cities, I do not mean Melbourne and Sydney only. I mean all the great cities, because while Melbourne and Sydney are most immediately connected, there are also Brisbane and Adelaide, and by-and-by there . will be Perth linked together. If we could build a bridge across to Tasmania, that also would be a most desirable thing ; but I only know of one man who could doit, or would be willing to do it, if we provided him with the money, and his name is the Honorable E. W. O'sullivan. We cannot have that, but we can have the Capital on a railway line that will connect Brisbane and Sydney on the north, and Melbourne and Adelaide on the south. In my opinion that connexion should exist. . The other site to which I have made reference is Lyndhurst. The water supply there is not so good as it is at Dalgety. It does not compare with that site in that respect. Still, I believe the water supply of Lyndhurst to be ample. From the information which I have from Government officers, I do not believe there can be any doubt with regard to the water supply there; I further point out the splendid centrality of Lyndhurst as being on the line directly north of Melbourne, where that line runs almost straight north, instead o'f winding away east, as it does to reach, Sydney. With the future connexions to the South Australian railway system on the one side, lines actually in process of construction now so far as New South Wales is concerned, only one link is required to make an almost direct line to Brisbane. There, can. be no doubt about the centrality of Lyndhurst as compared with any one of . the other sites that are at all in the running. Year by year that site must become more and more central ; because, unquestionably the trend of population and the development of occupation is northwards. </para>

                            <para>- To Queensland. The sea-board corner of New South Wales has been filling up to a remarkable extent, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> has correctly shown, the trend is right up the eastern coast. Already the population of the eastern coast entirely outnumbers the population of any other -part of the Commonwealth on a similarly sized area. Of course I am not talking of any little sections. That development must " continue. Why? For the simple reason that the eastern coast of Australia is, as yet, less developed than the south coast. And, as we go northwards along the east coast, we get the finest rainfall in Australia. As I have said, rainfall is the true test of the limits of human occupation in any part of the world. It is the test, not only of human occupation, but of occupation by the brute creation, and, still further, by the plants and grasses which make possible the occupation to which I have made reference. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately, I have not been at either of those charming summer residences. I do not know what the rainfall is either at the North Pole or the South Pole. But we can look all over the known globe, and no one can pay the least attention to the rainfalls of the countries of the world without knowing that what I have said is a truism - that rainfall is the test of occupation. Recognising that fact, we have a right to expect a greater growth of population northwards than even westwards. I am not making any unpleasant remarks about any locality, because I know the great possibilities of the west. ' I am aware that there is an immense area awaiting development there. But, on the other hand, to the north we have a country' that . will carry a population immensely larger than it at present sustains. For these reasons I think we have a right' to look rather to the north than to the south of New South Wales. -or, at least, to some, central position therein, for a suitable site for the Capital that this Chamber has evinced, I will not say an enthusiastic, but at least a kindly and laudable disposition to select a site and to see a Capital erected thereon, under . the terms of the obligation contained in the Commonwealth Constitution. </para>

I feel sure that during this session that obligation will be honorably met, and I am not going to strike a discordant note in this debate. I 'am as anxious as any honorable senator that this matter should be settled, and I go further, 'and say that when we do decide upon a site we' should, without any reasonable delay, take steps to establish ourselves within the territory selected. The first steps taken with regard to the Capital site were so long ago as November, 1899, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> was appointed by the New South Wales Government to inspect certain localities. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> is the President of the New South Wales Land Court, and, possessed of extensive knowledge of that State, was eminently qualified for the duties he had to perform. Subsequently a Royal Commission of four members from the different States, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzpatrick</inline> as  chairman,  was appointed, and we were furnished with an exhaustive report, together with plans and other information. There has also been a personal inspection of the majority of the selected sites, by nearly every member of both Houses ; and I sincerely hope that, with other information which we have, and information which we ought to have, we shall be enabled to come to a decision. Last session we narrowed the choice from twenty sites to two or three sites; and in this connexion I have a certain complaint to make against the Government. Towards the end of last session the Minister for Home Affairs asked for a sum of about ^2,000, in order to obtain reports on the two or three sites which remained open to discussion, and a surveyor thoroughly conversant with the district was appointed to inspect Monaro, with a second surveyor, a resident of Tumut, to inspect and report on the latter area. The Chief Inspector of Public Works,  Colonel Owen,  was also  asked to make an inspection, and he reported on all three sites, or, at any rate, on the Monaro and Tumut districts. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, who was Minister for Home Affairs, made a report ; and the complaint I have against the Government, is that we did not obtain that report in its entirety without having almost to violate the Standing Orders, and besiege the Government for about three days. We now (have the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest ; but the reports of the two surveyors, Messrs. Chesterman and Scrivener, who were commissioned about six months ago, have not yet been laid on the table of the Senate. I do not know how much of the £2,000 was spent in obtaining these two reports from experts; but I do not see why there should have been any expenditure if honorable senators are to be placed in no better position than they were during last Parliament to come to .a right decision. These reports have not yet .been seen by. any member of the Senate, although they were laid on the table of the House of Representatives six days ago. I do not see why this should be so, considering that these reports were called for by the Minister of Home Affairs, and that the Senate was the first Chamber to. consider the question of the Capital site. Seeing that this is an urgent matter, and that the Government ought to desire "honorable senators to have the fullest information, why were the . reports not printed and circulated? If" we do not receive those reports the ,£2,000, or whatever was the cost, is money absolutely wasted ; and the Government must admit that they have treated the Senate .'with scant courtesy, and have shown no anxious desire to supply the fullest information. I hope the omission will be rectified at the earliest opportunity, although I know that we must make allowances for the Government. In the first place, the Government are new to office, and have an enormous- number of routine administrative matters to attend to; and further, they have had a particularly trying time. They have had the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads, and that in itself is enough to somewhat distract their attention. Indeed, for the last week or two I think the Government have been in rather a- worse position than the Russians, seeing that there have been two parties trying to bottle up the Government. Under the circumstances, I think the Government may be excused ; but it is most unfortunate that when we are asked to decide this most momentous matter - perhaps, one of the most monumental we shall have to decide - the two expert reports, which we particularly want, are not laid on the table, although the Government have had them in their possession for six days. </para>

                            <para>- The information is in the hands of the Government, and could be given to us to-morrow. Last session' I asked the Government for certain information to guide us to a decision. We then contemplated only two sites, and I asked the Government to get the surveyors to mark out in each district an area of 1,000 square miles in the position they thought most suitable for Federal territory, and then to obtain from the residents an idea of what would be the cost of nationalizing that land. That information could have easily been obtained, and it would have been a splendid guide to us in refuting the statements of those who say that an enormous expense must be undertaken in order to establish, the Federal Capital. I know that, so far as regards Dalgety, and also, I believe. Batlow, a large area is Crown lands, and the cost of resumption would be very small. I also asked the Government whether, if we selected an area of, say, 1,000 square miles, we should have the right under our Constitution to take the whole of the Crown lands free. That is a legal question on which I ask the Government to obtain the opinion of the Attorney-General. I also asked that the surveyors, or the Chief Inspector of Public Works, should prepare an estimate of what they thought would be the minimum cost of the Federal Capital during the first ten years. Such information would not only have been useful to ourselves, but would have served to answer the absurd statements made by a lot of people that, if we establish the Federal Capital in New South Wales, we must spend millions and millions in <inline font-style="italic">thi</inline> first fe.v years. However, my suggestions were no* acted upon, and we are in the  position  of not having the information which I desired. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> made a very telling point when he said that we have no right to select a site in New South Wales unless we first get the consent of the New South Wales Government. </para>

                            <para>- But is it not a recognition that if we want land within any of those areas it is there for us ? Is it not perfectly evident that the New South Wales Government " would raise no objection to our taking a reasonable area, seeing that they have already reserved the land? Then there is the question of whether we should have the right .to take 900 square miles. If it is desired to have a large area in order to nationalize it, irrespective of the actual ' requirements of the Federal Capital, I am one of those who believe that we have no right to take that course. But I am strongly of opinion that we have a perfect right to take sufficient land, so that the city and suburbs shall be self-contained and under one jurisdiction, so that the whole of the catchment area shall be in Federal territory, and our source of water supply shall not be polluted, so that we can create artificial lakes and form large parks. When we come to consider the question from that point of view I contend that an area of 900 square miles is not at all too much. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly it depends on the situation ; but I am speaking in general terms. The Bill postulates an area of thirty miles square. That means that if the Capital were placed in the very centre there would be New South Wales territory within fifteen miles. It is contemplated, if the site is at Dalgety, to have a lake three miles across. If the Capital is built even in the centre of the Federal territory - and it is not altogether probable that it will - we must have an area fifteen miles round in order to insure that for all. time the suburbs shall be in Federal territory. What would be the effect if the city were in the Federal territory, and the suburbs in New South Wales? We should have divided jurisdiction. One authority would control the suburbs, and a totally distinct authority would control the city. If we wished to bring in a system of tramways or a water supply, we should have endless difficulty with two jurisdictions, which possibly, though I hope not, might be in hostility to each other. We ought to provide for the extension of a city which is to last perhaps for thousands of years. It is impossible for us to say to what number the population of the Capital will grow, and if it is only equal to that of Washington, it will be 250,000. That is a place with no trade and commerce, whereas our Capital may be a place with trade. In some of these sites the land is auriferous, and suitable for growing fruit and wheat. With railway communication the areas may become very populous areas. We may have a town which in time may approach Chicago in point of importance. If the Government of New South Wales is reasonable, it will recognise that, in asking for an area of 900 square miles, we are not trying to found a State on the principle of land nationalization, although I hope that we shall do that with the area, but are seeking to insure that tha city and suburbs shall be under one jurisdiction, and that we shall have plenty of room in which to lay out parks and reserves, and conserve water. Honorable senators, in discussing this question so far, have not made any comparison between the three sites, because they have had no further information, except <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest's report, of which only a portion has been printed, than was available last session. By going to the  Clerk  of Records and to the Minister of Home Affairs to see the reports, although they are not printed, I have been able roughly to make a comparison between the' three sites - Lyndhurst, Tumut or Batlow, and Monaro. It is admitted that Lyndhurst has a fine climate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">Neild made a great point of its centrality. But I do not think that centrality is one of the most important aspects in considering the question of a site. If it is decided the Federal Capital shall be in the centre of all future population, then, perhaps, it will have to be built in the desert country. But if we take a site like Tumut or Dalgety, we are only within 250 miles from the geometric centre of population. Surely, if in a continent of 3,000,000 square miles, we put the site within 250 miles of the centre of population, we shall be going as near enough to accessibility from all parts as we should require. I think that the claim that we shall select Lyndhurst, because it happens to be nearer the centre of population, is an untenable one, or is a factor which should not weigh against the question of water supply, climate, and other considerations which are of such vital importance. Although the climate of Lyndhurst is good, it is subject to great extremes. The lowest rate of temperature there is <inline font-style="italic">15-mA-</inline> degrees, or 16 degrees below freezing point; it suggests to us a Polar expedition. It has a lower temperature than any site except Bathurst and Armidale. So that no reading at any of the two southern sites - Batlow and Tumut on the one hand, or the Monaro tableland on the other - is so low as that. At Lyndhurst the frosts are frequent and severe, and the soil is not so good as the soil at Bathurst and Orange. It is described in the report as being somewhat poor. The average wheat yield is n bushels at Lyndhurst, and 12 bushels at Dalgety. </para>

                            <para>- The Royal Commission, after visiting Lyndhurst, said that the Coombing rivulet was practically dry - and that is relied on as the chief source of water supply - and put Lyndhurst fifth in the sites, so far as water supply is concerned. In no single factor - and this can hardly be said of any other site - has Lyndhurst been put first by any Commission or inspector that has ever visited it. The cost of resumption at Lyndhurst is very heavy. The ground is mostly selected, and in order to reclaim our catchment area the Commission estimate that we should have to expend , £160,160. Of all the sites it is the most expensive catchment area to reclaim. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest says - </para>

                        SMITH.Of course it is nothing to a millionaire, but we have to carry on the government with due economy. That estimate, of course, includes a pumping scheme from the Lachlan river, because it is recognised that these four or five streams would not be a reliable source of water supply. We must remember that we have to obtain water by conservation, and not by perennial streams. If we have reservoirs of water in the summer time, it becomes stagnant, and is not so healthy as that in a running stream. Again, Lyndhurst will have no water frontage. That, I think, is an important fact with regard to a Capital site. When we come to another most important factor - the generation of electricity - we find that the water supply there is only sufficient, according to

When I was in Launceston quite recently I was very much surprised to find that electricity was generated and sold at ½d.. per unit.

                            <para>- Yes. There is an illustration which should guide us to have a large supply of running water near the Federal Capital, in order to generate electricity, not only for lighting the city, but for developing motive power and running railways or tramways. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> as an old railway engineer and contractor, will agree with me in that. Now let us take the site of Tumut. The Commission stated that they were only to inspect sites that had a sufficient elevation, and 1,500 feet was fixed as the limit. I was astonished to find that in the report about Tumut they mentioned that they inspected sites far below that elevation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> has naively said that this was according to subsequent instructions, but from whom those instructions were received we do not know. We have reports upon Tumut and contiguous places from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, Colonel Owen, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chesterman.</inline></para>

                            <para>- I shall speak of that later. From what I have stated in regard to water supply, the Lyndhurst site must be considered out of the running in that respect. We have then to consider the Tumut site, and the Bombala site, including the areas contiguous to those places. When we' come to compare them we find a great similarity between those sites. They are situated only eighty or ninety miles apart, and are divided bv a range of hills. They are both forty miles from the Victorian border. They are situated at about the same altitude, 2,500 feet, and both require thirty miles of railway to connect them with the railway system of New South Wales. - The climate is verv similar at both places,- and both occupy commanding positions. These are the aspects of similarity between the two sites to which I think it is admitted we have narrowed the choice. </para>

                            <para>-I am speaking of Batlow and Dalgety. I have taken these sites, because in the case of Dalgety I am in favour of the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> that a Monaro site should be included in the Bill, and Dalgety, from the information we have already received; is, in my opinion, tha best site in that district. I take Batlow on the other hand, because Tumut, being low down, is a hot, steamy place surrounded by hills, and is quite unsuitable for a Federal Capital. </para>

                            <para>- Twenty seven miles is the exact distance stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chesterman,</inline> and the distance between Cooma and Dalgety is thirty miles. I have now to mention the points of difference between these sites, and they arise with respect to the water supply, the water power for electricity, water frontage for recreation, and appearance, and the suitability of the sites for the erection of public buildings. It is in connexion with these matters that dissimilarity occurs between these two sites which are otherwise so similar. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> reports that the water supply of Dalgety is the finest in Australia. This is due to the Snowy River, which Colonel Owen mentions in his report as one of the finest rivers in Australia, coming as it does from the perennial snows of Mount Kosciusko and its ranges. It is pure water, and it makes the site of Dalgety the best in the whole of Australia, so far as water supply is concerned. By a gravitation scheme, involving thirteen miles of piping,, a supply of 8,000,000 gallons can be obtained, or sufficient to supply 100.000 people. This can be secured at small expense, and it could be extended if desired to supply a population of 500,000 or 1,000,000. There is a frontage to one of the finest rivers in Australia, and a 30 feet weir on the site would create a lake three miles in length and of considerable width. The principal portion of the city would be formed on the high ground of a kind of promontory. </para>

                    <para class="block">The water power within thirty miles of the site is sufficient to generate electricity to the extent of 70,000 to 100,000 horse-power. That is to be compared with the 300 horse-power which could be secured at Lyndhurst, and with about an equal power which could be secured at the Batlow sire. This would be sufficient, not only to light the city, and give all the motive power required for the city, but to run railways if necessary from Dalgety to Cooma, to the Victorian border, or to Twofold Bay. It must not be forgotten that this is the very cheapest motive power we could get. In his report. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> says that everywhere in the district ornamental fruit tress grow well, with very little attention, and he regards the district as admirably adapted for dairying and fruit culture. The Batlow site is described by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chesterman,</inline> a gentleman who has lived in the district just as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> has lived in the Dalgety district. He says that of all the sites around Tumut that at Batlow is the best with respect to climate, soil, and water supply, and it is situated above the elevation of 1,500 feet. At Tumut there is admittedly a splendid supply of water, though it is not quite equal to the supply afforded at Dalget by the Snowy River. 'But when one leaves Tumut, and goes 20 miles up in the ranges to Batlow, the water supply is very different. It is very important to remember that, when speaking of the Batlow site, we cannot look for the water supply to be found at Tumut. </para>

I dare say that in winter these streams become swollen torrents, but they are nothing like the Snowy River, and are not snow fed. It is impossible to suppose that these little trickling rivulets could provide a water supply for a huge city. Colonel Owen, who went up to inspect the Tumut sites, says that none of them, which are above an elevation of 1,500 feet, can have anything like a water frontage. That is what we must reconcile ourselves to if we select such a site as Batlow. Now, as to water power. We are told that with 200 feet of head the volume of water of the streams to which I have referred would develop only 200-horse power, which is so infinitesimal as to be unworthy of consideration. If we take these three points of water supply, water frontage, and j water power, there is no comparison between Batlow and Dalgety. This view is borne out by the surveyors, by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, and  Colonel Owen.  The Batlow site is above the 1,500 feet elevation, and the surveyor savs that Godara is a better site, but it is under the elevation of 1,500 feet. </para>

I have pointed out that in many other respects there appears to be a remarkable similarity between the two sites. I should like to mention this statement with regard to the character of the site so far as its suitability for the erection of public buildings is concerned. With respect to Batlow, the surveyor says - </para>

                        <para>There is a cream-coloured sandstone about ten miles from the site, and a clayey sandstone twenty miles distant. The latter is described as cutting easily, but hardens on exposure. Granite abounds in the district in the form of outcropping boulders, but no quarry has been opened. There is also plenty of basalt and bluestone. The best quarry of the latter is at Hazeldene, about twenty miles from the site, where the stone is a very dark blue, more like trachyte, and is harder than the Melbourne bluestone. The largest outcrops of limestone are about six miles north of Cooma. The stone from this place produces a good lime, which is said to be stronger than that at Marulan. Abundance of clay suitable for brick-making is obtainable in' various parts of the district, and excellent hand-made bricks have been produced. There is plenty of good sand and other material for making concrete. </para>

                    <para class="block">To sum up the question with regard to Dalgety, it is, as I have pointed out, absolutely the cheapest site, and, I think I have shown, one of the best sites we could possibly get. Only thirty miles of railway are required on an even grade. I have travelled on the road from Cooma to Dalgety. It is a piece of level road. The other road, from Tumut to ' Batlow, is severe. One has to rise over 1,000 feet, and there is a great deal of cutting and filling, according to the reports given by the surveyor. So that railway connexion with Dalgety will be very cheap, comparatively speaking. In regard to resumption, I have shown from the reports that the Dalgety site is cheaper than any other site ; and the water supply is more plentiful and cheaper than at any other site. It compares in these respects favorably with Batlow, which all those who have inspected the sites contiguous to Tumut have stated to be the best site above 1,500 feet. When we consider water supply, water frontage, and water power, which are of vital importance, we shall find that Dalgety is infinitely superior to the Batlow site, whilst with regard to the cost of building material, resuming land, and water supply, it is absolutely cheaper than any other site. </para>

I ask honorable senators to read the information to which I have alluded, and see if I have not given a fair comparison of the various sites. I believe that when honorable senators do that, they will say that the Dalgety site, or some site on the Southern Monaro table land, is the best for the future Capital of the Australian Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Sometimes it is as well to have an opportunity of replying to the statements which are made. I think that the question as to which is the most suitable site would more properly be considered when we are dealing with the Bill in Committee. The measure itself is cast upon simple lines. In the first place we are called on to declare that the site for the Capital shall be in a certain portion of New South Wales, the name of which is to be filled in late* on; and secondly that there shall be a minimum area. As to where the site is to be, unfortunately the Government do not occupy any better position than their predecessors. There seems to be a difference of opinion in their own ranks, and they are endeavouring to throw on Parliament the responsibility and the onus of determining for their guidance where the Federal Capital should be located. They are making no attempt to guide Parliament. It is unfortunate that this position should be taken up, because there must be a majority of the Government in favour of one site or the other. It would be far better to let Parliament know exactly what attitude the Government themselves are going to take up. </para>

The Government are not prepared to lead Parliament in one direction or the other. They will not say that any one site is superior to another. They say:: "We are going to allow you to lead us and we will take anything you give." They do not care which we suggest. Honorable senators are perfectly well aware that a majority of the New South Wales representatives have indicated a preference for Lyndhurst, as against any other site which has been submitted. I am .not at this moment going to discuss the relative merits of Lyndhurst, Dalgety, or Tumut. </para>

                            <para>.- I shall not discuss the site now for two reasons. In the first place, it ought to be dealt with in Committee rather than in the Senate, and speeches that may be delivered here at this stage in favour of one site or another may have to be repeated next week. In the next place, a large amount of information has been obtained since the matter was debated last session. We have not got that information yet. While I give credit to the Government for their desire to have the question settled, we ought to be put in possession of the fullest possible information, so that the decision of the Senate may not be one which we shall see fit to go back upon. We have a report from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest dealing with the Tumut and Southern Monaro districts. It has been determined by the Senate that we shall have printed <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest's .report on the Lyndhurst site. The Government have in their possession the reports of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pridham, Mr. Scrivener, Mr. Chesterman,</inline> and Colonel Owen. Where are those reports? </para>

                                has seen the documents, because he has been to the Government offices and inspected them. But they should be tabled. We should have the benefit of them before we are called on to deal with this measure in Committee.

                                in moving the second reading of the Bill, said he had no doubt that whatever decision was arrived at by the. Senate,' would carry very great weight with honorable members in another place. So it ought. But if we have not got the information which honorable members in another place will have when they discuss the Bill, they will say - " These gentlemen were unaware of this fact and. that fact, this report and that report, and therefore their decision is not worthy of the weight and consideration that would have attached to it if they had been acquainted with the whole of the available information." Honorable senators know perfectly well that I do not desire to delay the selection of the site, but I hope that we shall be posted up with the fullest and latest information in order that we may arrive at an opinion based upon all the facts .that are available.

                            <para>- I cannot help that. This is a matter not for a few years, but for all time, and we should be very careful in regard to it. I also want to know how the blank is to be filled up. Do the Government propose to take an exhaustive ballot, so as to allow any honorable senator who thinks that one site should be put in to have an opportunity of inserting it? In the other House, in the first instance, there was an exhaustive ballot before one site was placed in the Bill. When the Bill came to us from another House, there was a place already named ; but we are initiating the Bill now, and it is reasonable that we should, if possible, by means of an exhaustive ballot, arrive at what may be the decision of a majority of honorable senators. For the sake of argument, let us suppose that there are three sites in the running. No. 1 site is proposed in the Bill, but the advocates of Nos. 2 and 3 sites join' together in order to reject No. 1, although No. 1 might, under ordinary circumstances, get a majority. </para>

                            <para>- Now we have this Bill, requiring hot less than thirty miles square, or the very much greater area of 900 square miles, as against 100 square miles. We are now saying that we will not be satisfied, and will not leave the Government in a position to be satisfied, with a smaller area than that mentioned in the Bill. How much better it would be if the Government were able to go into these negotiations - for after all this Bill only enables them to negotiate - with a free hand to select an area of not less than 100 square miles. The Government would not be tied to the minimum, but if the circumstances were such as to justify them in doing so, they could go up to the 900 square miles. I do not think it is any part of the duty of the Government to establish any experimental State - to experiment with legislation on land nationalization, or any other such project. It has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that that is no part of the duty of the Commonwealth Government. We are created under a Constitution which gives us certain specific powers and rights, and, strictly, we are not entitled to go beyond those powers and rights. It is true that the Federal territory will be under our guidance and any laws we see fit to make; but it was never contemplated that the Commonwealth would be put into a position to establish another State, in which we. could carry on a different system of legislation in reference to any of the great topics of subjects that come up for discussion from time to time'. </para>

                            <para>- As the honorable senator interjects, would not New South Wales be entitled to the unearned increment? The Federal territory will be within the borders of New' South Wales ; and why ? Not for the simple charm of taking land away from New South Wales. That State would very soon say, ' ' You are placing us at a disadvantage so far as our territory is concerned in relation to the other States." If there is any benefit to be obtained from the unearned increment New South Wales is entitled to that benefit. </para>

                            <para>.- There is no doubt that we have the unquestionable right to deal with this as a matter of bargain and agreement. I do not know whether the Minister for Defence would go so far as to say that the Commonwealth Parliament has power to resume land in New South Wales, whether or not the New South Wales Government object. If a contention of that kind is made, I say at once that not one rood or acre can be taken without consent. It is perfectly true that there is power under the Constitution to acquire land from any State or person for public purposes, but that power applies only to land required for post-offices, Customs houses, defence purposes, and so forth, and does not apply to land for the purpose of establishing a Federal Capital. There is a distinct provision under the Constitution that there shall be no limitation or diminution in the limits of a State without the consent of that ' State - except on such terms and conditions as* may be agreed on. </para>

No doubt a man living on it would not be subject to taxation by the State, but still, ultimately, the fee would be in the Crown as represented by the State. The desire, apparently, is to get that land out of the hands of the State into the hands of the Commonwealth, so that the former could have no possible control over it. </para>

                            <para>- It would, to a very great extent, because it would not have been acquired by the Commonwealth in the way the Constitution intends the Commonwealth shall have an opportunity of acquiring properties. It must be remembered that, when the Constitution was accepted, every condition laid down was taken in good faith by the people of each individual State, and we have no right to go beyond the Constitution, or attempt to do so, unless we have the concurrence of the States. I admit that if New South Wales consents to give twenty or fifty miles square, a bargain might be arranged, but before any attempt is made to obtain the larger area, there ought to be power to deal with that State in such a way that if it should prove a square of twenty-five miles is sufficient, the Commonwealth Government may be in a position to recommend that area to the whole of the Commonwealth. </para>

If the Commonwealth acquire land for the Seat of Government, there is power to make laws ; but what I argue is that we cannot acquire lands in any way we see fit, and, taking it altogether away from the State, make it Commonwealth property. </para>

If the Government of New South Wales say that the Commonwealth can take this area of thirty miles square, wherever it may be, then I admit that it will become Commonwealth property, and the land which has been alienated can be acquired by the Commonwealth and dealt with in whatever way it may seem fit, but it has to get the consent of New South Wales before it can touch one rood or acre of the land. </para>

I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> indicated that if the State would not come to terms the Parliament would take steps to alter the Constitution, and get an opportunity of selecting the Capital site somewhere else. I hope that honorable senators will at any rate grant us an opportunity to make ourselves fully acquainted with the various reports which have recently come to hand, and consent to an amendment in the Bill reducing the area which they say they intend to take to the limit prescribed in the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- I do not rise with any great pleasure to speak on this very important question, because I shall have to advocate what in this Chamber is, I believe, a very unpopular side. I think I may say that outside this building the policy which I and some others advocate is thoroughly believed in. From inquiries I have been making for months, I might say for years, past in Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales, and South Australia, I think that an overwhelming majority of the electors of the Commonwealth believe that the early selection of the site and the early construction of a Capital will be a waste of money, and is absolutely uncalled for by the conditions under which we are living and trying to prosper. </para>

It is my duty to put my view forcibly and clearly before the Senate, and before I resume my seat I shall move an amendment which may,, or may not, meet with acceptance. Let us ask ourselves for one moment why it is that we are called on to read this Bill a second time at this juncture. I was certainly a little amused at one or two senators from New South Wales iri congratulating, the , Ministers en having dealt so promptly with this very important question. I desire to congratulate the Ministers on having obtained possession of the Treasury bench by fair and honest means. But I am not going to be insincere and to congratulate them on dealing so promptly with this question, when I know the reason is that they have no other business to go on with. They have 'not yet had time to lay upon the table those important reports, without which it is impossible for us to come to a proper, conclusion. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that it is. But it is their fault, in trying to please my honorable friend, in pushing this Bill on with undue haste, and asking us to discuss it and come to a decision, when the reports that have been ordered and paid for have not been produced here, and no honorable senator has ever seen them, but my very industrious friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith.</inline> I cannot congratulate the Government on taking this course. On the other hand, I must find fault with 'them, and ask why it is that they have so far forgotten their duty to the electors ?

If that is the honest conviction of a large number of persons in that State, as I suppose it is, I have every sympathy with those honorable senators who are trying to allay the feeling. But I think that they ought rather to try to allay it by telling the people, as they honestly can do, that no member of either House of this Parliament desires to repudiate the bond in the Constitution. It is stated there so plainly that I cannot conceive of anybody getting the idea into his head that there can ever be, either now or in the future, an agitation to deprive the mother State of what are her constitutional rights. </para>

                            <para>- I have not started any such movement. I have repudiated it every time I have spoken. But because this grievance has been manufactured, because this supposed breaking of the bond has been created in the minds of timid or thoughtless men, is this Parliament to be dragooned into passing this Bill ? When the Vice-President of the Executive Council and the Prime Minister were explaining the policy of the Government they each practically stated that the only reason for pushing on with this measure is that it will allay this supposed feeling in the mother State. Is that the way in which we are to do our business, to become statesmen, and to work out the Federal Constitution? The only reason which the Prime Minister gave us was that he recognised the enormous influence which the Bill would have in allaying' this feeling in New South Wales, and bringing that State and Victoria closer together in brotherly love. I believe he said that it would create a broader and more sympathetic national life. Is that not all. balderdash? Are we here to perform the most important act that the Constitution has given us to do because some people in New South Wales, with a newspaper or two, believe that some people in Victoria, with a newspaper or two, are trying to keep the Seat of Government in Melbourne, and prevent a provision iri the Constitution from being carried out? I repudiate any such feeling. If any. one inside or outside the Senate, or any newspaper editors, hold that opinion, they are entitled to do so. But I do not believe that it has the slightest foundation in fact. I decline to be drawn one inch along a path which I know to be wrong, because of any petty, miserable, stupid feeling which they say exists, but whose existence I deny. The Prime Minister has defended his policy, not only on that ground, but also on the ground that the passing of this Bill will allay the feeling among a great number of' the people that to build the Capital now, or in the immediate future, would be a waste of money. And, knowing that he has that feeling to meet, how does he proceed ? He gets over the argument by saying that, if we are common-sense people," who are willing to go ahead on. economic lines, to cut our coat according to our cloth, there need be no extravagance in the construction of buildings on a colossal or magnificent design. He goes on to say that for twenty years the Parliament of this State was content to meet in the building in which we are assembled, in two rooms, which cost about £20.000. I do not know where he got his information, but if these two chambers were put up for that sum, it is news to me. His idea is that we should erect two chambers, which we can improve, and which will do us for twenty years. By that means, and that means only, he is trying to avoid the charge of extravagance and waste of money which he knows can be truthfully hurled against his Government. How does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> intend to swallow the policy of the Prime Minister ? How is he going to meet my honorable friends on my right as! well as Senators Pearce and Smith, who declare that to select a site is not enough, that unless we go on with reasonable speed to build an expensive Capital, we shall still be breaking the bond and repudiating the constitutional rights of the mother State? A large majority of honorable senators are going, I presume - I am not - to follow the policy of the Prime Minister; but I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> to take notice that the senators from New. South Wales and some other States will all contend that that is not a proper policy to pursue; that if only that step is taken, we shall still be repudiating the bond. I do not believe that myself, but there are the two arguments, which I leave the Ministers at the table and my honorable friends from New South Wales to fight out in the best way they can. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> makes a very ungenerous interjection. I am referring to what are essential factors. I am asking what are proper questions, and I should be open to blame if I allowed this debate to close without doing so. I have laid the ground which entitles me to ask these questions which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is so unjust as to interrupt, because they do not quite suit his book. It is of infinite importance that we should know how Ministers intend to proceed after they have, on arguments which are fallacious, induced the Senate to select a particular site. I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council, or the Minister for Defence to tell honorable senators from what money the Government propose to construct the Capital, how much is to be spent per. annum in ils construction, and when they hope that the Federal Parliament will be able to meet there. <inline font-weight="bold">"Senator Dawson.</inline> - I can tell the honorable and learned senator now. We are going to make money out of the Capital, not to spend money upon it. </para>

I undertake to say that if the proposal were to construct a railway to the moon, Ministers, whoever they might be, could find good reasons why the work should be undertaken if it were a part of their policy. Members of the present Government, concluding that it is a popular thing to proceed with this measure at once, are, no doubt, prepared to use every possible argument to justify their action. </para>

                    <para>Federal Capital question has been dealt with from its inception, has not redounded Lo the credit of those who have brought it forward as statesmen, or as cautious practical men of business. I make the statement, without fear of contradiction, that we have never once debated the question in the Senate without being at a disadvantage for want of information. We have never debated the question without having to complain of a lack of sufficient data and expert knowledge to enable us to come to a reasonable decision. The debate which has taken place on this Bill bears out what I say. Honorable members are rushing the matter through with undue haste, and though there are reports on the subject in the building, they are not in print, and are not before us. I venture, respectfully, to contradict <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and to tell him that the question is not yet ripe for decision. I do not feel called on to go into the question, as I think it is more a matter for experts. </para>

                            <para>- I was in favour cf a Southern Monaro site, but if it is to be a question between Dalgety and Bombala, I am not competent to settle it. I recollect that when I visited Dalgety, I thought the scenery was magnificent, and I preferred it to the scenery of the Bombala site. The Snowy River runs right through the township, and to have that river running through the Federal Capital would be a very great advantage indeed. I was exceedingly pleased also with the Bombala site, with the rivers, there, and the undulating, well-grassed country. With respect, to all these matters, I think I shall have clone my duty if I indicate by my voice the locality in which I think the Federal Capital site should be situated, and it should be left for surveyors, engineers, and other experts to decide as between Dalgety and Bombala, the precise site for the Capital. I am, therefore, in favour of the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that it would be better to include in the Bill a reference to Southern Monaro, which would include both Bombala and Dalgety, as they are practically in the same locality. That the question is not now ripe for settlement is shown by the arguments we have heard from Senators Symon, Pearce, and other honorable senators. We are faced with a great difficulty with respect to the land. The Constitution says that the area must be not less than 100 square miles, and Ministers are asking that we should take 900 square miles. So far as I know anything about the construction of a deed, an Act of Parliament or a Constitution, I do not believe that the High Court would ever give us such an area, unless with the full consent of New South Wales. I cannot conceive that when a minimum is placed in the Constitution, the High Court would agree that we could multiply the minimum area by nine. The moment that Ministers made up their minds that we should acquire 900 square miles, it was their duty to have negotiated with the New South Wales Government before bringing in a Bill of this character. They should have communicated with the authorities in the mother State, and should have said, " We desire not only to acquire the site for Federal purposes, for which the area mentioned in the Constitution would be quite sufficient, but we wish also to try a little experiment in land nationalization. We desire to go a little beyond the spirit and meaning of the Constitution, and we, therefore, ask you to authorize us to come before the Federal Parliament with a Bill which will cover those purposes." In my opinion, they were bound to have done that before they introduced this measure. We should not be asked to stultify ourselves by passing a Bill for the acquisition of a large slice of the territory of New South Wales, when our own common sense tells us, and honorable senators from New South Wales tell us, that that can only be done with the consent of the people of New South Wales. I believe that the people and Government of New South Wales will readily make arrangements to meet us in this matter. I believe they are prepared to negotiate with us for the acquisition of a very much larger area of land than is provided for in the Constitution, if we can justify the demand by pointing out that it would be not only for the benefit of the Commonwealth, but for the benefit of New South Wales. But all that must be done by negotiation, and I respectfully contend that in this matter negotiation should precede legislation. I say that, the question is not yet ripe for settlement, and we ought not, and dare not, as statesmen pass this Bill, in the form in which it is put before us. I am satisfied that the Southern Monaro district is a suitable district in which to locate the Federal Capital. Elevation, climate, water supply, and rainfall are suitable, but I have always been in a very great Quandary with respect to the necessary railways which must be constructed. The harbor works and railways which would be required, were the Federal Capital established at Bombala, would tend to make that the most expensive site suggested. I grant that were those railways and harbor works constructed, they would not only benefit the Federal Capital, but the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales, as they would be the means of building up a commercial city, and would give another port to New South Wales and the Commonwealth. In that view it is perhaps not correct to say that Bombala would ultimately be the most costly site. </para>

                            <para>- After passing the Act we might have to repeal it. This is another phase of the subject, and I say that as business men, if we owned these territories, we would not select a site for a big city at Bombala without knowing how the necessary railways were to be constructed. Is the Federal Parliament to build every railway necessary - to the port, to the Victorian border, and to connect the Capital with the New South Wales system? The Victorian Government may "not agree to construct a railway to the border from Bairnsdale, and the New South Wales Government might not agree to build a railway from Cooma to Bombala. Are not these questions, involving the expenditure of millions of money, of enormous importance ? They are questions which we w-ould certainly consider if the territory belonged to us. As trustees for the public, it is our duty to consider them with some business acumen. Are we to erect this </para>

                    <para class="block">Capital in the bush without knowing how we are to get access to it? We can secure access to it by building railways, but does it follow that the Federal Parliament will ever build those railways? The Victorian State authorities might not agree to build a railway from Bairnsdale to the border, and might tell us to do as we liked. Suppose the New South Wales Government told the Federal authorities that they would not construct a line from Cooma to the Federal Capital at Bombala without a 'guarantee of 4 per cent, for seven years, which is the term after which, I understand, a railway is supposed to begin to pay. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> will be able to say whether it is not an axiom that a railway cannot be expected to pay for seven years after it is constructed. Suppose the New South Wales authorities should be pleased to say - " You have chosen a site in a district which we do not approve, and against the. advice -of a majority of honorable senators representing New South Wales. Now, get along in the best way you can. We shall be prepared to build a railway from Cooma to the Federal Capital only on receiving a guarantee of 4 per cent, for seven years." I have been accustomed to look on matters from the family solicitor's point of view, and I do not think I can do any harm in looking at this great question from the point of view of a humble family solicitor. I say that we shall do wrong if we select a site when we do not know absolutely all the difficulties with which we shall be confronted in converting it into a magnificent city in the centuries to come. I come now to the question of what we are going to gain as a Parliament from the proposed Federal Capital. I have not heard the Vice-President of the Executive Council on this question. We know that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, when Prime Minister, always said that if we wanted to develop national ideas, and to get rid of local, provincial, and narrow ideas, we must have some bit of land which we can call Federal territory. This mere fact of squatting down with the kangaroos in the Bombala grasses was, according to the right honorable gentleman, to give us national ideas. All I have to say is that, to my mind, that is sheer nonsense. All honorable members of the present Government may not have expressed the same view; they no doubt think that they will quieten New South Wales by selecting a site, and that we shall thus broaden our views, and become more national. I ask honorable members to examine the statement. We have heard that this was the course adopted in Canada and in the United States of America, and it is claimed that, when the Federal authorities secured a national territory, it had the effect of developing national ideas. I absolutely deny that. To my mind it is sheer, absolute nonsense. We may have narrow and provincial ideas expressed in Melbourne and Sydney, if we have the wrong men, and we may have national, Imperial ideas expressed ' at Bombala or on Mount Kosciusko, if we have the right men. I do not mean to say that there is parochialism in the big cities of Australia, and I do not desire to get away from Melbourne or Sydney. I do not want to get away from the newspapers. I should like, wherever I am, to have them delivered at my door at six in the morning, and to have as many of them as possible. I do not know that anything is to be gained by burying ourselves in an inaccessible place. What is to be done the moment the Capital is built ? There will be the Parliament House and the Federal offices. Are all the Government officials going to live there? If they do, they will vacate their houses in Melbourne or Sydney, and those places will lose the benefit of the expenditure of their salaries. I should like to know whether Ministers are going to live at Bombala, if that place is selected? I will undertake to say that for years to come Ministers will not be found there. They will be there as little as they can be. We shall find them galloping all over the country. Their permanent homes will not be in the Capital for which they are clamouring. We shall simply have a repetition of what took place here during the first three years of the existence of the Commonwealth, when secretaries and under-secretaries, clerks, military officers, and officials of all sorts were scampering up and down the Commonwealth, and sending in heavy bills for their expenses. These are important matters, because if the expenditure is increased in these directions the burden upon the States will be the heavier. I beg to state that we have already got beyond the £300,000, mentioned in the Adelaide estimate. Notwithstanding the professed desires of the Labour Party to cut down expenditure, we have exceeded that estimate, altough we have not yet appointed our High Commissioner nor our Inter- State Commission - which we never wanted, and, I hope, shall never have - arid have not got the Capital. </para>

Each of the newly-appointed High Court Judges has an associate, and they are rushing about all over the country. I think .1 little expenditure might be .saved in that direction. I know perfectly well that the Adelaide estimate will be exceeded, as matters stand. If this Federal Capital is constructed in the near future, as my honorable friends from New South Wales desire, it will be greatly exceeded. We shall, in that way, have broken faith with the people, or, at any rate, shall not have kept our promise to them in not keeping the Federal expenditure at a reasonable amount. </para>

                            <para>- I am not shocked at all. I have done the same thing myself. I have saved sums of money that were voted at the instance of a- previous Government. When a member of Parliament becomes a Minister, he becomes anxious to save money, and is much more careful than he was as a private member. He knows that the whip is being held over him. My honorable friends are only doing what other Ministries have done. I caution those honorable senators who are not yet Ministers not to vote away money which they might very fairly save. I want to point out that some honorable senators are under a delusion - and I submit this with all respect - with regard to this leasing system. They suppose that .By leasing land for ten, fifteen, or twenty "years, as the case may be, they are going to obtain a considerable amount of money, which will quite pay the interest on the sum which we shall spend in constructing the Capital, making our artificial lakes, providing our water supply, our drainage system, our streets, and so on. I do not believe anything of the sort. I am quite willing to admit that the rents will bring in a fair sum, and that that sum will increase. But the initial outlay of establishing the Capital will be so enormous that the rent which the Government receive will not in any degree pay the interest. We have had instances given by honorable senators on both sides of the chamber, as to the ghastly failure of the leasing system in New South Wales. It has been a perfect and absolute failure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says that it has been a considerable success in Kalgoorlie. But that was not a scheme of land nationalization. It was simply a scheme by which private owners who got hold of land in the early days retained it after Kalgoorlie became the centre of one of the most wonderful gold-fields on the face of the earth. They then let it out on lease in building sites. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; I can quite understand that that has been a success. But we cannot, if we construct a city which we do not want, and have not got the population to fill, or the resources to support, have a white elephant of that sort which will compare with a successful gold-field. I shall be very glad indeed if any honorable senator can give me an illustration which will show that this scheme of letting .building sites on lease has succeeded in any large city. People are accustomed to have the fee-simple of land of that kind, and we cannot expect important banks to be built, large hotels to be constructed, and buildings and lodging-houses to be put up on leased land, which is liable to be re-assessed every ten years or so. Is there any case of a large city of this sort where blocks have been readily seized upon for building purposes, though no freehold has been obtainable? We cannot possibly expect men to put up palatial hotels and great shops if we tell them that every ten or fifteen years the rant will be liable to be raised, according to the unearned increment. I only hope that, for our own sakes, the supporters of this system are correct in their views. I think, however, that they are partly wrong. I do not believe that business people in Melbourne or Sydney will be anxious to obtain a site, the rent for which will be liable to be raised after they have put up expensive buildings. They will never know what their obligations are. </para>

                            <para>- Another argument why we should not rush with undue haste into this matter is that only recently we have had a new site recommended to us. Almost every one of us went to Bombala through Dalgety. We all saw Dalgety, but it was never considered to be in the running, and was never spoken of until the other day. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, who was then a Minister of the Crown, went there and inspected it. He obtained evidence, and furnished a report since he ceased to be a Minister. It was only in consequence of his report that Dalgety came to the front. I am not sure that it has not turned out to be the best site of the lot. So that if we had settled this matter when we were urged to do so last year, we should undoubtedly have left out the very site which is now, I believe, going to be one of the most popular of all the proposed sites. Does not this entitle me to say that the question is not ripe for settlement? Does it not justify me in saying that this artificial, unreal feeling which the </para>

It seems to me to be the best evidence we can have of how this question has been rushed. Ministers have been goaded and spurred into doing something by the representatives of New South Wales, although they knew that the question was not ripe for settlement. It has been, said that a reason why we should choose the site is that the people of New South Wales are keeping land tied up. Did any one ever hear a more futile reason than that? There are three sites which may be chosen, and we have requested the Government of New South Wales not to sell any land in any of them, because we may choose one ; but cannot they let the land for ten years or so? Cannot they turn it to account under grazing licences? Are they such fools that they must keep this land absolutely free from occupation? ' Cannot they make use of it 'in any way ? Certainly they can. </para>

                            <para>- The very object of the Bill is the acquisition of land, and it is conceded that the Government of New South Wales must consent to the grant of the land. The amendment expresses the opinion that the Bill is premature unless negotiations have taken place, and some arrangement made with the Government of New South Wales ; and, consequently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> says that, before the Senate is called on to consider the Bill, it is essential that we should, at least, know the mind of the Government of that State, in order to guide us to a decision. It is admitted that, constitutionally, we cannot compulsorily take territory without consulting the State Government, and I contend that that paragraph is strictly relevant. The amendment goes on to say -  and to arrange with the States interested, the terms and conditions upon which the railways necessary to give access to the Capital, and to the port (if any) should be constructed and opened for traffic. </para>

                            <para>- The amendment sets out that before a site is selected we ought to know the prospects there are of securing railway communication with the particular site. Could anything be more reasonable from a business or practical stand-point? On the other hand, we are asked to select a site without any knowledge as to the wishes and desires of New South Wales, although 'we cannot select the site, or construct a railway without the consent of the Government of that State. Hence the honorable and learned senator, reasonably to my mind, contends that he must know the views of the* Government of New South Wales, and the prospects of our getting railway communication to this particular site. </para>

How can we possibly negotiate with the Government of New South Wales, or any other Government, until a site has been selected? We cannot go to the Government of New South Wales and ask for any information about Dalgety or Tumut, when we do not know whether it will be selected or not? </para>

                            <para>- I wish to point out that, under the standing order of the House of Commons, the ordinary practice is for a member not to take the line which has been adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> but to move that the Bill be read a second time, either this day six months, or this day three months. We have decided to discard the practice of the House of Commons, and to set up a practice of our own. I take it that on this point of order the practice of the Senate in the future, will be decided. Admitting, for the sake of argument, that the' amendment is relevant, is it advisable that we. should lay down a rule that, on the second reading of a Bill, a senator may move an amendment which should properly be moved in Committee, in order to " stone-wall " or perhaps shelve the Bill, when in Committee we have ample opportunity to move any amendment that we may require to move? If that rule is laid down, even although in unusual cases it has been allowed in the House of Commons, it will be initiating a verv undesirable practice. </para>

                            <para>- It has never been availed of, except in most extraordinary cases. I submit that it is a straining of the standing order to say that on a motion, which is strictly relevant to a Bill, an honorable senator can move, as a reason for shelving the Bill, any amendment which is relevant to its clauses. At this stage of this Bill the discussion should be confined to its main principle, and that is the selection of a site for the Federal Capital. The proposals of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> may arise out of the selection of a site, but they certainly are not relevant to that question. </para>

                            <para>- Standing orders 185, 186, and 187 come under the heading of " Second Reading." At this stage of a Bill it is its principles and not its details which are under our consideration. I hold that, no matter how the literal interpretation of these rules may be strained, it is not competent for any honorable senator to come down here and under cover of a statement that he would submit a motion which was purely relevant to the contents of the Bill anticipate a Committee discussion. </para>

He might utilize this second-reading stage of the measure against the intention of the Standing Orders for the announcement of principles of. a varied character, which might extend throughout the whole ambit of a comprehensive measure. </para>

                            <para>- I take it that the President will not adopt the suggestion made by Senators Pearce and Keating, and deprive <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> of the advantage of standing order  187.  We have been listening to arguments which do not appear to me to be very relevant to the point of order. Under standing order  187,  instead of moving that the Bill be read this day six months, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is entitled to move any other amendment which is strictly relevant to the Bill, and the simple duty which the President is asked to perform at the present time is to decide whether the motion submitted is relevant to the Bill. If the President rules that it is relevant, he will have decided that the motion is in order. If a portion of the motion is held to be irrelevant that portion will be out of order, but the remaining portion of the motion mav be in order. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has already intimated in the clearest possible way that a large portion of the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is certainly relevant to the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- If standing order 187 is held to be unsatisfactory, the way to get rid of it is to repeal it, and not to ignore it. Senators Pearce and Keating desire that the President shall rule in such a way as to ignore standing order 187, and decide that it is unsatisfactory. It forms a part of our Standing Orders, and so long as it does, some value must be attached to it. The intention is perfectly clear, and if any, or the whole, of the amendment submitted is relevant to the Bill, it is as much in order as would be an amendment that the Bill be read this day six months. </para>

                            <para>- The standing order which I am asked to interpret and give a ruling upon, is- standing order 187. The question I have to decide under that standing order is whether the motion which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> proposes to move is in order, and is strictly relevant to the Bill. I point out, in the first instance, that the honorable and learned senator has mixed up in his motion a large number of propositions, which, if voted upon at all, ought to be voted upon separately by the Senate. If the honorable and learned senator had given notice of a motion in the ordinary way,, calling for a decision of the Senate upon these various propositions, his motion could not be put in its present form, because it would not be in order. If that were the only reason, it would be quite sufficient to force me to rule that the one motion containing all these propositions is out of  order. It is a motion containing a number of propositions which ought to be voted upon separately. The very foundation of our Standing Orders is that each member of the Senate should have the right to an expression of opinion by vote upon every proposition brought forward. He could not have that right in connexion with this motion, because there are a great many matters mixed up in the one motion, with some of which ha might agree, and with others of which he might not agree. I can quote several rulings by Speakers of the House of Commons on this very point, to show how much the operation of a similar standing order has been restricted in the House of Commons. Under the heading " Resolution must be pertinent to the Bill," I find this in  Denison's <inline font-style="italic">and Brand's Decisions -</inline></para>

                    <para>The FRESIDENT.----This raises a question which is not provided for by our Standing Orders. Can a senator, in the middle of his speech, without any motion that the Senate adjourn, ask leave to continue that speech on a future day ? I am not giving any opinion about it, but it is not provided for by our Standing Orders. Whether it is a convenient practice or not is for the Senate to decide. There may- be a difference of opinion. I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> in the middle of his- speech, asks leave to continue his remarks at the next sitting of the Senate. If that leave is given, I shall take it as a precedent, and it will, in future, be the practice of the Senate. </para>
