                    <para>- I intend to support the amendment, because while I believe that there may be occasions when it will be necessary for lawyers to appear before the Court, I anticipate that they will be rare, and can only arise where a doubt is entertained as to the jurisdiction of the Court. Who is the right party to decide that constitutional point? Neither the employers nor the employes are qualified to give a decision, and it should rest with the Judge who will be the only lawyer in the Court. If the Judge entertains a doubt as to whether a case comes within the provision of the Constitution, and expresses a desire to have the point argued by counsel, I cannot conceive of any employes or employers refusing to engage counsel for that purpose. That is the object of the amendment, which is not dictated by any desire to ban lawyers from the Court. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Judge would appreciate the reason why the provision was inserted in the Act. From my point of view, it is inadvisable to have lawyers in the Court to argue industrial questions. In Western Australia we have &#34;had some experience of an Arbitration .Court dealing with industrial disputes without the aid of lawyers. It. has been proved to be a cheap method. There have been no objections raised as to the improper notifying of parties, or as to whether a party was qualified to appear. 1 </para>

                        <para>- In New South Wales the Court is constantly called upon to listen to long and tedious arguments on technical points. A lawyer naturally looks at a dispute from the legal aspect, whereas the lay advocate of an employers&#39; union merely -considers how the conditions which the employes ask for would affect the industry if granted. He is there for the purpose of stating the reasons why the conditions should not be accepted. In the same way the employe looks at the case from the industrial stand-point. In such cases there is no necessity for the presence of a lawyer. The men who are best qualified to argue industrial questions are those who are engaged in industry , whether as employers or employes </para>

If either party to a dispute were to ask for the assistance of a lawyer, is it conceivable that the Judge would refuse to grant the request?. It is not likely that he -would ever ban the profession of which he is =a member. I trust that the Committee will recognise that this is an industrial question, and that by inserting the word &#34; and &#34; we give the President power to ask the parties to have a constitutional question argued, but that we leave industrial matters to be settled on industrial, and not on legal lines. </para>

                    <para>- The. Committee should remember that the Judge of the Arbitration Court will be one of the Judges of the High Court, which is the supreme authority in Australia. This amendment would put the Judge in an extraordinary position. He might desire that counsel should be heard, and might express a wish to that effect ; and it would be in the power of the representatives, either of the employe&#39;s or the employers, to overrule his judgment, and to refuse. That is not a position which is desirable. </para>

                    <para>- On the second reading, I expressed my intention to vote against preference being given to unionists. I do not propose to take up the time of the Committee, but I am glad to be able to inform honorable senators that within the last week, an effort made in the New South Wales Arbitration Court to have an agreement arrived at in that State, made binding on the whole of the people engaged in laundry work, has failed. The Court decided not to give preference to unionists, it having been shown that while there were only about 250 unionists in the trade, there were about 950 non-unionists, the total number of employes being 1,200. The Court further decided that unionists and non-unionists must be at liberty to work together. </para>

Even under those circumstances, I personally would ob- ject to preference being given, and I know that I am in touch&#39; with my constituents on the matter. If I can get only one honorable senator to join me, I shall protest against this preference provision. </para>

In Victoria, and in some of the other States, there seems to be a disposition on the part of certain public men to do all in their power, not only to prevent preference to unionists, but to prevent the growth of trade unionism itself. </para>

                        <para>- Those worn-out fallacies of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> ought to have been sent to the dead-house long ago. Those bogies are trotted out day by day by men who have never expressed sympathy for either unionists or non-unionists. It is not the non-unionists who are making this hubbub about preference, but the enemies of both unionists and non-unionists. In New Zealand preference has been given by the Arbitration Court, and since the passing of the Act, there has not been either a strike or a lock-out in that Colony. I have said that the enemies of this provision are not either unionists or non-unionists, but employers who are opposed to any restrictions by Act of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I indorse the view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise.</inline> If this preference clause is not included in the Bill, no trade union or labour organization will register. How could such a Bil&#93; be described as a measure to prevent disputes between employers and employes? In New Zealand, preference is given to unionists, but employers there found a means of evading the provision. In many cases, when employes had gone to a great deal of trouble in preparing evidence for the Court, the men who undertook this responsible work were singled out by employers, and dismissed for no reason assigned. The conclusion which has been arrived at by the Right Honorable Richard Seddon. and others interested in industrial matters is that these men have been dismissed simply because they have made themselves prominent in the work incidental to the preparation of cases for the Court. In order to protect the victims of such a system, I may inform honorable senators that there was recently passed by the New Zealand Parliament an Act, one section of which I shall read. In the opinion of some persons in the Commonwealth, preference should not be given, but what would they think if, in addition to such a provision, a law were introduced here to further protect workmen, as they are protected by another Act on the statute-book of New Zealand, section 6 of which reads as follows: - </para>

                        <para>- I desire to inform honorable senators of what has recently happened in connexion with one small trade society in this State. I refer to the Confectioners&#39; Society. For a long period of time the men employed in this industry received but inadequate remuneration for the work which they had to perform. Since the passage of the Factories Act in Victoria they have been successful in bringing into existence a trade society, fairly strong numerically. Certain members of the society were appointed to represent the employes in the industry on the Wages Board. They sat side by side on that board with their employers, with, of course, an independent chairman. One of the workmen who sat as an employes&#39; representative on the board had been in the employ of Dillon and Burrows for a period of thirty-five years. During twelve years of that time he occupied the position of foreman. He had Been for fifteen years secretary of the Confectioners&#39; Society. After the determination of the Wages Board had been gazetted and had come into operation, I am informed that his employers did not continue to treat this man with the same courtesy and consideration which he had received from them previously. Recently, without any reason being assigned, this man, who had been for thirty-five years in the employ of the same firm, was dismissed. He asked for a reason for his dismissal, and he was told that he had not been dismissed because he was an incompetent workman. On the contrary, his employers said that they were satisfied that he could get employment in any establishment in the city. Now, for what reason was he dismissed ? The president of the union was also working for this firm, and he too has been dismissed. After the dismissal of the president and secretary, one member of the society, working in the same establishment, was offered the position of foreman if he would leave the union. The man declined to do so, consequently he did not get the foreman ship, and the probability is that he is out of work now. A few weeks ago some of the -men who were working in the same establishment as unionists, and were subscribing to the union and to a fund to keep the men who had been unjustly dismissed, were informed that if they continued to do that they would meet with the same fate as the men who were out on the street, because of their advocacy of the principles of unionism. We hear much said with respect to the tyranny of minorities. We hear much from men who, during the whole of their public career have been consistent only in inconsistency, in the advocacy of that which the Labour Party has always warmly advocated, and to the principle of which they have always heartily subscribed, namely, majority rule. I am a bit suspicious of the eleventh hour conversion of men who have always been opposed to that principle. I have always my suspicions of the sincerity of eleventh hour converts. I know that there are persons in public life in the State of Victoria who are to-day clamouring for majority rule in matters industrial, and who, to be consistent, should advocate majority rule in matters political. In this State&#39; we have perhaps the most conservative Legislative Council to be found in any State of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- The Legislative Council of Victoria will never do anything that the people desire, unless great public determination is shown after a measure has been passed by the Lower Chamber of the State Parliament. In this institution there are gentlemen, employers of labour, who, together with a number of sympathizers, are today ardent advocates &#39; of majority rule in the industrial world. The members of the Victorian Upper House are elected by a narrow and restricted franchise, and if they believe in majority rule why do they not be consistent and advocate the extension of the franchise on which they are elected, on the lines of the franchise which governs Federal politics? But no, they do not believe in majority rule; they do not believe in the enfranchisement of the people, because if the people were enfranchised as they ought to be, it would be possible for the House to which they belong to be elected by the majority of the people. Even those who do not believe in preference to unionists, but who do believe in majority rule, will find it very difficult to give any valid reason for refusing to support such an amendment as I move. We do not propose to place any restrictions in the way of any workmen or work-women. On the contrary, our hands and our sympathy are extended to them all. But we say that in justice to the men who have done the pioneering in the industrial world in this and in every other State in the Commonwealth, some consideration should be given to their efforts. If this is done I am satisfied that this Bill in the form in which we desire to see it amended, if it will not prevent strikes of a gigantic character occurring in the Commonwealth, will to a very large extent reduce any repetition of the suffering and misery which have been endured by workers in past years, because of the absence of such a measure. </para>

                <para class="block">My reason for submitting this amendment is that I object to preference being given to any one in these matters. I am aware that in a later portion of the clause it is provided that the views of the majority of the persons interested may be taken into consideration, but the giving of preference in any case is to my mind repugnant to fair play. In the case which has been quoted by Senator Walker, the New South Wales Arbitration Court declined to give preference to 250 laundry workers who were unionists, because there were 1,200 employes in the trade, and 950 of them were non-unionists. In that case equity was attained, because the views of the majority were considered, but under &#39; this clause it is provided that preference shall be given not to a majority alone, but to members of organizations making an application to the Court. It seems to me that we ought to object, on the broad principle, to preference being given to any one. </para>

                    <para>. - It is impossible for the Government to accept the amendment. The object of the Bill is to provide a Court to deal with industrial disputes. We know that in a great many of these disputes it is in the power of the parties to agree to a preference. In a case where the parties cannot settle a dispute, we provide a tribunal with power to enforce its decisions, and thus prevent disastrous. strikes or lock-outs. The principle of the measure is that the Court may practically make an industrial agreement in that case, and compel its acceptance by the parties. It seems right that it should have the power to give a preference. In fact, it is hard to see how any measure of conciliation and arbitration could be worked, unless there were organizations upon which an industrial award would be binding. The Bill contemplates that there shall be these organizations, and that they shall submit ,to an agreement, such as might have been come to by the parties, if they were reasonable. I think it has been agreed by almost all persons who have advocated courts of conciliation and arbitration, that it is absolutely necessary that power should be given to the Court to grant a preference in favour of the organization making the application. I think it is generally recognised now that it is desirable that some rule should be laid down as to the conditions under which preference should be given. But. so far as the principle of preference is concerned, that is embodied in the Bill, and the Government cannot consent to any such amendment as that which has been proposed. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think it is of very much use to move an amendment in this .regard, but it is quite right that every honorable senator should express his opinion. I hold that it is a monstrous thing, even for Parliament to create a Court to give preference to one human being against another human being. </para>

                        <para>- It was supposed that the members of the Second Chamber would be matured; grey-haired men like myself. But what sort of&#39; men do I find here? Well, I .shall leave honorable senators to imagine what I think. I cannot conceive of even the general body of working men being willing to empower a Court to say that A, B, or C shall be employed, and no one else. A man may land here without a shilling in his pocket, and yet he is required by the Bill to join a union before he can get a day&#39;s -work. I understand the ideas of working men as well as any honorable senator does. But I cannot understand why unionists should persist in forcing this proposal upon Parliament. I know that it would be of no use to divide on the amendment, because .the Government is anxious to carry the Bill with as few alterations as possible. If I could, I should alter the clause so that no preference would be given. After a man has been punished for a crime, he should be allowed to earn his living; he should be invited to come back to the fold, and to be an honest man. But this clause will not give an honest man a show to earn a living. To me it appears to be an immoral provision. </para>

                        <para>- It does not strike one as an outrageous thing for a private individual to prefer John Smith to John Brown, because he has a right to give a preference if he likes. But it is proposed to enact that a man shall not be permitted to earn his living unless he joins a union whose members may be a very small minority of the persons, engaged in the trade. I protest against the inhumanity of a proposal which would give 100 unionists in an organization a preference over 1,000 non-unionists, because, it appears to me -to strike at the root of all fair play and decency. Nobody can pretend that one set of men is better than another set. Let us be fair, and do justice to all. The Commonwealth will not rise in the estimation of civilized peoples, or progress by means of such extraordinary legislation. If we pass a measure which will work incalculable injury, how can we expect that society will be able to conform to its provisions ? We must allow a certain amount of liberty to human beings in regard to their avocations, provided that they do not infringe the rights and privileges of other persons. </para>

                    <para>- I intend to support the amendment. I propose to answer the allegation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> that employers as a body are absolutely against trade unions. As a representative of that body, I distinctly deny his assertion. In years gone by, there was a very strong bias against unions ; and in my own opinion the employers were wrong, and the men were right. The unions have done good service to labour in all its varied conditions. Labour has been badly paid, has had to work long&#39; hours, and in many instances has been subjected to gross tyranny. Trade unionism secured not only an amelioration of the conditions of labour, but also .the advantages to be derived from the combination of skilled artisans. The very essence of the old unionism was that the. men, while combining to defend their interests, should continue to be governed by a spirit of emulation, so that they should come to be recognised by employers as skilled artisans. That was to a great extent the strength of the unions. I freely acknowledge that, on the whole and broadly speaking, trade unionists are better workmen than non-unionists. But I say that that state of, things is passing. I venture to assert that the average trade unionist of to-day is not the equal of the trade unionist of the past,&#39; and that this decline has, to a large extent, been caused by the political element in modern unions. By entering into the political arena the trade unions thought that their position would be strengthened, and particular individuals thought that they would be able to satisfy their own ambitious ain.s. </para>

                        <para>- I an. glad to know that it is so, because it has been repeatedly stated that unions while refusing to. allow their- members to work more than a certain number of hours per day or for less than, a certain rate of pay, do not allow them to do more than a certain amount of work. I contend that that practice would be an abuse and an injustice. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has given an illustration of tyranny on the part of an employer. Unfortunately, hundreds of cases might be quoted. But if he was fair he would also acknowledge that there are hundreds of cases in which men have exercised tyranny in regard to their employers. One case which occurred in New Zealand, was mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. and Mrs. Sidney</inline> Webb, who visited that country to gather information regarding the labour movement. This is what they state - </para>

                    <para>A master painter engaged two unionists for a job of painting and papering ; one he selected because of his being an expert paperhanger, and the other because of his skill &#39;as a painter. On visiting the job for the first time he found the paperhanger doing the painting and the painter doing the paperhanging. On asking the men to change places, one of them, instead of complying, told his tyrannical master to go to- with his job, and left. This is what unionists would call a spirit of independence. </para>

                <para class="block">I give that as an illustration of what workmen &#39; sometimes do. I believe that trade unionists as a whole are anxious to do what is fair and just to their employers ; but this case shows that the tyranny is not always on the one side. The fact is that we are all to some extent tarred with the same brush in that respect. I do not object to workmen organizing&#39;. I have always been in favour of unionism. But the unions should depend for the strength of their cause upon the fact that they are organized, and that they have to be taken into account in regard to labour conditions. I intend to read an extract from an American newspaper, which gives a report of a very important judgment recently delivered. The extract is taken from the <inline font-style="italic">Railway Age</inline> of 17 th June, 1904. </para>

                    <para>Liberty includes the right to make and enforce contracts, because the right to make and enforce contracts is included in the right to acquire property. Labour is property. To deprive the labourer and employer of this right to contract with one another is to violate section 2 of article 2 of the Constitution of Illinois, which provides that &#34; No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.&#34; It is equally a violation of the 5th and 14th amendments of the Constitution of the United States. The provision embodied in section S is a &#34; discrimination between different classes of citizens&#34; founded on no justifiable ground, and an attempt to exercise legislative power in behalf of certain classes and against other classes, whether labourers seeking work or employers, lt falls under the condemnation of the Constitution. The agreements in question would, if executed, tend to create a monopoly in favour of the members of the different unions to the exclusion of workmen not members of such unions, and are, in this respect, unlawful. Contracts tending to create a monopoly are void. The legislature of the State cannot create a monopoly. </para>

                <para class="block">That is stated to be one of the most important decisions affecting both employers and employes which has been delivered in America in recent years. It was delivered by Judge Adams, Judges Ball and Windes concurring. It practically lays it down that every citizen of the &#34;United States is a free citizen, that he shall enjoy the rights of citizenship; that citizenship gives him the right as a free man to seek for work, to get work, and to use his labour, which is his property, to the best advantage ; and that no man shall have any preference over him in that respect apart from the natural preference of being an abler or a better artisan, or mechanic. It is in that spirit that I regard the recent policy of the trade unions with dismay. I realize that this is the beginning of a system of class legislation which in itself must be injurious to the Labour Party. In the years previous to the Reform Bill in England the land-owners as a class dominated the country. In consequence labour suffered under conditions that we can scarcely realize to-day. I venture to say that if this Bill is passed, and if preference is given to unionists, they will have reason to regret it. We shall have another system of class domination. All class domination is injurious to the country, whether it is on the part of the employers or the employed. The unions will suffer more than they realize. I speak as an employer who sympathises with labour more perhaps than some honorable senators opposite realize. I contend, for instance, that the labour of the seaman or the miner should be paid for at wages over and above a living rate, in order that these workmen may put by a little to enable them to live in their old age quite apart from old-age pensions. They ought to be able to save enough to prevent themselves from being dependent upon :ne community in the closing years of their lives. I venture to prophesy that some years hence honorable senators opposite will realize that labour in Australia has suffered in consequence of this measure. Labour absolutely depends on permanent work, and there cannot be permanent work unless the country is prosperous. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, but if Robinson Crusoe possessed Australia, while he might live, it would not be in a manner any way satisfactory to himself. Labour ultimately depends on the production of the country, and if the producers do not thrive labour must suffer. The wharf labourers in Sydney have a union, with a membership of about 2,000, and yet I am informed that the average earnings last year were only about 15s. per week per man. That was simply because of the reduced number of ships which had to be loaded or unloaded. In the same way, the building trade depends on increased population, and there cannot be any increase unless the country is prosperous. The imposition of conditions which may have the effect of reducing the manufacturers&#39; output cannot improve the position of labour ; such conditions are against all reason and all economic laws. I have no doubt that honorable sen a- | tors opposite regard such a provision as ..hit under consideration as only fair and equitable. But it would be of no use. for example, to enact that a man&#39;s wage should be per week, when the standard of wages is absolutely dependent on the prosperity of the industry in which he is engaged. All the laws in the world will not make men happy and prosperous in their callings, unless the economic conditions of the country are favorable. We must pay regard to the inter-dependence of the different industries. </para>

                        <para>- If the development of the country is retarded by the exclusion &#62;( capital and. labour, the result recoils on both employer and employe. I will give an illustration.&#39; A gentleman in England bought land in that country valued at nearly &#163;100,000 in order to present it to his native town. He had to dispossess fifteen farmers, whom he proposed, if they were willing, to send to Australia, advancing money for tha payment of their passages and to give them a start. He wrote to me, asking me to make inquiries as to the price of land, labour conditions, and so forth. I fixed upon the Richmond River as a good place, and seat home all the particulars I could gather, pointing out that so far as the employment of labour was concerned the conditions were much more favorable to the farmer in England than in Australia. I suggested that, under the circumstances, farmers with grown-up families would be in a much better position than those who had to employ labour - that the former would not only be able to make a fair, but a very good living. The farmers were called together, and the position explained, with the result that seven decided to go to Canada, and <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> other eight decided to stay at horns. . </para>

                        <para>- I told them that they could get land here equal to the best in the world. There are thousands of people in New South Wales who not only have happy homes, but are making little fortunes on the land. In that State there is some of the finest land which only requires developing, and it can be .developed only by people who have the will and the necessary expert knowledge. Those farmers, if they had come to Australia, would have been the means of employing labour, not only on their farms, but indirectly in Sydney and elsewhere, in the handling of their produce. Every business man knows the bias which capitalists and others in England have against Australia, and it is essential that we should restore the confidence on which our prosperity depends. That is an object which I shall do my best to assist in attaining, but I shall fight with all my strength against legislation which, in my opinion, would be detrimental to the development of the country. I believe that trade unionism is a good thing, but I shall fight against the injustice and tyranny which would prevent a citizen of the Commonwealth from working as he pleases for himself and those dependent upon him. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to explain. I did not complain of the labour conditions, so far as the labourers&#39; wages are concerned. In my opinion, labour in the agricultural districts is not paid one farthing more than it has a right to expect; indeed, I hope the present wages may be improved on. I only stated that, in simple fairness, </para>

                        <para>- The conditions of agricultural labour in New South Wales are simply disgraceful, and men who regard them as too favorable to the employe are better outside Australia. We want none of them. If the labour conditions which might be secured under an arbitration law applied to the agricultural industry there might have been some reason for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray&#39;s</inline> cry. But we know that there has never been an organization of those engaged in the agricultural industry ; there has never been a case brought by them before&#39; an Arbitration Court, and there has been no rise in their wages as a consequence of such legislation as this. There can be no doubt that we should be much better off without the kind of people who look for lower wages than those to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has referred. If they are countrymen of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray&#39;s,</inline> the honorable senator should be glad that they have not come here to bring discredit on &#39; Australia. The honorable senator has also told us about wharf labourers working for 15s. a week in Sydney. Is that a fair wage? </para>

                        <para>- I hold that these men have been robbed of the produce of their labour. 1 have already submitted figures to show how the shipping industry in Australia has advanced in prosperity. I have compared the position of the industry at the present time with its position in 1891, which it will be admitted was a most prosperous year for the industry in Australia. It cannot therefore be said that I contrasted the state of the industry during a year of depression with a more flourishing state of affairs. I have shown that the figures compiled by <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> make it clear that the increase for the period to which I referred, from 1891 to 1901, was from 56 to  75  per cent, in&#39; inter-State and oversea shipping. I therefore repeat that the men to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has referred as having to work for 15s. a week, are not getting a fair share of the wealth which their labour produces. </para>

                        <para>- I point put that if 15s. a week represents the average wage paid to wharf labourers, it is clear that some of these unfortunate men have to live on less than 15s. a week. If the average is only 15s. a week, I wonder what is the minimum. Honorable senators opposite will dispute their own figures, and if we quote <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan,</inline> who is the highest statistical authority in Australia, they will dispute his figures. I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> will be prepared to argue against what he has said to-day. The agricultural labourer in New South Wales is the most sweated individual in the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has told us that capital is being driven out of the Commonwealth, and yet those carrying on the agricultural industry in New South Wales cannot afford to pay their labourers 5s. a week. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s friends who would not come to New South Wales because of the high wages then existing among farm labourers. I have shown that the prosperity of the other industry to which the honorable senator has referred is increasing by leaps and bounds, and from the dividends which are paid by Australian shipping companies there can be no doubt that a far better rate of wages than that to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has referred should be paid in that industry. The honorable senator has so mixed up labour, wages, and capital that there is really no following him. He has told us that if Robinson Crusoe had arrived in Australia he would have starved. I do not think that he would. I hold that Australia is one of the richest countries on the face of God&#39;s earth. I have no doubt that if Robinson Crusoe had arrived in Australia he would never have left it as he left the island on which he did land, and his descendants would be here to-day. The only capital which he had was the power of his hands to produce wealth. He produced wealth, and it was not until he became a bloated capitalist, so to speak, and captured his man Friday, that he followed the usual role of the capitalist and made of his man Friday a slave. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the honorable senator will see that it is advisable that we should give those men some protection in their work, and some degree of permanency in their employment. One of the reasons why the work of the wharf labourer is so badly paid is that the flotsam and jetsam of the population cut into their work, and I hold that that is not fair to the men who follow the occupation continuously. </para>

                        <para>- I think that that would be only fair to the men who are following this work as their regular calling. It is not in my opinion fair that when there is a scarcity of employment at this calling, the unemployed who do not follow it continuously should be allowed to divide with those who only get a half-loaf, which is already too much divided. I would go as far as any other honorable senator in finding work for the unemployed, but I think I should be doing them no injustice in refusing to divide with them work which is looked for by men continuously engaged in the calling, and whose wages are already too small. I hold that the amendment which has been moved is out of order. One of the objects of this Bill is to encourage trade unionism. </para>

                        <para>- If such a man can be found, he will be found to be one of those miserable small-hearted individuals who think .more of a threepenny or sixpenny contribution than of their manhood ; one of those creatures who will not contribute to a fund&#39; for the benefit of the trade by which they get their living. That is the type of man whom this amendment would encourage. I desire that there should be no more of the bitter battles which have been fought in the past between trade unionists and employers. But honorable senators opposite must, understand that if the necessity is forced upon trade unionists they will be found equal to the occasion. Although it has cost us much&#39; to do it, we have always been prepared, to fight for our rights, and let the consequences be what they may, they will not deter trade unionists from fighting for what they believe to be their rights. I say that trade unionists must be given preference in this measure if it is to be of any use! to them. If preference is not given, they will not register under the Bill, and so far as they are concerned, it will remain a dead letter, and we mav as well do without any arbitration law. Non-unionists never have submitted and never will submit a case to an Arbitration Court, and the trade unionists have been, and will be, made targets of. They will be regarded by their employers as agitators, and will, get no advantage from this legislation. I* appeal to the sense of justice in honorable senators opposite when I ask whether it is fair that the men who will be the means of putting this law into operation should receive np consideration whatever. T hold that unless a clear and distinct preference be given to unionists, honorable senators, instead of bringing about industrial peace, will bring about a repetition of those old industrial upheavals with which we have all been very familiar. </para>

If honorable senators will not give a preference to the trade unionist, they will subject him to the danger of a boycott, or of being branded as a ringleader. If this measure is to be of any use, preference to unionists must be conceded in clear and distinct terms ; otherwise we are only wasting our time in discussing its provisions. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to record my objection to the amendment. I was very glad when, towards the close of his remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie recalled the attention of the Committee to the real principle at issue in the discussion. I admit at once that it is very difficult for one to closely discuss the principle which underlies the amendment, unless he be prepared to ignore entirely many of &#34;the arguments which are set up against its acceptance. I cannot refrain from referring to some statements which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> made in his speech. He laid immense emphasis on the deterioration of trade, and the stagnation of the country, being responsible for lack of employment, and all that kind of -thing. But I have yet to learn that it has ever been contended that the existence of an Arbitration Court would insure a prolific harvest, or prevent the occurrence of droughts. We feel that these calamities are destined to come upon us, whether we have an Arbitration Court or not. Our desire is that men who are working by the sweat of their brows for a livelihood, may have an equitable deal in the distribution of the good things which exist in this world. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator has rather a peculiar method of showing where his sympathies lie. In the course of his speech, he frequently said that he was quite favorable to a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, in so far as it embodied the principles of the old unionism, and did not give effect to any of the aspirations of what he chose to term the new unionism. Will it surprise any honorable senators to learn that preference is not a new proposal ? Strictly speaking, it ought to be called protection - that is, protection to men who would otherwise be cast out. It is as old as I am. When I was a little over nine years of age I was working in a coal mine, and within twenty minutes of the time I commenced work, I &#39;was a trade unionist. Whenever a man came to a mine in that county, and asked an employer if there was a possibility of obtaining employment there, the first question of the manager was, &#34;Are you a member of a trade union?&#34; If the man said &#34; Yes,&#34; the manager answered, &#34;Well, show me your proof.&#34; If the man drew out his trade union card, that was sufficient proof, and if a hand were wanted, he was given employment. But if the man had not a trade union card, the manager asked whether he was prepared to become a member of the trade union, and if the question were answered in the affirmative, he was employed. If it had been answered in the negative, I doubt verv much whether the manager would have seriously thought of giving him employment. So that there is nothing new about the unionism which inculcates protection to the. worker. On the contrary, it is unionism of the oldest kind. It is imbued with the spirit of humanity, with an intense desire, to protect the labourer from those admitted tyrannies to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> referred. The arguments in favour of what he terms the new unionism must appear to him to be but a repetition of the cry which has been going on for very many years. When I was quite a youngster, I heard the same arguments as the honorable senator has used, advanced from the platform by men who were in deadly earnest in their opposition to the combination of labour. The fact must be recognised that along with what the honorable senator regards as the new unionism, there is the new industrialism. He shuts his eyes to the fact that changing conditions in industrial life have necessitated changed attitudes in unionist operations. It must be recognised that the real new unionism is simply the highest development of that light which has been shining through the centuries. When trade unionism was opposed in the olden days, it did not prevent organizations from growing in strength .and number, and the result of its growth and development may be seen here just as it is seen in all other parts of the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> cited an American case to show how&#39; preference to unionists had absolutely failed. I never attach great importance to American authorities. I recognise that in that country there are three &#34; fundamentals,&#34; as some honorable senators term them. America has a large number of millionaires, it makes more paupers than any other country I know of, and it has larger strikes than any other country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> has contended that we are endeavouring practically to exclude non-unionists from employment. We have never made any such attempt, and do not do so now. But we say that the trade unionist is menaced every day in his life. I will give an instance. There is a coal-mining industry in Western Australia, and during the last &#34;two years the whole of the men engaged at one mine have no less than four times been notified of their dismissal as a body. The reason given was that the employers desired to shorten hands. But I wish the Committee to understand what this pretence of shortening hands really meant. The same company is to-day employing as large a number of hands as has been employed at any time. What the company has done has been to give fourteen days&#39; notice of their intention to shorten hands, and to dispense with a certain number. I was one of the victims myself on one or two occasions. We determined &#34;to have a ballot as to whose services should be dispensed with, rather than .give the company the opportunity to single out and dismiss the men whom they particularly disliked. </para>

                        <para>- We did nothing of the kind. We denied the right of the employers to victimize a man because, he was a unionist, and had brains-enough to look after his own interests. As soon <inline font-style="italic">ax</inline> this position was taken up the company reluctantly accepted it, but instead of desiring to dispense with the services of half-a-dozen men they dispensed with a hundred. What was the result? If the men whom they really wished to get rid of were four in number out of a hundred, the company took the other&#39; ninety-six back again within forty-eight hours. The other men were not less valuable, nor were they less desirable citizens, but they were dismissed because they were always to the front when the principles that they belie\,ad in were at stake, and when questions affecting the livelihood of the workers were to be looked after. To my own personal knowledge that practice has been adopted within the last two years at no less than four mines. I have had a great deal of experience of employers, and I do not brand every employer as being unfair towards unionists. There are employers with whom I am personally acquainted who have the handling of large numbers of men. and who sincerely believe that the life of their industry is best conserved by employing union men, who are true to themselves and to each other. Why? Because under such conditions, as employers have told me scores of times, they know whom they are dealing with. They know that in negotiating with the officers of organizations they are dealing with men who will tell them directly what they want and what they mean. Once a compact has been arranged they can depend upon union men. The opposition to preference to unionists is simply a bit of political fat. We are not asking for preference to unionists. We are asking for protection to unionists. </para>

They recognise that their rights and privileges have been secured by the agency of unions. Their unions have been political organizations in the true sense.

                        <para>- The coalminers&#39; unions have always been political organizations. 11,hey have had ito look after Coal Mines Regulation Bills, and to agitate for them. They have been, their own principals in every case, and? have had to fight for all their requirements. They have had to make up their minds as to what was needed to benefit their industry, and then they have sailed straight to the harbor where they could obtain it. That has been the case for the last century at least. The sanitary conditions under which coal miners have had to work in the past are almost inconceivable to men who know nothing about mining. If honorable senators who are opposing this provision would don the miner&#39;s jacket for three months I venture to say that they would hold a different opinion in respect to preference. It is want of knowledge and of experience in these matters that leads to many of the arguments which are advanded against preference. </para>

                        <para>- What is the history of this movement in Australia? The movement took practical form in New South Wales when .the disastrous results of the great maritime strike were realized. A Royal Commission was then appointed, and on the report of that Commission the New South Wales Parliament passed an Act providing for voluntary conciliation. We all know of the failure of that Act. Since then we have gone onward, until to-day there is before us a Bill providing for compulsory conciliation and arbitration in disputes extending beyond the limits of a State. We are asked to say that unionists who will have to pay fines in the event of there being a strike, shall have no preference. Such a proposal is ridiculously one-sided. Where there are responsibilities, there ought to be privileges, and nowhere else. We are asking nothing but what is absolutely fair and British ; and the country will know what value to place on the protests of honorable senators opposite. The country has only recently been polled, and with what result ? An absolute majority of the honorable senators returned to this Chamber at the last election are pledged to support preference, for the one purpose of securing industrial peace in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- We do not need to quibble; and it is sufficient that I am able to say that four States against two returned representatives to this Senate in favour of preference to unionists. The Attorney-General has said that the question was not before the country. I can tell honorable senators that one of the daily newspapers in Adelaide raised the question as a bogy to frighten the electors of South Australia, and told them that if representatives of the Labour Party were returned that was what they might expect. </para>

I claim that no injustice will be done to non-unionists if the small measure of preference to unionists asked for in this measure is conceded. As I have already said, all the sacrifices will be made by trade unionists, whilst the non-unionists will be m&#39;aking no sacrifices at all to bring about industrial peace. </para>

                    <para>- I am only too pleased that the electors of the Commonwealth should know that there are a few members of the Senate, whose sense of British fair play and justice impels them to protest against this provision which the Labour Party are seeking to force upon the community. I think that our friends of the Labour Party desire the liberty to kill liberty, and I am very much inclined to think that they will succeed in killing liberty, when the electors of this Commonwealth will say in lament, &#34; Save us from our friends.&#34; As a matter of fact, the workers of the Commonwealth are now saying, &#34;Save us from our friends.&#34; Not a single honorable senator opposite can explain why it is that the majority of the workers of the Commonwealth- remain outside the unions. We have listened to volumes of eloquence as to what unionists have done, and how. much consideration they deserve for the advantages they have conferred upon their class, but, notwithstanding all that, instead of the workers rushing to join the unions they steadfastly remain outside of them. We have had no satisfactory explanation from any newspaper, or from any member of the Labour Party as to why non-unionists refuse to join the unions. I take, it that if the workers generally believed that in unionism they would find liberty, justice, fair play, and the advantages which honorable senators opposite claim for it, they would enter the unions. When we find unionists in such a hopeless minority, we are justified in examining most critically the basis upon which honorable senators opposite rest their defence of unionism. Since criticism has been directed to the unions in this way, every newspaper we .take up has something to say concerning the tyranny and thraldom of unionism. We are given the details of facts which go to show that the unions are political, and desire to tyrannize over non-unionists, and everybody else. We have had specific instances to prove this. We know that the Australian Workers&#39; Union practically compelled another association - the Machine Shearers&#39; Union - to register, and we found that the Registrar of &#39;the New South Wales Arbitration Court decided that the rules of the Australian Workers&#39; Union were such that no free, workman should be asked to subscribe to them. We have learned that .they passed rules concerning the politics of the country under which men were robbed of the right to exercise their conscientious convictions. We learned that trade unions are political institutions, and we are here being asked to pass a Bill to give them power to tyrannize over all the workers of the Commonwealth. I hope .that there will be a clear-cut issue when we next go before the electors. I deny that any honorable senator has a right to say that the electors of the Commonwealth seat to this Senate a majority of honorable senators in favour of preference to unionists. &#39; That is not a fact. </para>

I do not wish to deny to the Labour Party any victory they may have obtained. I prophesy that they are going to obtain further victories, but as their efforts will be in the direction of tyranny and injustice, the workers will some day have reason to say, &#34; Save us from our friends.&#34; We have the afternoon before us, and I have some very interesting reading here which I propose to give .to the Senate. I should like honorable senators opposite to learn what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Macgregor, of New Zealand, has to say on the subject of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in that Colony. He is not a member of the Labour Party, but he had at the outset the greatest possible sympathy with this legislation. He is. a master of arts, a barrister at law, and he was a member of the New Zealand Legislature. This is what he says - </para>

                    <para>It only remains to add that the writer did his best as a member of the Legislature to secure the passing of the Act; that. he believed it would prove a beneficent measure, and still believes it would have so proved had it not been perverted to improper uses; that he has watched it closely ficm its inception, hoping against hope that it might yet fulfil its promise and justify the expectations of its author ; that he has been reluctantly driven to the conclusion that it is proving, and) must more and more prove, a curse instead of a blessing. </para>

Let us learn something of the grounds on which he bases this opinion of the working of the New Zealand Arbitration Act.

                    <para>It has been truly said that unionism must dominate Parliament if it is not controlled by Parliament, and in New Zealand for some years, it has dominated the Government, and through it the Parliament. The ultimate aim of the ringleaders in the conspiracy is to dominate the employers and control all the industries of the Colony ; and Parliament has deliberately furthered their aims, whilst the Court, by awarding preference to unionists has unconsciously played. into their hands. They have achieved their object, and the employers from end to end of the Colony feel themselves to be at their mercy. This is no exaggeration, but a sober statement of fact. Is it possible or conceivable that such a system can be a success? </para>

It never occurs to them to ask whether the argument used is sound, or whether it can be met. They never think of learning anything from the teachings of history, and the operation of the Arbitration Acts already in force in the Commonwealth and in New Zealand. They have not sufficient courage to answer the arguments which are used, but by sneering and jeering at him they try to pull down .the man who uses arguments against them. </para>

Whenever I have had the pleasure, as I sometimes have had, of speaking to gatherings of the Labour Party outside, I have found that they will not listen to facts. One is only allowed to half state a fact, when they begin to sneer and to jeer. I wish honorable senators opposite to listen now to what this <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macgregor</inline> says. He is a barrister-at-law, and though I am aware my honorable friends opposite do not like lawyers, they should have some respect for the opinion of a thoughtful and cultured man, who has taken his degree at a University, and who assisted to pass the New Zealand Conciliation and Arbitration Act. This is what he says about unionists in New Zealand, and I suppose they may be considered first cousins to those represented by our honorable friends opposite - </para>

                    <para>Unionism in New Zealand has become a triple tyranny - the ringleaders and agitators tyrannize over the general body of unionists; the unionists, who are only a minority of the workers, have established a tyranny over the workers generally, and they exercise almost complete control over the Ministry and (he Legislature. They are at present concentrating all their efforts upon one object - to compel employers to use their capital according to the determinations of the unions, dictated through the Court of Arbitration, and, in the meantime, to give the least possible return to the employers for wages received. </para>

                <para class="block">We have proof of those statements. We know well that through the Arbitration Court the workers are trying to secure more and more of the profits of industry. In some instances, they may have a perfect right to share in them, but what this writer points out is that while they subject their employers to the irritation of litigation they are not prepared to give them a fair day&#39;s work for the wages they receive. It has bean proved over and over again. </para>

It can never be rammed home too often that it is a question of character. If employers do not possess a proper character, no Act of Parliament will ever make them do justice. And if employes have not a character for steady thrift, sobriety, and industry, all the Acts of Parliament which may be passed will not make this a. prosperous industrial Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>One of the features of &#39;new unionism generally is its contempt for the old unionism, and especially for its encouragement of thrift and self help. The inculcation of thrift is looked upon with coldness, if not with aversion, by our New Zealand variety pf unionism, as, indeed, it is by materialistic Socialism generally. Experience shows that amongst the workers as a rule, thrift goes with unselfishness and a sense of duty and responsibility, and unthrift with selfishness and self-indulgence. The whole tendency of unionism amongst us is to destroy in the worker the one thing on which his manliness and his chance of real happiness depend, by disparaging the old unionist idea that it is a man&#39;s duty to carry at least his own burden ; it tends also to discourage the foresight and self control which form one of the elementary factors of morality - &#34;a quality in moral character which determines the happiness or misery of them who possess or do not possess it, in a way that goes far deeper into life than by mere success or failure in laying by a sum of money.&#34; The difference between the old unionism and colonial unionism-, is clearly seen in their different attitudes towards the question of old age pensions. The tendency with .us being to look to the State for everything, and to discourage self-reliance. It is still more clearly seen in the fact that amongst the unionists in New Zealand there is almost complete indifference to real co-operation, which in England has made such remarkable progress in recent years. The whole tendency of our boasted labour legislation is to discourage real co-operation, and one of the worst evils of our arbitration system is that it tends, not only to divide permanently employers and wage earners into two hostile camps, and to render it more and more difficult for the wage earner to become an employer, but also to segregate the wage earners more and more from the other classes of the community. </para>
                <para class="block">From my experience - and I read everything on Socialism or labour politics that I Can get hold of - that is exactly what labour legislation is tending to. I do not say that the unionists set to work to do this wilfully, but that is the result of almost all their efforts. They are setting class against class. They fail to recognise this fundamental fact, that the interests of the workers and the owners in a factory are identical ; that the larger the profit made, the better it is for both parties. They must consider what profit can be made. On the one hand there is the capital and the directing skill of the owner, while on .the other hand there is the labour of the men and its efficiency and skill. All these factors ought to be safeguarded whenever we pass a law. All these factors must be present whenever we desire to go in the direction of successful industry. But my honorable friends leave them all out of consideration. They think pf nothing but wages, and how to increase wages. They do not consider both sides of the question. I hope to submit, next week, an amendment in which I shall try to define some of the principles which should guide the Court in adjusting wages between owner and worker. We have not done with this admirable pamphlet yet. Judging from the attention which it commands from my honorable friends, it is making them think. I do not desire to convert every one of them. I merely ask them to consider the reasons they will submit to the electors for placing an Act of Parliament, and a secretary to a union, between a man and his daily bread. If that is what they call liberty and justice, let them gp to the country on that cry, and let us fight out the question whether we are to be governed by tyranny. If we are to be governed by political unionism, let us know it as soon as possible, so that a man can elect to stay in the country and part with his capital, or clear out with his capital. Let us all know exactly what the conditions are to be. </para>

                        <para>- Let a man take his choice. Let us know what the conditions are to be. I am inclined to think that under the power which the Labour Party are getting we shall never know what the conditions are to be. I do not suppose that any place could be found in which there is more unrest and discontent. My honorable friends on the other side believe in the gospel of discontent. The unrest in the Commonwealth is dreadful. The uncertainty of our legislation must tend to make men timid in investing their capital. It must tend to make men look for investments in other places. While this state of things continues we cannot expect to get the best investment of capital. Its investment must be limited. Do my honorable friends mean to tell me that if there were uncertainty of work and prosperity here labour men would not go out to the first gold, coal, or tin mine, which they could hear of? We know that they would. If the conditions for the employment of capital be made more uncertain, capital will go too.

                    <para>Such are the general tendencies and character of unionism of the colonial type, and it must be admitted that the probabilities are against the success of a system of conciliation and arbitration in which unionism has such a preponderating influence. Coercion and class warfare are of the very essence of it, and we can now see that failure was the inevitable fate of any system based upon conciliation. Unionism, like other institutions, possesses no other virtue than that of the men of flesh and blood who apply it; and the leaders of colonial unionism, like their master, Karl Marx, profess the most profound contempt for moral ideals generally. Their reliance is upon force, not upon character. </para>

                        <para>- I have quoted all the passages bearing on the question of unionism. There are plenty of passages about the Arbitration Act generally, but I cannot use them in relation to this clause. I protest against its retention. I have always pointed out how various unions are decreasing in number. Although this legislation has been promised, still the unions have been decreasing in number during the last two years. How idle, therefore, is it for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> to talk about the electors sending a majority here in favour of this legislation. It rests with my honorable friends on the other side to show that the unions are doing good, and not harm ; that they exist merely for the sake of working this Bill; and that their membership is gradually increasing. When they must admit that there is a majority of two to one against the unionists, and that some unions are decreasing in number while this discussion is proceeding, how can they ask that a minority shall receive a preference from the Court? What is one to think about this democracy? Every honorable senator on the other side would feel insulted if I did not admit that he was a full-fledged liberal-socialistic-democrat. If he is, does he not believe in government by majority ? Are we to have government by majority all over the Commonwealth, except in the case of trades unionists? Are we. to listen to this rant and nonsense about unionists having given up the right to strike? They have not given up that right. Their representatives come to us with nothing in their mouths but &#34; Compulsory arbitration.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I am discussing an argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> to the effect that unionists are entitled to preference because they have given up the right to strike. I contend that they have given up nothing. They are the wrong sort of people to give up anything. When they begin to give up a little, and consider the rights of others, they will get a little more respect from me. That argument is used here again and again, but does it contain a shadow of truth? How dare the men who are trying to dominate the whole Commonwealth and begging that this Bill shall be made law, as it does justice to the unionists, say that they are giving up a right? My honorable friends talk about restricting liberty, and get angry when liberty is taken away from them. This provision for preference to unionists will &#39; create a great deal of friction, and will be found to be utterly impracticable. It will deprive many men of employment, and will harass employers. In the long run the unionists will tyrannize. They have tyrannized in the past, just as the employers have done. We shall not alter human nature by passing this Bill. Unions have been shutting out the cooper, although he could make a cask, and they have been shutting out the wharf labourer by closing their books. This Bill will convert them into legal political organizations. We have no right to pass a provision of that sort &#34;unless we have the rules and the agreements of every union in Australia placed upon the table of this Senate. I believe .that if this clause is to be carried, we ought to embody in the Bil! a set of rules for the unions ; and any other rules which the unionists sought to make should be certified to by the Attorney-General that they were not. contrary to the spirit of the measure. We have no right to let the Court find out years hence that there are large unions that have restrictive clauses in their rules. </para>

                        <para>- Before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> leaves the chamber - as he is in the habit of doing when he has made reckless charges of this kind - I ask him to listen to some figures in reply to one statement which he made. I take these figures from an official document. He said that in all the States of Australia the number of unionists is dwindling, and that the working men are not joining the unions. He referred especially to those States in which there are Arbitration Acts. I am going to explode that statement, and to show that it is on a par with many other statements which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> makes. I have here the official report of the Registrar of the Arbitration Court in Western Australia. That report shows that in the year 1901 the number of registered trade unionists in Western Australia - and these figures do not include the unregistered unionists - was 8,920. In the year 1902 the number was 11,442, an increase of 2,522. In the year 1903 the number was 15,294, an increase in the year of 3,852 ; or an increase in the two years of over 6,000 trade unionists. I ask the honorable and learned senator, in view of that statement, whether he is again prepared to make the assertion which he has made to the Senate? </para>

                        <para>- I shall have to go into details to show that it is not only in the mining centres, but also in the industrial centres, that there has been an increase. I will, for instance, give the figures for the south-western district of Western Australia, where there is no mining whatever - absolutely none. In 1901 there were 3,708 unionists, and in 1903 there were 7,948, an increase of over 4,000. That number does not include any miners - not one. The honorable and learned senator asks us to accept the opinions of the alleged expert whom he has quoted on the subject of arbitration. He calls him an impartial expert. A . gentleman who claims to be impartial should use impartial language; and when I hear a person stigmatize the trade unionists of New Zealand as tyrants I have grave doubts as to his impartiality.

                    <para>During the hearing in the Arbitration Court to-day of an application by the Operative Bakers&#39; Union to have a common rule in the trade extended so as to operate in the Newcastle and Illawarra districts, the President stated that he was of opinion that if this matter had been left to those concerned in the business at Newcastle it would have been settled, with perhaps the exception of the minimum wage question. He could only say that it was unreasonable to expect to settle these matters by rule of thumb, as the conditions in different districts were not always similar. He could not understand why men should insist upon acting on this rule of thumb method. He could understand them trying to get uniform conditions, but he thought the men ought to bend a little in response to the different conditions which prevailed in different .places so long as they were being fairly treated by their employers, and were getting fair wages and working reasonable hours. He repeated that he considered the whole matter could have been settled if the Newcastle branch had been left to itself with the exception of the minimum wage. This question involved an amount of only 2s. 6d. a week. There was no magic in the hour for starting work. In Sydney it was 9 o&#39;clock, but such hour might not suit the employers at Newcastle. So long as the men were not sweated, but obtained reasonable conditions, he thought they should consider a little more the interests of those who employed them. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CROFT</inline>(Western Australia).I intend to oppose the amendment. I shall not go over the ground traversed by the supporters of the Bill as it stands, except to join with them in the belief that trade unionists should have preference, by reason of the fact that they are members of organizations recognised by the Bill. While that aspect of the case has been laboured, the main question as to giving preference, in order to insure protection, has not been answered from the other side. An attempt has been made to deny that individual employers discharge men because they are trade unionists, or that organizations of employers boycott and discharge men for the same reason. But, as a matter of fact, ,the official organs of the employers advocate iri leading articles that trade unionists should not be employed. Is it denied that that is the case ? </para>

                <para class="block">That is from a newspaper which supported the candidature of the nominee of the Reform League of New South Wales. How much further will an organization of employers go in an attempt to boycott trade unions? I shall give an illustration. The secretary of the Tailoresses&#39; Union in Western Australia was discharged from her employment because of her official connexion with the organization, and thereupon the other employes, male and female, numbering about eight, came out on strike. No other tailor would employ them, and they walked about idle for weeks. I organized what we called the Industrial Co-operative Tailoring Company, and .made arrangements with Messrs. Sargood, Butler, Nicolee, and Ewen for the purchase of material. The first supply was received, and the manager put in charge of the company. However, the Master Tailors&#39; Association met and went in a body to Sargood, Butler, Nicolee, and Ewen, and to other wholesale merchants, whose names I do not know, and intimated that if the co-operative company was supplied with material, the members of the Master Tailors&#39; Association would have no further dealings with them. The result was that the Industrial Co-operative Tailoring Company, found it impossible to get a yard of material in Perth at any price. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DOBSON</inline>(Tasmania).- It is not my intention to answer the hysterical heroics of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who played his part of trade union advocate in a very proper manner, except that he could not refrain - honorable members opposite seem unable to refrain - from imputing words I never uttered, and twisting my words and arguments. I gave honorable senators three different examples of what the newspapers call the &#34; tyranny and thraldom &#34; of unionism, and I adhere to every word I said. In my opinion, those unions acted in a tyrannical, cruel, and unjust manner. I did not vilify or condemn the whole of the unionists of this State or of the Commonwealth, but merely applied my remarks to the three instances. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> does not seem to pay any regard to the fact that the numerical strength of the Australian Workers&#39; Union has dwindled down from 21,000 to 13,000. The members of this union had certain rules which the Registrar of the Court considered unjust and unfair, and which deprived men of their liberty. They were so strict as to take away a man&#39;s conscience and judgment in connexion with anything political, and they handed him over bodily to the executive of the union. I say that to give a union of that kind any legal status would be to do a gross wrong. I say that the members of the Coopers&#39; Union, in setting a man to make a cask out of wood which he was not accustomed to work, and then excluding him, did a gross wrong. I have said that their work was the work of tyrants, and so far from withdrawing the words I now repeat them. I say that the members of the Wharf Labourers&#39; Union, in preventing some fifteen wharf labourers from working where they had worked for years, unless they agreed to join their union, and then bluffing them in every possible way to prevent them joining, acted unjustly and tyrannically. I stick to that, but the honorable senator has twisted my statement into a villi. ,fication of the whole of the workers of the Commonwealth. That is not fair argument. I have not vilified men whose actions I know nothing about. I have given three examples, and I stand by the words I have used in connexion with the unions to which I have specially referred. I say that unions which would be guilty of such gross wrong should be given no political power whatever. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has repudiated the statement that by this legislation we are bringing ridicule upon Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator told the ladies at one meeting that they must combine &#34; from the highest lady in the land to the meanest servant,&#34; and when a lady in the audience interjected that servants were not necessarily mean, he did not know what to say. That is exactly the position in which the honorable and learned senator finds himself here. He tries to dodge round every statement he has made, and how can honorable senators on this side fix gentlemen of that description? When their arguments are knocked to pieces, they simply repeat them,, or trump up new ones. The honorable and learned senator has to-day referred to the rules which have been adopted by trade unions in New South Wales. He has told us that the Australian Workers&#39; Union had rules that were tyrannical, and that the members of that union should therefore receive no preference. But the honorable and learned senator must recollect that before they can receive any preference under this Bill, those rules must be altered in accordance with the judgment of the Registrar and the Arbitration Court. Again, in connexion with the coopers&#39; incident, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> should know that if any trade society acts unjustly towards any worker who is entitled to be a member of the society, it can receive no preference. In connexion with the incident of the wharf labourers, to whom reference has been made, if the statement, that they are only earning on the average 15s. per week, be true, I see no reason why any one should be very anxious to become a member of the Wharf Labourers&#39; Union. Whether that statement be true or not, if the members of that union place obstacles unfairly in. the way of any one becoming a member, do not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and his friends see that before they can claim preference under such a Bill as this, their rules and their methods of conducting their business must be altered in such a way as to give to every qualified person the most perfect liberty to join their ranks? Does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> see that that would be the very best thing for the community ? If unionists are to share the advantages of this measure, their rules must be fair and just to everybody, and the condition of things under a Bill of this description will be better than that which has prevailed in the past. Instead of arguing against preference to unionists, honorable senators opposite, even from their own point of view, should argue in favour of it. It has been clearly pointed out that this clause provides not so much for preference as for protection. I could tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> of thousands of people in Australia, and of hundreds who are amongst my own acquaintances, who would be members of trade unions to-morrow but for the fact that if they joined a trade union the bread would be taken out of their mouths straight away by those by whom they are employed at the present time- I have no desire to publish the names of particular workers and firms, but if the honorable and learned senator will come to me privately I can give him a number of names, and he can make his own inquiries as to the facts. The honorable and learned senator will then learn how necessary it is that preference of some description should be given to the men who have taken, and who will take, an active part in the readjustment of the industrial affairs &#39;of . the community. If some such provision is not made law, these men will be sacrificed every day, and the result, in a few years, will be that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> desire will be accomplished, and there will not be a unionist left in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I shall give the honorable senator an opportunity of supporting that view. It is better to leave the decision to the Court. In the case of the laundry trade in Sydney, the Arbitration Court refused to give a preference because there were about 250 unionists as against 950 non-unionists. After taking everything into consideration, the Court, in its wisdom, decided that the unionists were not entitled to preference. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite prepared to put the trade unionists of Australia in exactly the same position by leaving the decision to the Court. In some instances there might be a vast majority of unionists and only a very small minority of non-unionists, and if the Court, in its wisdom, thought that no preference was necessary, or should be given, why should it not be at liberty, to decide, quite apart from what the non-unionists think? In other instances there might be a very small proportion of unionists interested in the decision, but the Court might come to the conclusion that, under existing circumstances, those persons might be very hardly dealt with if some preference were not granted.- It is the duty of this Parliament, I think, to allow the Judge to decide in the light of the evidence whether preference is necessary or should be granted.

                        <para>- The action of the honorable and learned senator is in the direction of creating a misapprehension. Surely if it is intended to test the question whether there should be a qualification of the preference or not, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has taken the proper course to attain that end? Surely the Attorney-General would not have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> take such action as would prevent any honorable senators from testing the question whether the onus of proof as to a majority should rest with unionists or non-unionists? </para>
