                    <para>- Last night the Attorney-General said he would give some information to-day with reference to the item of£550 for " Caretakers, charwomen, and miscellaneous expenditure," at Melbourne Government House. Apparently, more than one caretaker and one charwoman are employed. In this case only £550 is set down for at least four persons, while in other cases we have been voting large sums for individuals. I desire that those who occupy the lower positions in the Public Service should not be in any way sweated or reduced to a very small wage, on which perhaps they cannot live with any sort of decency or comfort. As honorable senators are so ready to vote very large sums to individuals for services which are very much more arduous, I desire that these persons in the lower positions should get a fair deal. </para>

                    <para>. - This item of £550 includes provision for an engineer mechanic and a doorkeeper, and for other persons who, I think, are only engaged occasionally. The building is not always in occupation, and when it is occupied by the Governor-General it is necessary to have some cleaning done. Last year £550 was voted for this purpose, but only £359 was expended. </para>

The amount comprises the following items: - Registration, £2,500; divisional returning officers, seventy-five, at £26 per annum, £1,950; Commonwealth electoral officers - New South Wales £250, Victoria £250, South Australia £100, Queensland £250 ; writing up registers, at1s. 6d. per 100 names, £1,000 ; books, printing, stationery, &amp;c, and ballot box equipment, £2,600; maps £500; office cleaning. £100 ; postage and telegrams, £600; police canvass for the various States, namely, New South Wales, £.900, Queensland £2,500, Tasmania £250, South Australia £800, Western Australia £2,000, Victoria £1,250; total, £7,700. It will be noticed that the amount is larger in the large States than in the smaller ones, because the expense there is greater. Clerical assistance costs £2,200. These items make up the total of £20,000. That, of course, is only a rough estimate. </para>

This messenger also, according to a foot-note, acts as caretaker. . So that he is practically at work day and night f°r £99 Per annum. I understood that there was a provision in the Public Service Act to the effect that there should be a minimum wage of £I] 0 per annum to all public officers who had reached a certain age, and had been a certain length of time in the service. Can the Vice-President of the Executive Council give us any information on the point? </para>

                    <para>- The salary does seem to be very small, but there has been an increase of £15 since last year. The salary is not up to the minimum, but I presume that this officer, for some reason, does not come under the minimum wage section of the Public Service Act. I am informed, however, by a note which has just been handed to me that the officer will get the minimum wage this year. A small sum is asked for increments and adjustments of salaries, and the officer will be paid the balance to complete the minimum wage from that fund. </para>

                        <para>- I also wish to draw the attention of the Committee te* what I consider to be the incompleteness of the Auditor-General's Report, and its general lack of information. When 1 compare it with the report of the Auditor-General for the State of Queensland, the small amount of information contained in this report becomes all the more apparent. I think the Auditor-General should go very much more into details. I do not wish to particularize as to where the omissions are, but I would suggest to the Government that the Auditor-General be invited to look at the Queensland report, and to see whether in future he cannot model his report upon that. If he did, it would be of much more use to Members of Parliament than it is now. </para>

                    (Queensland). - In division 27 there is the item - " Gratuities to officers engaged in excess of office hours, £500." I have no objection whatever to thos-3 officers being paid for overtime; but I have a decided objection to the payment being called a gratuity. A gratuity is something given to a person, which he has no legal right to claim. I would suggest that the words should be amended by substituting the word " payment."

                        <para>- This is really a matter of form rather than of substance. I am not quite sure whether the word "gratuities" is correct ; but this is not a payment in the sense of being a recompense that can be legally claimed. It is not entirely a payment for overtime. It is a payment made to some State officers who have to do Federal work. Federal work is being done in the Victorian Government Printing Office, where the Government Printer has a large staff of printers and other employes under his direction. The special work that has to be done comes in rushes. There is the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> work going on continuously throughout the parliamentary session, in addition to which there is the printing of evidence taken by Select Committees and the printing of papers laid upon the table of both Houses of Parliament, which honorable .'Senators wish to have at their disposal within the shortest possible time. It is, therefore, necessary to ask some officers to do work which is not in the nature of work foi which they can claim ordinary payment. We make them special recognition in the form of an honorarium. Perhaps "honorarium" would have been a better word than "gratuity." But I have an idea that we have used the word " gratuity " somewhere in the Post and Telegraph Act, with reference to payments occasionally made to captains of ships. </para>

                        <para>- That would probably be the case. The word " honorarium " would be as harmless as " gratuity " in that sense, but would have the same signification. I would ask my honorable friend not to press his motion to a division, because the House of Representatives would not think highly of us for making a request upon such a comparatively small matter. </para>

                    (Queensland).- We have* had a disquisition on the meaning of the words " gratuity " and " honorarium," and as to which would be more proper in this connexion. I take it that neither is proper. Either these officers are or are not entitled to payment for actual services rendered. If they are entitled, I have not the slightest objection to their being paid. It is our duty to pay for all services rendered. But we ought not to make such payments by using a term which leads it to be supposed that the money is given to them as an act of grace by this Parliament.

                        <para>- I do not think that can be so. These are matters of arrangement between the States and the Commonwealth Government. As a matter of fact. Commonwealth officers render various services for the States Governments, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> I regret to have noticed that there appears to be a disposition on the part of the Victorian Government .to " collar " the payments made by the Commonwealth to Victorian State servants for special services rendered. I think that is a very mean thing to do. I object to the officers who earn this money being insulted by the suggestion that they are given a gratuity, or an honorarium, as an act of grace. We have no right to spend the .taxpayers' money as an act of grace, whilst we have a perfect right to spend it in remunerating persons for adequate services rendered to the Commonwealth. I think we should not shelter ourselves behind the use of a word like this, and I shall take the sense of the Committee on the matter. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is under any impression that by calling these payments " gratuities " the officers for whom they are voted are not likely to receive them, or that the heads of Departments might insist upon the money being paid into the States Treasury, he is mistaken. The honorable senator's objection is one of form, and not of substance, and I trust he will not insist on his motion for a request to the House of Representatives. The term " gratuities " is used because the payments are such as could not be legally demanded for services rendered. There might not be so' much objection to the motion if the question had been previously raised, but it is rather hard that on the first occasion on which exception is taken to the use of the term, the honorable senator should proceed to the extreme length of dividing the Committee on the question. </para>

Fifty-five thousand pounds was asked for last year on this item, and £25,000 was expended. It is largely spent in connexion with the Customs Department, but to some extent also in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Department. The honorable senator will understand that when any money is received by the Government it is paid into the consolidated revenue, and it cannot afterwards be paid out except by a vote of Parliament. It sometimes happens that a payment is wrongly made to one of the Departments. It may happen, for instance, that money is paid into the Customs Department in mistake, and that money cannot be refunded without a vote of Parliament. department of trade and customs. </para>

                        <para>- I have said so before publicly, and I repeat it now. I quite agree that in very many respects he did the right thing. I desire to direct the attention of the Government to the method adopted by the Customs Department of referring trumpery grievances to be settled by the Minister instead of deputing authority to deal with such matters to local Collectors of Customs. In cases of misdescription of goods, and other slight offences, involving, perhaps, not more than a few shillings or a pound, it would be much more convenient if the decision were left to the local collector, instead of putting in operation the whole machinery of the Department. </para>

For the security of the revenue, and in order to see that no injustice, on the other hand, is done <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the importer, a report is sent to head-quarters.

                        <para>--I am sorry that the method inaugurated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> has not been adhered to. If any ordinary individual transgresses the law, and a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case is shown, he has to face a tribunal of his country in open Court. When, however, there is a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case against a merchant the method with all Customs administrators, excepting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> was to have the matter " fixed up" in the Collector's office, or in the Minister's back parlour over a glass of champagne. Was that sort of treatment meted out to lowly offenders? Was such a tender regard shown for their dignity or their feelings ? There ought not to be such distinctions between one class and another. </para>

But if it is discovered afterwards that a mistake has been made by the Department, it is only reasonably honest that those importers who have paid the duty under a misapprehension should get it refunded It was absolutely necessary for the importers to pay the duty in order to prevent their trade from drifting away from them.

                <para class="block">Surely there has been sufficient time to permit the law officers to discover whether it was legal to refund the money ? I have put the question on two or three occasions, but it seems to me that unless one is prepared to make himself a nuisance he can get very little information from the Government. It is Only fair that when reasonable notice is given to the officers any information desired should be forthcoming. I have always been accustomed in Queensland to be furnished as soon as possible with the information for which I have applied. This is a small matter, perhaps, from the point of view of the Department. Whey may say it is only a matter of £500 odd spread over forty-two persons. </para>

                        <para>- It may be a very small question as far as the Department is concerned, but it is a big question to those who paid the duty on the representations of the officials, and who now find that because it was not paid in terms of section 167 of the Act they have no right to get a refund. In this case those who endeavoured to comply with the law as it was represented to be by the officials, are the only persons who are going to suffer. After they had been wrongly collecting the duty for three years, the Department decided to refund the money to those who had complied with section 167 of the Act, but not to those who believed that the official interpretation of the law was wrong, but who, nevertheless, paid the duty under verbal protest, and who are able to get an admission to that effect from the officers concerned in its collection. Unless the money be refunded in their case too an advantage will be given to their trade competitors. If any one ought to receive consideration it is the man who is prepared to endeavour to &gt; abide by the interpretation of the law as declared by public officials. It has always seemed to me that the importers of China oil have a fair case against the officers of the Government. I may be told that it does not matter whether they, have or not ; that there are the law courts to which they can go to prosecute their claims against the Government. But I do not believe that many of these people are in a position to have recourse to the law courts. It is of no use to say that a. person can take advantage of the law when, in all probability, he has not a five-pound note in his pocket. It practically amounts to saying that he. cannot get justice unless he has a long purse, and is able to engage lawyers to fight the Crown, which fights them with public money, and can command the best talent. Probably, if a verdict was secured against the Crown in one of the lower courts, there would be an appeal involving a considerable amount of money. I desire to have information in connexion with this matter. It concerns not one, but a number of persons who have paid duty under representations made by the officials of the Government. If what is described is the law, I contend that the law is very hard upon people who are trying to be honest and to pay their way, especially as they are not in a position to know what the law is as clearly as do those who are administering the Department. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that the honorable senator should consider that he has reason to blame the Government for not having supplied him with information, But it seems to me that, so far as the facts are concerned, he has all the information he has asked for. What he asked, I understand, was what course the Government intend to take. He has already been told that the money will be refunded so far as it has been paid under section 167. If not paid under that section, no claim to a refund can be entertained. Getting away from the details of the case - which, as the honorable senator says, may be small in themselves - we come to a very big question upon which he desires the Government to express an opinion. That is whether, in cases where duty has been wrongly charged, and the Customs authorities afterwards come to the conclusion that the duty should be lower, all the persons who have paid the higher duty are entitled to a refund? The answer is that the Customs Act itself provides a certain course for importers to take under such circumstances. Section 167 provides - </para>

                        <para>- What the honorable senator is claiming is that where an error has . been made in deciding the proper duty to be paid on an article, whenever the Customs. authorities come to the conclusion that the duty paid was too high, the persons who have paid the higher duty should be entitled to a refund. That is certainly not equitable. China oil is used in the manufacture of soap. It goes into consumption in that way. To illustrate the principle, take the case of ordinary merchandise. Suppose drapery, or something of that kind has for three years been charged 20 per cent, instead of 10 per cent. That 20 per cent, has been added to the cost of the article, and the consumer has paid it. Would it be just if the Customs authorities' afterwards came to the conclusion that 10 per cent, instead of 20 per cent, ought to have been paid to refund the amount overpaid, when the importer had been collecting it from the consumer? I fail to see how the honorable senator can establish -his claim to a refund of the duty in this case. We must lay down a broad line for all such cases. The law cannot be applied capriciously, favouring importers in one instance, and not in another. We must have a. general principle, and apply it indiscriminately throughout the Commonwealth. It is hard that any man who has a case should be unable to afford to go to law, but still that remedy is always open, and the Customs authorities will always have to pay if judgment is given against them. But, unless the authority of the Court is obtained, the Customs authorities, as I understand, are not in a position to refund money which has not been paid under protest: </para>

                    <para>- My sympathies go in the direction of the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline> He draws attention to the fact that if a man in a large way of business, knowing all the details and all the points in connexion with importation, enters a written protest against the payment of duty, he is afterwards allowed a refund ; whereas a man in a smaller way of business, who intrusts implicitly to the directions and instructions of the Customs officers, and hands over the money without making any protest, is deprived of any right to a refund. The matter is involved in a good deal of difficulty, because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> points out, the importer might be enabled to get a refund of money when he had already charged it on to the consumer. In a case where China oil was concerned, the Government ordered the Customs Department to allow the oil to be admitted free when it was found that a man in a large way of business in Melbourne threatened an action against them. I consider that the Government should, not as a matter of law but of justice, consider every case on its merits, and if they find that an overcharge has been made, and has not been recovered by* the importer from the consumers, they should deal generously with it. </para>

                    (South Australia). One or two cases of this description have been brought under my notice. I have gone to the Customs Department, where I have found that the officers give all the assistance in their power, and the money paid under protest was refunded without going to law. I have in mind two instances where that was done. I think that either the merchants or the officials in Queensland are not going the right way to work, or the results would be different.

The explanation of the Vice-President of the Executive Council does not satisfy me, because it does not seem to bear upon the question. He points out that section 166 of the Customs Act provides that no person shall become entitled to any refund ; and I submit that no person is entitled under section 167 to any refund, even though he has made a deposit under the terms of the Act. The section clearly states that -

                <para class="block">I wish to know what truth there is in the statement that the Customs Department found it necessary to break the law in this matter only when they were the ate ned with an action by a large importer in Melbourne. It appears that they could readily flout the <inline font-style="italic">ma.r&gt;</inline> in a small way of business, but when they had to deal with a man who was prepared to take the question to Court they admitted that his contention was right. An order, is made by the Department for the refund of this duty collected over a period of about three years, and if the Government are right in issuing such an order they will be equally right in refunding the whole of the money collected in this way. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has referred me to section 167 of the Customs Act. I told the honorable and learned senator that, there is no authority under that section for the action taken by the Government, and I desired him to refer me to any section in the Act which gives the Government power to decide matters in the way i,i which this matter has been decided. I can get no information whatever from the honorable and learned senator, who has merely talked generalities. I wished to know whether the Government, under the Customs Act, have power to make these refunds, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has not touched that question at all. The honorable and learned senator has talked all round it, and has said that under sections 166 and 167 certain things take place, but I again submit that these sections do not touch the matter to which I have referred. I am not contending that these persons have a right under the law to claim a refund, but I ask whether there is anything in the Customs Act which expressly prohibits the Government from making these refunds ? I have searched the Act from end to end without finding any provision of the kind. It seems to me that it is a question purely of administration. If it can be pointed out to me that there is a single specific provision in the Act which says that the Government shall not have power to make refunds where the Department has made a mistake, I shall be satisfied. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has not attempted to do that, but has simply evaded the question. The officers of the Customs Department should know their own business, but apparently they do not, because, while it is distinctly stated in the Tariff Guide that oils of a certain sort and in certain quantities shall be admitted free of duty, they do not appear to have been aware of the fact. The average person taking up the Tariff Guide will see in a moment that it was the intention of the Legislature that these particular oils used for manufacturing purposes should bs admitted free, but the Customs Department have said in certain cases, " No matter what the law says, our interpretation of the law is that you must pay 6d. per gallon duty on this oil." This may be all right in the case of a man in. a large way of business, with a lawyer at his elbow to advise him in the circumstances to make his payment in certain terms, but no consideration is given to the man in a small way of business who has not the assistance of a legal adviser. </para>

                        <para>- I am asking the Government to tell me where, in the Customs Act, they are expressly prohibited from refunding money paid in this way. I can find nothing expressly laid down in the law to provide that the Government cannot act fairly by all the citizens of the Commonwealth. If I aim told that the law is such that under it the Government may act fairly by one, and unjustly by other citizens. I am sure that that is a law which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> will assist us to alter. The Department has admitted that they have made a mistake in this matter. Here is an article which Parliament, the authority above the Government, has declared shall be free of dutv. The Government officials in a certain place have contended that this is a dutiable' article, and those importing it must pav duty on it before they can get it. A man in a small way of business goes to the Customs Department, believing that he will get correct information. He wishes to pass entries for this oil, and the officials of the Department tell him that he is making a mistake in thinking that it is free of duty. They inform him that it is subject to duty at so much per gallon, and he must pay that duty before he can get it. He does not go to a lawyer to find out what is the best thing to- do in the circumstances, because to do so might cost him three times as much as he would have to pay to the Customs Department to secure possession of the oil which he has imported. He is disposed to take the word of the Customs officials. He does not presume that men employed by the Government are employed for the purpose of getting money out of him contrary to law. He pays the duty demanded by the Department, and later on he discovers that the officers of the Department have made a mistake, that they have wrongly interpreted (he law, and that the commodity which he has imported is free of duty. But he has no remedy. Another importer of the sarnie commodity acting under the advice of a solicitor deposits his money in the terms of section 167 of the Customs Act, which the first man knew nothing at all about. When the departmental blunder is discovered, an order is issued - contrary to the law, which says that the deposit shall be the cause of an action before it is paid back - by which the money is refunded to the big importer. To the man in a small way of business, the departmental officers say, " You have not established a claim - what right have you to a refund?" <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> I aim sure, will not consider that fair play. When the Government, exercising their powers of administration, go behind section 1.67 to refund money which has been paid under protest by a large importer, they should be prepared to exercise the same act of administration when dealing with men in a small way of business, who have paid duty wrongly charged, because they have trusted in the ability and integrity of the officials employed by the Government to administer the law. If there was any section expressly prohibiting the Government from making refunds there might be something said for the position taken up. I have been, endeavouring for over two months to obtain information, and' the present is the only opportunity I know of to accomplish my object, this year, at any rate. If it is purely an act of administration, so far as the big man is concerned - and according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> it is- only when the big man puts down his foot that the Government think it time to move - then it should be an act of administration in the case of the small man, who is apparently absolutely ignored, simply because he may not be acting under legal advice. The law does not provide that a man has a right to get his deposit back, but the section distinctly states that the deposit shall be deemed the proper duty unless an action be commenced within six months. 1 contend that none of the people involved have commenced action against the Collector. We have heard, indeed, of one man who threatened to commence an action - I do not know whether in that case more than six months had elapsed - but, at any rate, the Government immediately made the matter one of administration, and were prepared to make a refund. In other cases, however, no satisfaction could be got, and the Government endeavour to shield themselves behind generalities. I desire to know whether members of the Senate are prepared to say that justice shall be meted out to the big man and refused to the small man, and, therefore, I move - </para>

                        <para>- If there were a resolution of both Chambers, overriding what we think to be the law, and declaring that a refund shall be made out of the revenue, the refund would have to be voted in the ordinary way. This money has, of course, gone into revenue, and there is only one constitutional way of taking it out, subject to a statutory provision to which I shall presently refer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> I think, will see that to reduce, this particular division by a sum of £1 is not the way to assert that there shall be refunded any particular money paid into Customs revenue. The honorable senator's speech was a very powerful and vigorous statement of the position from his point of view, and I may say that that statement gladdened my heart as a free-trader. In all such matters, I take a very liberal view, and, when commodities are declared to be admitted free, I like them to be free. I feel always a very strong inclination , to adopt any course which will secure to the importer the admission of goods free, and, if not free, at the lowest possible duty. </para>

                        <para>- My friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> is possessed of such, I shall not say, an impatient, but a galloping intellect, that he gets a long way ahead of the stage we have reached, while I can only approach it by slow and plodding steps. The question is very simple indeed. It is not a question of administration, but one of strict law laid' down for the protection of the revenue, and the control of a Department which is exceedingly difficult to administer. If any looseness takes place in regard to the refunding of money paid into the revenue by way of duty on particular commodities, it will open the door to endless claims of the same character, and cause not merely a great deal of difficulty, but, possibly, a great deal of abuse. The schedule of the Tariff declares amongst other exemptions that of what is described as China oil. When the Tariff was passed, the Customs authorities had at their head a man who devoted his very life and energy to bringing it into effective operation. That gentleman, in conjunction with his officers, and, of course, under the advice of experts made classifications of the articles to be subject to duty. For any one to suppose that those classifications could be perfectly free from error, or from the necessity of change upon further information, would be to suppose an impossibility ; and of course that position is contemplated by the law. When we passed the Customs Act we provided for all such contingencies. We provided, as was necessary, that no man should be entitled to a refund of duty he had paid under a classification which, when originally made, was believed to be correct, and to cover justly, the articles referred to, simply because, on further information, the classification was subsequently altered, with the result that a lower rate of duty, or no duty, was charged. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to first deal with the facts and the position. Matters are always in a state of flux in regard to Customs duties. Definitions change from day to day, some commodities being .excluded at one time and included at another ; and all depends on fresh information and so forth. After the coming into operation of a Tariff such as this, it would be impossible to have, as a matter of course, refunds of duty paid under such circumstances as I have indicated. Such contingencies were contemplated when the Act was framed, and provision was made to meet them in three sections. The first of those 'sections is 166, as follows </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </interjection>
                <para>If any practice of the Customs relating to classifying or enumerating any article for duty shall be altered so that less duty - which, of course, includes free; a duty may be so much less that it is free - is charged upon such article, no person shall thereby - that is, shall by virtue of the simple fact that he has paid duty on articles which are now declared to be free, but which were previously presumed to be dutiable - become entitled to any refund on account of any duty paid before such alteration. </para>
                <para class="block">This is the general enactment' to guard against endless claims, and against a total disarrangement of the Customs - against opening the door to all kinds of abuses and difficulties. The Act could not be administered in the . face of endless claims of the kind. The section I have read, if taken as absolutely rigid, might seem to be hard ; and opportunity ought to be. and is, afforded to deal with the class of cases contemplated. An importer, to take the case cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> relies on the following definition of China oil : - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>This term covers the crude liquid oils of Stellinga and Araghis, either singly or in admixture, and suitable only for blending and soap making. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">He goes down to the Customs House, and the authorities say, " The article does not come within that definition ; it is dutiable." Then the importer may do one of two things. He may say, " This is China oil, and it is free." In that case he ought to have the opportunity of paying the duty under protest, or making a deposit, and then testing the question, and it is given to him by the Act. On the other hand, he may say to the Customs officers, " You say that this oil comes within that classification. I yield to that interpretation. I pay the duty without deposit or without protest." The persons to whom my honorable friend wishes the duty to be refunded adopted the latter course. </para>

If it described the state of things, however, it would be an allegation practically of corruption.

But under section 163 claims for refunds, rebates, or remissions of duty must be made according to form 42. 126. Such claims shall be made not later than three days after the goods have passed from the control of the Customs or the duty has been paid., or such further time, not later than one week from such passing or payment, as the comptroller, in writing, allows. But unless made as aforesaid no such claim shall be received or allowed. </para>
                <para class="block">All these regulations deal with the remission or refund of duty paid under certain conditions, as provided by section 163 of the Act, and under section 167, if the Customs authorities continue to dispute the point, there is only one alternative, and that is an appeal to a Court. But if they do admit the right to a rebate or a refund there is no litigation, in accordance with the decisions of previous Attorneys-General. It is the only interpretation under which the proper management of the Department can proceed and the law be carried into effect. Even where there is an absolute disagreement, and it can only be settled at law, it must be commenced by the owner against the Collector within six months after making the deposit. I do not overlook what my honorable friend has said as to an oral protest, which the law does not provide for in any way, and the payment of the duty under conditions which entitles the importer either to a refund, if the Customs authorities give way, or to an action at law if the dispute is maintained. Hard cases, it has often been said, make bad law, and they certainly make bad administration. The smallness of the amount involved in this case does not affect the principle of the thing. But those who made the deposit in the terms of the law, and made their claims under the circumstances referred to, occupy a different position, because, about a year ago, the Customs authorities framed the following new classification: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The term " China oil " is applicable only to the liquid oils of Stellinga and Araghis either singly or in combination with each other, or with the addition of a proportion of crude sesame oil. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Having made that new definition, they had to deal with those who had paid the deposit, and taken the steps which entitled them to claim a refunds Admitting that the old classification was made under an error of fact, or a misconception of the law, their duty was clear, under the authority of previous decisions of the law officers, and that was to make a refund. But in the case of those importers who had not made the deposit, and who, under what my honorable friend says was an oral protest, paid the money and assented to the liability - it may be because the amount was small, as he suggests, or it may be because they &lt; did not know the difference - there is no legal authority to refund the money. It seems to me that if the Customs Department were to take it upon themselves to refund duties paid under such circumstances as these, and without compliance with the law-, they would be liable to be visited with the severest possible displeasure of Parliament ; in fact, it would be almost impossible that they could be allowed to retain their offices. It would be a most dangerous thing to allow that to be done. We might have swarms of applications coming before the Department, in which the officials would be required not to interpret and enforce the law as clearly laid down in the Act and regulations, but to give rein to their sympathy and good feeling, with the possibilities of obvious abuses creeping in. I can assure my 'honorable friend that the Customs Department have every desire to act upon the principle of doing justice to everybody alike ; and if the same conditions prevail, the large importer who pays duty without a protest is no more entitled to receive a refund than is the small man who pays under similar circumstances. Therefore I am sorry that it is impossible for the Customs authorities, doing their dutv under the law which they are sworn to administer, to act otherwise than they have done. I have investigated the matter with great care. By the courteous consideration of my honorable friend. I have had a full opportunity to go into the matter thoroughly ; and I say again that it is with regret that we find that it was impossible for the Department to act otherwise. Even if it were possible for the Department to make a refund in accordance with a resolution of the Senate, it could not be done under an amendment such as this. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator TURLEY</inline>
                    (Queensland). - The Attorney-General started by pointing out that some other method should be adopted to elicit an expression of opinion with regard to this subject. I have always understood that the best method of obtaining an expression of opinion with regard to matters of administration was t6 move for the nominal reduction of a vote. That is the course which I have taken. The Attorney-General appeals to the sympathy of honorable senators, and says that, however strongly they mav feel, they should not express an opinion regarding the method of administration. It is not a question of sympathy, but of fair dealing. The matter of collecting duties on China oil was under the consideration of the Customs Department of the States years ago. It was not until a large merchant in the city of Melbourne was ready to bring an action against the Government that they considered it; and then, whatever the Attorney-General may say. to the contrary, they gave a preference to the big man over the small man, whatever their intentions may have been. I have stated the facts pretty clearly so far as concerns the case represented to me by one of my constituents, who informs me that there are other cases in the same position. I have moved this request, because I want to know whether' honorable senators are prepared to back up the administration, or whether they think that the Department ought to give satisfaction from the point of view of equity to all classes of the community. The Attorney-General stated that when
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline>
                    was at the head of the Customs Department, he, in consultation with his officers, decided to adopt a certain classification of goods. No one complains of that. But I venture to say that if
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline>
                    were at the head of the Department now, and knew of an obvious mistake, he would insist that everybody who had paid under a misapprehension should get his money back.

                        <para>- Allusion has been made to section 166. That section simply states that no person shall become entitled to a refund on account of any duty paid before an alteration in classification. That covers the whole thing. No distinction is made in favour of those who paid under protest. The section says that no persons shall be entitled. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> also read a number of regulations, but they did not bear upon the question; and when he discovered that there were no regulations that did bear upon it, he quietly dropped the book. He reminded me of the action of a peculiar fish, which, when it wishes to hide itself, emits a quantity of liquid which discolours the water, and enables it to escape under the cover of darkness. </para>

It would be very strained administration if a person bringing goods into the country asked for information from the Department, and if duties were charged on articles which the Department itself admitted ought to be free. I have pointed out that the Attorney-General has completely clouded' the issue by reading a number of regulations which he says have the force of law, but which have no more bearing on this question than .they have on the rising of the moon. I have dealt with sub-section 2, of section 163 of the Act, which provides that a refund or remission of duty collected in manifest error shall be made "in the manner prescribed." That is definite, but we have then to discover what is " the manner prescribed." The Attorney-General informs the Committee that that is laid down in section 167. I point out that the interpretation which the Attorney-General has put on section 167 in connecting it with section 163 15 altogether beside the mark. The honor able and learned' senator has read something into the section which - it does not contain, whilst the words of the section cannot bear the construction which has been put on them. A dispute in this case commences when an importer objects to the interpretation of the law by the Customs officials. As the Attorney-General has said, there are two courses open to him. He can put down a deposit, and section 167 deals only with the case of a man who does put down a deposit when a dispute arises. The section provides - </para>

The Attorney-General took these words, " the contrary shall be determined," out of section 167, and connected them with section 1 63, which provides ' that a rebate or remission of duty, as the case may require, shall be made in the manner prescribed. I contend that the prescription is clearly laid down in the section to which I have referred. </para>

                        <para>- It is true that the classification has been altered, but the duty has been collected on this oil since the alteration of the classification, although it is perfectly clear from it that this commodity is free of duty. The words which the Attorney-General separated from their context in section 167 are rightly used in that section, and are governed by the preceding words of the same section. The Government realized that the departmental administration had been wrong, and that money had been collected from the public which the Department was not entitled to collect. The classification is altered, and a certain commodity is made free of duty ; in spite of the alteration of the classification, the officers of the Department continue to. collect duty on this article. In some instances the duty is paid under protest as a deposit, and under section 167 I contend that that deposit must be deemed to be the proper duty, unless, by action commenced by the owner against the Collector within six months after the deposit was made, the contrary shall be determined. That is the whole matter. The Attorney-General has attempted to connect the words "the contrary shall be determined" with the words of section 163. I submit that the law cannot bear the honorable and learned senator's interpretation. Where duty is paid under a protest in the form of a deposit the deposit under the law is deemed to be the proper duty, unless, as the result of an action commenced against the Government by the person concerned, the contrary is determined. It is nonsense to suggest that the contrary -is determined if merely notice of such an action is given. That would be futile, and no one could hold that it would be in the interests of the Department, the revenue, or the public doing business with the Department. I contend that the administrative action taken by the Government in the issue of order No. 480, deciding that all money paid in the form of a deposit in connexion with this commodity should be refunded, was outside the direction of the law. The Government took the responsibility of that administrative action. There is nothing in the Act to prohibit them, but if they are entitled to take such action in the interests of certain persons who have made a deposit, they are equally entitled to take similar administrative action in the interests of persons who have paid duty which should not have been collected without protest, and paid it in good faith, believing that the law was being rightly administered by the officers of the Department. I have so far received no reply to that contention. I wish to get at the bottom of the matter, in order to discover how it is that the Government can deal in one way with one section of the community, and in a different way with another. The Attorney-General has said that he is sorry that statements of that kind should be made, because they amount to a charge of corruption. I 80 not believe they do. I merely make the statement that the Government have apparently felt themselves entitled to deal in a certain way by an administrative act with persons who understand the law. It appears that where people have been governed in their relations with the Department by an intention to do what they be- 'lieve to be right, putting full confidence in the ability and integrity of the officers of the Department, the Government will not exercise the same powers of administration that they do in regard to other sections of the people. The reply which I have now succeeded in obtaining from the Government is not very definite. The Attorney-General said that the law prohibits any refund, but I contend that the law does nothing of the sort. I can only by inference conclude that the Government do not intend to -refund this money, and that that determination has been come to simply because those people did not make a deposit. Is that the answer of the Government? </para>

                        <para>- I am contending, that the merchant who works with a lawyer at his elbow may be enabled to ruin his competitors, owing to the fact that he receives special and preferential treatment from the Department. When I asked the Attorney-General to cite any authority which prohibited the Government from dealing with this matter as one of administration, he replied, " Oh, no, it is not our place; the onus of proof is thrown on the man who has had money taken from him, and did not put in a protest - he must prove that the Government have power to pay him back." To take shelter behind such a technicality is absolutely unworthy of a gentleman of the reputation and ability of the Attorney-General. The honorable and learned senator said that the Department was at that time' in a state of flux. It must be remembered, however, that there are always alterations being made in the Customs duties. But when an obvious and admitted mistake has been made, and there is no law or regulation prohibiting the matter being, dealt with as a matter df administration, the proper course is for the Government to act fairly and justly between all classes. I take the answer of the Government to be that they do not intend to interfere with the present arrangement. I have been a long time getting that answer ; and if I had had it before, it might have saved considerable time this morning. The fact is, the Government were, simply a bit scared when they found that some one of importance was prepared to issue a writ. They thought it was better to come to a settlement than to fight out the question. An order was then issued which authorized a refund to be made not only to the person who had issued the writ, but to all persons who had paid the duty under protest in a similar manner. The reply is that the Government do not intend to refund the duty to those persons who, acting in all good faith, paid the money without a protest, under the interpretation and advice of the Customs officials. The only remedy which is now left to these persons is to issue a writ. ' </para>

I notice that subsequent speakers have inferred from his remarks that this is a case as between a big man and a small man. I do not know how much is involved in the case brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline> A writ for the recovery of ^5 was issued by a person named Way Sing against the Collector of Customs, and it was served on the Department on the 12th March, .1904.

                <para class="block">In consequence of that minute, which is dated the 7th May, 1904, there was a reclassification order, and China oil was classified as free, and from that time I presume that no duty has been collected. The Government then issued an order that in all cases in which the duty was paid, under protest, or under section 167 of the Act, a refund should be made. The Department contend that there is power in sections 163 and 167 of the Act to make the refunds under those circumstances ; but in only one case has a claim been made for a refund under those conditions. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> is really contending for is that because the Government refunded the duty in one case, everybody who for the last three years paid any duty on China oil, or on any article which was imported as China oil, is entitled to demand a refund. There is no provision in the Act to warrant a refund under those circumstances, and it would be exceedingly dangerous if there were; because it would mean that whenever an alteration was made in the classification of an article, reducing the rate of duty, every importer from the most remote time who had paid a higher rate would be entitled to a refund. It would make the Department very chary indeed about making any alteration, unless they, were positively compelled to do so. The action of the Department is, I think, perfectly clear and reasonable. I do not see how any more could be done. </para>

                    <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has laid enormous stress on his opinion that the Department treats persons who are in a strong position differently from those who are in a weak position. Apparently all through this case the Department has been confined entirely in its action by the law, as it should be. The Customs officers should have no discretion; Duties should be collected, and, when necessary, refunded under the conditions prescribed by law, else the greatest favoritism and jobbery would certainly creep in. The honorable senator says there is no provision in the law. to prevent the Government from refunding this money as an administrative act. Clearly the law says that, in the event of money being collected under an impression which was subsequently departed from, and being paid without protest, the mere fact of payment does not entitle the importer to a refund. Clearly the officers of the Department cannot pay to other persons any money, which they may choose to claim. </para>

                        <para>- No; the law goes on to place those persons who made a protest in the prescribed form in a position, under certain circumstances, to have the money legally refunded to them. In the event of an importer making a protest, and, if need be, commencing an action within six months of the time of protest, and the decision being in his favour either in a court of law or by default of the Department, the latter must refund the money which was deposited. Both processes are fixed by law, and it is not a question of whether the claimant is big or little, or whether the sum is large or small. It is possible to conceive of a very wealthy trader carrying an an extensive trade, paying without protest very large sums. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that it is not. There is no question of degree in this act of administration. It is merely a question of compliance or noncompliance with clearly defined law. The Customs Tariff embraces an enormous number of items, and when articles of commerce so nearly approximating each other appear under very different classifications, there must necessarily arise from time to time errors of judgment. If it were to, be laid down as a principle that wherever there was a doubt, the importer should have the benefit of it, the revenue would suffer enormously. Therefore it is properly laid down as a principle that the duty of a tax collector is at all times to safeguard the revenue. It is an axiom that it is the duty of a citizen to know the law. It is a misfortune that the poor citizen is more frequently ignorant of the law than is the wealthy one. </para>

                        <para>- That is a misfortune we cannot get over. The duty of the Customs Department is not to discriminate, but simply to administer the law as. they know it. The man who gets a refund gets it in accordance with the law. The man who fails to get a refund fails in accordance with the law. If there is anything wrong in the administration of the Customs Department, it is not the present Government, or the Government which originally gave the decision in reference to this matter, but it is the Customs Act that is at fault. What I urge upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> is that, supposing his contention were given effect to, justice would not be done, but very gross injustice, because the persons who have paid these duties which are now admitted to have been collected in error, have shifted the burden on to their customers. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot conceive of a case where it is impossible for the importer to charge the duties on to his customers, if he is engaged in manufacturing. China oil is a raw material of manufacture. It is a material that cannot be produced in the Commonwealth, and must be imported. It is obvious that the duties must be added to the cost of production of the manufactured articles. The persons who have paid the duty are really the persons who have consumed the manufactured product. Therefore, the duty can be and is handed on to the consumer. But the persons who paid the duty to the Government are the only persons to whom a refund could be made, supposing there was a refund. The persons who have really borne the burden of the duty would, if there was a refund, have in addition to contribute their share to the refund. So long as there is a Tariff at all, whether it be a protectionist or a revenue Tariff, there must be mistakes. They will be disco\,erd as soon as possible, and when discovered the evil will not be continued. But it is impossible to remedy the evil that has occurred, because it is impossible to reach the persons who have really paid the duty. It may be in some instances that the exporter has paid the duty out of his profits, in order to get his goods into the country. It may be that the consumer who uses the manufactured article has paid the duty. But very rarely indeed is it the merchant who actually pays the duty in the ultimate. Therefore, it is impossible to pay the duty back to the persons who have really borne the burden. I urge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> not to press his request. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend reminds me of a barrister in Court who, when an argument of a most potent character was being urged against his case, said, " It is of no use for my learned friend to use arguments of that sort, because I am determined1 not to be convinced by any argument." That is not a reasonable position. My honorable friend has argued for several hours, and seemed to hope that his several speeches would have an effect upon the opinions of honorable senators. He does not adopt a fair attitude if he says that under no circumstances will he change his opinion, although he has been endeavouring to change the opinions of others. Seeing the futility of the motion, I hope that he will not press it. We have had quite a number of extremely ridiculous divisions in this Chamber yesterday and to-day. </para>

But a division may be forced upon the Committee, not by the whole body of honorable senators, but by a section. What I wished to say was that these divisions were futile, and therefore ridiculous. I would not speak of the action of honorable senators as a whole as ridiculous. I do not believe that the decisions of the Committee, in reference to the divisions to which I referred, were ridiculous. I think they were extremely wise. But it was the minority to which I referred. </para>

                        <para>- No, except as an argument why this amendment should not be proceeded with because no result can come of it. This subject has occupied nearly the whole of to-day. It has been threshed out from, every possible point of view. It is obvious that there is a majority against the view which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator [Turley</inline> holds. Therefore I took the liberty to urge him not to press his motion to a division. But he says that he is not one who moves motions with the intention of withdrawing them afterwards. I venture to say that that is not a proper attitude to take up with reference to honorable senators. It is not proper for an honorable senator to induce us to discuss questions at length, and then to say that no amount of argument, no production of facts, and no evidence against the opinion which he holds will change his view, and that he will stick to it however impracticable and however stupid it may be. </para>

                    (Queensland). - I had intended to take a division at once. My object was to obtain a distinct expression of opinion from the Government. I have obtained that opinion. They state that they do not intend to do anything in this matter. But I was asked to withdraw my motion, and have been told that I am not at all complimentary to honorable' senators in pressing the matter to a division. Although I believe that I am right, and have no reason to believe that there is a majority of honorable senators against me, I am told that I am acting in a stupid manner, because I do not withdraw. I do not usually act so stupidly as that.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline>
                    may consider that any honorable senator, who thinks he has a good case, and wishes to test the feeling of the Committee, is wrong because he does not choose to withdraw when he is requested to do so. If his opinion is that my action on this occasion is simply an exhibition of stupidity, he is quite welcome to it. I have had no evidence that a majority of the members of the Committee are prepared to vote against my motion. So far only the Attorney-General, the Vice-President of the Executive Council,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline>
                    and
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline>
                    have expressed any opinion adverse to it.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline>
                    did not go into the matter, and I am therefore asked to recognise that two official members of the Senate, with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline>
                    possess the whole of the brains and intelligence of the Committee, and that other honorable senators should not be allowed to express an opinion on this question by a vote. I decline to accept any such suggestion. If Senators Stewart, Givens, and I arrogated to ourselves such a position as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline>
                    claims for himself and his friends, I should like to know what would be said by honorable senators opposite. I have submitted a case to the Committee, which, in my opinion, deserves reasonable consideration. It is not my practice to speak merely for the purpose of wasting time. If a majority of the members of the Committee inform me that they are opposed to me in this matter, I might feel justified in withdrawing my motion, but I shall not do so because, in the opinion of one or two. I have not submitted a reasonable case for consideration.

                (Queensland). - On the second reading of the Bill, I directed the attention of the Government to certain appointments which have been made in Queensland of officials intrusted with the administration of Commonwealth legislation, governing the employment of white and coloured labour on the sugar plantations. I have contended that it is quite unreasonable to expect faithful administration of the Sugar Bounties Act if it is placed in the hands of actual enemies of the White Australia policy. I do not propose to move any request for a reduction in the vote, nor do I propose to discuss the question at length. I do not blame the present, any more than previous Governments, for the appointments to which I refer. My complaint is that the officer at the head of the Customs Department in Queensland is allowed to make these appointments at his own sweet will, and without Ministerial supervision. In my opinion, it is the duty of Ministers to see that their subordinate officers in the various States carry out the spirit and intention of the law. The spirit and intention of the Sugar Bounties Act is to encourage the growth of sugar by white labour by every possible means, and yet the head of the Customs Department in Queensland, instead of appointing officers in sympathy with the Commonwealth legislation on this subject to administer the law, has appointed men who are totally opposed to the spirit of our legislation, and actual enemies of the ideals which form the basis of that legislation. If a squatter, owning a station, arrives at the conclusion that it will pay him better to use it as a sheep station rather than as a cattle station, do honorable senators believe that he would intrust its management to a man who was totally opposed to that idea, and determined to prove it a failure? They know that he would not do anything of the kind, and if that principle is good as applied to private business it should be equally good as applied to public business,. I wish now merely to direct the attention of the Government to this matter, with a view to induce them to see whether some more satisfactory method cannot be devised for making these appointments.

                    <para>- The time has now arrived when honorable senators who care to do so can criticize the policy of Ministers, and their administration' in regard to defence matters. In accordance' with the notification which I gave a week since, I wish to say a word on the subject of the compulsory military training of youths. I should like to explain why I have not spoken on the subject before. Some months ago I gave notice of an abstract motion advocating the principle of the compulsory military training of youths. That was when the Senate met on the Wednesday in each week, and adjourned for a week at a time, and there was never more than one-half the members of the Senate present. I did not therefore care to go on with the matter. It then struck me that the submission of an abstract motion was not a practical way in which to deal with so important a question. I therefore formulated the idea of changing the .motion into one for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the subject. I then saw my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson,</inline> who was Minister of Defence in the Watson Administration, and I had to wait a few weeks to learn from him whether the Government of which he was a member would support the appointment of such a Select Committee. We all remember the exciting time which the Watson Administration had in connexion with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and the events that ultimately led to their retirement from office. I had then to wait for a week or two until Lt. -Col. McCay got fairly into the saddle. I waited upon that honorable and learned gentleman to ask him whether the Reid-McLean Administration would support my motion for the appointment of a Select Committee to consider this question. I called three times on the Minister of Defence, but, after waiting some five or six weeks, I received no answer. The Minister's scheme was then submitted to Parliament, but I find in it no allusion to compulsory drill. I found afterwards that the Minister had not read my papers, nor had he mentioned the matter to the Cabinet ; and I must confess that I was disappointed, though, at the same time, I know the enormous amount of work the Minister has to do, and, therefore, I do not complain - I merely express my disappointment. I then saw the Prime Minister, and' asked him if he would undertake to bring this important matter before the Premiers' Conference, shortly to be held at Hobart. The right honorable gentleman made one or two very excellent suggestions, but said he could not give me any definite promise that the matter would "be brought before that Conference. Those facts explain 'the cause of my delay, and, under the circumstances, it appears to me that no Minister of Defence, and no set of Ministers, regard this matter as so important as I do, or as important, I may say, as do most of the leading military men in the world. I therefore make no excuse for saying a few words this afternoon, in trying, if I can, to induce Ministers, and honorable senators on all sides of the Chamber, to regard this matter of the compulsory training of our youth as lying at the very foundation of any scheme worth talking about for the defence of the Commonwealth. I submit, with all deference, that the present scheme of defence has no foundation on which Ave can ever build up a force which will be a credit to the Commonwealth. I am inclined to compare the scheme to a bucket without a bottom, for that is certainly what it will be found to be in days to come, unless some system of compulsory military service or training is adopted. Shortly after I commenced to take an active interest in this question, I received a communication from the secretary of the National Service League of Great, Britain, expressing his pleasure that it had been brought under the notice of this Senate, and his hope that the movement which had been initiated would be kept alive. I replied to that letter, telling the secretary that, so far as I was concerned, t'he interest taken in the Question would not be allowed to flag, and asking him to send me copies of the magazines, the enormous number of leaflets, and other literature, issued by the League. I have been furnished with some very useful documents, and the few quotations I propose to make will show the vast importance of the subject. T'he principle advocated by the National Service League is that of universal military training, and the objects aimed at by such training are: - </para>

                <para class="block">There is then pointed out the training that should be imposed on the youths. There are many ways of commencing, and carrying out a scheme of the sort proposed. One is to commence, as I propose, with youths ranging from 12 or 14 up to 18 or 19 years of age. I hope that honorable senators will not confuse the compulsory training of our youths with what is called compulsory service or conscription. What I propose is that we should take in hand the youths who are being educated in other ways and get hold of them before they arrive at manhood, and are involved in commercial or professional duties. The compulsory military training of such youths would not involve very much interference with their ordinary educational course. One of the </para>

If I had my way, I certainly should impose compulsory service on this Commonwealth, and I should do so without t'he slightest hesitation. But if we cannot impose compulsory training on men between the ages of 18, and 22 or 23 years of age, </para>
                <para>Ave must fall back on the compulsory training of our youths, if we desire to have what we call a citizen army in time to come. We have in the Commonwealth, cadet corps, and the Minister of Defence, in his scheme, proposes to bring the question of their organization before the Conference of Premiers in February. I contend, however, that cadet corps are simply a means of playing with a very important subject. In the very useful report, so far as it goes, of the Commission which was appointed to inquire into the question of making the cadet corps more useful, I find the following: </para>
                <para>Estimate for cadets when developed. - Number of cadets 22,556, costing £13,606 for allowances, other expenses and officers, bringing up the amount to £30,700. Of this, £20,000 is required for the year 1904-5 ; to this must be added : - Arms, £21,000; equipment, ,£3,000 - total ,£24,000, or £8,000 per annum, spread over three years, so that £28,000 is required for the first year. </para>
                <para class="block">At the present time there are 8,661 junior cadets, and 561 senior cadets in. all the States of the Commonwealth, including those under the military system, and those attached to our State schools. If we turn to the statistics of our population, we find that, when the last census was taken on the 31st March, 1901, the youths between 15 and 20 years of age numbered as follows in the various States : - New South Wales, 70,423 ; Victoria, 58,882 ; Queensland, 23,684; South Australia. 20,007 <inline font-style="italic">j</inline> Western Australia," 7,088 ; and Tasmania, 9,388; or a total, of 189,472. But, on looking further at the census figures, I find that the youths between jo and 15 years of age numbered 218,308; of youths between 12 years of age and 18 and 19 years of age, we have about 200,000; and if we eliminate 50,000 for boys who are ill, unfit, who are away, or who cannot be reached, it is fair to ' assume that there are about 1.50,000, every one of whom ought to receive both military and physical drill, and certainly ought to be taught the art of shooting. To take a practical view of the question, let us come to the matter of cost. Arms have to be obtained, and a system has to be started. But, as pointed out by the Commission on the cadet system, there is no occasion to incur the total expense in the first, or the second, or even in the third year. I take it that, to carry on the compulsory training of youths would, when the system was in full force, require an expenditure of from £1 00,000 to £150,000 per annum. There is no reason, however, why we should not commence next year with an expenditure of £30,000 or £40.000, which could be increased in the following year by another £20,000. The cost would depend on the number of arms, and, almost entirely, on the system inaugurated. I am told that the system reported on by the Royal Commission is rather extravagant. According to that report, each junior is to get an allowance of 10s. per year, and each senior an allowance of £1 per year, as uniform and orderly-room expenses, while an officer commanding is to receive £20 ; 'a battalion commander, £10 ; and adjutants, captains, and lieutenants, ^£7 10s., £5, and £$ respectively. I am informed lb v a military man that, although those expenses may seem very moderate, they are rather extravagant. The principle underlying the system which I advocate is that we have a right to call on the youths of the Commonwealth to train themselves in the art of defence just as we have the right to compel them to go to school and learn to read and write. I also think that in return for all the services which the State renders to the parents of the youths, as well as to the youths themselves, we might in many cases prescribe that the parents shall provide the uniforms which may be necessary. I desire the Defence Force of the Commonwealth to be in all senses of the word a citizen force- that every soldier shall be a citizen, and every citizen a soldier. If we enter on the work of organization in an economical way, and have regard to the duty which alT men owe to the State, we can carry out such a scheme practically, economically, and efficiently. I undertake to say that any Committee which may be appointed to inquire into the matter will find that what I have outlined can be accomplished, and they will also find that it is the almost unanimous opinion of thoughtful military men in the United Kingdom, that it is the only system that can. with due regard to the adequacy and efficiency <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> the military defences, be adopted. </para>

Considering that we are not contributing our proper share to the naval defence of the Empire, and seeing that what we ought to do is to take care that our land forces are in perfect order, and that we drill and make use of the raw material we have, it seems to me that a system of compulsory training is most admirably suited for the Commonwealth.

                <para class="block">One objection to anything of that kind is that the freedom of the Anglo-Saxon race would not stand it, because it is contrary to the genius of the English-speaking people. But every writer- -and I could produce scores of quotations - will tell us in a sentence that that is all bunkum, that it is absolutely opposed to the history of our nation. Article after article points out how England has attained its present position by compulsory service, and by that only. It has been done by the press-gang, as well as " by guns and bayonets. In the time of King Alfred it was necessary for everybody to take part in the defence. of the country. After the Restoration the law was that if a man had £6,000 in property, or an income of £500 a year, he had to provide a horseman properly equipped1; but, that if a man had an' income of only £50 a year, or only £500 worth of property, he had to provide a pikeman. As some of the military men point out, under the ballot system in the militia force, the compulsory principle is in force in England. When they speak about enforcing the ballot system, that is to some extent compulsion on those' who draw the lot, and are liable for service. It is perfectly certain that this scheme can only be properly and efficiently launched in harmony with the States. I can quite understand my honorable friend, Lt. -Col. McCay, desiring .to bring before the Premiers how his cadet system is to be carried- out. But I implore him to 'drop a cadet system which is purely voluntary, and to discuss with the Premiers whether we cannot start on a larger scale some system for the compulsory training of our youth. It could be done in all large towns without the slightest trouble. In outlying districts there might be a little trouble. ' But the trouble in teaching the lads their drill would be compensated for by the freer use which they could make of their rifles. They would have a better physique. They would make some of the most splendid mounted troops in the world. I am under the impression that it is the duty of the Commonwealth to have for service abroad at least 25,000 men efficiently trained, and fit to go into the field. A time "will come when that necessity will be acknowledged. A time will come when we shall be engaged in a much greater war than the Boer war, and we may have to do five times as much as we then did, if ever England is engaged in a large European war, and has to fight for her very existence. To have 150,000 youths, physically capable, who are not compelled to undergo the training necessary to fit them to defend their country, and to be content with 8,000 cadets, seems to me to be a very foolish way of inaugurating a defence system for this great Commonwealth. Many boys take to the cadet system merely because they like to wear the uniform and to march through the streets to the music of the fife and drum band. But we do not get hold of the boys we want to train. They are not the State school boys, but the boys who play about night after night in the streets of our large cities, and who would make the most useful soldiers. So long as we confine our compulsory training to the cadet movement we shall get only the better class boys, who can afford to buy their uniforms and rifles, and like to play at soldiers. I wish to get hold of every healthy boy, whether he be a street boy or a college boy. I wish, the Senate to acknowledge that, just as the State teaches and compels boys to learn how to read and write, lest their ignorance should be a danger to the community, so it ought above all things to teach them the art of self-defence, lest their ignorance should become a danger to the community. We have only to take a glance at the report of the Commission which was appointed to inquire into the results and the defects of our military organization during the Boer war, to learn how necessary that training is. Out of the many of the drafts of militia, yeomen, and volunteers which were sent from London, a great number had to be drilled for four or five weeks, day and night. Some men had to be put on the horse, and almost taught how to saddle it, before they were fit to go into the field. Is that creditable to our nation? Is it not just like old England, trusting to her .grit, energy, and pluck to muddle through ? I believe that the nation which most efficiently organizes in arms or industry or politics will come out on top. Are we going to neglect organization for the youth of the Commonwealth, and yet think that we have a perfect system of defence? I hope that the Prime Minister and the Premiers will not be prevented taking action by the consideration of expense. I believe that there is not enough money voted for the equipment of our military forces either in arms or in accoutrements. I understand that some officers make out their estimates according to their knowledge of politics. If they want £600,000, they ask for £900,000, and probably, when the Minister and the Secretary have cut down the estimates, and the Treasurer has had another cut at them, they will get what they want. But I understand that the late General Officer Commanding sent in his estimates conscientiously prepared with due regard to the wish of Parliament, to save every shilling that it could. He simply asked for what was necessary, and when £160,000 was knocked off, I believe that it crippled the Defence system. If you ask any officer you meet in the street, he will tell you - if he will talk at all - that at this moment money is required for both arms and accoutrements. </para>

                        <para>- If our Defence system requires so much money, it must be voted. If we take the military men at the disposal of Great Britain, both in time of war and in time of peace, we shall find that they are but a handful compared with Russia's 3.500,000, Germany's 3,500,000, France's 3,000,000, Austria's. 2,000,000, and Italy's nearly 2,000,000. The National Service League points out that if we had a system for the compulsory training of our youth between the ages of 18 and 21, we should have a militia of 2,000,000, who in time of danger could be called out, and would be ready for the field in two or three weeks, owing, to their training.

                    <para>This particular defect (the lack of a system of national military education) in our military organization has cost the country no less than a hundred millions sterling ; that it was a principal indirect course of the outbreak of war ; that for some months it left the United Kingdom practically denuded of trained soldiers; and that it produced - the most perilous international situation in which the Empire has found itself since the days of Napoleon. Only an extraordinary combination of fortunate circumstances, external and internal, saved the Empire during the early months of 1900, and there is no reason to expect a repetition of such fortune if, as appears probable, the next national emergency finds us still discussing our preparation. </para>

                    <para>Military or naval training should be made compulsory for every able-bodied youth between fourteen and nineteen, as a branch of, or as a continuation of ordinary education. In working out the details the line of existing educational machinery should be closely followed. Military training would rank as an additional branch beside elementary, secondary, and technical education, being most nearly allied, by its compulsory character, to elementary education.

                    <para>I am much flattered by the suggestion that I should write an article dealing with the objects of the National Service League. I regret, however, that I cannot do so at present, as all my spare lime is fully occupied with other work. But in a book of personal memories recently published, I stated very plainly my views upon what I conceive to be the absolute necessity of enforcing compulsory military or naval service, in some form or other, upon all classes in the United Kingdom. The National Service League can make use of those statements in support of its proposals. </para>

                    <para>At the same time, I am also convinced that drill and military exercises should be compulsory in all schools up to the age of eighteen. I look upon this early training as essential for the country, not merely for the training of armies, but for the general physique of the nation. Cadet corps and boys' brigades are of the greatest possible use in this respect, but they do not altogether fulfil the purpose that early training would do, as recommended so strongly by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir G.</inline> Taubman Goldie in the report of the South African War Commission. I entirely agree with Lord Methuen, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> French, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Hildyard as to the training of boys, and, finally, with Lord Wolseley, that it is advisable to spend more money on cadet battalions, which are most valuable adjuncts to the Army. </para>

It would be a great mistake to postpone the matter for eighteen months, until there is another Conference of Premiers. </para>

                    <para>- - I regret that I have to intervene at this stage, because I know there is a general desire to get through business. But certain circumstances have prevented me from having anything to say upon the Appropriation Bill up to the present. Like others, I desired to have an opportunity to make some criticism with regard to certain items. However, my chance is gone. But I do wish to take the opportunity to indorse very heartily what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> as to the absolute necessity for inaugurating some system of training the youths of Australia, so that they may be able, if called upon, to defend their country. I look upon it as most essential in connexion with the defences of Australia that we shall, as far as our powers will permit, act in conjunction with the States, in order to carry out some system of training our youths, especially in the art of rifle shooting. It is generally desired by Australian people that we shall rely for our defence upon our citizen soldiery, and our system is a farce if our citizen soldiers cannot hit a haystack at a hundred yards. I am afraid that that is what a number of them cannot do now. I do not think that any one will accuse me of militarism. I do not believe in that rampant spirit which some people encourage. But the very groundwork of the defences of this country must rest upon our youths; and unless we set to work early and initiate some system of training, not only in respect to night drills, but in the most essential part of training, the use of the rifle, we shall never have an efficient citizen soldiery system. This is undoubtedly one of the most important matters that the Minister of Defence can take into consideration. I earnestly hope that some arrangement will be come to with- the States Governments which will enable a system of this kind to be initiated, so that our youths may receive proper military training, and especially proper instruction, in the art of rifle shooting. I felt that it was incumbent upon me to express my opinions in regard to this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has taken a very deep interest in it. Twelve months ago I supported his contention just as strongly as I do now. I hope that the Minister of Defence will see his way clear to give special attention to it, and that he will impress the importance of it upon the Premiers of the States. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite safe for the honorable senator to say that, because I certainly should not be guilty of any attempt at homicide, or at killing a pet lamb. I rose, not to refute the honorable senator's statement, but to take exception to it. It was not worth refuting. As to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> scheme, I am certainly in favour of training the youths of the country, and I hope that the Premiers will take the subject into their consideration at the coming Conference. At the same time. I do not know that I am prepared to adopt any particular attitude on the subject to-day. If it is desired that there should be an expression of opinion to the effect that there should be compulsory training of boys, while the people who have votes are not subjected to similar compulsory service, I am not prepared to take up that attitude. While the service is voluntary for voters, let it be voluntary for non-voters. That is fair. Why should a man who will not be a voter for a few months, or for a year or two, be compelled to give his services to the country when we do not compel any one else to give his services ? I do not agree with that contention. The experience of New South Wales is that youths are only too willing to give their services; but it has been one of the blots on our system in that State that there has been a gap between the age of 14, when boys left the Cadet Force, and the age when they were eligible for enrolment in the Defence Forces proper. The consequence was that many of them lost their enthusiasm in military matters before they were eligible to undertake the higher duty of participating in the regular defence of the country. I thoroughly agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> as to the desirableness of training our youths so as to make them fit to enter the Defence Forces, and to that extent I willingly give my indorsement to his opinions, and join in his wish that the Premiers will take the matter into consideration at the ensuing Conference. </para>

                    <para>- I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> of the fact that the Government are thoroughly impressed with the importance of this subject, and I shall have much pleasure in drawing the attention of my colleague, the Minister of Defence, to the facts that the honorable and learned senator has collected since this matter was last discussed. The importance of it cannot be over-estimated. But, as I have said before, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> must recognise that one of the difficulties in dealing with the matter is that the compulsory training of boys out of school can only be carried on' in conjunction with the States authorities. No doubt it is an appropriate subject to be discussed by the Premiers Conference. Of course I am not able to say what will be discussed, because the list of subjects must be entirely under the control of the members of that Conference. I can, however, assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> that whether the subject is considered by the Conference or not - personally I hope it will be - it will not be lost sight of by the Government during the recess. </para>

He merely deplored the fact that the majority of our citizen soldiers were not efficient rifle shots. In doing so, he used a metaphorical figure which is employed every day in colloquial language. He said that many of them " could not hit a haystack." Every one knows that that is a mere figure of speech. Moreover, it is a notorious fact that the Defence Forces of Australia are not as efficient in rifle shooting as we should like them to be. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> denies that he himself has defamed the Defence Forces of Australia, I should like to point out that not only has he done so, but that he has absolutely ridiculed them. </para>

                    <para>The people of Australia have now an ingrained belief that an Australian astride of anything with four legs, if possessed with a rifle, and a pillow case full of cartridges, is a match for an indefinite number of the best trained soldiers of any nation under heaven. That unhappy mania is shared and propagated by members of Parliament and Ministers of the Crown. The late Minister of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, G.C.M.G.. recently declared in Parliament that if he had not rifles enough for the Forces he would " arm them with pick-axes or something " ; and the present Minister states that should England become involved in the Eastern War, he intends to rais?, the number of rifle club members from 25,000 to 50,000,' though well knowing there are not rifles available for even the existing regiments if extended to their war establishments. The Minister apparently prefers undisciplined, unorganized mobs with rifles of every possible pattern, but minus ammunition and destitute of officers, to drilled, disciplined, armed, and officered soldiers. With such ideas permeating the community, what prospect is there of Australia developing a sound system of military, let alone naval, defence. </para>

It comes with a very ill-grace from the honorable senator that after writing such an article he should charge an honorable senator on this side with defaming the Defence Force, when that honorable senator advocated' merely the increased efficiency of the Force. If such a charge lies against any member of the Senate, it certainly lies against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline></para>

                    NEILD (New South Wales). - It is only because reiterated misrepresentations are finally in some quarters accepted for truth that I take any notice of the effort which has been made to place an interpretation upon words written by me which must be transparently false to any one who gives the matter consideration. The words quoted are to the effect that a certain ingrained belief is held by the people of Australia. That does not mean the Defence Force in any shape or way. The words which have been read imply no belief on the part of the Defence Force, and have no relation to it. There was a time when the very word's which have been quoted were use'd publicly in New South Wales by an officer who had returned from South Africa, and when it was a common thing, as stated in the quotation, for public men, Ministers, Members of Parliament, and others to advocate a gospel of " gallop and shoot," in preference to any form of military organization. That is all my article said, and it is all I say now. The promulgation of such a false doctrine is entirely opposed to the true national spirit, not to the fictitious and meretricious public spirit of which we sometimes hear. The man who desired to defend his country, and to maintain Australian prestige, is the man who is prepared to take some little trouble about it, and to make some slight sacrifice to fit himself for it, and not the man who is satisfied with firing at a target, or galloping about on a horse in the imaginary belief that he is thus qualifying himself for military service. The capacity to shoot straight and the capacity to ride hard are very useful adjuncts, but they do not constitute the all in all of military training, nor do they constitute that military training to which

                    <para>- I have but a very few remarks to make, and I know the reply which will be given to them before I make t'hem. The Minister will compliment me upon having placed the matter so lucidly, before the Committee, will admit that he is profoundly impressed, and will undertake to submit what I have said to the Cabinet. I Know the exact formula. I wish to say that there is one member of the present * Government in the place where I think he ought to be. I have a great deal of confidence in the present Minister of Defence. I believe that if the honorable and learned gentleman remains in that position long enough great advantage will accrue to the Defence Force of the Commonwealth. I see no provision made in this Bill for converting the <inline font-style="italic">Cerberus</inline> into what she ought to be, an effective weapon of defence. This matter has been referred to time after time. She is now armed with four 10-inch muzzleloading guns that are quite obsolete, and of no service at all. A modern vessel, armed with a 9.2-inch gun, would be able to stand off and batter her to pieces. If she were armed with four 8-inch modern breech-loading guns, I am informed on good authority, she would be a match for any single vessel that might enter these waters. The Naval Defence is our first line of defence, though we have heard a good deal to-day about cadets and small boys. As a layman, I offer the opinion that in Australia we shall have to depend for our defence mainly on the big guns of the Naval and Artillery branches of the Defence Force. If an expenditure of from £20,000 to £25.000 would be sufficient, as I am informed it would, to convert the <inline font-style="italic">Cerberus</inline> from a comparatively useless floating battery into a very effective one for the defence of one of the largest capitals of Australia, the proposal is worthy of consideration. I feel sure that I shall be told that the matter will be given consideration, and that is the last we shall hear of it. I direct attention to the branch of the force which is here called "The Naval Militia," but which used to be called "The Naval Brigade," and to which some of the finest men in the States belong. The pay used to be about £11 a year, until there was retrenchment in Victoria, when it was reduced to, I think, £7 5s., though subsequently it was slightly increased, and now stands at £8 10s. I suggest that the Government should add another £2, which would, of course, be paid throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- The pay ought to be increased in order to induce men to join the Naval Militia, because, in my opinion, we shall have to depend on big guns, and not on rifles in case of war. The men to whom I refer can go on board a vessel, take their part in a battery, or use the rifle, and when they compete with rifles at the butts, they very frequently are successful. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of such useful men throughout the Common- wealth, whom a little inducement would bring into the Defence Force. At present, the whole effective strength in Victoria is 116 men, though eight or ten years ago it was 250 or 300 men. I am not belittling the land forces, but, in my opinion, Australia will never be attacked by an army, but by a fleet carrying big guns. </para>

                    (Queensland).- This is the time to ventilate a matter which has occupied a good deal of the time of the Senate, but which, nevertheless, has not, in the opinion of most honorable senators, arrived at a satisfactory conclusion. It is a matter, which, to a large extent,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline>
                    you had under your personal charge, namely, the case of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline>
                    There are one or two new developments to which I desire to call particular attention, and in regard to which this Parliament is entitled to some satisfactory explanation before we conclude our labours. A statement has been made, which I, together with, I believe, almost every other honorable senator, am satisfied is correct, and which casts absolute discredit on the whole of the evidence given by the late General Officer Commanding before the Select Committee on that case. If we find a witness's statement is in one particular absolutely vitiated, that to a large extent discredits all his other statements. You,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline>
                    as particularly interested, have had questions on the notice-paper for a considerable time in regard to this matter, and, so far, no satisfactory reply has been given by the Government. The questions have been postponed from day to day on one flimsy excuse or another, and before we allow the control of the business to go out of our hands, we ought to see that justice is done to an injured citizen of the Commonwealth. It was pointed out by the Attorney-General that this Parliament is, to a certain extent, a court - a final court of appeal. It is one of the first principles of British justice and jurisprudence that the dispensation of justice must not be delayed - that for the protection of the citizens the administration of justice must be speedy and sure. But all the efforts of the Government in this connexion have been to delay justice - have been to block any final decision. I object to such a course on the part of the Government, and I intend to review the circumstances shortly. In his evidence, before the Select Committee, Major-General Hutton was examined in reference to the following letter: -

The honorable senator's denunciation of Major-General Hutton, and his remarks generally, would have been perfectly appropriate in the discussion of the report of the Select Committee, but now they can only have the effect of re-opening a discussion on the whole case dealt with in the report. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw the expression. I am very pleased to find that the Attorney-General has no desire to burke discussion. A new fact has come to light which places one officer or the other in a very invidious position. Either Major-General Hutton has said on oath what is not true, or Colonel Hoad has stated in a letter what is not true, but I understand that the latter is prepared to back up his statement by an affidavit if the Government will give him an opportunity. When Major-General Hutton swore that he knew nothing about the letter there was no means of proving whether he did or not, but the means is now at our disposal. </para>

They have evaded giving <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> an opportunity to vindicate his character by taking the sworn statement of Colonel Hoad. I do' not know exactly which officer has made a false statement, but I know that we have the remedy in our hands. I have the very best reason for believing that Colonel Hoad is prepared to make an affidavit that he had more than one consultation with Major-General Hutton as to the contents of this letter before it was written by his direction. I challenge the Government to put that statement to the proof. </para>

                        <para>- It is not possible to take that course when we are discussing the Estimates. I am taking the only course which appears to me to be effective. It has been said that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was retrenched because there was no officer required at the time ; in fact, that they intended to dispense with a number of officers, and that he was one of those whose services could best be spared. I believe it is a fact "that very soon after he was retrenched, two officers, named Robinson and Buckley, were appointed, who had no claims on the service. One of them was brought out from England, and the other was the son of a prominent merchant in. Melbourne, who, I suppose, could exercise a great deal of influence. Is that the way in which the Parliament al lows' the Military Forces to be run? </para>

                    <para>- I - I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> does not desire that I should enter into a discussion of the Carroll case. We have heard quite enough about it. Putting that case on one side, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> asks that Ave should anticipate the answer to a question, that is on the notice-paper for to-morrow. It is undesirable that the Estimates should be postponed for such a purpose. In the first place, it is not denied that a letter was written by Colonel Hoad. The letter itself states that it was written under the direction of Major-General Hutton, who has said that he has no recollection of having ordered it to be written There is a difference of recollection between the two men. That is what it comes to. Surely it is not right for an honorable senator to hurl charges of perjury against an absent man on such a ground. In the multiplicity of affairs that have to be transacted, a man is always liable to make mistakes of this kind. It is impossible to say which officer is correct. But it would certainly be wrong to do anything to decide a question of this kind without giving one of the parties an opportunity to defend himself. </para>

We shall then be in a better position to discuss the schedule. It appears to me that the Government are in this matter guilty of conduct which can only be described as contemptible. In the first place, this Chamber is not a court of law, where it is permissible for members of the legal profession to shelter themselves behind mere technicalities. The representative of the Government should not carry the pettifogging methods of the courts into this Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to know what the honorable senator means by that ? It is because honorable senators wish to consider other business which, in their opinion, is of more importance, that they desire to slur over this question. We have now an opportunity to prove, by evidence which was not available when the Select Committee was inquiring into this case, whether statements made by the principal witness against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> were true. I have asked that Colonel Hoad should be permitted to make an affidavit as to whether he correctly stated the facts in his letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> when he said' that he was desired by the late General Officer Commanding to write it. The Attorney-General sheltered himself behind the legal quibble, that we cannot get an affidavit from any person, except on a legal matter. I then offered to cease my remarks if the Government would undertake .to get a written statement from  Colonel Hoad,  which I am sure every member of the Committee would be willing to accept, and the Attorney-General then sheltered himself behind the fact that there is a question on the business-paper dealing with this matter to which he proposes to reply to-morrow. I was perfectly reasonable when that statement was made, and asked that we should delay dealing with .this matter until the honorable and learned senator's reply to the question is before <inline font-style="italic">us.</inline> If the answer to that question is satisfactory, there need be no further discussion. The Attorney-General would not agree .to that, and all his supporters expressed themselves against the proposal to postpone this item until tomorrow. If I had my way, and a sufficient number of the members of this Committee loved justice and fair play, .this discu :sion should continue until after the time when the Attorney-General will answer this question, so that we should have full information before we proceed ,to a decision. </para>

                        <para>- It is a truly awful state of things that we should not allow the Government to do just what they please with us. I remind honorable senators that the Government are in the position of the directors of a public company. They have to manage the affairs of the Commonwealth in the interests of the shareholders, who are the people of the Commonwealth." We are a representative Committee of the. shareholders, and the representatives of the people should not be under .the thumb of any Government. On the other hand, it should be no indignity to the members of any Government to be under obligation to disclose their full intentions to the representatives of the people. The reason which is alleged for the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carrol</inline> is, that Major-General Hutton considered that he was the officer who could be spared with least injury to the service when retrenchment was the order of the day. Major-General Hutton directed a letter to be written to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> after that officer had been placed on the Retired List, asking him if he would be willing to return the gratuity which he received on his retirement if he were restored to the Unattached List. Major-General Hutton has admitted that that statement, if written by his direction, involved that he must have contemplated the possibility of reinstating <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> at some future time on the Active List. When confronted with that letter by the Select Committee, Major-General Hutton, in the strongest terms, denied all knowledge of it. He said, in answer to question 438 - </para>

                <para class="block">The Attorney-General says that it is a question merely of a lapse of memory, and as to whether Colonel Hoad or Major-General Hutton more accurately recollects what took place. I point out that it is not merely a matter of recollection, because that presupposes that Major-General Hutton gave his answers to the questions asked him without due thought, whilst we have evidence that he emphatically repeated three times that the letter was sent without his knowledge, and that he knew nothing at all about it. On the face of the letter, it. is evident that Major-General Hutton did know about it because it begins, " I am desired by the General Officer Commanding." Therefore, either Colonel Hoad made a false statement when he wrote that letter, or Major-General Hutton swore to a false statement when he gave his evidence before the Select Committee. We have now an opportunity to find out whether Major-General Hutton was correct in the statement he has made. I have the very best reason for believing that if Colonel Hoad is afforded an opportunity to deal with the evidence to which I have referred, he will swear, if necessary, not only that Major-General Hutton knew of the letter in question, but that he had more than one consultation with his Chief of Staff before that letter was sent. That is a statement which should not be ignored in dealing with this matter. It must be remembered that the injustice which <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> is suffering has been inflicted on him at the instance of Major-General Hutton in the first place. He was placed on the retired, list by the late General Officer Commanding. That action was confirmed by the Minister of Defence at the time of the recommendation of Major-General Hutton, and the action of the present Government is largely based on the attitude of and the evidence given by that officer. When we find that in one specific instance Major-General Hutton's evidence is absolutely discredited, and to use stronger terms, if  Colonel Hoad  is to be believed, that it is absolutely false, we are justified in holding that it is the duty of the Government to review the whole matter. I should be sorry if the Committee refused to consider it, because of any desire to be revenged upon an officer who has given some little trouble. </para>

I do not this afternoon go the length of asking the Senate to review its decision, but before we separate for the year we ought to have some assurance that tardy justice will be done to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> The means lie to our hand. Colonel Hoad, who was in Japan when the Select Committee sat, is now available. If it can be proved that Major-General Hutton authorized, or wrote that letter, it will prove that he contemplated the re-employment of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> and also that Major-General Hutton was absolutely wrong in all his contentions.

                    (Queensland).- I am extremely surprised at the attitude of the Government. This case was considered to be of sufficient importance for investigation by a Select Committee, who recommended the reinstatement of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline>
                    The report of .the Select Committee was not adopted; and I think I am right in saying that the principle reason was the evidence given by Major-General Hutton, together with the statement laid upon the table of the Senate just as that officer was leaving for the old country. If the contention of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline>
                    is correct - that Major-General Hutton's evidence has been, or is likely to be, found unreliable in one particular - then I submit that the whole of his evidence must be discounted. I can imagine the Attorney-General in a Court, dealing with a witness whose evidence has been discovered to be unreliable on an important point of this character. How the honorable and learned gentleman would rave and rant, and tear and cross-examine in his efforts to influence the jury ! Yet the Attorney-General treats this whole matter with the utmost unconcern, although, in my opinion, the honour of the Senate is involved. An officer of the Commonwealth Forces was literally hounded out of his employment by

There is a liar somewhere in connexion with this case ; and it is either Major-General Hutton or Colonel Hoad. The Senate is entitled to have the matter cleared up, and if the Government shield either Colonel Hoad or Major-General Hutton they will be guilty of a gross breach of trust. What confidence could be placed in a man who would deliberately go before a Committee and swear a falsehood? If Major-General Hutton did so, would the Government be justified in leaving the control of the defences in the hands of such a man? It is within the power of the Government to prove whether Major-General Hutton has done such a thing, and if he has, he is guilty of the most unsoldierlike conduct, and ought to be drummed out of the British Army. In the interests of all concerned, every light should be thrown on this most unsavoury incident. Major-General Hutton has gone away, but Colonel Hoad is here, and that officer's honour is also involved. Major-General Hutton went before the Select Committee and deliberately branded Colonel Hoad as a nar. </para>

We 'have not received that support which we should have got if other matters were not pressing for first attention upon honorable senators who desire to prorogue at an early date, and who, therefore, wish to obtain sufficient time for the discussion of those matters .in which- they are interested. I hope that honorable senators who have assumed that attitude will be content to take the responsibility of their action, because it must be remembered that we are in the position of a jury. A fellow citizen has appealed to us for justice, and we have no right to allow any consideration to stand between us and the granting of justice to him. Perhaps no good purpose could be served by pursuing the matter any further at this stage, but I can assure the Government that it will not be allowed to fall into the limbo of forgotten things. There are honorable senators who will revive the case next session, and insist upon a fair deal being meted out to an injured officer. He has been refused common justice. He has been denied an opportunity to refute injurious evidence which he had no opportunity to refute at the time it was given. All this discussion could have been saved if the Government, at the beginning, had complied with the very moderate request that the Chief Staff Officer should be asked for a written statement as to the correctness or otherwise of the assertion made by Major-General Hutton in his sworn evidence.

                        <para>- We who have taken this stand have failed not because our claim was not right and just, but because of considerations which I hope will not obtain when the Senate meets again. I promise the Government that this matter will not be allowed to sink into the limbo of forgotten things. If no one else moves, I shall push the matter to the furthest extremity until absolute justice is done to this citizen, who has been very hardly dealt with indeed. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to call attention to some items similar to those to which I have previously called the attention of the Attorney-General. I have been trying to get some explanation of the reason why certain officers have been kept below the minimum salary which the Parliament has enacted shall be paid to officers after they have attained a certain age. I find that on these Estimates two messengers are given £61 each. That is very far below the minimum provided by the Parliament. Either these are very young lads, or they are getting very small salaries. </para>

                    <para>---On this vote for the Public Service Commissioner, I desire to refer to several matters in connexion with the postal administration in Queensland. One of these matters was dealt with on a recent Appropriation Bill, and the Attorney-General promised to submit it to the Government, and try to see whether an undoubted grievance could not be remedied. As I have heard nothing further on the subject, I have come to the conclusion that his promise was so much wind, that he has not brought the case before the Government, and that it stands now just where it did when I previously spoke. I allude to the position of a number of classified postal employe's in Brisbane. I forget exactly how many are concerned, but I know that they represent a considerable number. These men passed the usual Civil Service examination, were treated in every respect as clerical classified assistants, and had before them the prospect of being assistants in that grade. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">But when the classification was adopted, it was found that their work was placed in the general, instead of in the clerical division. I have no complaint to make against the Public Service Commissioner for so classifying the work. I think that on the whole it was just as well that this particular branch was placed in the general division. But the increases granted to the officers are now only general division increases, and their prospects of promotion are very seriously changed. If this matter is not dealt with by the Government, it will have to be dealt with by the High Court. If the Government are not prepared to do justice, the men will have to wring justice out of them. The matter has been allowed to go on too long, and' I now want to know whether "the Vice-President of the Executive Council can tell me whether anything has been done since I spoke last to put it on a proper footing. I am prepared to be told that the matter is in the hands of the Public Service Commissioner. But the Public Service Commissioner cannot override the law. He cannot tear up the Constitution. The Constitution reserves , to these men all the rights they possessed when the Federal compact was entered into. They formerly belonged to the clerical branch of the service. They passed their Public Service examinations. They were in receipt of regular clerical increases. But now they are relegated to the general division. </para>

                        <para>- I want the men to be placed in their proper division. While they were in the Queensland service they were in the clerical branch. They were in receipt of clerical pay, and clerical increments. When the Public Service Commissioner classified the service he put them in the general division. What I complain of is that they are now paid general division increases, which are much smaller than clerical division increases. They also complain that their avenues of promotion are limited in a very serious degree. The agreement made with these young men when they entered the service has been deliberately broken. I claim that they should be granted the same annual increments as are received by other employes who entered the service at the same time as they did, but who were fortunate enough to be employed' at work which the Public Service Commissioner classified as clerical. There is a legal question involved - whether the bargain entered into with these men by the State has not been departed from by the Commonwealth. That is a question which ought to have been submitted to the Attorney-General. If I have his assurance that the matter will be attended to, I shall be satisfied. Another matter which has caused a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst the Post and Telegraph employes in Queensland is the computation of pay for Sunday work. It appears that  in calculating this pay, the annual salary of an officer is divided by 365. The officers contend that it ought to be divided by 313, deducting fifty-two Sundays. There is also a matter affecting the employes who have to do with the mails, which has caused a great deal of dissatisfaction. </para>

In the' mail branch of the Brisbane General Post Office, there are 119 officers whose average salary is £147 per annum. In the Adelaide General Post Office there are 139 officers at an average salary of £163. In the Brisbane Post Office, where there is much more work to do than in the Adelaide office, there are nine paid clerical assistants. In the Adelaide Post Office there are twenty-eight paid clerical assistants. </para>

                <para class="block">Australia are. If there is to be uniformity of administration, let us place each office on the same footing. The question of the mail money which used to be paid to officers of the Department in Brisbane has been brought before the Senate on several occasions, but so far no relief has been granted. This mail money was paid in the Brisbane Post Office for about thirty years, and the officers came to look upon it as a part of their salary. They do not ask that it should be continued as hitherto, but they ask for an increase of salary to compensate them for the loss they have suffered. They ask that they should be placed in the same position financially as they were in prior to Federation, when, as a matter of fact, this mail money was as much a part of their annual salaries as was the sum voted for the purpose on the Estimates. There are a number of other matters to which I desired to refer, but at this late period of the session I have very little hope that they would be sympathetically discussed, and I have been forced to the conclusion that it is probably better that I should postpone their discussion until next session, when they may be dealt with to more advantage. Before I resume my seat, however, I must refer to the disproportion noticeable between the increases granted to the more highly paid public servants of the Commonwealth, and those granted to our poorly paid public servants. I find that the more poorly paid employes are recommended for increases of £2 per annum, or about 9d. per week, whereas in some of the higher grades the increases recommended run from £5° t0 £100 P61 annum, or from £1 to <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per week. In my opinion the more highly paid officers were getting quite enough before the classification, whilst the very opposite was the case with many of the poorly paid employes. I know that we shall have the usual statement that good men must be paid good salaries. I have no objection to that, but when we find salaries jumped up from about £400 to £550 a year, we begin to inquire" the reason. My contention is that the Public Service Commissioner, being a civil servant of the old <inline font-style="italic">regime,</inline> whose particular business it was to see that the more highly paid officers received large increases annually, and who did not trouble very much about the poorly paid employe's, has 'followed on the old lines. As we put it in Scotland, he has " greased the fat sow." " To him that hath shall be given." He could not take from those who had so little, but he went as near to that as he possibly could. If I have gauged the feelings of the Federal Parliament aright, it is that more attention should be paid to the men who do the rough work of the Post and Telegraph Department. They are as necessary to the carrying on of the Department as are its most highly paid officers, and every one of them should be decently paid </para>

                        <para>- In some cases they are not. Why should a man who is already in receipt of a sufficiently large salary be granted an increase of from £50 to £100 a year, whilst another man in receipt of the paltry annual wage of £120 is given an increase of only £2 a year ? That is the system carried out by the Public Service Commissioner throughout. I trust that the Government will take into consideration the grievances to which I have referred, and will see that they are remedied before this Parliament meets again. </para>

                        <para>- I have no hesitation whatever in giving my honorable friend an assurance that the matters to which he has alluded, as well as those to which any other honorable senator may allude in connexion with the Public Service, will be thoroughly investigated, with a view to the redress of all injustice and the removal of inequalities. But with regard to the specific matters to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has referred, and which I again assure the honorable senator have been investigated in fulfilment of the promise which I gave, 1 am satisfied, as I think the honorable senator will be, that there is no foundation for some of the grievances he puts forward. The honorable senator has been good enough to ask merely for an assurance that the grievances shall be investigated, but he will perhaps allow me to give such information as I have now as the -result of inquiries already made. Taking first the last point to which the honorable senator referred - the alleged grievance that the more highly-paid officers have received large increases, whilst those at the opposite end of the scale have been treated in quite a different, and apparently in an inequitable manner - the figures show that exactly the opposite ls the case. The total increases shown by the classification, which has not yet been confirmed, and which is subject to appeal, amount to £54,564. If no classification of the service had been made, the States and statutory increments would of course have to be paid. These should be deducted from the total increases shown in the classification, in order to establish a just comparison. They would amount to £34,653, leaving the actual amount of increases due to the classification scheme at £19,911. The amount involved in increases to officers receiving less than £200 per annum - the lower grades of the service -is £41853. </para>

Honorable senators will therefore see that there is not very much left for increases to officers receiving more than £500 a year. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say how many, but the increases provided for those officers total £880, whilst officers of the Administrative Division - the highest class - divide amongst them £400. These amounts will be found to make up the total of £54.564. Stated in percentages the figures show that about 76 per cent. of the total increases will go to officers of the lower divisions of the service, if the classification scheme is carried out. </para>

                        <para>- They are of value in this way, that they show that, amongst officers receiving over £500 a year, and officers of the Administrative Division, there is but £1,280 for distribution as increases, and honorable senators cannot bring a railing charge such as that to which we have listened, when it can be shown that out of £54,564, £41,853 is distributed amongst officers receiving less than £200 a year. The official figures show that there is no foundation for the appeal which is frequently made on behalf of " the poor man." Whatever his faults, I think it must be admitted that the Public Service Commissioner, in his classification, has endeavoured to do justice in the distribution of these increases. The question of the mail money to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has referred has been considered already, but I have no doubt that the Post Office authorities will be prepared to consider it again. The honorable senator does not disapprove of the discontinuance of the payment of mail money. It existed only in Queensland, and was therefore an anomaly in the Commonwealth service, and was on that account discontinued. The honorable senator suggests, however, that while it is right that these payments should be discontinued as payments for mail money, they should be continued in the form of increases in salary. That would be taking money out of one pocket to put it into another. However, it is a legitimate matter to bring under the notice of the Government, and I readily assure the honorable senator that it will have consideration. With respect to the objection taken to the Sunday pay, I may inform the honorable senator that time and a-half is being paid for Sunday work, but what the honorable senator contends is that the payment should be regulated by having regard to the sum resulting from a division, by 313, instead of that resulting from a division by 365. Whilst the matter is one that may fairly be discussed, I think we should not do well to interfere with the Public Service Commissioner in its adjustment. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, I may say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has put the case very moderately, although I do not agree with him, nor do I think do other honorable senators. I may conclude my remarks by summarizing the present position. The classification scheme is not yet confirmed, and pending the appeals, it is undesirable, inconvenient, and possibly embarrassing to discuss details. It is not the intention of the Government that the classification scheme shall be confirmed, or brought into final operation until honorable senators, if they so desire, have had it under review. At any rate, no change due to the classification scheme alone - there being other matters affecting status, and so forth in the service which are not interfered with - will be carried into effect until honorable senators have had an opportunity to express an opinion. It is the present intention of the Government, at any rate, to afford at the earliest possible time, such an opportunity in regard to a matter of so much interest. </para>

                    <para>. - The first paragraph of the clause has been struck out, and in lieu thereof a provision for some kind of Government control has been inserted. My honorable friend now proposes to amend the remaining portion of the clause so as to make it read as a prohibition against opium, except for medicinal purposes. It is inadvisable that that amendment should be made, because the existing law deals with that subject. Another reason is that if the amendment were made, it would be necessary to make a series of amendments. </para>

If we amended the clause in the direction in which my honorable friend proposes, it would involve very great controversy. When I read the provisions in the ordinance, he will see that for the present - and this subject can be dealt with next session - there is ample restriction on the importation and sale of opium as well as of intoxicating liquor.

                    <para>- I had intended to move an amendment in this clause, giving the white inhabitants of British New Guinea limited representation, but in view of the remarks which have just fallen from the Attorney-General, in which he said that if there were no fresh controversial amendments, there would be a probability of the Bill becoming law, I do not intend to proceed with my proposal. If, however, the Bill is passed, I intend next session to introduce an amending Bill, giving limited representation to the white inhabitants; I desire to see this measure placed upon the Statute-book. It may be jeopardized by the introduction of a further controversial amendment, which will give rise to a long discussion. I am not disposed to take up further time, but simply intimate that I drop my amendment for the present. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline>
                    that it is of very little use to endeavour to insert new provisions in the Bill at this stage of the session, especially if they are of a controversial character. It appears that an amendment of the character indicated by the honorable senator would give rise to considerable controversy. My own information is that it is scarcely likely that the Bill will be dealt with by another place at all. If that is so, it shows the uselessness of introducing serious legislation of this character at this late period of the session. A Bill which grants a Constitution to British New Guinea imposes a serious responsibility upon us. It ought not to be passed without the fullest' consideration. I therefore protest against' the manner in which the Bill has been introduced. But as it is exceedingly necessary that some kind of a Constitution should be adopted, as the Bill will in some respects meet the requirements, and as there is no probability of its passing if we further amend it in a serious direction, all I can do is to utter a strong protest, and to express the hope that on a future occasion we shall have ample opportunities to amend it.

                        <para>- It is so serious a matter to interfere with the Constitution of the Territory that I arn sure that the Attorney-General will agree that any measure of the kind should be introduced by the Government. It should not be undertaken by a private senator. Facilities should be afforded for considering the subject fully. I think that is a reasonable request. </para>

Even the most democratic senator will recognise that before we offer any form of representative government to British New Guinea, we ought to' have accurate information as to how many white people there are there, who they are, and what they are doing.

                <para class="block">I only submit this motion <inline font-style="italic">pro forma,</inline> because we are told that there is a prospect of new legislation affecting New Guinea being brought forward next session. That being the case, I do not intend to press my proposal ; though I, for one, strongly regret that the Bill as it stands runs counter to an ordinance already in existence in the Possession. That ordinance permits the sale of land on conditions under which the rights of the natives are preserved. It is called the Land Ordinance of 1899. We must not forget that contiguous to the Possession are German and Dutch New Guinea; and I am very much afraid that if permission is not given to alienate land, our Possession will be placed at a great disadvantage as compared with other portions of New Guinea, which are not under our government. Every one who has any knowledge of business knows that persons who have freehold property are) '(more inclined to spend money and tq improve their holdings than are those who have leasehold land. The ordinance to which I have referred prohibits dealing in land with natives, and imposes a penalty up to .£100, or imprisonment for a period not exceeding twelve months. It provides, further, that after sufficient inquiry the Administrator, on behalf of the Crown, may purchase native lands in perpetuity, or upon "such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon " by the Administrator, and the owner or owners of the land. It also provides that such lands are to be held either as Crown lands or for sale in fee-simple, or, I presume, on lease ; that lands may be granted to missions ; and that they may be reserved for public purposes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> told us a few days ago that about- 750,000 acres are said to have been acquired by the Government under this ordinance. Consequently, that is all the land that is available for sale But not more than 50,000 acres have been alienated. I may remark that some time ago the local Government were' in favour of granting land on certain terms to the Hall Sound Company ; but before doing so, they thought it right to consult the Governments of the Colonies that had granted £20,000 a year. It was then found that such a proposal did not meet with their approval. I had the honour to be one of the directors of the company. If the concession had been granted, we should have spent a considerable amount of money. Our object was the <inline font-style="italic">bona -fide</inline> settlement of the place. We intended to go in for cultivation. I did not enter into the affair with the object of making money. If I had done, I certainly should not have made any. If we do not establish industries of some kind in the Possession, it will be a very long time before British New Guinea becomes a self - supporting country. If, during next Parliament, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> seems to expect, a Bill is introduced to amend the provision dealing with the Legislative Council of New Guinea, I shall, if spared, endeavour to bring forward a clause to provide for the sale of land in New Guinea. I now ask leave to withdraw my amendment. </para>

I agree entirely with the honorable senator in the suggestion that it should be left to the Executive to grant land in fee simple if it sees fit. I believe that it would do more to advance the interests of New Guinea to allow the land alienation ,to take place under wise restrictions, and careful administration, than to prohibit it altogether.

                            does not propose to persist with his amendment, because of .the late period of the session, I shall raise no objection to the course he has taken, but I consider it a great pity that so important a matter has not been fully considered in the Senate, especially in view of the fact that in another place honorable members seem to have been entirely in favour of non-alienation. I hope that an opportunity will be afforded to deal with the matter next session.

I am sure that with many other honorable senators I am as much interested in those principles as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> We say nothing, because what we1 want is already contained in the Bill.

                    is not putting the matter fairly. Senators Walker and Gould have been allowed to make an attack on the principle of non-alienation, whilst no reply is made by those who hold a different view. It is no fault of mine that those honorable senators did not have an opportunity to deal wit'h this matter before. I am awaiting a ruling from the Chairman as to whether I shall be in order in discussing the matter at this stage.

                    <para>- The Attorney-General has not given us adequate reason for his proposal. I understand that the amendment made by the House of Representatives means that the Bill shall not apply to existing contracts made before the 30th June next, which is practically six months from the date of the measure coming into operation. Is this the point thai was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> about contracts which were being entered into? </para>

Will people not be prejudiced, who have in good faith entered into contracts since the 17th November? If that be so, it would hardly be fair to those people whose bills of lading will be altogether different from the bills of lading of others who are practically engaged in the same business. </para>

                        <para>- I am certain an attempt will be made to raise the freights. Those contracts, at any rate, are undoubtedly on more favourable terms than any man could now obtain, and the persons who have made them will be able to dictate terms to the shipper. In other words, the little shipper who has not previously made a contract will be unable to obtain such favorable terms as are enjoyed by those whom we have called the middlemen. </para>

                    <para>- I am very glad that this clause has been inserted. Although I have obtained what I want in regard to the fruit merchants of Tasmania, I do not think that the Bill is quite just to others. The fixing of the month of June will carry us over the fruit season, but if there are contracts for rabbits, butter, or other perishable products, and those contracts have been made in good faith, they ought to be protected. I am not interested in those other contracts, but I do not like to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> who ought to know something about justice, say that there is a concession. There is no concession ; it is merely a matter of justice, and does not go far enough. It has been pointed out by the press that there are two sides to this question. There is the ship-owners' side, and, although I am interested on the part of the shippers, -I do not think we have quite sufficiently considered the former. </para>

                    (Queensland).- This is not a concession to the shippers, but, practically, protects the interests of the shipowners who have already entered into contracts. Contracts which have been entered into will be void, and others will have to be made; and, so far as I have been able to glean from previous debates, there is no protection to the grower - to the man who does not make any contract with the shipping company. In Tasmania there appears to be a system of two or three firms taking up all the available space, and letting it out to any growers who require it. I further understand that the growers, knowing that those firms secure all the space, are not usually in a particular hurry to enter into a contract until the freight is ready ; and the effect of the amendment will be that two or three firms I have mentioned will have their contracts exempt, and will be able to make more out of the growers. There will be no other space available at the same price; and from this point of view, it seems that we may be doing a positive injustice.

                        <para>- I know precisely what this sort of trade usually is. When the growers know that some person has entered into a contract for space, and is willing to sub-contract at any time, they are not in the habit of entering into a contract with the shipper before their produce is ready for shipment. This amendment would place them at a decided disadvantage. Shippers, knowing that space could not be obtained elsewhere at the same rate, would be inclined to take advantage of their position, and put up the rates against those growers who were looking round for space. If that is the effect which the amendment would have, I should not have the slightest hesitation in voting against it. </para>

                        <para>- I know that, but the honorable and learned senator's principal object was to protect the shippers and producers of Tasmania, and of course other States, witE regard to existing contracts. The! position in my State is not quite understood by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline> Unfortunately there is a want of cohesion and cooperation amongst the growers, and but for the action of two or three firms who have received a little revilement here rather than the praise which I think they deserve, it is doubtful if we should have had these large ships coming along as quickly as they have and catering for us. What these firms do is to enter into a contract which suits the steam-ship companies. The latter have not to arrange with the producers, but are assured of their space being taken, and the contractors let out the space at exactly what they pay for it. </para>

                    <para>- The proposal to insert this proviso is simply an act of ordinary justice to those who have entered into contracts. From its wording, it is perfectly clear that any contracts entered into before the passing of the Act would be respected. I take it that any contracts which were entered into to-day would be perfectly good if the Bill were assented to to-morrow. </para>

                        <para>- It has been urged that this provision might put shipowners in different positions. A man who makes his arrangement to-day, or after the Bill comes into operation, will be in a more unfavorable position than a man who has already entered into an agreement, but that is one of the inevitable results, when men make their contracts ahead. If the operation of the Act had been made to commence on the 1st July next, that difficulty would have been got over. There is no time to reconsider that question, and I think it will be very much better for honorable senators to accept the Bill as it stands, with the suggested amendment of the Attorney-General. </para>

                        <para>- It will be better, perhaps, if I explain the origin of the clause. In the Harter Act the words " or in the management of the vessel " appear. I had those words struck out when the amendment was shown to me. as about to be moved in another place, for this reason - that a case was recently decided in England, in which the learned Judge - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Kennedy - gave a decision, the effect of which might seriously prejudice our shippers. The case was one in which a cargo of butter, owing to carelessness in the management of the temperature of the cool chambers, had been frozen and spoilt. The Judge decided that the ship-owner was not liable, because he considered that carelessness in connexion with the temperature of the cool chamber was part of the management of the vessel. Of course, that would defeat the object of our Bill to a great extent. In the other House this point was mentioned and considered. The only amendment which it is necessary to make is to strike out the words "or document." Although we have the words " or document " in an earlier clause, they were put in there because a ship-owner might escape from the obligations of this measure by contracting himself out of his liability for negligence, by means of an agreement which was not embodied in the bill of lading. Therefore it was necessary for us to take into account, not merely the bill of lading, but any other documents. But that does not apply to this clause, which, in point of fact, is merely to establish a statutory form of bill of lading; and if the bill of lading is limited to the exceptions mentioned, and we make it illegal to put in other stipulations relieving the ship-owner from negligence, the measure is very satisfactory. </para>

                            <para>- Well, that is one thing that it does not mean; it does not mean the construction of the line. I wish that to be perfectly clear, so that honorable senators may not be led away into arriving at a wrong conclusion by any mistaken impression of that kind. The Bill does not commit, and is not intended to commit, the Senate or this Parliament collectively or individually to the construction of a transcontinental railway line, connecting South Australia with Western Australia. </para>

I am moving the second reading of this Bill, and I may be allowed to place my view of it before the Senate. I do not think that any long discussion is necessary. If this were a Bill for the construction of the line, there would be scope for very extensive discussion on the subject. It is because the Bill does not commit this Parliament or the Commonwealth to the construction of the. line, that I venture to think that there is no room for a very long debate. Nor do I think that any such discussion is needed. </para>

                            <para>- I am hopeful that even my honorable friend who interjects, will be in favour of passing this Bill with the same reservations as I apply to myself - that it does not commit me, as it does not commit him, to vote for the construction of the line, unless he is convinced, when that project comes before Parliament, of the necessity for doing it. I hope that honorable senators have an open mind upon the question so far, and that they are open to consider the reasons and the additional information which I am about to supply. In the first place, we all know that Western Australia, undoubtedly, wants the line. There can be no question about that. I think, also, that my honorable friends will agree with me that I am perfectly frank when I say that at present I am not in favour of the construction of the line. I wish that to be distinctly and clearly understood. Therefore, the arguments which I propose to offer in moving the second reading of this Bill are emphasized and strengthened by the fact that I do not support construction now. and do not advocate the Bill as part of the policy of the Government on the ground that it is equivalent to authorizing the construction of the line. </para>

                            <para>- Western Australia is a part of the Commonwealth, and is at present largely isolated from the rest of the Commonwealth. Quite apart from the question whether this large amount of money should be raised for the purpose of its construction, no one can deny that Western Australia may, on broad Federal grounds, apart from selfish motives, legitimately advocate the railway, and legitimately push any steps she may think desirable in that direction. I go further. I say the time must come when this iron road between Port Augusta and the nearest point of railway construction in Western Australia will be constructed, and will be a symbol of that union which, although I am not in favour of the immediate construction of the line, I freely admit is to a certain extent incomplete without it. </para>

Because they cannot get a bridge across Bass Straits, they therefore oppose this much more legitimate and much smaller Federal work between the eastern States and Western Australia.

                            <para>- I am aware that my honorable friend has occupied a distinguished position as a Minister of the <inline font-style="italic">Crown in</inline> Tasmania. I am saying that there is a close parallel between the condition of things in the eastern States of the Commonwealth and Western Australia, and that which existed between the eastern States of the United States and the State of California. The distance to be bridged over in this case is very much less than it was in the United States. The distance overland between Fremantle, the chief port in Western Australia, and Adelaide is 1,746 miles. Of course there are two portions of the distance already covered by railway - 387 miles between Fremantle and Kalgoorlie, and 259 miles between Port Augusta and Adelaide, making a total of 646 miles, and leaving a gap of only 1,100 miles. </para>

                            <para>- No; the larger section is on the South Australian side. By comparison with the similar work which had to be undertaken in the United States to unite San Francisco with the eastern States of that Union, this is a comparatively small undertaking. It seems to me that, although we may be opposed to granting to Western Australia all that she desires at once, or at all, for the matter of that, we might fairly concede what is asked by this Bill, and that is an investigation and the acquisition of the fullest materials possible, to enable us to exercise a sound and reasoned judgment when the entire project comes up for determination. That is what this Bill proposes. It is intended to obtain, by the best possible, and the only, process under the circumstances - I know .of no other way: - the information required, to enable us to deal with the whole subject. </para>

It has been suggested that the term " log-rolling " may be properly applied to this proposal. That is calculated1 to excite prejudice, but I do not think it is quite the way in which the proposal embodied in this Bill should be designated. </para>

                                always warns everybody against anything of that kind, but I appeal to the honorable and learned senator to admit that the term is not applicable to this Bill. I have stated the broad grounds on which I put this measure. The second thing which may be considered! - and it seems to me that the position is a very strong one - is the attitude of South Australia. I frankly admit that I believe that if she were asked South Australia would not pronounce in favour of the immediate construction of this line.

That has relation to communications - perfectly unauthorized, in my opinion - which passed from Ministers in South Australia at the time the Constitution was undergoing the process of discussion and approval by referendum, and when Western Australia was considering what course she should take. I wish honorable senators to dissociate their minds from the question of construction which was then under discussion, and to view this proposal on its merits. This is a Bill to acquire data and information, which, I believe, everybody desires to obtain, in order to be enabled to arrive at a sound conclusion. There was a report, presented by a Board consisting of engineers from New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia,' presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> Deane. That report which has been printed, shows exactly what I have already submitted as the view of everybody who has considered the subject. The engineers did the best they could, but said - </para>

                            <para>- The object of the Bill is to obtain that data completely and authoritatively, to satisfy, amongst others, South Australia, which is what I might call a party opposed to the construction of the line at the present time. It is also to satisfy those experts whose advice may assist Parliament to determine whether or not the line ought to be constructed. At any rate, the extract which I have read substantiates what I have said as to the necessity to satisfy not merely laymen, and for !the matter of that, we in the Federal Parliament - not merely to satisfy the ordinary mind, but the expert mind - as to the need and the feasibility of constructing the line at a fair and reasonable cost, having regard to the possibilities of traffic and so forth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> said that nothing had been done in regard to obtaining data, but, with great respect, I must say that the honorable and learned senator is mistaken. Western Australia has been doing a good deal towards obtaining information. For instance, there is a report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> C. Castilla on boring operations for water along the proposed route. In addition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Muir, reported . at the cost of the Western Austra- . lian Government, to the engineer of that State, as to a preliminary examination of the country between Kalgoorlie and Eucla. . It will be seen that Western Australia has not been idle in seeking, as far as possible, to supply data; but it is quite impossible for that State to go over the 625 miles in: South Australia, in order to make a survey which, in my belief, even with the views I hold with regard to the construction of] the line, is absolutely essential, in order, to supply necessary information. I frankly admit that under many conditions there is not ordinarily a detailed survey on which; tenders can be called, until it has been determined to construct a line. But this is, an exceptional case in regard to which Parliament cannot determine to construct the line without having the fullest possible information. ; </para>

                            <para>- After the fullest inquiry, the estimate of £20,000 was arrived at, and it has been confirmed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> of New South Wales, an expert of eminence, who was chairman of the Board of experts, to which I have already referred, and who regards that as a fair sum to cover the cost. Honorable senators seem to think that this proposal is somewhat sudden, and that it has not been tinder the consideration of those who have had the interests, if I may say so, of the Commonwealth in their hands. The proposal was initiated, and has been proceeded with in Parliament by three Governments. In the first place, on the 20th April, 1904, the Deakin Government introduced a proposal in the House of Representatives for a survey to be made. The Watson Government came into power on the 27th April, 1904, and on the 9th June, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor,</inline> the then Minister of Home Affairs, proceeded with the proposal as part of the Government policy. When the present Government came into power on the 18th August, this year, this Survey Bill took its place as part of their policy, and was included in the statement made in both Houses. The debate on the subject was resumed first in Committee in another place, and the appropriation message was carried by. a large majority of something like 27 or 28. The Bill was then introduced, and the second reading was carried by a majority of, I think; 22. Of course, events in another place do not at all bind the Senate, and I do not mention these facts with a view to in any way overbear any honorable senator's judgment, but merely 'as worthy of consideration. On two occasions the proposal, has been adopted by large majorities in another place. </para>

But we are here representing the people of Australia, and surely we ought to give some consideration' to their opinion, as voiced in Parliament." Although we are not bound by what has happened elsewhere, we are not altogether to ignore the views of successive Ministries, or the views of the more numerous branch of the Legislature, which has quite lately come back, as a whole, from the constituencies. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator may be able to show that that is so ; but I take a different view. There is not room for any detailed debate, and on the grounds I have mentioned I very confidently submit the Bill for the acceptance of the House. I appeal to honorable senators to assist in obtaining an early vote on the second reading. I believe that the passage of the Bill, without committing honorable senators to the construction of this great work now, or at any time, will serve the purpose of supplying adequate information which will enable this or some later Parliament to deal with the matter. In addition, I believe that even this small instalment will serve to cultivate and maintain the federal and friendly spirit which ought to prevail between east and west - that it will at least be an indication - I shall not use the word "symbol," to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> objects-- </para>

                        <para>- There is one thing upon which we can all agree, and that is that this is not a party question. We are told that it is a Federal question. There are three groups of persons who think over this projected survey and line. The first group are represented mainly by the senators from Western Australia, who will have the railway made at all hazards. The second group objects to the Commonwealth being launched upon a career of borrowing £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 to construct a railway across what is practically a desert. </para>

The third group, to which I find the Attorney-General belongs, regard the railway on its merits, and to that group mainly I shall address my remarks. But here let me say that the Attorney-General takes up an extraordinary position. He is willing to spend money on a survey for a railway to which he objects. </para>

                            <para>- The survey could be carried out five years hence as well as now. The honorable and learned senator tells us that it is going to be an accurate survey, from which a contractor could form an estimate, and that it can be done for £2 0,000. I do not care two straws who the man is who says that it can be done for that amount. I shall pledge my seat that it will cost nearer £50,000 if it is done in such a way that I could frame an estimate as a railway contractor. I have heard it said that it will cost £100,000, but the principle is just the same whether the cost be £20,000, or £50,000, or £100,000, or only £1,000. I object to the money of the Commonwealth being spent on it under any circumstances. I cannot help congratulating the Western Australian political engineers who are running this particular job. </para>

                            <para>- I did not see it in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and I am not accusing the representatives of Western Australia of trying to perpetrate a. job. If my honorable friend had been a railway man as long as I have, he would know that the expression is used every day on the railways all over the world. I propose to show how very clever Western Australians have been. To South Australia, through whose territory the railway will run for a distance of 625 miles, they hold out the bait of an offer to indemnify that State against any loss for the first ten years. If it be a proper thing to do, why offer a bait or a bribe to a sister State? In that case, does it not look as though two of the partners were to enter into a compact to fleece the other four? What would be thought if half-a-dozen senators went into a speculation, and I proposed to you, sir, that we two should feather our nests at their expense? I should consider that that was not a very straightforward proposal on my part. If this is a fair and proper thing, to do, why offer any inducement to South Australia? Why not offer to pay the whole of the loss for the first ten years to Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales, and Queensland as well as South Australia? The next step was to induce the Deakin Government to ask that the Engineer-in-Chief of each State might report. This places no legal obligation on the part of those States to carry out the work, but to some extent it did commit the States, in my opinion, when they allowed their Engineers-in-Chief to go and report on this proposal. The third step towards the construction of this railway is the introduction of this Bill. I am not blaming, this Government in particular, Every preceding Government would have done just the same, I suppose, if it had been in office long enough. This Government is not solely to blame. I blame any Government for undertaking this work, but the present Government are no worse than others in this connexion. You, sir, are aware that Western Australia has already passed an Enabling Bill, not for this survey but for the construction of a railway. When my attention was first drawn to the measure by an honorable senator the preamble read to me like an extract from <inline font-style="italic">Fundi</inline> more than anything else. I do not know that any one ever saw the preamble of an Act of Parliament drawn after this fashion - </para>

                    <para class="block">Surely the people of Western Australia have as much freedom by land and sea as have the people of Northern Queensland or Tasmania? They enjoy the best position, because Fremantle is the first, as well as the last, port of call for all the big vessels which trade between Europe and Australia. Let me show Western Australia's idea of freedom of trade by land and by sea, and the reason I take this course is that she is appealing to the sympathy of the other States. If that sort of language had not been inserted in the preamble of an Act of Parliament, I do not know that I could have said anything. She thought so much about the Federation, in the first place, that she refused to join the other States unless they allowed her to collect import duties on Inter-State goods for a period of five years. In spite of the spirit, if not the letter of the Constitution, Western Australia has managed to get special consideration for herself in a Navigation Bill, if I recollect rightly. That is freedom of trade by sea, so far as she is concerned. What is freedom of trade by land as viewed through the spectacles of free-trade Western Australia? Not only does she impose an import duty on the goods coming from other States, but she imposes a prohibitive Tariff on her railways as against those goods. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> quite expected that this matter would be introduced. </para>

                            <para>- It has, because Western Australia is appealing to our sympathy. She wishes us to build the railway, and she says that she is going to work it and control it, and perhaps carry goods from other States at the same rates as local goods. Was not the honorable and learned senator very pathetic and almost eloquent just now on the constitutional question? He desired to see this closer intercourse between the States. I propose to show how Western Australia regards this closer intercourse by quoting the railway freights on Inter-State goods from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie. Hop beer, made in the State is charged £5 os. iod., while hop beer from other States is charged <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> 12s. 6d., or an increase of 30 per cent. Local coal is carried for 17s. 2d. per ton, but Newcastle is charged <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 14s. 3d., or 100 per cent. more. Local butter is charged <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 10s. 2d., but imported butter is charged <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> 10s. nd., or an increase of 121 per cent. It is said that the railway is required in order that they may be able to send food more cheaply to the poor people on the gold-fields. The best way to reduce the cost of food is to charge the imported article the same rate as the local article. As regards fruit and vegetables, dried and preserved in tins, the local article is charged <inline font-style="italic">£z</inline> 5s. 7d., while the imported article is charged £$ os. nd., or an increase of 121 per cent. On imported dripping, vinegar, lard, and cheese, the freight is 121 per cent, more, while on jam it is 190 per cent, more than on the local product. Imported dairy produce, not otherwise specified, is charged 121 per cent, more than the local article. Imported marmalade and tomato sauce are charged 190 per cent, more than the local articles. Imported wine is charged 226 per cent, more than the local wine. No less than 279 per cent, more is charged for the carriage of imported hardwood - blue gum from Tasmania and ironbark from New South Wales - than is charged for the carriage of the local products. I thought it would be well to mention these facts in order to show Western Australia's idea of freedom of trade by land. </para>

An appeal is made in its preamble to the sympathies of the other States. The Attorney-General fought shy of this aspect of the matter. The Western Australians would lead us 'to believe that they have been very badly treated. In fact, in their own Act of Parliament they practically say that a promise was made to induce them to join the Federation. The Act says - </para>

The impression conveyed both by the preamble of the Western Australian Act, and also by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James'</inline> statement, is that a promise was made, not by one State, but by the whole of the States. But in his pamphlet, published last July, the then Premier of Western Australia said - </para>

                            <para>- Western Australia pledged herself to join the Federation, and the one condition that was laid down, so far as her public men could pledge her, was that New South Wales should become a member of the Union. Nothing about the railway was said. It is rather curious that Western Australia now turns round, and absolutely accuses South Australia of having broken a- promise. I intend to show that South Australia did nothing of the kind, and that if there was a compact between the Premiers of the two States it is Western Australia herself that has broken it, and that South. Australia has never departed -from, it from that day to this. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> says in his pamphlet - </para>

                    <para>South Australia had stipulated, as a Dew condition, that the line should be constructed on the 3ft. 6in. gauge. </para>
                    <para>That statement is made in his pamphlet, published only last July. But that was not a new condition. The condition was understood at the time these negotiations were carried on between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holder</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, that the gauge should be 3ft. 6in. That did not satisfy <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James,</inline> however, for the reason that in the early part of 1901 his own engineer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor,</inline> recommended that there should be a 4ft. 8½in. gauge. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, James</inline> writes - </para>
                    <para>Seeing that the adoption of the 4ft. 8£in. gauge as the standard for all Australia is, in all likelihood inevitable, the State will Before long find it necessary to convert its trunk lines to that width. </para>
                    <para class="block">That refers to the line from Kalgoorlie to Perth. Before proceeding further, I think I may fairly call attention to the small attendance. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.']</inline> On the 18th May last Premier James telegraphed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> then Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, as follows: - </para>
                    <para>On condition that the Commonwealth is allowed a free hand as to route and gauge of line this State will be prepared, for ten years after line is constructed, to bear a share of any loss in excess of our contribution on a population basis. </para>
                    <para class="block">That shows that what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> wanted was to substitute a 4ft. 8½in. gauge for a 3ft.. 6in. gauge. The gauge was never mentioned during the negotiations between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holder</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holder</inline> was quite warranted in believing that the gauge would be 3ft. 6 in. for this reason: The Western Australian gauge was 3ft. 6in. The gauge of the railway from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie, 387 miles, was 3ft. 6in. The gauge of the railway from Port Augusta to Terowie, 119 miles, was 3ft. 6in. The gauge of the Petersburg to Cockburn railway, 145 miles, was 3ft. 6in. The gauge of the railway from Quorn to Oodnadatta, 454 miles, was 3ft. 6in. Altogether, including the transcontinental line, when that is completed, right through from Port Darwin, as far south as Terowie, South Australia would have connected with Port Augusta, a little over 2,000 miles of railway with a 3ft. 6in. gauge, which was also the gauge of the Western Australian railway, 387 miles, at. the end of what will eventually be- though not in my day - a railway between South Australia and Western Australia. Another fact which has to be borne in mind is that at the time of the negotiations between Mr.' Holder and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest,, the estimate was that the railway would cost ,£2,500,000. That is now raised to £5,600,000. Therefore South Australia has not broken any arrangement made. If any compact at all was made Western Australia has broken it. </para>

                            <para>- When South Australia has her railway complete across the continent, there will be over 2,000 miles of 3ft. 6in. gauge connected with Port Augusta. There was not a word said about a gauge of 4ft. 8½in. when these arrangements were being made between the South Australian and Western Australian Premiers. My contention is, therefore - and- 1 think I have shown reasons for it- that it was understood that the gauge would be 3ft. 6in., and that South Australia would have the right to determine the route of the line through her own territory. I think that was only a reasonable thing. Without committing it to black and white, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holder</inline> assumed that, as the railways in that part of the world were built on the 3ft. 6in. gauge, this railway would be constructed on the same gauge. Honorable senators will understand why I read put the freight charges of the Western Australian railways, when I read what appears to me to be almost a bribe offered by Western Australia to South Australia. I have here a letter which was written on the 18th February of last year. I do not know whether the Premier of Western Australia ever intended that it should see daylight, but it is addressed by that honorable gentleman to the Premier of South Australia, and contains this passage; - </para>

                    <para>To South Australia we offer an opportunity of controlling- with us the only line which leads direct to the richest markets in Australia, our Eastern Gold-fields. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is to say, these two States are to combine to get possession of this railway. I think that is pretty cool. In effect " We offer this to South- Australia as a bribe to join us.", I recollect that this Senate strongly objected to the . States having ' anything to do with the construction of -our public works. That was the reason we originated a Commonwealth Public Works Department. It was alleged that Commonwealth public works carried out by States -officials cost a great deal more than they ought. I am not going into that question, but Western Australia proposes to work this railway, as I understand it, and to work the taxpayers of the Commonwealth at the same time. Can honorable senators imagine the taxpayers of the Commonwealth giving this railway into the hands of Western Australia and South Australia, when between them they will pay 15 per cent, of the deficit, while the other 85 ger cent, will have to be paid by people who would have no control of the line if this suggestion were carried out. Would not this be a beautiful haven of refuge for all . the incompetent hangers-on of the public men of Western Australia and South Australia, if we were to permit this sort of thing to take place. If we do not intend to allow these two States, or either of them, to work this railway after it is constructed, we must organize a Railway Department of our own. We must create a seventh Railway Department to work 1,100 miles of railway, upon which there will not be a single dwelling from one end to the other. This is a practical question, which was not touched upon by the leader of the Government in the Senate. It should not require the possession of much practical knowledge to enable any one to understand that to work a railway of that kind must involve an enormous cost, comparatively. The reason why the railways of Queensland are the worst paying railways in the Commonwealth is because they form a number of little disconnected railway systems. </para>

                            <para>- The criticism may not be on a very high plane. The Senate is composed of all sorts and conditions of men. We shall, no doubt; have the theory and sentiment from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> by-and-by, whilst I am putting before -honorable senators the facts which-, after all, -give a better indication . of what we shall have to pay in the long run-. In the circumstances I have indicated, for the management of this 1,100 miles of railway we should have to establish special workshops, as it is proposed that, this shall be a 4ft. <inline font-style="italic">i\m.</inline> line. We must have a special traffic manager, special engineers, and machinery provided in the workshops, which would be sufficient to meet the requirements of 11,000 miles of railway. It is clear that this line could not be worked at any reasonable rate; Four years ago . <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, when Premier of Western Australia, introduced a Bill for the construction of a line from Coolgardie down to Norseman, half-way to Esperance Bay. Some honorable members of the State Parliament of Western .Australia desired that the railway should start from Esperance Bay, and work inland 120 miles to Norseman, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest's main objection to that railway was that it would be isolated from the rest of the Western Australian system, and would, therefore, be most costly to work. Yet here we are asked bv the right honorable gentleman to construct a railway 4I 00 miles in length, which some one must work. We must either hand it over to Western Australia and South Australia, or create a seventh Railway Department in Australia' to work 1,100 miles of railway, and run about a train a day - three trains each way every week - and the chances are that the traffic would not be anything like so great. Of course; this is a very fine thing for Western Australia. Same millions of other people's money would be spent within her territory, and the line would act as a feeder to the State railways. We can very well understand that Western Australia would like to have this railway built, seeing that she would have to pay only  s§  per cent, of the cost, whilst that would also represent her share on a population basis of the annual loss which must inevitably follow. The question was raised whilst the Attorney-General was speaking as to whether the proposed survey may be considered as part of the railway. According to my view, as a railway man, such a survey as that which has been described by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> - a complete and accurate survey with plans and specifications - is as much a part of the railway as is the permanent way. If we once commence this survey, according to my view, we shall be committed to the construction of the railway. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, and, unfortunately, a great deal too much money has been wasted in that way in the Commonwealth. Victoria has wasted £250,000 in that way. The expenditure on this survey1 will probably be another waste of money if it ever takes place. If this proposal is such a good, thing as we are told it is, why does not Western Australia pay for this survey herself, if it is only a matter of £20,000? </para>

With respect to the breaking of promises, I say hat if a promise has been broken, it has lot been by South Australia, but by Western Australia. Another point which was lot referred to by the Attorney-General is hat no expert has yet recommended the instruction of this line, and those who lave been asked to do so would not say whether they would recommend it or not. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor,</inline> the very able Engi- neering Chief of the Western Australian railways, declined to offer any such advice. </para>

                            <para>- It cannot be found that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor</inline> ever recommended the line. There have been six estimates of the cost of constructing the line, ranging from £2,500,000 to £5,090,000. I should now like to show what the different States will have to contribute if this line were constructed. The figures are as follows : - South Australia, which in the years 1901-2-3 had a deficit of £103,000, would have to contribute £468,000; Tasmania, which for two years ending 31st December, 1902, lad a deficit of £297,000, would have to contribute £226,500; New South Wales, which had a deficit for three years ending 50th June, 1903, of £347,000, would lave to contribute£1,815,000; Victoria, which had a deficit of £648,000, would have to contribute £11,548,500; Queensland, which had a deficit of £1,496,000, would have to contribute £657,500. Now we come to Western Australia, which in the three years I have mentioned, had a surplus of £108,000 ; and for the year ending June last has a surplus of £112,000, and the contribution of which would be £284,500. This wealthy State with a surplus, asks Queensland, with her huge deficit, to assist in building an Inter-State railway. If this railway is to be built with Commonwealth money, why should not the two States treat the Commonwealth in the same way. as they would treat a syndicate? Western Australia will derive the principal benefit from this line, and it would be perfectly reasonable to ask that State to hand over to the Commonwealth fifty miles of land on each side of the whole 475 miles of railway. If that were done, I should be prepared to vote for the line.. A betterment of only is. an acre on this land would represent £1,500,000, and the people who find the money ought to have the benefit of the betterment, considering that the whole of Western Australia's contribution to the construction of the railway is less than . £300,000. There is another alternative. If Western Australia had come forward and said that she could not build a railway because it was too costly ; but that she was willing to pay her proportion, on a population basis, of the cost of the Inter-State railways from Brisbane to Port Augusta, it would have been only a reasonable offer. I now want to speak of the railway as a " going concern." The estimates of the cost, as I say, of construction, range from £2,500,000 up to £5,090,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest's original estimate was £2,500,000, and his second was £3,000,000; and when speaking at the Adelaide Town Hall thirteen months ago, he . jumped to £4,000,000, on the ground, no doubt, that the gauge had been increased. The first estimate of the Board of engineers was £5,090,000, and their second £4,559,000, and finally we have the estimate of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor</inline> of nearly £5, 000,000. </para>

                            <para>- No; that will involve additional cost. When the Attorney-General was speaking, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> interjected that the cost would be about £8,000,000, and I intend to show that that is somewhere about the mark. The cost per mile in the estimates I have already quoted, range from £2,275upto £4,627, and it is interesting to compare those figures with the actual cost of a 3ft. 6in. line such as that from Palmerston to Pine Creek, which cost £7,402 per mile. The 1,100 miles of line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie would, at this rate of £7,402 per mile, on a 3ft. 6in. gauge, cost £8,142,200, and, with the standard gauge, the cost would be considerably more. The line from Hergott to Oodnadatta, which is on a 3ft. 6in. gauge, cost , £4,752 per mile, and the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta line, if constructed at the same rate, would cost £5,227,200 ; and it must be remembered that those lines to which I am now referring are in the centre of civilization, compared with the route of the proposed line. I was the first to mention a probable cost of £5,000,000 three or four years ago, at a time when we were told the line would cost £3,000,000. So far as the passenger traffic is concerned, I am ready to admit that a person travelling to Kalgoorlie from Adelaide, or to Adelaide from Kalgoorlie, could travel almost as cheaply as he does now by way of Fremantle. I do not for one moment contend that there would be a great saving by a sea route ; but there would no doubt be a slight one. As to the comparison of the cost between Fremantle and Adelaide, it will be fair to take as a base the railway line : between Sydney and Adelaide, which is about the cheapest long ride in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but a good deal is made of the expected passenger traffic. My opinion is that. people will not travel by this Inter-State line, when they, can go so much more cheaply by boat. No one who travelled between Adelaide and Fremantle, would do. so a second time, especially in the summer ; no one would make such a journey except in case of great emergency. </para>

Taking as a basis the present fares on the Sydney to Adelaide line, a person travelling first class by sea from Adelaide to Fremantle would save £3 14s. 8d., in comparison with the cost of a first-class fare on the overland journey, while, on a second-class fare, there would be a saving of £2 5s. But the Orient Steam Navigation Company carry steerage passengers between the two ports for £4, and as a second-class passenger could not be carried overland between Adelaide and Fremantle for less than £8 6s., we see here a saving of £4 6s. </para>

                            <para>- I am not saying that a good deal of the Kalgoorlie passenger traffic would not go to Adelaide by rail. And in making my calculations, I have had regard to a fact, which nobody else seems to have taken notice of. A man on the overland journey would have to pay for two sleeping berths, and about eight meals, which would mean say 36s. in addition to the fare. A fact that we ought to remember is that passengers may travel from Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart, or Adelaide to London, or <inline font-style="italic">vice versa,</inline> on the mail steamers, just as cheaply as from or to Fremantle, and that if a passenger from London lands at Fremantle he pays the same fare as the passengers who travel to Sydney. It is said that a man would leave the steamer and go overland by rail. In my opinion no second class passenger would ever go by rail except in an emergency, because he would save three or four pounds by travelling by boat. It is the second class, and not the first class passengers who make a railway pay. Second class passengers, I contend, would not have the money to enable them to travel overland by rail. They' would not travel by railway when they could travel by boat for three or four pounds less, and lose only a day and a half, or, if you like, two days. In the United Kingdom, 77 per Cent. of the money paid in passenger fares is paid by third class passengers, while the other two classes pay only 23 per cent. between them. I ask honorable senators to look at the map upon the table for a moment. A great point sought to be made by those who favor this railway is that it would facilitate the carriage of the mails. It is alleged that two days would be saved in the journey. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor</inline> said that it would take sixty-one hours to run overland, and that the contract time with the big boats is ninety-six hours, that is, a difference of a day and a half. The period of ninety-six hours was fixed many years ago, before the days of turbine steamers, which steam at the rate of twenty miles an hour. The day is not far distant when steamers will make the journey in very nearly the same time as a train.' ' For the sake of argument I . shall allow that if the mails were brought by the dotted line in the map <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> Western Australia, two days would be saved. The contract time from Adelaide- to London is thirty-one days. But if the 1,140 miles to complete the real Transcontinental Railway from Oodnadatta to Fine ' Creek were built- and it is only forty miles longer than the other - then the mails could be delivered in London <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Port Darwin, Port Arthur, and the trans-Siberian railway in twenty-three days, or in eight days less than the present contract time, while the Western Australian railway, at the very best, could make no more than two days' difference - in my opinion, npt one day. As a matter of fact, the quickest journey by steamer has been seventy-six hours, as against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor's</inline> estimate of sixty-one hours by rail. I have" allowed; that, on the Siberian railway, with a gauge of 5 feet, a train can be run at the rate of thirty miles an hour; it is too little.. There would be two days more saved. If .the Western Australian railway were constructed, the mails could never gain more than, two days, and then the trains would have to travel thirty-eight or forty miles an hour, which could not be done. I desire to say a few words now about the carriage of food-stuffs. We were told that this railway would be very useful.. - ,for .the ..conveyance of passengers, mails, and food-stuffs to the markets of the eastern gold-fields, described by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> as one of the best markets in the world. He offers to South Australia another little bribe in a letter which he wrote in February last year. He says - </para>

                        <para>I gathered a few weeks ago that we should have exported some grain this year, and next year wc must. . . . Some years ago we used to import thousands of tons of chaff. The trade was overtaken by the local supply three or four years ago. Our wheat fields, which were supposed to be bounded by Northam, are stretching eastwards towards Southern Cross, and the railways are carrying grain from places along the gold-fields line, where a comparatively short while ago people would have scorned the suggestion that anything would grow. The same class of country, with occasional breaks, continues right through to Kalgoorlie, and also north rind south of the line. ... I am not posing as a farmer nor as a judge of land, but am influenced by hard facts in connexion with the produce of grain. . . . Fruit is being grown in increasing quantities. We have not reached the export stage, which we eventually expect to attain in regard to the citrus and apples. Grapes and peaches and similar fruits we have had for years. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">In the face of those statements, surely the most fatuous could never believe for a moment that South Australia or any other State would supply meat, grain, fruit, or butter by this railway to Western Australia when constructed, and that could not be in less than five or six years. Grain could be brought from the other States, from New Zealand, or even from the Argentine, to Fremantle, and carried by rail 387 miles to Kalgoorlie more cheaply than it could be carried by ral from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. We are also told that it would be a very useful railway to carry manufactures. Does any honorable senator entertain such a stupid idea for a moment? Would it carry manufactures from the wheat-fields round Port Augusta? The manufactures would have to come from Adelaide or Victoria. Who would think of carrying manufactures by railway for a distance of 2,000 miles, when there was a boat which would carry them for a third of the money ? Those who oppose this proposal will be stigmatized as being unfederal and unpatriotic, because they object to other people's money being spent in the building of what is purely an Inter-State coastal line. My opinion is that a man is unfederal who would use Commonwealth money to build a railway which would render useless the dock which is being constructed at Port Adelaide at a cost of half a million pounds for the sake of accommodating the big liners. If this railway were built, no liner would ever call near Port Adelaide. They are now threatening to stop calling, because the mail is not given to them. If that line were made, what inducement would there be to call? If the true Transcontinental Railway, whch has cost millions, and which this line will block for a generation, were completed, the railway would run from Port Darwin to Adelaide, and thence round the coast as far as Rockhampton. The true federalist is the man who would take these matters into his consideration, and who would say to Western Australia, " If you and South Australia think proper to hand over to us a strip of country 100. miles wide for the whole length of the railway we shall not mind putting our money into the venture." Who pays the deficit? Generally it is the public servants who are called on in the first instance to do so. I recollect when <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> Victoria we had a- railway deficit of £500,000 amongst a million of people. Queensland has had three deficits of half-a-million amongst' 500,000 people - £1 per head per annum for the three years ending 30th June, 1903. A nice little deficit that is ! If we had a similar deficit in Victoria in proportion to population, it would amount to ?1,250,000. Yet while the States have these deficits staring them in the face, our friends from Western Australia, who have a big railway surplus every year, ask the people to contribute to a railway which, on the most sanguine estimate, would lead to a deficit of ?68,000 per annum, but which, in my opinion, would involve a far greater loss than that. But I am going to show that there is a greater objection to the line than any which I have yet mentioned. If the people of Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie become sufficiently influential, as they will do if the gold-fields increase in value, there will undoubtedly be constructed a line from Coolgardie to the coast at Esperance, a distance of 228 miles. </para>

                    <para>Those are strong arguments in favour of the construction of the 228 miles of rail way from Esperance to the gold-fields. I' desire to repeat that when the gold-fields become sufficiently strong, and the people of Western Australia are satisfied that they are going to continue, there is no doubt whatever that that line will be made. Naturally the people of the gold-fields will want to get to the sea by the nearest route. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, when addressing the people of Adelaide on the 10th November last year, said - </para>

                    <para class="block">That was objected to because the line did not go right through ; but <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest did not want it to go right' through, because lie knew that if the line was constructed, the traffic would go to Esperance instead of to Fremantle. I need not go into details to show, that the fares for people on the gold-fields would be very much cheaper by way of Esperance Bay to Adelaide, and from Adelaide to Coolgardie by that route, than by way of the 1,359 miles from Adelaide to Coolgardie by rail. The matter of the construction of the Esperance Bay railway attracted a good deal of attention in South Australia ; so much so that the Premier of that State only last January wrote a minute to the Commissioner of Railways, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pendleton,</inline> in which he said that he wanted to know - whether or not, in the various reports furnished in relation to the construction of a railway between Western Australia and South Australia, and the estimate given, any consideration was given to the question of the traffic being either diminished or increased in consequence of the probable construction of a line from Esperance Bay to the gold-fields. </para>

                        <para>In reply to the inquiry of the Chief Secretary, I have to say that in none of the reports or estimates made by me in connexion with the prop ;osed railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie d.d I take into consideration the possibility of a line being made from Esperance Bay to Kalgoorlie (or Coolgardie); and although it is difficult to say, with accuracy, what traffic would be drawn from the first railway if the second were made, I am of the opinion that if the Adelaide Steamship Company determined to run quick and commodious steamers between Port Adelaide and Esperance Bay, a distance of about 830 nautical miles, in connexion with a line from that! bay to the gold-fields 220 miles, quite 50 per cent, of the estimated traffic for the other line would go through Esperance. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Fifty per cent, less than the estimated traffic revenue ; and that means that the estimated deficit on the line, ?68,000, would be greatly increased - probably by £60,000 Or £70,000. I look upon the construction of the line from Coolgardie to the sea-coast at Esperance as inevitable. Indeed, that it will come no one denies. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, himself, in October, 1900, brought in a Bill for the construction of part of the line as far as Norseman. It was defeated by nineteen votes to fourteen. That line was to go to Norseman, only part of , the way. When it was urged that the railway should be carried from Esperance to Norseman only, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest said, as I mentioned a little while ago, that that was objection able, because it would form an isolated railway, and be costly to work. I have detained the Senate at some length, but I have not exhausted all the material which I had prepared. The matter is undoubtedly a very important one, but at this period of the session I can hardly expect the Senate to listen to me as carefully as I might have expected at an earlier period. I am quite aware that every one has made up his mind. If the Bill had been brought forward earlier, more attention might have been devoted to it. I am strongly of opinion that the railway ought not to be made under any circumstances, and when I think of the projected line from Coolgardie to the coast, it seems to me to be almost a crime to spend money on this Inter-State line. I should be wanting in my duty to those who sent me here if I did not oppose this scheme from every point of view. I have looked into it very carefully, and the more I consider it, the more convinced I am that no one who thoroughly understood what is proposed, and who looked at it with an unbiased eye, could possibly support it for a moment. I can readily understand the statement of the Attorney-General that he is not in favour of the construction of the railway. I can also quite believe that the more he looks into it the less he will be inclined to vote for its construction. But in the meantime I object to spending any Commonwealth money on a survey. I desire to emphasize the fact that we have not even authority from the South Australian Government to go on with the railway, even if the survey showed, that it was likely to be a paying concern. It is quite clear to my mind from what the Premier of South Australia has said, that that State will-never consent. In facty it would be the most suicidal thing South Australia could pos- . sibly do to consent to have this railway built, even if it did not cost her a shilling, and even if she had not to make good any part of the inevitable annual deficit. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware that the whole question is new, so far as many honorable senators are concerned. But unfortunately it is not a question so far as concerns those organs of public opinion which, to a large extent, form the views of the people in this State. One of the great disadvantages from which this Commonwealth suffers is that public opinion on these questions is formed very largely from prejudice. I am sorry to make the statement but it is a fact that honorable senators are very largely unaware that prejudice is forming' even their opinions on many matters. I say that because I know that in regard to this question one side has been put by the press of this State day after day, and that honorable senators have read what has been written continuously during the whole ten months of our sitting here, while there is another side to the question which is never heard in this State, except on such occasions as the present when the matter is mentioned in the Federal Parliament. We are at a great disadvantage in this regard. Honorable senators from other States are cautious not to allow the 'press of this State to form their opinions for them on a question which affects their own States,- but on questions which affect States other than their own they' ate. not so much on their guard against specious arguments, and perhaps unconsciously allow their opinions, on those questions, to be formed for them by the press of this State. </para>

                            <para>- There are journals in this State which have a wonderful effect on popular opinion, and which, day after day, put forward the statement that the country this railway is to serve is a desert, and as some honorable senators have said that their minds are open on this question, I welcome the opportunity to put the other side to them. One objection to the proposed survey is that it is a work which the State of Western Australia should undertake. We are told that Western Australia should come to the Federal Parliament and say, " Here are reports as to the cost of this work and the quality of the land ; here are all the data required, and we ask you to accept these reports." What would honorable senators who are opposed to the proposal say to that ? They would say, " This is an <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement prepared by Western Australian engineers and published by the Western Australian Government." </para>

                            <para>- I ask if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is prepared to say that we should reject this Bill because the Commonwealth cannot afford to expend ,£20,000? If that is the spirit which animates the Federal Parliament in dealing with such a public work as this, and if honorable senators are prepared to contend that the 4,000,000 people comprising the population of the Commonwealth cannot afford to pay .£20,000 to secure reliable information on which a decision may be based as to whether the construction of the railway should be carried out, then I can only say that this Parliament is not fit to govern a new country like Australia, which should be governed by men who preach the gospel of hope rather than the gospel of despair, and by men who believe in the development of the interior of this country, which is as yet undeveloped, but which has magnificent possibilities, as Kalgoorlie and Broken Hill testify. We are told that this railway will not pay. That is exactly what the croakers in Western Australia told us when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest proposed his water scheme. </para>

We must be in a position to make an estimate before we can say whether this railway will pay. This Bill is a first step to enable us to estimate whether it will pay. I can understand the attitude of some honorable senators who represent Tasmania, and who contend that the Commonwealth should not take up this work at all ; but there are some honorable senators who say that if it can be shown that this line will pay, the Commonwealth should undertake its construction. </para>

I should like to ask honorable senators whether the States of South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland have ever regretted that they built the railways connecting their capitals? We know that the wealth and importance of each of the States, and of Australia as a whole, have been increased by the linking together of the States capitals by these railways. We are told again that there is no immediate necessity for the construction of this railway ; that there is plenty of time. I point out, first of all, that the survey proposed will take some time. The results of that survey must be allowed to permeate into the minds of the people of Australia. The reports must be circulated and discussed, and it will be some years before Parliament will be ready for action, even if the survey is found to be most favorable to the construction of the line. After Parliament is ready for action it will still be years before the line can be constructed; and, taking a most sanguine view, it cannot be expected that the construction of this railway will be undertaken within the next ten years. The statement has been made that this railway was not held out as an. inducement to Western Australia to join the Federation. It is true that there was no such bond entered into with respect to it as we find in the Constitution with respect to the Federal Capital. </para>

                            <para>- When the Federal Bill discussion was raging, the anti-Billites were asking the people of Western Australia what was the use of entering the Union. They were being told that Western Australia, like New Zealand, was isolated, - that each of those Colonies was five days' journey from the eastern seaboard of Australia, and that Western Australia might as well lie 'an island in the ocean as New Zealand is in the Pacific. The reply of the Federalists was that the eastern States of Australia would, as the natural effect of Federation, see the wisdom of linking the east and the west by means of a railway. </para>

                            <para>- And I beg to differ from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> on the point. I had the honour, along with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> and others, of visiting many towns in South Australia when we were conducting a campaign in support of the construction of this railway. We had large and enthusiastic meetings everywhere, and carried resolutions urging the State Parliament of South Australia to at once pass enabling legislation. At no place did we meet with a hostile reception, and at no place was there a hostile vote. But I have stronger proof still, to which I ask honorable senators from Queensland to listen. It is recognised that honorable senators from South Australia, who are elected on adult suffrage under a liberal Electoral Act, truly represent the people of that State, and, as a result of the campaign I have mentioned, arid in spite of the opposition of the powerful newspapers of Adelaide, every senator returned at the last election was pledged up to the hilt not merely to the survey, but to the ' construction of this line. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to read the telegrams exchanged by the Prime Minister and the Premier of South Australia, because they have been published in a parliamentary paper. But the Government of South Australia practically said to the Federal Government, " Before we entertain the idea of introducing an Enabling Bill, we want a guarantee that there is some possibility of the railway being built; we want to see the actual data." The Government of South Australia saw the reasonableness of asking for a survey, and they stipulated that before a Bill was introduced into the State Parliament a survey should be made. The whole position of South Australia is indicated by the fact that the people of the State are prepared, through their representatives, to vote for the construction of the railway, while the representatives in the State Parliament lay down the position that before they consent to the construction there must be a survey. So much for the contention that South Australia is opposed to this Transcontinental Railway. I now propose to show that there is a reasonable prospect of the line paying. A number of statements have been made to-night by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles;</inline> but, while I am prepared to listen to that gentleman on the question of Victorian railways, I am afraid that he knows very little of Western Australian railways. It is not fair to base arguments against the proposed transcontinental line on a knowledge of the Victorian conditions only. I can illustrate that contention by pointing to the wide difference between the cost of construction in Western Australia and other States. The chief railway in Western Australia, that from Southern Cross to Kalgoorlie, is, I suppose,' a record of cheap construction in Australia. It was built at a cost of under £1,500 per mile, and I doubt whether there is any line in Victoria which can be compared to it from that point of view. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is referring to the country near Port Augusta. Honorable senators are falling into the error of thinking that because they know one part they know the whole of Australia. They are showing prejudice when they allow themselves to judge the route of this line by some portion of Western Australia, or South Australia, which they happen .to have seen. Only two weeks ago there was a report from Western Australia of a man with his wife and little children leaving his farm in South Australia and travelling with his flocks and herds right across the continent from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, landing, them in good condition there. He lost a few horses and cattle in the district immediately surrounding Port Augusta ; but after he reached the border he did not lose a solitary head ; and his stock fattened as they travelled. He showed his belief in the character of the country by immediately applying for a grazing area of 90,000 acres, seventy miles east of Kalgoorlie, on the route of the proposed rail way, and the Government showed their belief in the country by refusing to grant his application, while the construction of the line was pending. Here is a quotation which I have taken from the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age-</inline></para>

I propose to show from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor's</inline> report that there would be some passenger traffic. Excluding the over-sea traffic, over 1,000 persons travel each week between the eastern and western States - that is 500 persons each way. The great majority of these purely Australian passengers go to the gold-fields. The great majority of the people on the gold-fields are Victorians, and strong believers in this railway. They have already to undertake a railway journey of 400 miles to get to the coast where they ' join th'e steamer. Is it reasonable to suppose that they would make,;that journey when they could get info a train at Kalgoorlie, and proceed over-land more cheaply, and more quickly, and with less discomfort ? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor</inline> says - </para>

                            <para>- I do not overlook that matter. The great bulk of the passengers on the Inter-State railways do not have sleeping accommodation. I.t is only the favoured few who are able to afford a sleeping berth. On the Melbourne to Adelaide line it will be found that the great majority of the passengers do not travel in the sleeping cars. I have now to deal with the over-sea traffic. I have seen many passengers leave the mail steamers at Adelaide to go overland by train .to Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. If this railway were constructed, many passengers by the mail boats would take the train at Fremantle, because we know that many persons, as the result of a long voyage, are glad .to go overland from the first port of call. </para>

                            <para>- I know that many passengers do land and travel overland. As to the stock trade, we have to remember that there is a very large consuming population at Coolgardie, where the people are unable to produce any foodstuff on the spot, .owing to climatic conditions. They are living in mineral country, where stock cannot be grown. Our present sources of supply are principally Queensland, North Australia, and South Australia. The present method of supply is this : Cattle are driven down from the borders of Queensland, and from North and South Australia till they strike the railway at Oodnadatta. Then they are shipped in cattle trucks to. Port Adelaide; then they are put on board ship, and taken to Fremantle ; whence they are trucked again and sent on to the goldfields, where they are slaughtered. In the case of cattle coming from eastern States, they are driven to the nearest port, or, perhaps, trucked down from "Gippsland to Melbourne, and thence shipped around to Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately, the honorable senator is not aware of the fact that while we have in the south-western part of the State, ample -agricultural and horticultural country, we have no pastoral country. We have to go to the north-western portion of the State to find pastoral country, and that is as far from the gold-fields' markets as Port Augusta itself. Cattle could only be brought from those districts by steamer, and then by rail to the gold-fields. </para>

                            <para>- We shall have dairying country in time, but we have not got it yet. Our country is heavily timbered, and, as those honorable senators who know Gippsland are aware, a generation of settlers who break their hearts in clearing the country have to die out before dairying can be started. Now, I want to deal in detail with the reports of the Engineers-in-Chief of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Their estimate of the total cost is £4,559,000. That is the final report shown on page 1269 of the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Papers</inline> for last session. In the first year- they estimated a deficiency of £68,168. Within ten years, having in view the same rate of progress as Australia has made within the last ten years, they anticipate an annual profit of £18,219. That is to say, it is anticipated that in the first year the loss to be shared by over 4,000,000 of people would be slightly over £68,000, which will diminish. I also wish to show that these engineers say that there will be a saving of two days in the delivery of the mails between the eastern and the western States. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor</inline> said that two and a half days would be saved. </para>

Further, the cost of maintenance of the present telegraph lines would be considerably reduced ; new tracts of pastoral country would be opened up; and recent discoveries of mineral country lead to the conclusion that there are rich mineral deposits in the proximity of the proposed railway. </para>

                        <para>For the first. 100 miles from Kalgoorlie we passed through a salmori-gum forest. The timber is good and plentiful, and suitable for mining purposes. It would be impossible for me to. approximate the width of this forest, but it certainly cannot be less than fifty. miles wide, and for all I know to the, contrary it may be considerably more. Interspersed through this forest are numerous flats covered with grass, as well as with salt-bush and other fodder shrubs. The soil is. of good quality, and the, growth of grass and., herbage luxuriant'. For the next 100 miles the nature of the country, varies somewhat, being composed of alternate belts of native oak, salmon-gum, and gimlet wood. Belts of spinifex and scrub are also crossed. At about 200 miles, rolling downs of limestone formation are met with covered with a luxuriant growth of grass, and occasionally a salt-bush flat. This country is lightly timbered with myaporum, and presents a beautiful park-like appearance. Close to the coast a narrow belt of mallee runs, and further inland small belts of myall and myaporum are met with. This country is also well grassed, and salt-bush and other feed bushes are plentiful. To the north, near the 31st parallel of latitude, the country is more open. In fact, from the South Australian border for 250 miles in a westerly direction, it is one large open plain of limestone formation, fairly well grassed throughout. Taken as a whole, this stretch of country is one of the finest I have seen in Australia. </para>

                        <para>With water - which doubtless could be obtained if properly prospected for - it is admirably adapted for grazing purposes, and will, without doubt, be taken up some day from end to end. Game - kangaroos, emus, and turkeys - is fairly plentiful in the vicinity of tine rock-holes. . . At the time of our visit this tract of country must have been at its driest, as the settlers at Eyre and Eucla informed me that it was the worst season they had experienced for the last twenty years. From our observations, it was quite evident that there had been a long dry spell extending over fully twelve months, I should think Still, the grass is sound and strong, growing for the most part to a height of twelve inches. Judging from the growth of grass and other vegetation on this country, it is very evident that there must be good falls of rain over it and at regular intervals; but the ground is so porous that the rain, as soon as it falls, percolates through the limestone. </para>

                    <para>As to the geographical formation, Mr. Muir says' </para>
                    <para>The country traversed is, on the whole, flat and uninteresting. There are no hills of any magnitude, no lakes,' and very few water-courses. The height' of the proposed starting point of the railway ( Kalgoorlie) is 1,240 feet above sea level, and from there to Cardinia, some seventy miles, there is a practically gradual rise of 300 feet. This is the highest point attained, and" from there onward until the South , Australian border is reached, fifty-five miles north of Eucla, there is an almost gradual fall, amounting in the aggregate to some goo feet. The. most irregular formation of the country occurs between the commencing point and the Goddard's Creek, consisting of low diorite and ironstone ridges; with outcrops of granite sandstone, and quartz. This portion of the country is distinctively auriferous, and quartz outcrops show in many places. </para>
                    <para class="block">I may mention that the Western Australian Government spent £1,100 on the survey. There is another important aspect of the matter that has not been touched upon by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> and the Attorney-General. That is the question of defence. I venture to say that this railway, from the point of view of defence alone, is well worthy of the consideration of the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Major -</inline> General Bevan Edwards has reported that for the efficiency of the defence of Australia, this railway is absolutely necessary. </para>

                        <para>A very erroneous impression seems to prevail regarding this country. From conversations 1 have had with really well informed people since my return, I gather that it is supposed to be a barren, inhospitable sand waste. Quite the contrary is the case. There is very little sand comparatively. Just along the sea coast at Eyre Patch there is a narrow range of sand hills, about three miles wide on the low land plain, midway between the cliffs and the sea, but it ceases about 60 miles from Eyre Patch. </para>
                        <para>I fancy the unfavorable impression must have been taken from Eyre's work. He hugged the sea coast the whole way, and saw nothing of the back country, and his most serious disaster, the murder of his mate by natives, occurred at the place since named after him. </para>
                        <para>These plains, upland and lowland, are dotted with blowholes. They are a very peculiar feature, acting as vents and drains. They emit a roaring noise, and blow in or out according to the wind. After heavy rains I have seen considerable streams running into them. This explains why there is, despite of fair rainfalls, little surface water or streams in the country. </para>

                    <para class="block">I ask honorable senators to weigh these facts. They are not theories. They are not the statements of newspaper editors, who have "imagined vain things" for political purposes. They are facts, compiled by men who have been over this country, whose life's occupation it has been to construct railways, and prepare plans and estimates for the guidance of Government and Parliament. Many of these men have had a life-long experience of Australian conditions, and of the construction of railways in all the States. They have come together, and have given valuable information and estimates as to the cost of the construction of this line. I have submitted' facts also from men who have a knowledge of survey work under Australian conditions. They know the nature of this country, and they stake- their reputation on the opinion they give as to the quality of the land which this railway will serve. I have submitted facts from the reports of boring parties who have struck good sound water in what has been described as a waterless country, on the route of this railway, and at one place water suitable for human consumption. They have proved that this country can be used for pastoral purposes. I ask whether, in view of these facts, honorable senators are prepared to remove the isolation from which Western Australia suffers. Is the Senate prepared to make Federation a real thing for Western Australia? Without this railway, Federation is a delusion and a sham for that State. </para>
                    <para class="block">It means nothing to Western Australia without this railway. Victoria has reaped a golden harvest from Federation. In three years, as the result of Inter-State free-trade, brought about by Federation, the value of the exports of this State to other States of the Commonwealth has increased by £2,000,000 sterling. The State of Tasmania, when the fiscal barriers were thrown down, and owing to the existence of a drought in all the other States, with the exception of Victoria, also reaped a golden harvest as the result of Federation. </para>

                            <para>- If it had not been that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> and those who think with him, raised the miserable Kyabram cry of economy, we should now have had an Inter-State Commission, which would have prevented differential rates not merely in Western Australia, but in every State of the Commonwealth. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> quotes the differential rates charged in Western Australia, can I not claim that the same miserable, pettifogging policy has always animated the railway management of every State in Australia? Have we not witnessed Victoria, by her railway rates, endeavouring to rob South Australian railways of the traffic which rightly belonged to them ? Have we not witnessed New South Wales endeavouring to rob Victoria of the traffic rightly belonging to that State? Western Australia has only followed the silly, suicidal example of the other States of the Commonwealth in this regard. I repeat that if it had not been that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> and those who think with him, raised the Kyabram cry of economy, and prevented the establishment of the Inter-State Commission, differential rates would exist no longer. It is my desire to destroy provincialism, whether 'it exists in connexion with railway management or in the minds of honorable senators, who say that because this railway will not benefit their particular corner of Australia they will have none of it. They say, " Because our State will reap no direct benefit from this undertaking we shall have none of it." Is that going to be the test on public questions in this national Parliament? Are we to deal with questions in this national Parliament from the point of view of the benefit which will be derived by the particular States which we represent? I warn honorable senators that if this is the spirit in which they propose to deal with this proposal it will only bring about reprisals. If the people of one State are going to use the national Parliament to block the aspirations and desires of the people of another, such action must result in reprisals. </para>

                            <para>- It is absolutely correct. A leading journal in Melbourne describes this as a proposal for a desert railway, and is prepared to impute all sorts of improper motives to the representatives of Western Australia. And when I see a newspaper so stoop, in order to defeat this proposal- by influencing public opinion, I feel every justification for saying that those organs cannot see beyond the smoke of Melbourne. I do hope and expect that in this National Parliament, we shall get a broader and more national view of those questions, and that members will not allow their opinion to be obscured by the press. I have lived in Melbourne for four years, and during the whole of that time, I have been subject to a torrent of misrepresentation from the two journals of Melbourne on this question. The people of Western Australia have been time after time, through their representatives, insulted by those newspapers, and I take this opportunity to make known my opinion of them. The House of Representatives has, at any rat* set an example which honorable senators might well follow. In that House, the State of Western Australia has a very small representation as compared with the representation of Victoria and New South Wales, and I am well pleased to recognise that the representatives of the mother State set a good example, a large majority of them voting in favour of this proposal to obtain information. We do not ask Parliament to commit itself to the construction of the line. Are honorable senators afraid of inquiry? Are they afraid to give an opportunity to prove that there is justification for this railway? If honorable senators are not afraid of such a result, let them vote for the survey. What will the Bill mean in a pecuniary sense to Tasmania? The £20,000 will be spread over 4,000,000 of people, so that the proportion to be paid by the 180,000 inhabitants of Tasmania will amount to £800. </para>

Are the Tasmanian people prepared, for the sake of a beggarly £800, to show themselves so parochial as to refuse to allow a question of this kind to become national ? I hope for better things in the Senate. I believe there will be a majority willing to give Western Australia all that is asked, namely, a full inquiry.

However much we <inline font-style="italic">may differ from</inline> that honorable senator, no one can accuse him of want of earnestness. He has put the case from his point of view ' in a very clear and convincing fashion. But we have to deal with actual facts and not with conjecture ; and we ought to take advantage of the experience which has been gained in the older and more populous States. It is idle to tell us that a certain man has travelled over - a portion of the proposed route, and has said that in his judgment a line may be constructed for a certain sum of money. As an old railway man, who has surveyed hundreds of miles of line in this country, I can say, without exaggeration, that the cost- of the proposed railway is terribly under-estimated. </para>

                            <para>- It is proposed, at most, to have what engineers call a flying survey ; that is a survey which means merely looking over the leading features of the country without regard to full details, and an expression of opinion - that is, the surveyor thinks - that a railway can be made for a certain sum of money. We have heard glowing accounts of what can be done on the proposed InterState line in the way of carriage of stock, and also in the way of the cultivation of adjoining land, and the conservation of water. But a glance at the Western Australian map shows that in some places the rainfall is only 6 inches per annum, and that even on the coast range it does not exceed 19 or 20 inches. Where will it be possible to get the water for the purposes of this railway? I lived in Riverina for many years, and built large reservoirs there ; and with a rainfall of 15 or 16 inches, the water lost, by evaporation during the summer time amounted to 1 inch per day. How much would be lost in reservoirs on the ;arid plains of Western Australia? The duration of a supply of water would be measured by days and nothing would be left but mud, unless a constant supply were "secured from some other source than the rainfall. As a matter of fact, those, who are advocating the scheme, at the same time condemn it. A pamphlet published by the authority of the Western Australian Government, containing a report prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Gwynneth, who, amongst other qualifications, is an associate member of the Institute of Civil Engineers in London, :is therein stated to have had " considerable experience in railway construction and "management in New South. Wales, Victoria, and Queensland," and to hold " the highest credentials from those ' with whom he has been associated in professional work." From the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gwynneth</inline> it would appear that there is not the slightest chance of the line paying. Even supposing we do' not pay much attention to the reports of experts who have not been over the' country, we must regulate our judgment by the experience gained in countries where there has been extensive railway construction. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> appeared horrified when some honorable senators intimated that there are large areas of drifting sand and other difficulties to be encountered in constructing a railway along the route proposed. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .Gwynneth</inline> recommends that the line, if constructed, should not follow the direct route which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest and others recommend, but should be taken to the south, and kept a moderately short distance from the coast. One advantage of this suggestion which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 'Gwynneth</inline> points out is that a railway at or near Eucla would give facilities; for loading and unloading metals and sleepers, which could be taken inland and on to the railway works. Mr: Gwynneth points out that the route he suggests would go over better land, with a larger rainfall, whereas the. direct route is through a desert of sand. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gwynneth</inline> says that the northern route, for a distance of about 108 miles, would pass through "high drifting sand hills," as described in the reports of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. A.</inline> B. Moncrieff, Engineer-in-Chief of South Australia, and. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> B. Stewart, the Inspecting Surveyor .of that State. That evidence does not bear out the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> .but goes to show that, instead of splendid agricultural country, there is nothing but drifting sand .hills. Do honorable .senators, who talk about the carriage of stock, know anything about the question ? After a journey of i,x 00 miles over a desert railway tract, half of the cattle would arrive nearly dead, while the other half would be in such a state of fever that they would have to be turned into paddocks before they would-be fit for consumption. As to the water supply, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> pointed out that one or two bores have, been put down along the- route, and there is no doubt that this railway will have to depend on an artificial system, of : supply.' There are no rivers on this line, and no means of conserving water; and the'-latter -would be. a very difficult matter- with only a few inches of rainfall. </para>

                            <para>- That fact is shown by the formation of the country. Western Australia is a comparatively low, desert country, with large sand plains, where the water, if it percolates, must be impregnated very largely with minerals. In Queensland, on the other hand, the water, which falls on high tablelands, as, at all events, of a good quality, such as cannot be found on the country between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. On this overland railway, in addition to the 625 miles of railway in South Australia, and the 470 miles in Western Australia, there would have to be reconstructed and relaid 225 miles of line between Adelaide and Port Augusta, and several hundred miles between Perth and Kalgoorlie. On the South Australian railway a portion of the line has a gauge of 5ft. 3m., while further on the gauge is 3ft. 6in. I should like to know how overland passengers will be able to proceed with despatch over a railway with several breaks of gauge. A man leaving Melbourne would commence his journey on a gauge of 5ft. 3in., but after he had passed through Adelaide he would get on to a 3ft. 6in. gauge. I also remind members of the Senate that to make a line capable of carrying heavy traffic at a high rate of speed it would have to be wholly relaid and re-metalled, at a huge expense. The lines between Melbourne and Bendigo and Melbourne and Ballarat are first-class lines, but, after forty years of working, trains now only travel at a speed of thirty miles an hour. It is, therefore, ridiculous to expect that trains could be run on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta line at anything like that speed. Furthermore, I venture to express the opinion that, instead of the line costing £4,000,000, which is the estimate, it will probably, cost more nearly £10,000,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gwynneth,</inline> quoting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> C. Stewart, one of the inspecting surveyors of railways in South Australia, says that, in- addition to the heavy work, it will be necessary to provide 70,000 cubic yards of soil to prevent the cuttings and banks on the railway from being blown- away and drifting with the action of the wind. A nice agricultural country that ! In the Riverina district of New South Wales during the late drought drifting sand was blown and piled up against the fences so as to cover them up for distances of hundreds of miles, and now it is possible to drive over them without obstruction. Similarly in Western Australia, after a time of hot winds, it will be necessary to uncover and dig out this railway. Yet some honorable members have spoken as though persons are anxious to travel on this railway, and stock-owners are agitating to send their cattle by it. If a man comes -to me and says, " I have a good thing," I ask him, "Are you prepared to invest your money in it to prove your <inline font-style="italic">bona fides V</inline> Similarly, we might expect the people of Western Australia to say, " The prospects of this line are excellent, and we are prepared to back our opinion by voting a sum of money for its construction." What they are doing, however, is trying to impose upon their poorer neighbours. What interest have Tasmania or Queensland in this work that they should be asked to pay a portion of its cost? The expenditure of £20,000 on a- survey would hardly give information worthy of the slightest consideration. I hope that honorable senators will not be led away by sentiment, or the desire to avoid hurting the feelings of the representatives of Western Australia, into voting for a proposal which, in my opinion, is a delusion and a snare. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not speak very long. If the Bill is to be carried in opposition to my wishes, I shall accept my defeat with a good grace ; but I would not dare to give a vote on the second reading without expressing my opinions in regard to the proposal. If I could conscientiously vote for the second reading, I would do so with great pleasure, but my judgment tells me that I should not be right in doing so. £20,000 is not a very large sum, but, as an old and experienced contractor, who for thirty years of his life was engaged in enterprises of this character, I say that the survey could not be carried out for anything like that amount. I do not know that it could be made for £40,000. But this is not the time, when the States, and more especially Queensland, are suffering from extreme financial depression, to squander or throw away money. I was one of a firm of three who built the line from Port Augusta to Farina, a distance of 200 miles. The country through which that railway goes is very superior to that which would be traversed by the proposed line, being good pastoral country, whereas the bulk qf that through which the proposed line would pass is a desert, unoccupied by man or beast, notwithstanding the many years which have elapsed since white men settled in Australia. There is no part of Queensland, with the exception of barren ranges, such as the Croyden Ranges, and scrub country, which cannot be occupied except at great cost, which is not being used by squatters. </para>

                            <para>- I lost £30,000 in hard cash by the droughts in Queensland, but I say that, as a general rule, the rainfall in Queensland for the last thirty years has been good. The fact that the country through which the proposed line would pass is unoccupied is positive proof that it is a mere desert. Even when we were building the line from Port Augusta to Farina, the men were instructed to leave their barrows standing on end, and the bullock yokes were stuck up in the same way, to prevent them from being' covered by sand before the morning. What is the use of forcing this proposal through the Federal Parliament ? It is not by doing wrong things that the Federation will make headway, but by encouraging what is reasonable and proper. The line which it was proposed to construct from Port Augusta to the Northern Territory would have been a thousand times better than that which is now contemplated, because a considerable area of the country along the former route is fairly habitable. If water were obtained by putting down bores along the line proposed to connect Kalgoorlie with Port Augusta., the chances are that it would be unfit for either stock or use in locomotives. Moreover, high-pressure engines would be required to bring it to the surface. </para>

                            <para>- No ; but in order to reach the artesian water and bring it to the surface free from contact with the brackish water, which flows in from the intervening levels, pipes have to be sunk, and have to be proof against any intrusion of the brackish water, or otherwise the whole supply will be spoilt. The brackish water flows in between the artesian" springs and the surface. In 1883 I engaged the first man who put down an artesian bore in Australia. I know that Queensland is full of fresh water, and that if the bores are put down sufficiently deep good supplies can be obtained. If, however, the bores are not very deep, and the water does not rise to the surface, it is brackish and is not fit for stock. </para>

                            <para>- At Thurlgoona I put down two or three bores to a depth' of 400 feet, and the water obtained would have poisoned a native cat. The construction of a railway _ for 1,100 miles through country which does not yield water fit for use in locomotives would be an undertaking of the greatest magnitude, presenting difficulties of which no one could conceive except those who have engaged in similar enterprises. A continuous service of trains would be required to carry water beyond the first fifty miles from the termini, and unless sidings were put down at every few miles, a double line of rails would have to be laid down. I speak with the knowledge of one who has been engaged in railway construction for thirty-five years, and I am sure that if a competent railway engineer, able to offer an unprejudiced opinion, were engaged to report upon the proposal, he would fully bear me out. </para>

                            <para>- The credit of Australia has not yet been quite exhausted, but if we were to carry out any such wild schemes as that now proposed, we should further injure our already damaged credit. There are plenty of .opportunities for the profitable employment of capital in this great country, and we should not do anything that would 'have the effect of interfering with legitimate enterprises. If we constructed this railway we should be handicapping the people of Australia to a very serious extent. I declare, upon my honour, as a railway contractor who has some knowledge of the difficulties of construction, and as a squatter with some knowledge of country, that Hie proposed railway would not pay for the grease used on the wheels of the rolling-stock. </para>

If the country is so barren that it will not grow sufficient timber to supply fuel for the locomotives, what can we expect? In almost every country there is timber growing. But in this country the rainfall is so slight that timber will not grow. Would any sane contractor import coal for his locomotives to burn while he was constructing the railway if he could get wood along the route ? It would cost five times the money if he had to use coal for his locomotives. </para>

                            <para>- The interjection is very silly,, because while I have chartered many ships, I have never had an interest in a ship in my life. It would not interfere with the steam-ship companies if there were half-a-dozen railways to Kalgoorlie. I went to the library a little while ago to get the work written by my good friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, on the exploration of this territory. The book has been lent, and therefore I cannot quote some exploration notes, which, I may mention, are very much opposed to this proposal. It is sometimes said that there was an understanding that this line should be constructed. .1 was a member of the Convention which framed the Constitution. I spoke at many meetings during the Federal campaign, and opposed this proposal from the beginning. When the press of Australia knew little about the country, I spoke against the project. </para>

                            <para>- Many things are said which are not true. The Commonwealth is not bound to spend money, even on a survey, but if any money is spent for that purpose it will bind us to go a step further. I should like a high official who is not under any obligation, except to state the truth, to make a report, without going over the country. It is an undertaking to go over the route. </para>

                            <para>- In that case, why does not Western Australia, which is a wealthy State, bring up. a report, and settle the controversy? It is absurd to compare this transcontinental line with any Inter-State railway, because in each case the latter was built through country which was occupied, and consequently there was no difficulty about its construction, nor was there any water competition. No railway in the world can compete with water competition. At the present moment we have been carting wool right from the head of the Darling down the whole length of that river up to Echuca, on the Murray - hundreds of miles - because 300 or 400 miles by rail would cost three times as much. Water communication can run rings round railway communication anywhere. If this railway would benefit Australia, or even if it would benefit Western Australia, I would vote for it. I know that there are parts of Western Australia that are suitable for agriculture, and I believe that the time will come when that State will export, instead of importing. But the country which would be traversed by this railway will not be brought under cultivation, if only on account of the absence of rain. There is not a stream or a water-course for hundreds of miles. There is no sign of a stream marked on any map. </para>

I should be only too glad if the land could be made valuable. I have invested money in Western Australia myself, and have lost it. I have been cured of that sort of thing, and I do not wish to rush the Commonwealth into dangerous speculations. We have had our troubles, and we ought to go slow and sure for a , time. When the drought is all over, five years hence, if the people of Western Australia cannot afford to pay for this survey themselves, they may come to us again, and we may be inclined to act generously towards them. I am an old railway contractor, and in my conscience, I believe that this line would be a terrible failure. There is no justification for the expenditure of money upon it in any shape or form. For these reasons, although I regret to have to do so, I must vote against the second reading of the Bill. </para>

I feel very much as though this matter were not being considered as it ought to be. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> who has just spoken, said, for instance, that in Western Australia they had to import a great deal of stuff from the other States. He used, that as evidence of the unproductive nature, of the country to be traversed by the railway. But if the honorable senator will cast his memory back some years, he will find that the position in the West to-day is exactly what it was in Victoria in the fifties. It is because people in the West find it profitable to produce gold, and to buy their products from other States, that they are importing so much. But that is no argument against this line. Indeed, it is considerable evidence of the poverty of arguments against the proposal before the -Senate. </para>

As for the work which that line would do, one important work would be the speedy transit of our mails for' Europe. I suppose that if this line were built, it would expedite the European mails. by two days between the east and west coasts. In addition, there is the extreme desirability of making the best possible arrangements for the defence of Australia. . I - should be quite willing to see this £20,600 included in the Defence Estimates, and paid for by all Australia on that basis. I strongly urge honorable senators' to view this question, from' a broad, national stand-point, and not from a narrow local one. </para>

I believe that those of us who are genuine federalists will admit that it is only a matter of time when this railway will 'be constructed. At present we desire information, and if for £20,000 we can get it, whether it be favorable or unfavorable to the construction of the line, the money will be well spent. In these days of practical politics, let us see what £20,000 means. We have in Australia a population rather over, than under, 3,600,000 persons ; £20.000 represents 4,800,000 pence, so that this expenditure would involve a charge per capita on the people of the Commonwealth of ijd. That is to say, Senators Fraser, Zeal, and Best would together represent an outlay of 4d. on this work, and every nine persons would contribute is. towards it. I should like to know why tenders should not be called for this survey? I am satisfied that perfectly competent surveyors would be very glad to undertake this work for £20,000. Judging from the experience gained in Western Australia, the gold area of that State extends eastward, and there is no reason why we should not expect the discovery of other gold-fields beside that at Kalgoorlie. It is a singular fact that a country which is not good for agricultural purposes is commonly found to be good country for minerals. In connexion with another matter, to which reference has been made, I would ask what proof have we that we shall not find artesian water in this country ?

                                Forrest is a gentleman for whom I have a very great regard, but he has not been over the whole of this country. If, the information supplied as the. result df this survey is at all satisfactory, I would ask whether this railway could, not be constructed on the land-grant principle, with the necessary reservation that the Government should hereafter have the right to take it over. It seems to me that when we have an enormous area of land lying idle, we can very well afford to offer it for the construction of a railway. I am aware that many persons object to the, alienation of a single acre .of land. I am not one who holds that view, as I believe that. if land is alienated, a. good use will be made of it.

                                has informed us that the line from Southern Cross to .Coolgardie cost £1,500 per mile to construct. It is therefore clear that there would be no engineering difficulties to surmount, and at this rate, 1,000 miles of railway could be built for £^1,500,000. I have been trying to count heads, and, so far as I can learn, the Senate is about equally divided on this matter.

                            <para>- I am sorry to hear that. In New South Wales, in many speeches which I had the honour of delivering in the days gone by, when I sought election as a member of the Federal Convention, I advocated a railway between the eastern States and Western Australia. I went further, and advocated, in time, the construction of a railway from Adelaide to Port Darwin. My theory is that if Ave are ever to become a great nation, we must be in a position to send our troops from one part of the Continent to another. When it comes to a matter of national preservation, £20,000 to secure reliable information would be 'money well spent. I have no doubt that the majority of honorable senators desire that kindly feeling should exist between the east and the west of Australia, and I have not the slightest hesitation in giving my support to this proposal. </para>

                        <para>). - I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> in the desire he has expressed that good feeling should continue to exist between the east and west of Australia. But this is a matter which must be viewed from a practical stand-point. It must be shown that by the expenditure of the sum proposed, we shall get information which will justify us in constructing this railway from the east to the west. It may be contended that by this expenditure we shall obtain information which will enable us to give an intelligent vote upon the proposal to construct the railway at some future time. But if we take the trouble to consider the population of Australia, and the nature of the country between Western Australia and the eastern States, it must be admitted that there is a very large area of country on the proposed route of this railway which is utterly valueless, and with our sparse population the amount of traffic which would pass over this line would be so small that if it were constructed within a reasonable number of years, it would in all probability only be a cause of annual expense, far in excess of any revenue which we might expect to derive from it. I have the greatest sympathy with our friends in Western Australia, but I feel that even the expenditure of this comparatively small sum of money can hardly be justified at the present time. If I had any idea that the result of an investigation of the character proposed would give the slightest scintilla of justification for the construction of a railway in the immediate future. I should give my vote in favour of the Bill. But, from all the information we have obtained up to the present, it does not appear that we would be able to obtain an adequate return from a railway of the kind within any reasonable period. It is estimated that a railway between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie would cost £5,000,000 or £6,000,000. Whether the line would really cost such an amount I, personally, am unable to say, but I do regard the question from the financial standpoint. If anything like that cost were incurred, we should have to find from £150,000 to £200,000 per annum by way of interest. </para>

                            <para>- Have we not sufficient information to justify us in saying that a railway of the character will not pay for many years to come? The strongest argument in favour of the line is that advanced from the point of view of defence. But are honorable senators prepared to in- " cur a large expenditure on that ground? A period of four days would. I presume, be required before troops could be moved across the Continent by means of a 3ft. 6in. railway. A railway of this character, if built at all, ought to be on the standard gauge, which would, of course, mean a much greater expenditure than that mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> As to the argument that the construction of a line would shorten the time occupied in the carriage of the mails from the old country, I feel sure that a line to Port Darwin would be of materially greater assistance. With the fullest desire to do what I can to assist the Western Australian people, there appears to me to be, at the present time, no justification for undertaking an expenditure of even £20,000, which would really mean an indication to our fellow citizens in the west that this Parliament was favorably disposed towards the construction of the line; and I do not believe that a majority of honorable senators are favorably disposed to the project. They cannot fail to see that the railway would entail very serious expenditure for many years. I believe that all of the States are in an impecunious position, and that they find their revenues insufficient for the expenditure. It is now a matter of great difficulty to obtain money in the old country, and I do not think that the Commonwealth would do one whit better than any of the States if it were desired to raise a large loan. </para>

I was anxious to hear what could be said in its favour, and I am sorry to say that, as a result of my inquiries, I feel that I would not be justified at the present juncture in voting for an expenditure of money for the purposes of a survey of the line, which I do not believe will be constructed for many years to come. </para>

                            <para>.- Then I say that, as a representative of the taxpayers, it is no part of our duty to vote for an expenditure which it is not intended to follow up, if the survey be favorable from a constructive stand-point. If it is not desirable to immediately set about the construction of the line, it is not desirable to initiate an expenditure, the limits of which no man can tell. One of my earliest experiences in voting money, as a Member of Parliament, was in connexion with a sum of . £15,000; and I remember that, before the work was completed, the outlay amounted to something like £160,000. Is there any human being who can possibly tell what will be the final limit of the expenditure now proposed ? It is quite possible that after the £20,000 has been voted, and the work entered upon, we shall be told that if we do not spend a few thousands more - probably some score of thousands more - the whole expenditure will be absolutely thrown away. We have heard to-night from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the State which is most anxious for the construction of this line has great resources, and is immensely wealthy. The honorable senator tells us that people who have lived in Victoria and New South Wales are doing uncommonly well in Western Australia, and that they occasionally visit these less-favoured States in order to spend their money amongst their poor relations. Yet it is the pockets of the poor relations which have to be rifled for the purposes of this survey. Two-thirds of the population of the Commonwealth live in the eastern States, and, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> are the poor relations of those who live in the western State, though they are being called upon to find the money for this survey. I admit that only £20,000 is being asked for, but of that amount the State from which I come will have to find , £7,000. and Victoria a similar amount, while the balance will be contributed by the four other States in different sums, the State which is to get all the benefits from the expenditure oeing that which will contribute about the least, although, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> -if is the richest in the Commonwealth. If everything is to be subordinated to the question of communication for defence purposes, I might take a different view of this proposal ; but, so far, nothing in the Commonwealth has been subordinated to defence .purposes. Not very long ago there was a proposal to mount a solitary cannon in Fremantle for the defence of that port, and the Fremantle newspapers of January and February last show that the Fremantle Chamber of Commerce formed a deputation to urge that the cannon be not mounted, because, if fired, it might break some of the windows of the town. If the defence needs of Fremantle are so discounted by the representative body of traders of that port, it is little more than farcical to ask the Commonwealth to initiate an expenditure which will run into anything between' £5,000,000 and £10,000,000 to defend it. </para>

                            <para>- It was, perhaps, unfortunate that Fremantle was not provided with a sufficient number of eminent hills to give a choice. Report after report by the late General Officer Commanding the Defence Forces of the Commonwealth has been laid on the table of the Senate, and of the other Chamber, all asserting, in the most emphatic manner possible, that the railway would be useless for defence purposes, because we have no force which could be transported over it. There is evidence that Major-General Hutton's opinions are received with a great deal of credence by some honorable members, and I ask them, therefore, to accept that opinion. Moreover, there is no likelihood of the Commonwealth having a sufficiently large force to make transportation possible in the near future. We have no right to construct the line as a mere speculation. The present military organization does not permit the bringing together in the eastern States of a number of troops sufficient to defend Western Australia. No arrangement is contained in the Defence scheme which is being adopted by the Government, and for which we have made provision today in the Appropriation Bill, whereby the eastern States could be stripped of troops for the defence of the western State. If the line is to be of use for purposes of defence, we must enormously augment our military forces. But there appears to be no intention to do that. I say emphatically that we have not a man to spare now. There is only a skeleton force in any part of the Commonwealth. Take the great district of Newcastle, New South Wales, as a typical case. The troops provided for the defence of that district do not. number 800 men, while for the Botany and Woollongong districts not 500 men are provided. That being so, it is the wildest nonsense, and the most preposterous logic, to suggest that the railway will be of service in providing for the transport of troops to defend Western Australia. I may be accused of uttering sentiments which are unfederal </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is always la'boriously endeavouring to achieve that result. To defend a great territory we must have a large number of troops. You cannot move an infinitesimal force from place to place in ordinary warfare, though you might do it with tin soldiers out of a child's toy box. Until the Commonwealth is prepared to pay for an adequate defence force, it is useless to speak of spending £5,000,000 or £10,000,000 on a railway for the transport of troops which do not exist. </para>

                            <para>.- We have been told by one honorable senator that this line will earn revenue by carrying fat stock. Another, enthusiast has informed us that the desert is such a land of Beulah that somebody with his wife and small children has travelled across it with his horned stock, horses, sheep, pigs, 'and poultry, without losing a head after striking the beautiful and prosperous country that lies to the west of Port Augusta. These enthusiastic utterances would be admirable upon the hustings ; but they are simply thrown away when addressed to a man who has a sense of his responsibility, in the matter of hard cash, to the people of the community. </para>

                            <para>.- I say that the two statements cannot be equally valuable. If the country through which this line is to pass is so beautiful that, as the man who paraphrased Scripture said, " The children of Israel with their horses and their flocks and their little ones " could cross it without losing a head of stock, it is obvious that the line would not earn money by carrying fat stock. Fat stock would grow fatter and more valuable the further they travelled over this delectable country - a country so delectable that I believe even the rabbits have fought shy of it. I understand that it does not carry one goat to the square mile, one blackfellow to twenty square miles, or a rabbit to the acre. </para>

                            <para>.- I did not know of that ; but what I do know is that small fortunes have been made in certain cases by persons who have erected rabbit-proof fences at the expense of the taxpayer, who has been what is commonly known as sweated for the purpose of political jobs in this respect. I should feel it my duty to vote for a line which actually involved true Commonwealth interests. A line that would be a service to the whole Commonwealth would be one to which I should be very much more disposed to give an enthusiastic support than a strong opposition. But, if we begin- with the northern capital of Queensland, we find that a railway has been built by the State from Brisbane to the New South Wales border; that New South Wales has built a railway, on which she is losing £[60,000 a year, between the Queensland border and Sydney ; that she has also built a line of railway, something like 400 miles in length, from Sydney to the Victorian border; that the Victorian Government have built" their line of railway, some 176 miles in length, from the New South Wales border to the capital where we are now happily placed, and from the capital to the -South Australian border. Then again, South Australia has taken up her burden and built her line from the Victorian border to Adelaide. Now we are suddenly asked by the golden-shored State to pay not only for the building of this line, but for the survey. We are asked to pay even for the promoters' fees of a line that will admittedly benefit only Western Australia. I cannot conceive that it is the duty of the Commonwealth to pay for the construction of a local line designed to serve local interests. It cannot be advanced for one instant that the construction of this line would be' attended by the smallest advantage to Queensland ; that it would be of the most remote advantage to New South Wales, or of the slightest interest to any one in Victoria. Although it might have some remote advantages of a very minor character for South Australia, the whole argument that we have heard is that it would be of advantage to Western Australia. I am prepared to admit that for the sake of argument, although I think I shall be able to show that the prospective advantages are very infinitesimal. It cannot be the duty of the </para>

                            <para>- It might be. I recollect a case which occurred in a State not many hundred miles away from here, where a dispute had been going on for I do not know how long, relative to the erection of a lock-up in a country town. This town, like a. good many others, was of a straggling character. One portion existed at a certain point ; then there was a kind of a hiatus, and after passing over a distance of three-quarters of a mile, the rest of the town was to be found. There were many deputations to the Government as to where the lock-up should be placed, and finally a Government official was sent to make inquiries and report. As might, have been expected, he interviewed the mayor of this little township. He said to him, " I want you really to tell me what, in your opinion, would 1« the most suitable site." " Well, look here," said the mayor, " it don't matter twopence where you put the lock-up, as long as you spend the money in the town." I think there is a moral in that simple story. It does not matter twopence whether we build this railway or not, as long as we spend the money on the survey. That is the position which is presented to us. </para>

I appeal to the honorable senator as one whose sense of fairness I respect, to say whether he can find in the speech delivered by the Attorney-General, in moving the second reading of the Bill, one solitary excuse for the expenditure that we are asked to incur. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps not. I may be wrong, but I have expressed the opinion which has been forced upon me. The one great thing to be achieved at the present time is the survey, perhaps for some ulterior purpose not entirely unconnected with a future general election. Australia has been pretty well exploited, and we know that wherever the land has offered a chance for a man to make a home, or to raise a crop, it has been taken up with fair promptitude. If the tract of country between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta is such a land of Beulah, as has been represented, why has it not been settled long before this? The very mention of the name of Kalgoorlie points a moral, and adorns a tale. Not so many years ago, Coolgardie was the pivot of the Western Australian gold-fields, but the bottom fell out of that field, and Kalgoorlie came to the front. </para>

                            <para>.- It may be the second in importance; but it had to take second place, because its early promise was not fulfilled. My moral is that it is a precarious thing to spend a large sum of of money upon the construction of a railway merely ,to reach a mining centre. We do not know from one month to another what will be the outcome of mining ventures. It must be remembered that the more successful mining development is, the more quickly the resources exploited will become exhausted. Farming operations bring about opposite results. The more the soil is cultivated,, and the greater the extent to which Nature is subdued, the more valuable the land will become. </para>

                            <para>.- I fully appreciate my honorable friend's enthusiasm for the gold-fields of Western Australia, but he must see that there is no possible comparison between the means of transit required to convey ounces of gold, and those needed for the conveyance of the millions of tons of coal won from coal mines, such as those at Newcastle. Having regard to the manner in which all the available lands of the Commonwealth have been taken up for the purposes of cultivation, or pastoral occupation, how is it that over the wide range of country, extending between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie, there are as far as we know, no human settlements? Even the blackfellows cannot exist there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has stated that where the land is unsuitable for agricultural or pastoral purposes, it is likely to prove rich in minerals. I do not suppose, however, that, in his capacity as one of the leading financiers within the limits of the Commonwealth, he would ever dream of making an advance of public or private funds upon such lands on the off-chance that neath the wilderness of shifting sands, some mineral products might be found. My honorable friend, in his splendid Federal enthusiasm, has, I think, rather given himself away. We know that there are thousands and thousands of miles of desert sands in Arabia, and in the Sahara; but we have not heard of any proposal to spend millions of money in constructing railways to traverse these wastes upon the chance that valuable minerals might be found. No one appreciates more than I do the kindly enthusiasm and Federal devotion evinced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker;</inline> but when it comes to spending the hard cash of the taxpayer upon wild-goose propositions, I cannot follow him. Would my honorable friend in his position as a director of more than one of our greatest monetary institutions be prepared to advance even one penny per acre upon the land that is to be traversed by the railway ? We are told that at one side of this 1,100-mile track there is something like 400 miles of railway upon the 3ft. 6in. gauge, whilst there is a similar length at the other end. Does any one suppose for a moment that it would be possible to usefully operate a 3ft. 6in. line for such a long distance as that contemplated ? I have, upon many occasions, travelled over the very excellent 3ft. 6in. lines of Queensland, but no one in his senses would care to travel over such lines at nighttime. </para>

                            <para>- I am delighted to hear it. I am surprised that the State which can afford to provide such splendid rolling-stock should consider it, necessary to ask its poor relations in the eastern States, who have to put up with such inferior accommodation, to defray the cost of the survey of the proposed line. It is absolutely absurd to propose to have a line of 2,000 miles or more in length, except with the standard gauge. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will not take our very mild interjections in a personal sense.' We recognise and give him credit for his fairness in granting a pair, and his straight-out opposition to the scheme we can understand and appreciate as that of an honest opponent. I am sorry to say that some honorable senators are not treating this question in the liberal spirit which is usual in the Senate. I have never known a pair to be refused to an honorable senator when he was on a sick bed until this occasion, so that it is a unique event in our history. There should be no such strenuous opposition to a proposal of this kind, when it is remembered that it is simply one for the spending of a paltry £20,000 on an inquiry which will enable us to say whether this great national work is justifiable or not. This paltry sum is denied to a- State which undoubtedly expects treatment more in harmony with the high-sounding sentiments which were expressed in pre-Federal days. When we contrast the finely-rounded periods of the ardent federalists of those days with the utterances of this evening, we must come to the conclusion that there is a tremendous f alling-off in the Federal spirit. There can be no gainsaying the fact that Western Australia was led to believe, by every sign it could possibly interpret, that the eastern States were undoubtedly friendly, and that some of them were pledged up to the hilt to assist in the building of this railway. </para>

Surely if there be any virtue in the word of a public man we should be able to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> statement as an authoritative one. Upon the occasion to which I refer that gentleman was representing Victoria, and indeed the whole of the Commonwealth, inasmuch as he was returning from the old country, which he had visited as a representative of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know upon what foundation that statement rests, having in mind the large public works which have been carried out in Western Australia, despite its small population. I think that I am quite within the mark when I say that in no part of the world has 250,000 people incurred such great responsibilities in opening up the interior of the country as have the people of Western Australia. Upon the Coolgardie water scheme alone the sum of £3,000,000 was expended. </para>

                            <para>- I claim that the people of Western Australia have shown their faith in the resources of that State. If we do not continue to develop our territory we might as well hand it over to the aborigines. If we are to leave that untouched we shall be of very little more use in the country than the race which we have dispossessed. If Australia is to be developed it can only be done by the cooperation of th'e whole of the people in works of this kind. It is quite unreasonable to expect a small population of 250,000 to undertake a gigantic national work of this kind. If the spirit which has been displayed by some honorable senators to-night is to be the spirit in which Federal matters generally will be dealt with, our legislation will riot do us credit. What has become of the Federal spirit and the higher political plane of which we heard so much when Federation was being advocated ? I make bold to say that the representatives of Western Australia have exhibited no narrow provincial spirit in the votes which they hav'e cast in this Chamber. I admit the charge made with respect to the special Tariff of Western Australia, but the financial exigencies of the State at the time of Federation made it absolutely necessary that we should have some such guarantee that we should be able to carry on. That special Tariff is practically a thing of the past now, and when all is said and done it cannot be contended that the people of the other States have suffered from it. in any way. Its effect has been merely th'e taking of money out of one pocket and putting it into another in Western Australia. But though the other States have not suffered from the Western Australian Tariff, there can be no doubt that that State has provided a great market for their products. The best market Tasmania has to-day is Western Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will not be acting in the best interest of the State which he represents if he takes any action calculated to arouse a feeling of jealousy between the people of Western Australia and Tasmania. It should not be forgotten that the game which some honorable senators are disposed to play on this occasion is one at which two can play. If this narrow selfish spirit is exhibited, Western Australia may also require to put it into practice in order to secure justice. </para>

                            <para>- Whatever increase of revenue we have secured has been due to a period of prosperity, which in the Commonwealth has been confined to Western Australia, and it has not been due to Federal legislation. Western Australian representatives have shown that they are prepared to treat the other States in a generous spirit, and it is in extremely bad taste that representatives of other States should exhibit such intolerable opposition to this measure involving the expenditure of the paltry sum of £20,000. Pairs have been refused to honorable senators who are unable to be present, and we could expect no more strenuous opposition if the Senate were now being asked to vote the money required for the construction of the railway. </para>

It would never have been made had it not been for the taunt uttered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> If the question before the Senate involved the expenditure of some millions of money for the construction of this railway, I could understand the opposition which has been exhibited, but such opposition to a paltry vote of £20,000 to secure information is very unfair. Many representatives of the other States know very little about Western Australia, and States at a great distance from the Seat of Government will always be under considerable disabilities in this respect. I ask honorable senators not to allow their minds to be prejudiced by a press which has shown itself unfair to distant States in connexion with most matters. I can assure the Senate that this is not the only time that this Bill will come before them if it is not passed on this occasion. If Western Australia is to remain a part of the Federation, and is to gain any tangible benefit from it, it must be connected with the eastern States by rail. I defy any one to say that Western Australia can hope to derive the slightest benefit from Federation in any other way. Without this railway Federation, so far as Western Australia is concerned, must continue to be a farce. </para>

There is a standing order which says that honorable senators must maintain silence when a ruling is being given, and I will not be interrupted. I was saying that a proper amendment would be to move that the resumption of the debate be made an order, not for another hour, but for some future day ; and if the honorable senator will alter his amendment, and propose, for instance, Friday next, it would be in order. .. </para>

There is other business which the Senate can transact when it meets at a later hour to-day. I desire the postponement of this matter until we can read the report of to-night's debate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> because I wish to fully understand the arguments for and against the proposal. It is only fair that I and other honorable senators who have not made up their minds on the question should be able to read what has been said, so that we may be able to give an intelligent vote, and one which we can afterwards justify to our electors. It is only fair, seeing that those who are in favour of the measure have succeeded in carrying the adjournment of the debate, that honorable senators who are in my position should be given a proper opportunity to fully inform their minds on the subject before dealing with it again. </para>

                            <para>- I am endeavouring to give reasons why in my opinion it is absolutely necessary in the interests of the people of the Commonwealth that this debate should be adjourned until Wednesday next. I have moved the amendment, because I wish to have an opportunity to make myself acquainted with arguments and facts that have been advanced during my absence from the Chamber. I have an absolutely open mind, so far as this question is concerned, and I think it is only reasonable that I should be given an opportunity to read in cold print the additional facts which have been adduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and others in favour of this Bill before I am called upon to cast my vote. I wish to arrive at an unbiased decision. I am sure that the representatives of Western Australia would be the last to argue that for the reason that I have been returned to this Chamber by a State whose people, because of their geographical position, or of ignorance of the true facts, are said to be prejudiced against this proposal, I should give a biased, vote. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and others say, "All that we ask is that justice shall be done to Western Australia." I desire an opportunity to calmly and carefully consider the facts in order that I may give an unbiased vote. Surely honorable senators would not deny that right to me? I have not made up my mind upon the question. I have read sundry reports, and it is because of the possibility of a bias that may have been created in my mind by a perusal of those reports, as well as of the articles which have appeared from time to time in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> that I wish a further opportunity to consider the new points which have been raised. I may be unconsciously biased on this question. It has been suggested that I am, because of the articles which have been published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> If that be so, there is no reason why I should not be given an opportunity to clear myself of anything of the kind. I am surprised at the hilarity displayed by honorable senators. I am considering this position in all seriousness. I think that in this matter I may fairly claim the support of honorable senators from Western Australia, and I trust that the Senate will agree to the amendment. </para>

I have missed all my trains, and I am out for the night, with the object of finishing the business now in hand. It has been proposed that the debate should be adjourned until Wednesday next. I am largely sympathetic with the honorable senator who has moved the amendment ; but, at the same time, I do not desire to unduly oppose the wish of the Government. It has been publicly intimated that they desire that Parliament should be prorogued at four o'clock to-day and. I, for one, am anxious to assist them to achieve that object. The original amendment was that the debate should be adjourned until four o'clock to-day, and with all due deference to you, sir, I do not agree with your interpretation of the standing order. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps it will save discussion if I admit at once that I made a mistake. The standing order provides for something to be done at the next sitting, and I overlooked the fact that the next sitting will be held to-day but, still, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> accepted the position. He said that he wished the debate to be adjourned until Wednesday next, and not until a later hour to-day. </para>

                        <para>- I am pledged to see that the Western Australia senators, who are peculiarly interested in this matter, have an opportunity to take a vote upon it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has moved that the debate be resumed at 4 o'clock this afternoon. I understand that it is the intention of the Government to prorogue Parliament at that hour. Therefore, if I supported his proposal, I should be false to the pledges which I have given. I have pledged myself to assist the representatives of Western Australia in obtaining a division upon this Bill, before the prorogation. I am sincerely desirous of redeeming my promise, and for that reason I cannot conscientiously support the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline></para>

                            <para>- A proposal was made that the debate should be adjourned until 4 o'clock this afternoon, and as it is well-known that the Ministry proposed that the prorogation should take place at that hour, it is clear that the intention was to prevent any further discussion of the Bill. No one is more strongly opposed to this measure than I am, but I shall take part in no unfair tactics to defeat it. If any such tactics are adopted I shall refrain' from exercising my vote. A proposal has since been made that the debate should be adjourned until noon, and in this matter I place myself in the hands of honorable senators representing Western Australia and other honorable senators supporting the measure, who have a serious responsibility resting upon them, and are deserving of every consideration. If they assure me that they think it will be an advantage to them to secure an adjournment to that hour I shall be prepared to vote with them ; but, as in my opinion the result will eventually be the same, I should very much prefer that the matter should be dealt with at once. </para>

I wish to contradict the statement of the Attorney-General that he did not refuse an adjournment of the debate. During my speech on the second reading of the Bill, I asked the honorable and learned senator twice to agree to an adjournment of the debate, and he positively refused. The honorable and learned senator has since denied that he did anything of the kind. </para>

When I was speaking on the second reading, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in what I thought was rather an offensive manner for him, questioned my statements in regard to the railway rates in Western Australia, and insinuated that I had concocted or invented the figures. However, I happen to- have here with me the book which contains the Western Australian railway rates : for passengers, goods, and so forth, for the year  1902.

                        (Victoria).- The question before the Chair is practically whether we shall adjourn until 12 o'clock noon, or until 4 o'clock p.m. I listened with great interest to the speeches by the Attorney-General and
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline>
                        on the second reading. The speech of the Attorney-General was very interesting, so far as it went, and I listened with a great deal of interest to the reply of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline>
                        and to the able and earnest remarks of

                        The case for this survey has been, if I may say so, laid before this Chamber by the Attorney-General and by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                        in a most ample form, and has been replied to by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles.</inline>
                        Those speeches, and others made by honorable senators, have been so complete that we are practically in possession of all the information available on the subject. I may be forgiven for not personally referring to other honorable senators, but I must say that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal</inline>
                        made some most pertinent remarks, and, altogether, 1 may say, as one who has not spoken on the main issue, that we are now qualified to give a decision.

Personally, 1 think that if we were to meet at 4 o'clock p.m. we should be able to come to a decision. I am perfectly prepared to decide at the present moment ; but the Attorney-General, and others who have supported him, are still thirsting for information. The Attorney-General thinks that it is necessary we should meet at half-past 10 o'clock this morning, for the purpose of further debating the question. 1 do not think, however, that that idea meets with the approval of honorable senators. </para>

                            <para>- Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, 4 o'clock p.m. ?;ould be a reasonable hour to fix for the resumption of the debate. If, by an extraordinary coincidence, the prorogation should take place at that time, honorable senators who are so anxious to have the discussion brought to an end will receive our sympathy. Parliament has been in session now for nearly ten months, and the Government, if they were earnest in their desire to get the Bill passed, should have introduced it earlier, so as to allow for its fuller debate. I confess that feel aggrieved that we should have been kv.pt here until this hour of the morning, and I do not feel that 1 should be- justified in further protracting the sitting. In the circumstances, I think that 4 p.m. to-day would be a reasonable hour to fix for the resumption of the debate. </para>

                        <para>- I admire <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> and others who, after occupying the time of the Senate at considerable' length in discussing the question of the adjournment, express sympathy for you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> as well as for others who have been compelled to remain in the Chamber so long. I suppose they think that because they have expressed their views on this question nothing further remains to be said. I have listened with verv great patience to the Queensland tornados, the Tasmanian blizzards, and the never-ending, talkers from Victoria, and yet I am not satisfied. When these honorable senators calmly consider the position, I think they will come to the conclusion that they have not dealt fairly with their fellow senators. Honorable senators do not seem to be quite themselves this morning, and I should like them to calm their ruffled feelings. We have discussed both the main question and that of the adjournment at considerable length, and I wish to advance some excuse for the request which was made by those who support the Bill, that the debate should be adjourned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has discussed the main question. </para>

I have no desire to prolong the debate, but I think the Senate should freely understand why the request was made for the adjournment of the debate. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have deprecated any reference to pairs, but I would point out that two honorable senators are unavoidably absent. Pairs were absolutely refused them. This is not a party question, but one that ought to be calmly considered. We should be prepared to extend every consideration to each other, and all that the supporters of the Bill ask is that its fate shall be determined by a legitimate vote of the Senate.

                            <para>- They are personally interested in so far as they are representatives of the State which is principally concerned. Finding that they could not obtain the full and deliberate sense of the Senate on the question at this early hour, the)' thought that it would be best to allow the debate to be adjourned. The Attorney-General was gracious enough to accept their proposal, and it was agreed to. He then moved that the debate should be resumed at the next sitting, which meant that it would be further considered at 10.30 this morning. In these circumstances, why should any honorable senator suggest that 4 o'clock would be the proper hour for the resumption of the debate when, notwithstanding the protestations which may be made, we all know that the prorogation of the Parliament is fixed for that hour? Those who make such a proposal are surely not treating their fellow senators fairly. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, because that is right. I strongly object to any endeavour to take away from those who are seeking to do their duty, the opportunity to discharge their responsibilities to those whom they represent. The representatives of Western Australia are actuated by an honest desire to do full justice to this question, and I trust that honorable senators will act as gentlemen, and avoid giving them the slightest cause for dissatisfaction or resentment </para>

                            <para>- That raises an important point. There was a motion upon which the honorable senator moved an amendment. Therefore, he must be considered to have spoken both to the motion and the amendment. A further amendment has been moved, and the question arises whether the honorable senator ought to be permitted to speak again. I do not know that there is any rule on the subject, and at this late hour I do' not think that it is fair to ask me to give a ruling of which I am not in a position to fairly consider th'e result. The honorable senator has spoken a great many times, and although I do not go the length of saying that he has not the right to speak, I do not think that he should again address the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- There is a standing order to the effect that an honorable member may speak once upon every question before the Chair. That is the original question only. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has spoken to the original question, and also upon the amendment moved by himself. As he did not move the original motion, he is not entitled to reply, and, therefore so far as the standing order is concerned, he is not entitled to speak again. That standing order is not, however, complete. I communicated with the parliamentary authorities in Sydney, where this standing order is in force, inquiring what the practice was. I received a reply, and announced to the Senate that I intended to adopt the New South Wales practice; but the supplementary procedure for which provision was made did not cover the point now raised, namely, whether an honorable senator, having moved an amendment, can speak again upon a further amendment on an amendment. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is not what has been done. That phrase means that a debate can be adjourned to a later hour of the same parliamentary day, as was done the other day on my motion. My motion is to adjourn the debate, not to a later hour of this sitting, but to a certain hour of the next sitting, that is to the parliamentary Thursday. It is indifferent to me, sir, how the question is put, but I venture to submit that, on a motion to adjourn the debate from one sitting day to another sitting day, an amendment cannot be moved to sit at a later hour on Thursday. </para>

                            <para>- The Attorney-General is taking a point of order which seems to me somewhat technical. One of the objections to ruling in the manner he suggests is that an amendment has been moved and debated, and it is too late now to rule it out of order. It is a little difficult, no doubt, to construe standing order 419. If the Attorney-General is right in his contention, then I was right in my first contention, when I prevented <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> from moving the amendment with which he started. </para>

                        (Queensland). - I hope, sir, that you are not afraid that I am going to speak again. I do not know that your remark is not to some extent a reflection upon me, because I never speak unless I feel that I can make a contribution to the debate, or suggest a reason, why a certain thing should be done. I wish to controvert the statement of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline>
                        that when the representatives of Western Australia are able to get an honest or legitimate vote on this question, they are blocked. That is a reflection on every member of the Senate who is not prepared to vote in the same direction as those honorable senators. The only inference which can be drawn from the remark is that I am not prepared to give an honest or legitimate vote on the question. It seems to me that on this occasion
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>
                        is taking up a partisan view. 1 gathered from the discussion that no party issue is involved. I understand that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline>
                        objected to my amendment, because he said that he had given a promise to the representatives of Western Australia. If there is one thing which should be respected by a public man, it is a promise which he has made, either publicly or privately. The honorable senator has a right to stick to his promise. Because he comes from the same State as I do, and has given that promise, does it mean that he expects to bind me?

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has said that honorable senators have been getting excited over this matter. I take exception to that remark. I have not been excited nor has there been any reason for excitement. I agree that there should be cool and calm consideration of the question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> also made a statement, which is a reflection upon other members of the Senate, that certain honorable senators ought to be ashamed of themselves. Why? What have they done in the opinion of the honorable senator that they should be ashamed of themselves? Am I not acting within the Standing Orders ? Do I not believe that I am acting in the interests of people whom I have been elected to represent? I do not know why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is allowed to rise in his place and say that I and other honorable senators, because they do not happen to agree with his opinions, 'ought to be ashamed of themselves. If that view were to be generally adopted there would be no diversity of opinion in the Senate. I am astounded at the attempt of the honorable senator who occupies the position of leader of the Labour Party in the Senate to turn round not on ..honorable senators opposite, but on the members of his own party, and to say that, in his opinion, they should be absolutely ashamed, because they believe they are taking a right course of action upon this question. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator that his own remarks were unfair. I do not think that he has- any right, either under the Standing Orders or in accordance with the courtesy that should be extended by one senator to another, to say that, other senators should be ashamed of themselves. Not satisfied with making that statement, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> hurls threats around the Chamber. If there is one thing to which I object more than another in a deliberative body, it is the making of threats. In the first place, it is a species of intimidation. I ask Senators Gould and Fraser whether they are in favour of a system of intimidation? Is the Attorney-General - who is the very embodiment of courtesy, and who possesses that indefinable quality which enables him to secure the good-will even of honorable senators who differ from him- </para>

If my honorable friends who have moved amendments on my motion will withdraw them I shall be prepared to move that this debate be resumed at 2 p.m., as that appears to be the general desire. As several honorable senators have recognised that it is only fair and just that an opportunity shall be given to take a vote on this question, I am justified in hoping that that opportunity will be afforded. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to say a few words with regard to the position of honorable senators representing Western Australia in this debate. We are naturally most anxious that the proposal for a survey of the route of the proposed railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta should be voted upon this session. It has been promised since the first sitting day of the first Federal Parliament that this survey would be made. We found that we had a majority of the members of the Senate in favour of the proposal, and at the present. moment there is an actual majority of the members of the Senate in favour of passing the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> who is a supporter of the Bill, is at present in Sydney with the Navigation Commission, on the business of the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> who is also a supporter of the Bill, is on a sick bed. We endeavoured to secure pairs for those honorable senators, and they were refused. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not further refer to that matter. I was prepared to agree to the proposed adjournment of the debate to 10.30 a.m., because I felt that we should not allow a vote to be taken when we knew that two of the supporters of the Bill would be unable to take part in the division. The Attorney-General moved that the Senate should adjourn until half-past 10 o'clock, and when an amendment was proposed the honorable and learned gentleman agreed to 12 o'clock, and now is willing that the hour shall be 2 o'clock. The party opposed to the proposed survey have had a great triumph. They have been able to prolong the discussion, and to postpone a decision until such a time as will render it impossible to take a vote on the question this session. </para>

                            <para>- I feel that honorable senators, although they may make mistakes, act fairly. The Government have entailed on us what has been practically a useless discussion during the early hours of this day. We came here yesterday determined, at whatever hardship, to sit all night, if necessary, in order that this extremely important question might be 'dis- cussed. Speaking for myself, I confess that I was very ill informed on the matter, and was anxious to keep an open mind, and to hear everything that could be said in favour of the proposition. The adjournment of the debate, at half -past 2 o'clock, put honorable senators in the position of having lost their night's rest fruitlessly. I feel that that is what has led to the recent futile discussion. </para>

I cannot help thinking that some measure of blame for all the hours of acrimonious discussion is attached to the representatives of Western Australia. The reason they gave for desiring an adjournment did not necessitate their stopping the discussion, because they could have kept on informing honorable senators until a much later hour, and thus have delayed the mere voting until all their forces could be marshalled. </para>

I do not know whether any honorable senators entered into an arrangement, but I take the interjection as a reflection on honorable senators who declared for or against the proposal. </para>

                            <para>- I deny that. The opponents of the Bill are in a majority. We were anxious that there should be a division, and, in saying that we sought to avoid one, the honorable senator is acting unfairly. </para>

                            <para>- I was opposed to that. I gave <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> the assurance - and I spoke for several others, as well as for myself - that we would be no parties to a count out. I should not like the House to adjourn with the feeling that there has been unfairness. I give the most generous credit to Senators Pearce, Smith, Henderson, and other representatives of Western Australia for the fight which they have maintained. The representatives of Victoria, however, feel that this proposed survey should not be made at the expense of the Commonwealth. When the proposal is brought forward again I trust that it will not be put before us in the last hours of the session, so that it may be fairly treated. </para>

                        who has alluded to them in general terms, but very kindly, seemed to put the blame for what has occurred on our shoulders. As I have been in the chamber practically the whole night I am fairly conversant with what has occurred. The representatives of Western Australia are not numerous, and they had to conserve their speakers if they wished to keep the debate going until they had the supporters of the Bill present. It was imperative that we should secure their attendance, because a practice to which I am not at liberty to refer specifically has on this occasion been departed from. Not a right, but an act of courtesy which has always been recognised by honorable senators was disregarded on this occasion.

                            <para>- I am not discussing it. All that I say is that a representative of Western Australia has in his possession a letter from an honorable senator who is ill, stating that he is prepared to vote for the second reading of the Bill. When the discussion had reached a certain stage last night, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> who was one of the only two senators from Western Australia in the chamber, who had not spoken, moved the adjournment of the debate, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> had intimated that he did not desire to speak at that time. The Attorney-General appealed to him not to press the motion, and other honorable senators, who support the Bill, also urged that it should be withdrawn. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> then asked leave to withdraw his call for a division, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> who is opposed to the survey, objected. We must not forget that honorable senators opposite, although, prepared to discuss the matter in the lobbies, were not ready to speak against the Bill on the floor of the chamber. </para>

                            <para>- From his statement of what has occurred, I think it will be seen that the supporters of the Bill have afforded every, opportunity for its full discussion. I, for one, do not object to anything that may be said by senators opposite. I recognise that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has pointed out, they have a duty to perform, and that, if the States which they represent are opposed to this Bill, they have certainly a right to voice their opinion. When they remained silent, however, I think there was reasonable ground for the suspicion that, knowing that we wished to secure the attendance of the supporters of the Bill, they were prepared to take us at a disadvantage. Is it not a fact that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> was speaking, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> left the chamber, and that, although he had scarcely passed through the doorway when attention was called to the state of the Senate, he did not return? </para>

In view of .all these facts, a suspicion was created, which has not been wholly removed, that there would not be a vote upon this question unless it could be taken when we were at a disadvantage. </para>

                        <para>- I was in the chamber when attention was called to the state of the Senate, but -I did not think of retiring. I had no desire to see the Senate counted out, for I had said that I was prepared to listen to the arguments advanced in support of the Bill by those who were better acquainted with the subject than I was. The statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> shows that when a person is deeply interested in any subject, and sees something being done, the object of which he does not fully understand, his suspicions lead him to jump to the conclusion that it is designed! to frustrate the purpose which he has in view. No doubt that is very natural, but I would point out that an uncontradicted statement of the kind made might lead the public to the conclusion that some honorable senators had been acting unfairly. We have been charged with a conspiracy of silence, with the object of obstructing business. But I absolutely deny that any understanding existed among honorable senators to that, end. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> will bear me out when I say that when he asked me if I was ready to speak, I answered in the affirmative, and stated that I had all my papers and documents ready. Whilst we were speaking, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> came in, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> said, " I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobsonis</inline> going to speak first." I thereupon made up my mind to defer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> We were all anxious to -hear the opinions of the representatives of Western Australia and South Australia, who were supposed to be best acquainted with the circumstances, but there was no hanging back on our part. I was prepared to speak at any time after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had sat down ; but when I realized that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> - who probably had a better acquaintance with the subject than I had - wished to address the Senate, I gave way. Surely, I cannot be charged with obstructing business, because I decided to waive my right in favour of an honorable senator whom I thought had a prior claim? I absolutely deny that there was any attempt on the part of myself or other honorable senators to obstruct the debate. It was stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the advocates of the railway had to reserve their speakers. Three honorable senators who were opposed to the proposed survey spoke one after the other, and no attempt was made to reply to them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> states that he knew that the supporters of the Bill were in a majority, and yet we are told that they were not prepared to speak in reply to the views expressed in opposition to the project. One representative of Western Australia therefore contradicts another. If they had had a majority, they should surely have been in a position to offer a reply to every honorable senator who opposed the measure. I am opposed to the Bill, but it is not to be conceived that I should allow it to pass without expressing the opinions of those I represented. Were the representatives of Queensland to sit by as dumb dogs, and say not a word on behalf of their own State? I object to the unfounded statements of the representatives of Western Australia which are calculated to prejudice us in the eyes of the public. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that when we resume the consideration of this Bill at 2 o'clock this afternoon, honorable senators will do what they can generously, and magnanimously, if necessary, to enable a division to be taken on the second reading. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> mads a complaint with regard to my action. I would only say that the attitude I adopted from the beginning was that we should go on with the debate, and come to a division - at any rate, that we should conclude the debate. It was from no desire to inconvenience honorable senators that I , felt bound to resist an early adjournment. I strongly resented the motion for adjournment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> and it was at my instance that he sought to withdraw his call for a division. As the honorable senator was refused leave to withdraw, I then voted with him, because I thought the refusal . was distinctly unfair. </para>

For that reason I took the action I did, protesting all the while that I desired the course I had laid down, with a view to having this important matter finally dealt with, to be carried out. </para>
