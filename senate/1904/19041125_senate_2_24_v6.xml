                        <para>- I rise, sir, to draw your attention to the fact that notice of motion No. 1, for the 15th December, in the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> is, except as regards the omission of one part, in precisely the same terms as a motion which the Senate decided was to be dealt with yesterday,, and which the honorable senator did not move or withdraw. I wish to know the reason why it appears on the notice-paper. It stood as notice of motion No. 1 on yesterday&#39;s notice-paper, but up to the time that notices of motion had been called on the honorable senator had not given notice of a motion. </para>

Although he did not move the notice of motion, and did not subsequently give notice of it, yet it appears on the noticepaper for the 15th December. </para>

                            <para>- Practically, it did. It decided that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> should not have the right to postpone the notice of motion. If nothing else had been done, sir, I think you will agree with me that only two courses were then open. One was that . he should thereupon move the motion, and the other was that it should be withdrawn. With regard to the fact that prior to that division being taken. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> had given notice of a motion, I would submit to you, with the greatest respect, that the decision of the Senate, that one of those, two things must happen, cannot be overruled by that previous notice. </para>

Senator Neild</inline> gave his notice of motion in order before the business was called on, and by inadvertence, when the notice of motion, on the business-paper came on, he moved that it be postponed. The whole of the proceedings were irregular. There ought to have been no motion, and there ought to have been no division.

                            <para>- There is no stigma about the matter. It is a mere question of procedure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> made a mistake in moving that his notice of motion be postponed, because it was really off the noticepaper ; as a matter of fact, it was to be put on the notice-paper for another day. In consequence of the previous notice which had been given, it was an irregularity, and I do not see that there is anything to complain about, or any reason to raise any question. It is really not a matter of any great importance, because, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> had not given that notice of motion, he could have given another notice of motion for another day. The matter had not been disposed of. </para>

It seems to me that standing order 102 brings about exactly the same result as far as he is concerned if he wishes to postpone his business, except that there is no division. The two standing orders are in absolute conflict on that point. </para>

If, before the business of the day is called on - and it has been done here dozens of times - an honorable senator gives notice that he is going, to move a motion standing in His name on a future date, it is put down for that date by the clerks, as a matter of course, and is put on the noticepaper. </para>

                        <para>- I have often objected to this method of doing business. It is extremely undesirable in dealing with Money Bills that the Standing Orders should be suspended, and the measures passed through without opportunity being given to consider them in a rational manner. There is no reason why this measure should not have been placed before the Senate&#39; at an earlier date. </para>

                    <para>- I think the Attorney-General should tell the Senate whether this Bill is based on last year&#39;s Estimates. Looking hurriedly through the schedule, I am under the impression that it anticipates this year&#39;s Estimates. If that be so, good reason should be given for the suspension of the Standing Orders. We have before suspended the Standing Orders under protest in the case of Bills of this nature, based on Estimates previously considered. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that this Bill deals with works which did not appear on&#39; last year&#39;s Estimates, and it is therefore an unparalleled departure in the history of finance in the Commonwealth that the Standing Orders should be suspended for the passage of such a measure. We have not so far passed a Supply Bill involving Estimates which have still to come before us. If this measure is prophetic, and is based on Estimates which have still to come before us, by passing it we shall deprive ourselves of any effectual means of dealing with those Estimates, because we shall have committed ourselves to the leading votes affecting public works, appearing in them. If I state the case correctly the Attorney-General (must show urgency in support of his motion, or I shall otherwise be inclined to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline></para>

                    <para>- The Senate is not fairly treated with respect to financial Bills. There has been a continual complaint since the inauguration of this Parliament that money Bills have been brought up to the Senate on very short notice, and that because of delay in another place the time for their discussion in the Senate has been curtailed. It appears to me that in this Bill the cart is put before the horse. The Attorney-General asks us to grant a large sum of money for new works and buildings before we have had an opportunity, to consider the Estimates for the ordinary services of the year. I notice that in this Bill provision is made for new works and services connected with the Post and Telegraph Department, involving _ an expenditure of&#163;155.000. A sum of , &#163;130,000 is set down for new works and services in connexion with the Defence Department. There are also other items appertaining to those Departments which come under the heading of Home Affairs. It is asking rather too much of honorable senators to claim that a Bill introduced here at ten minutes to 11 o&#39;clock, should be proceeded with five minutes- later, before we have had an opportunity to consider the proposals contained in it. </para>

But I appeal to honorable senators not to adopt such a course lightly, or unless they feel that the public interest, or the satisfaction of their own judgment, imperatively demands it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has referred to the practice in connexion with Supply Bills, but this is not a Supply Bill. Supply Bills rest, as my honorable friend has rightly said, upon Estimates which have to be passed. This is an appropriation for works and buildings in order to prevent any stoppage in the construction of public works, and to enable them to be proceeded with without delay. For that reason the other Chamber was unanimous in passing this Bill through all its stages yesterday. </para>

                        <para>- No; this Bill has nothing to do with that. It merely authorizes the expenditure of money on works and buildings. These are not the general Estimates. The Appropriation Bill proper will be dealt with at a later stage. Last year, a similar Bill was introduced on the i st October. We are following the same precedent now. Indeed, the Bill may be compared with measures that are introduced in the States Parliaments to authorize the construction of railways and other public works. I hope that honorable senators will enable us to advance the Bill a stage, and if they give reasons why there should be further consideration of details,, we shall offer no objection. </para>

                <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                <para class="block">This is a measure which is more appropriate for consideration in Committee, when honorable senators will have an opportunity to speak more than once, and to apply their minds to particular items, than for debate on the motion for the second reading. So far as I am concerned,, the amplest information will be supplied, and the figures will be explained in the fullest possible, way. One reason why this Bill is brought in separately is that , it is a Bill which the Senate may amend. It is differentiated in that respect from an ordinary Appropriation Bill as to which we can only make requests. Honorable senators have the freest possible hand in regard to this expenditure. The amount covered by the Bill is &#163;404,240, and I think the most convenient elucidation I can offer is a comparison with the actual expenditure of last year. That bears on the point to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> alluded, in reference to new expenditure and excess; but, of course, there must always be new works each year, not in the sense of something beyond the ordinary scope, but simply because great departments like that of the Post and Telegraph Department must always be providing additional conveniences for the community. We must provide additional works to enable the outlying parts of the country to be served with telephones, telegraphs, and post-offices, just in the same way as every business man, as his connexions increase, must extend his operations. The new works mentioned are required to provide for the growing wants of the community from day to day ; and, from that point of view, we can apply our best judgment in the consideration of the measure. It is desirable that there should be no stoppage of those works, and that the Government should know as early as possible what authority they have for incurring the expenditure. The works extend all over this vast continent, and are directed to providing conveniences in districts which cannot be reached in an hour or a day ; and it is not desirable that there should be any suspense on the part of the public, or of contractors and employes, as to whether there is to be a continuance of operations. The actual expenditure last&#39; year was &#163;325,009, as against an estimated expenditure this year of &#163;404,240. That actual expenditure last year was incurred under the Estimates submitted to the Senate by the then Vice-President of the Executive Council, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> in a very interesting speech. An apparent increase of &#163;79,231 is shown, made up chiefly of two items, to which I shall direct the attention of honorable senators, and which contain the only proposals calling, I think, for any criticism in Committee. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable senator has anticipated what I was going to say. Honorable senators will realize that, in voting this &#163;24,400, they are pledging themselves to a work which is estimated to cost &#163;87,700, and it is right that it should be shown how the figures are arrived at. An exceedingly favorable arrangement has been made with the State of Western Australia. The land required will cost about &#163;34,000, but of that sum &#163;24,000 represents the value of Crown lands. The State of Western Australia, in order to assist in the carrying out of this work, which &#39; I am sure every one interested in the defence of Australia admits to be pressing, does not, as might have been done, ask the Commonwealth to pay cash, but is prepared to let the land be considered as a transferred property. That is a very great gain to the Commonwealth, seeing that the land may be dealt with under the provisions of the&#39; Constitution, and. such legislation as this Parliament may authorize in the matter of the transferred properties. </para>

                    <para>- A Bill on this matter was introduced by the Barton Government, and one suggestion made was that transferred properties should be paid for by the Commonwealth taking over a portion of the States debts. I thought then, and still think, though not. finally - I am not pronouncing any Government policy - that that is far and away the better plan by which to pay for transferred properties. That, however, is a question which honorable senators will not desire me to enter upon now. All I wish to say is that, in my opinion, Western Australia deserves a slight meed of appreciation for the attitude which that- State has assumed, and which enables the Commonwealth to proceed with this work under favorable circumstances. Possibly if the Commonwealth had to face a cash outlay of &#163;24,000. there might be some hesitation in immediately undertaking the work. Some further land has to be purchased, but it is infinitesimal. The cost of the works is estimated at &#163;22,000, and the armament at &#163;31,600. All the expenditure I have mentioned does not amount to a large drain on our resources, especially when we consider that the object is to put the defences in a proper state. </para>

                    <para>- The total amount for the land is set down at &#163;34,100, and of that &#163;23,900 is for land belonging to the State. I may refer honorable senators to the full particulars on the subject of defences at North Fremantle and Arthur Head, given . at page 31 of the papers laid before Parliament in connexion with the Budget, and it would be convenient if I mentioned one or two of the details. The Crown land at Arthur Head is estimated to cost &#163;23,900, but I may mention that that is the valuation of the State Government, and has not yet been definitely accepted by the Commonwealth Government. The expenditure estimated for moving and re-erecting buildings on the proposed site is . &#163;3,800, for emplacements &#163;7,000 of the total cost of &#163;10.000. and for armaments &#163;7,600. At North Fremantle private land is estimated to cost &#163;6,400. That represents the claims as sent in and valued by the Public Works Department of Western Australia, but the Commonwealth Government have not yet assented to the valuation, which may, therefore, be less. Then emplacements are estimated to cost- &#163;12,000, of which &#163;4,000 is considered sufficient to cover the expenditure for the current year. A summary of the proposed expenditure gives &#163;34,100 for land, &#163;23,900 of which, as I have said, is for Crown land, and &#163;10,200 for private land, and armament is&#39; to cost &#163;31,600, and this with an expenditure, estimated at &#163;22,000 on works, brings the estimate up to &#163;87,700. </para>

                    <para>- Not all of it. The total portion of the excess expenditure is &#163;33,000, and &#163;24,400 is placed on the Estimates for the current year. The new expenditure on account of the Post and Telegraph Department is set out on pages 12 and 13 of this schedule, while similar information in regard to the Defence Department is given on pages 14 and 15. It is very desirable that there should be a full reserve of ammunition in connexion with the Defence Department. These Estimates have all passed under the scrutiny of the late Government. On going through the expenditure in connexion with the reserve of ammunition, it was found that the sum originally asked for was altogether inadequate, and that it was necessary to spend an additional sum of &#163;60,000 or &#163;70,000 for that purpose. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is aware of the difficulty which occurred in connexion with the Toowong Rifle Range. It is a very good range in many respects, but it was found that the bullets sometimes ricochetted and went straight over the hill at the back, and the consequence was that more than one action for damages was brought against the Department. It had to pay damages in one case, and therefore it became absolutely necessary to obtain another rifle range. </para>

                    <para>- I take it that &#163;24,000 is the Western Australian Government&#39;s estimate of the value of the land. For the information of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> I might say that the harbor to be defended at Fremantle is right in the centre of the town, which lies on either side of it. Outside the harbor there is an open roadstead, and for the defence of the place it is necessary that forts should be constructed on either side of the harbor. The land on one side of the harbor, on which it is necessary to construct a fort, is practically in the centre of the town, and is therefore very costly. </para>

                        <para>- There are various Government buildings upon it. I believe that one portion of it, on which the Customs House is erected, has already been transferred to the Commonwealth. The military authorities state that it is absolutely essential for the defence of Fremantle that a fort should be constructed on this land. The land at the place selected for a fort on the other side of the harbor is the property of private individuals, and is not nearly so valuable, because it is not so near the centre of the town. </para>

                    (Queensland).There is, in addition to the amount set down for the purchase of the land, a sum of &#163;3.800 required for the removal and re-erection of buildings. That brings the expenditure proposed for this land up to nearly &#163;30,000. I wonder whether that is all that will be required. I understand from Senator Pearce that there are public buildings erected on the land to be resumed, and it does not appear to be land which would ever have been built upon by ordinary business people.

                        <para>- It has evidently been reserved for public purposes, and the Commonwealth is now asked to vote &#163;24,000 for it. The public buildings erected on it cannot be of a very important character, when they can be removed and re-erected for &#163;3,800. As far as I can gather, the Commonwealth is being taken advantage of in this matter. </para>

                        <para>- We know that each State is in exactly the same position in regard to the Commonwealth that State electorates are in with regard to the States Governments. Each State looks upon the Commonwealth Government as fair game. It appears to me that the Western Australian Government has taken up that attitude in connexion with this matter. If honorable senators -recognise that it is the duty of the States to get all they can out of the Commonwealth, it is also the duty of the Commonwealth to give as little as it can. We should remember that we are dealing with the money of the whole of the people of Australia. No matter what arrangement is come to with the Western Australian Government, the people of Australia will ultimately have to find the money. I do not know who is to blame in this matter, whether it is the present Government or past Governments. </para>

                        <para>- Some one is undoubtedly to blame. The honorable and learned senator would not conduct his private business in such a fashion. If he arranged to take over a property, he would make sure of the terms on which it was to be transferred to him before he took possession. The Commonwealth Government appears to deal with these matters in a large, vague, and airy fashion. The Western Australian Government makes a demand for &#163;24,000 for this land, and the Commonwealth Government, while it does not say that it will agree to pay that price, says, &#34;All right, we shall take possession, and we can settle that matter afterwards.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned- senator, if he should continue to occupy his present position, may ask next year for another &#163;24,000 for this purpose. My experience as a member of a State Parliament has taught me that Governments deal very loosely with matters of finance. I am extremely anxious that as the Commonwealth Government is a pattern for the States Governments in everything else, it should be their model also in the conduct of financial affairs. We should not be asked to vote money until a definite arrangement has been come to with the people who are to get it. The Government have no information on this matter. </para>

But it is not so at all. The land to which he has directed his very clear remarks involves only a portion of the total estimated cost of &#163;87.000 on these fortifications at Arthur Head, North Fremantle. The expenditure in respect of land is estimated&#39; at &#163;34,000. We are now authorizing the expenditure of &#163;24,000, not necessarily in respect of the land, but towards going on with the work. </para>

In any case, it- has been agreed between the Western Australian Government and the Commonwealth that their land is to be treated as part of the transferred properties. Items 8, 9, and 10, under the heading of Western Australia, in division 2, make up a total of &#163;16,800, and there is a note at the bottom of the page showing that &#163;7,600 has to be added to that, representing expenditure which is provided for under division 6, sub-division 1, item 15. That makes up the total of &#163;24,000, which is merely the amount which Parliament authorizes to be spent during the current year. </para>

                        <para>- What we are committing ourselves to is the construction of these fortifications at a maximum cost of &#163;87,000. But we are not committing ourselves to give &#163;24,000 in cash for land. The land is the subject of a transaction between the State and the Commonwealth, which is beneficial to both parties. With this explanation, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will admit that the position is simple ; and I should like also to assure him with regard to the general military expenditure that there has been no large increase. The estimated expenditure on defence last year was &#163;581,262. The estimated expenditure provided for this year is &#163;571,114. There is also this to be said - which I feel sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> will bear me out in stating - that every effort is made consistent with efficiency, to keep down the actual expenditure. Last year, as against an appropriation of &#163;581,262, the actual expenditure was &#163;519,170. That, of course, is irrespective of works and buildings, and expenditure on the Imperial Squadron. The expenditure this year on the works and buildings with which we are now concerned, is &#163;130,000. Last year the amount was , &#163;97,000; but the difference is due to the cost of the Fremantle undertaking. </para>

                    <para>- My honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> with his native shrewdness and caution, appears to be haunted with the idea that we are not driving a sufficiently hard bargain with respect to the land for the Fremantle fortifications. The question of the value of the land has not been finally decided., but it must be remembered that the Commonwealth will be in possession, and that if there is any dispute as to the actual value of the land, it will be settled fairly, probably by arbitration. The Attorney-General has stated that the Western Australian Government have agreed to consider this land, which they own, as similar to the transferred properties. The Western Australian Government are to be commended for their action in that respect. I believe this is the first time in the history of the relations between Commonwealth and States when that has been done. It&#39; shows a proper spirit of reciprocity, and it would be advantageous if it were followed to a greater extent. It would indicate good feeling with regard to great national works which are beneficial- alike to both the Commonwealth and the States. I do not wish to mention instances in the contrary direction, but there are cases in which, even in regard to handing over transferred properties, a good deal of friction between States and Commonwealth has been occasioned. I am of opinion that the transferred properties will never be paid for by the Commonwealth in cash. If we succeed in consolidating the States debts, we shall practically take over the whole of the debts that accrued in the creation of the large assets of the States which have not been taken over by the Commonwealth. In the case of the transferred services, -it merely means that if we take over States debts we shall take over the property as well as the debts. If we take over the debts of the States we shall, to that extent - perhaps the amount may be &#163;12,000,000 - take over the assets with the liabilities; and, as to the larger indebtedness of &#163;200,000,000, the assets remain under the control of the States. It is exceedingly improbable that the States will ever receive payment in cash for the transferred services, and therefore this land is practically a gift from the Western Australian Government to the Commonwealth. </para>

                    SMITH.Undoubtedly there will have to be a bookkeeping system, by which each State will have to pay interest on its own debt, which is transferred to the central authority. But I say again that as far as this land question is concerned, the value of it will probably never be paid by the Commonwealth in cash, though no doubt the transaction will be adjusted in some other direction. It seems to&#39; me that the objection taken to these items is not to the construction of the forts, but to the purchase of the land, and when it is pointed out that the land is handed over as a portion of the transferred services, the difficulty is practically overcome. &#39;

                    <para>- It seems rather strange for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> to tell the Committee that if the Commonwealth takes over land, and pays double what it is worth, in the shape of interest on State debt, we get the land for nothing. It does not matter whether we pay cash for land, or take over a portion of a State&#39;s debt to the extent of its value ; we have to pay for it just the same. I think that if the Attorney-General will explain one point, it will remove all the difficulties with respect to the items under discussion. Honorable senators will observe in connexion with the military expenditure on works and buildings, that more money is to be spent in Western Australia than in all the other States put together. That fact might alarm the citizens of the other States, who might say, &#34; Why should all this be done in Western Australia, when so little is done in the other States?&#34; But I think that if honorable senators examine the facts closely, they will find that the expenditure is not to be considered new expenditure, which would have to be paid for on .a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis, but is expenditure which Western Australia will have to bear. </para>

If it is necessary to spend these large sums in Western Australia, and the whole of the Commonwealth has to pay for them, Western Australia will reap an immense advantage. Western Australia is having works constructed, for which the other States have to pay. </para>

                    &#39;has, though, of course, not purposely, conveyed a false impression as to the attitude of Western Australia on this question. That honorable senator refers to the costliness of this land, and assumes that the people of Western Australia are anxious to drive the Commonwealth into the. bargain. The fact is, however, that -when the military authorities selected this site, the Fremantle people held a public meeting of protest, and asked that the fort should be removed as far away as possible, so that &#39;in case of war the enemy&#39;s fire would not be directed to the centre of the town. The British Admiral on the Australian Station was requested to go to Fremantle and report, and, after making an inspection, in conjunction with military officers, who did not belong to Western Australia, the present site was selected as the best. In the face of these facts, it is idle to attempt to assert that the people or the Government of Western Australia are trying to induce the Government to expend &#163;24,000.

                            has practically explained the matter, but I should like to say that, in regard to the fortifications erected at Largs Bay and other places before the establishment of the Union. I feel no apprehension whatever. All such works are transferred properties, and in the end the taxpayer of the Commonwealth must pay for them. New fortifications are national works which must be paid for by the whole Commonwealth

                            and all fortifications previously erected out of the funds of the States will also have to be paid by the Commonwealth

                            pointed out, there are two distinct positions, one where there is expenditure for the benefit of the State, and the other where it is for the benefit of the Commonwealth ; and the present instance comes within the latter category.

                    (South Australia). - I am quite satisfied with the explanation that has been, given, and I have no objection to the item being passed. I know, however, that there are a great many people who, in comparing the amounts to be spent in the different States, take the view I indicated previously. Transferred services, of course, stand in a different relation from that of other, services; and I raised the question merely in order to give the Attorney-General an opportunity to make an explanation, so that not only honorable senators, but people outside, may understand the position. I quite agree with the Attorney-General that the States which have already carried out such works are in no worse position than are the States in which such works have now to be dealt with, because the .former States will be recouped by the Commonwealth. I wanted the position made as public as possible, so that we may not be subject to unjust criticism.

                    (Queensland).- My remarks were intended to apply to the transfer of the land, and I desired some definite information as to area and price. The Government ought to be in possession of the facts, and should lay them before the Committee. I have no intention to refer to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith&#39;s</inline>
                    remarks about payment not being required, because we all know that the Commonwealth .will have Ito pay for the land. Either this or a previous Government, or the Government before that, are to blame for the very unbusinesslike fashion in which this transaction has been carried out. There is another matter on which I desire some information. I see that a sum of &#163;3,800 is set down for removing and re-erecting buildings, and it would appear that that is a re-vote - that a similar sum was provided last year and was not expended.

                        <para>- The matter of the &#163;3,800 was explained a good many weeks ago. The money was not expended, because the whole matter was left in abeyance until Parliament had been fully informed of the maximum estimated cost of the works. As I have already said, I cannot tell the honorable senator the price agreed upon, because no price has been fixed. All that Parliament is asked to do is to authorize an amount to be applied in a particular way, and I have stated the maximum, which cannot be exceeded, but may be reduced. The matter is still subject to adjustment. </para>

                    <para>- In the Estimates for the Post and Telegraph Department there are a number of items which might well engage the attention of the Committee. The amounts set down for the completion of post offices in a number of the States are very large, and honorable senators must have been struck with surprise at the costly buildings which some towns &#39; seem to require, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. Honorable senators, like myself, must have noticed in travelling through the States how great a tendency there is to extravagance in the matter of public buildings, especially post-offices. Where a building, sufficiently large and convenient to meet the requirements of a small town and district, might have been erected for &#163;400 or &#163;500, the cost has amounted to , &#163;4,000 or &#163;5,000. </para>

                        <para>- That is held out as a horrible example; but every honorable senator will find that in his own State the same thing has occurred, and is recurring. I assume that the general desire is to curb any tendency towards extravagance. In travelling through the different States, honorable senators must have noticed that there has always been a tendency to extravagance in the direction of erecting far more costly buildings than were necessary. </para>

                        <para>- In the size, and very often in the design, of the building. In Tasmania, just prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth, some post-offices and other public buildings were erected, which were quite out of proportion to the requirements of the town or district to be served. That has also occurred in the other States. If honorable senators will refer to the items for New South Wales and Victoria, they will perceive that very large sums, indeed, are required to complete the post-offices in small places. Either the buildings must have been very small ones when they were handed over to the Commonwealth, or the necessity for these large additions has arisen very quicklv. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - I wish to give some information with regard to the Fremantle Post Office. When the present post-office was erected all the shipping was done in the open roadstead. Fremantle harbor was not made, and, naturally, the town grew round the open roadstead. The post-office was a small one, but it fulfilled the then requirements of the place. After the completion of the inner harbor the town naturally grew round the inner harbor, and the post-office is now quite three-quarters of a mile away from the principal portion of the town. Moreover, it is too small for present requirements.
                </para>
                <para class="block">The foot-note to the item is somewhat misleading, because the post-office was taken over as a transferred property. What is proposed now is that a new site shall be purchased in the present business portion of the town, and a building erected there. This sum of &#163;20,000 is required to purchase the land, and erect a building thereon, but against that sum ought to be placed the amount which will be realized by the sale of the present building and the site. </para>

I do not think that this matter can be referred to too often. The fault is not peculiar to any one State. It has been common to all of them, and I fear that it has been unduly continued under the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the Commonwealth.

There has been for a long time too much tendency in the States - and I hope it is not likely to prevail under the Commonwealth - to be just a little extravagant in the way of bricks and mortar, in buildings such as post-offices and railway stations. </para>

                        <para>- Apparently more luxury is required on the line from&#39; Sydney to Melbourne, and therefore I shall say no more on that point. . I know that a good many years ago, in South Australia, when we were very flush of cash and built railways in various directions with borrowed money, there was far too much expenditure on elaborate railway stations in out-of-the-way places. Solid cut stone and all that sort of thing were used when a good galvanized shed and a wooden platform such as exists at a station with which I am very familiar, would have amply&#39; met all the requirements of the traffic. The residents in that locality have been a standing pattern to all Australia as regards station accommodation. </para>

                        <para>- The station is very commodious ; but I do not think it is very elaborate. I quite agree that great- scrutiny should be exercised in respect to the expenditure on public buildings, and that it should bear perhaps more relation than it has done to the necessities of the case - to the actual accommodation required, as well as to the revenue-producing resources of the locality. The great bulk of these items for New South Wales are re-votes, because the greater portion of last year&#39;s votes has not been expended. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot shovel out the money within a day or two. Three or four Governments have done their very best to comply with the necessities of the public in these places. If a part of the expenditure has been undertaken, the work must be completed. We are practically asked to re-affirm some votes of last year, in order to complete buildings which are in course of erection. We cannot allow unfinished buildings to go to waste. In Victoria it is largely the same, because, with two exceptions, there are no new votes. Recent Governments have been exhibiting that care which is so much required, and only two new votes for Victoria find a place in this Bill. The expenditure at Minyip is practically in that category, because very little of last year&#39;s vote has been spent. When we consider how much has to be spent in completing a building, we must keep in view the amount voted for the entire building. I have not seen the plan, and do not know the character of the building to be erected at Minyip. So far practically nothing has been spent for this purpose, but &#163;1,500 will not provide a very large building for post-office purposes. </para>

The site is a very valuable one, in the centre of the town, and so long as land is what it is, and the method of buying and selling it what it is, we must expect to have to pay a fair price for land so situated. Honorable senators should take into consideration the fact that the old building on this site will produce something which will go to the credit of this vote. </para>

I have taken the trouble to ascertain the population of Minyip. We are asked to vote the sum of &#163;1,499 to complete the post-office at this place, and no one appears to know what sum has already been spent for this purpose.

                        <para>- The .longer we live the more we learn. The probability is that on that occasion also the Standing Orders were suspended, and we were given no opportunity to consider the items submitted. What appears to me to be one of the most serious pieces of extravagance disclosed in this Bill is the vote of &#163;20,000 proposed for the post-office at Fremantle. They do things in a very grand fashion at Fremantle, and have not yet learned from hard experience how wise it is to avoid spending money lavishly on public buildings. 1 admit that in Queensland we committed the very same mistake, and we are now repenting in sackcloth and ashes. I really believe that a post-office very much less imposing than one which should cost &#163;20,000 for buildings and land should suffice for a small town like Fremantle, with a population of about 15,000, and within a few miles of Perth, the capital of the State. &#163;5,000 should be quite sufficient for a post-office in such a place. I suppose that the matter is settled, and it is useless to make any objection now. We can Only give a hint to the present Government, and to any Government that may succeed them, that we are altogether opposed to this extravagance on public buildings. </para>

                    (South Australia). - I have no desire to find fault with what is proposed to be spent in Victoria or New South Wales. I expect honorable senators representing those States to have an eye to the local expenditure. I wish to refer to the expenditure proposed at Mount Gambier. We have been told that Minyip is a district where there is a great deal of settlement, in addition to the actual population of the town, but from what I have seen of that part of the country, it is not very closely settled. At Mount Gambier there is considerable settlement, and there is a population of between 3,000 and 4,000 in the town itself:

                        <para>- Only &#163;600 is asked for. What I desire to point out is that it is proposed to incur this expenditure in connexion with old buildings, which in the near future will have to be pulled down altogether. A very large section of the people of Mount Gambier is of opinion that the present post and telegraph office is not in the best position, and that it should be in the position originally selected for the purpose, and on which a fairly substantial building was erected. .By some manoeuvring, whether municipal, political, or social, I am  unable to say, the post-office was removed from its original position to the site which it now occupies. I am given to understand, by people in Mount Gambier, that it would be quite possible to dispose of the present post-office and site. It would be far better to do that, and expend this money on the construction of a Post-office on the original site,, where it would give satisfaction to the majority of the people. The difficulty is that it is impossible to secure unanimity amongst the local people. Self-interest creeps in, every man wishes to have a post-office or a railway station at his own door, and Governments are sometimes prevented from doing what is right on that account. I have drawn attention to the matter in order that the Attorney-General, who knows something of Mount Gambier, and has favorable recollections of the place, might induce the Department to make further inquiries, and see whether it would not he advisable to dispose of the present building and site, and meet the convenience of the majority of the people at that place. &#39;by transferring the post-office to the original site. </para>

I am told that there is not a tree within ten miles, or a water-hole within twenty miles of Killarney, and that the railway running to the place does not pay for axle-grease. I have learned also that a nomad travelling to Killarney and anticipating that he would find beautiful scenery there, said to the proprietor of the lonely bush shanty at the place, &#34; I thought that Killarney was noted for its beauty spots?&#34; and received the reply, &#34; So it was, &#34;sir, but yesterday a wandering goat made its appearance and consumed all the beauty spots there were about the place.&#34; </para>
