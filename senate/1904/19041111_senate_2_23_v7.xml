In the first place, I wish to complete a quotation I made from the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> in reference to this provision, of which he, in conjunction with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom,</inline> was the author. In responding to the statement that I quoted from the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> yesterday, that he had not seen the phraseology of the amendment, and was willing, to accept the spirit, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> said, at page 2956 - </para>

                    <para>I do not commit myself to the phraseology. I wish, as far as I can, to carry out the views I have just enunciated. The spirit of the proposal is as follows : - &#34; No preference shall be declared to any organization under this Act if its rules, decisions, or practices, or any of them provide for or permit either the application or appropriation of its funds or any part thereof for any political purpose whatever, or any political action on the part of the organization.&#34; </para>

I am sure that my honorable friends realize that I am merely mentioning a simple fact, that this proviso to preclude preference in the case of&#39; an organization which is political as well as industrial, and which they are now attacking here, was carried by the votes of their own party in the other Chamber, and by a majority of one against those who wanted something which they considered more drastic. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to enlarge the consideration of the matter beyond the point we have under discussion. I think it is a simple fact j its significance I leave to my honorable friends. I now come to the third matter about which I wish to say a few words. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> asked a question in regard to clause 62, and I promised to refer to it. This is the first of a series of three clauses under which, in a case of special emergency, the Governor-General has power to- proclaim any association as an organization under the Act. It will only be brought into force in a case of great emergency, in which, owing to the extension of a trade dispute from one State perhaps to all the States of the Commonwealth, at any rate to another State, it has assumed the dimensions practically of a national industrial revolt - whether this is due to employers or employes is not the question - and where it is necessary that the arm of the Executive should&#39; be brought into play. </para>

                        <para>- As- my honorable friend puts it, it is practically only applicable in the case of a party defendant. Of course a provision of that kind is drastic, and interference by the Executive in that way is only conceivable in the event of a crisis of a very alarming character, affecting the objects to be met by the general provisions with regard to conciliation and arbitration. But these provisions do not in any way affect the view which I took the liberty of submitting to honorable senators last night. I am anticipating a little, sir, with a view to explaining its relevance to the very important matter we are considering, as suggested toy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> In the first place, it is greatly safeguarded, because the proclamation may limit entirely the organization - </para>

The old organization is governed by its own State rules, which are untouched!; but when it registers under this measure it adopts rules. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is anticipating what I was going to say. This clause does not in any way lessen the force of the argument as to the changed status so to speak of the organization. &#34;The measure does not interfere with existing trade unions in a State. Because when a union becomes an organization under this measure, it does so under a new set of rules applicable to, and for the purposes of this measure. If it is a proclaimed organization, great care has been taken to make the same principle apply. The proclamation of an association does not deprive it of the power to make its own rules. The second paragraph of clause 63 says that if it does not make rules in conformity with the measure, the Court may prescribe or frame the rules. But in every case they must be new rules under the new legislation. </para>

Attention has been called to clause 62, which does not in any way affect the difficulties we are discussing in connexion with clause 55, and it leaves untouched the position that when an association registers, or is proclaimed under this Bill, provision is made so that rules applicable to the new state of things may be adopted, and if not adopted, shall be framed and applied by the Court. </para>

                    <para>- The Attorney-General, with a view to influence those honorable senators who did not anticipate this difficulty when they brought forward1 their objections to our former amendment, has now anticipated the point that he conceived that we were going to raise, and which must have a considerable effect upon their minds. It was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> who first introduced to the notice 11 d 2 of the Committee the point that there could be an organization for the purpose of this measure only. I must say that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> first brought forward that point, it appealed with very great force to me, and it seems to me that it was a perfectly logical view for the honorable senator to take, that without in any way endeavouring to influence or interfere with existing organizations in respect of their political rights, you could put into this Bill very sweeping words barring the organizations from taking political action. But I pointed out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> by way of interjection, that I believed that he had entirely overlooked the fact that while that was possible with new organizations, something else might occur. That was this - that the Governor-General could proclaim an existing organization as an organization&#39; within this measure. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson&#39;s</inline> .theory -entirely fell to the ground. For this reason, that when the Governor-General proclaimed an existing organization as an organization within this measure, then that organization could be forced into Court as a defendant. I will instance a case. </para>

                        <para>- But let me point out a phase of the case which the honorable and learned senator entirely ignored. Take the Seamen&#39;s Union. Suppose that that union takes (the advice which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> says he will give them if this clause is passed in its present form, and that they do not register under the Bill. Suppose that the ship-owners do register. Suppose that, later on, a dispute arises between the two parties - no matter who starts it. Suppose the seamen demand an increase of wages, and determine to go on strike, as the coal-trimmers of Newcastle have gone on strike in defiance of the law. Here would be a maritime strike which would lay the whole of our shipping idle. Do not honorable senators think that that would operate as a powerful inducement to the Government of the day to advise the Governor-General to use the power given to him In clauses 62, 63, and 64, to proclaim the Seamen&#39;s Union an organization within the meaning of this Bill ? </para>

                        <para>- Before the rules are touched the union has to be proclaimed an organization. The Governor-General, when proclaiming a union an organization, would not say, &#34; Let me see your rules.&#34; He would proclaim it first, and the organization would have to bring its rules within the meaning of the Act. If it did no1:, the organization could not evade the law by having one set of rules to meet the provisions of the Act, and another set to evade it. The organization so proclaimed would be the Seamen&#39;s Union. Its rules would go with it. Its funds would go with it, and its officers would go with it. Its members would go with it also. They could not retire from it while the dispute was pending. Neither could they retire their funds while the dispute was pending. The Governor-General would have proclaimed the Seamen&#39;s Union, whose members were on strike, or who would be about to go on strike, as an organization under clause 62. What would happen then ? The power of adopting rules conferred by clause 56 would apply to any proclaimed organization. The Seamen&#39;s Union have rules which, if they were adopted, would debar them from getting preference. They would, therefore, have to bring their rules within clause 56. They would have to draft new rules or to have a separate set of rules, as provided by clause 56. If they did not do that, what would happen? The Governor-General would do it for them. And remember - this is my point - &#39;that no matter if they say, &#34; We will still maintain our old rules as a separate set,&#34; their funds, which are the life-blood of their union, would go with the rules and with the organization. They could not take the funds of the proclaimed organization, and give them to the organization carried on under the old rules. Therefore, the old organization would practically have to frame rules in accordance with this measure. What would happen then? They would have to appear as defendants in the Arbitration Court, because the ship-owners had cited them to appear. Now see what their position would be.. Having been cited to appear as defendants, they would have to make out a case before the Court. Has it not been contended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford, Senator Matheson,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> that unions have a right to preference </para>

                        <para>- But the honorable senator and others, by their votes, have said that preference ought to be given. Otherwise I cannot understand their votes. If preference is not a good thing, I cannot understand that the unions would ever apply for it. Why did the Government, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> was a member, put in the preference provision if it was not a good thing? Every union, if this limitation were &#39;taken out, would apply for preference. They know its value in safeguarding their officers from the boycott. Now, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s amendment strikes at party political action. Honorable senators opposite have contended that they do not object to trade unions, even when they are organizations under this measure, taking political action, if it is not of a party character. </para>

                        <para>- A number of cases have been cited by honorable senators on this side to show that some political action on the part of the unions is absolutely necessary. Action in regard to accommodation for seamen and accommodation for shearers is not of a party character. Action in regard to Employers&#39; Liability Acts is not of a party character. T say that these are not party matters, because they are questions upon which politicians of all parties are agreed, and are willing to take action. They are questions which affect trade unions as trade unions, and there is every right to take action regarding them ; indeed, trade unions would not be representing and acting in the interests of the trades, unless they did take such action. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s amendment is that after the words &#34; or binding decisions,&#34; there shall be inserted the words &#34;compel or require any. of. its members to vote for or subscribe to the funds of a political party.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- That is not the question ; the question is what would a union&#39;s. life be worth if it disregarded the provisions of the Act ? The Registrar has a whip, which he can hold over a union, and which no union can afford to disregard. The registration of a union may be cancelled, or the union may be sued for breach of award, involving the confiscation of the funds, and - the fining of individual members. I ask honorable senators who hold the view that separate organizations could be formed for the purposes of this Bill to remember that the Governor-General may proclaim an existing organization; and it is a mere evasion to say that after proclamation an organization could divide itself. The organization proclaimed is the organization which owns the funds, and which has certain rules ; and it is those rules - and not any new rules, as the Attorney-General attempted to show - which have to be brought into conformity with the Bill. An organization, having- come under the Bill by proclamation, is then placed in a position to get preference, and it has to alter its existing rules by eliminating all reference to political action. It is admitted that it is necessary for unions to take political action apart from party politics. </para>

                        <para>- Those honorable senators who intend to vote against the amendment say that, while it may have been necessary on the part of unions to take political action in the past, unions shall under this Bill be debarred from the advantage of preference, unless they cut themselves off from political action in the future - political action, not only of a party character, but of a general character, an industrial character, and even of a municipal character. It was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie that the Amalgamated Workers&#39; Association of Western Australia has on many occasions taken part in political action not of a party character, and that certain honorable senators have co-operated with that association in such political action. Then we were told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> that the branches of the Australian Workers&#39; Union in the back blocks of Queensland take part in municipal and political affairs, though not of a party character, in the interests of their members. Then again the Seamen&#39;s Union takes action in the interests of masters, officers, and men iri matters purely associated with the trade, but at the same time of a distinctly political, though not of a party political character. There is no defence left for the clause as it stands ; and all honorable senators may consistently support the amendment, which prevents party political action either in the direction of coercing members, or in connexion with the funds. The only time when political action of a party character can be taken is when there is absolute unanimity in the union - when every member is willing to take action, and spend the funds on party political lines. In such a contingency there is no coercion, and, therefore, there is no necessity for a clause to prevent men carrying out their unanimous wish. I hope that with these fresh considerations before them, the Committee will see that the clause as it stands is far too sweeping. There is no honorable senator who is prepared to say how far it may operate. </para>

                        <para>- Yes.; they cover any possible action on the part of a union. On the other hand, the amendment is perfectly cleary and could be easily interpreted by any Court It would enable an organization to. know what disability it incurred when an application was made for preference, and, in the interests of moderation, I appeal to honorable senators to vote for a proposal which is definite and clear, and which meets all possible objection. </para>

                    <para>- I must say that I have to a certain extent been struck with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said in connexion with clauses 62 and <inline font-style="italic">64.</inline> I do not propose, however, to deal with those clauses in the first place, but to confine myself to the amendment actually before us. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie insist that the amendment leaves no scope for party political action on the part of an organization, and on that ground simply, we are asked to vote for the amendment. It is said that party political action is barred, and that all that is asked for by the amendment is freedom to take part in other classes of political action. What we have to do is to analyze the clause as it stands, and see how far it is affected by the amendment. The clause as it stands provides two separate, and entirely distinct conditions - a fact, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie appears to have overlooked. First of ail, the rules must not permit the application of the funds of an organization to political purposes. The second distinct proviso is that an organization shall not require its members to do anything of a political character. We must keep these two provisos entirely distinct in our mind when we discuss the amendment, and immediately we begin to apply the amendment to the clause, cut up in that way, we find that it would have been just as effective if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie had proposed to strike out the words from &#34;permit&#34; to &#34;purposes.&#34; In fact, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie had moved to strike out the words &#34; permit the application of its funds to political purposes, and to leave the balance of the clause subject to trifling verbal amendments, his object would have been achieved. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, the head of Parliament in that sense ; but the sending of that petition to the Queen did not make the movement a political one. All this argument is entirely beside the question, because we are dealing with organizations formed for specific purposes under the Bill. One of the primary objections I have is to the using of pressure to force persons into an association, the funds of which may be used for political purposes. I am asked by honorable senators opposite to bring pressure to bear upon persons to compel them to join unions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s amendment cuts out the restrictive part of the proviso so far as its first contingency is concerned, that is to say, the use of the funds of the association for political purposes. I cannot agree with the contention that any one member of an organization who objected to the use of its funds for political purposes could appeal to the Court to prevent that, if the rules permitted it. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators must face the fact that if we have a preference provision at all, men to get employment on equal terms with unionists must join their union. They may be men of an absolutely conservative turn of mind, and with no sympathy whatever for democratic principles. I have met many such men, and are they to be debarred on that account from joining the union? </para>

                            has objected to clauses 62 to 64, and it seems to me that those clauses would have the effect which
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                            represents. &#34;Under them the Governor-General would be able, in cases of emergency, to compel such a union as the Seamen&#39;s Union to become an organization under this Bill, and, in doing so, the members of that union would undoubtedly lose their rights of preference. I quite agree with
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                            that it is impossible to split hairs, and say that a union on one side of its face has political objects, and on the other has not. But I also agree with what the Attorney-General has said, and that is that these clauses could only be brought into operation in exceptional circumstances.

                        <para>- I looked into the matter carefully yesterday, and I arrived at the same conclusion as did the Attorney-General, that it is only in the very last resort that any Executive would dare to use the power given under these clauses. I go a little further than the Attorney-General went, and I say that if it became necessary for the Executive of the Commonwealth to take advantage of these clauses, the condition of affairs would be such that the Bill would become inoperative. I consider that these three clauses are practically useless, and I am prepared to support honorable senators opposite in striking them out. </para>

                            objects to the clauses, and still insists upon having them. I do not think that they are in the least necessary. They would be operative only in extreme circumstances, and as they interfere with what, in my opinion, is an essential part of the Bill, I am prepared to have them struck out.

I desire to draw his attention to a case which occurred only the other day, which will show the injustice which might be done if the course suggested by the honorable senator were adopted. There is on the statute-book of Queensland an Income Tax Act which compels every one who earns any money whatever during the year, if it should be only one shilling, to pay an income tax of10s. per year to the Queensland Government.

                        <para>- The Liability to pay this additional Queensland tax is strongly objected to by members of the Seamen&#39;s Union who are domiciled in the other States, and have to pay the taxation demanded of them in those States. As a consequence a number of men ha.ve refused to pay this tax in Queensland, and have refused to accept their wages in a Queensland port. But under the Queensland Act the employer is proclaimed a collector of income tax under the Act, and he is compelled to collect the tax in every case, under a penalty of &#163;5. A number of the seamen have said, &#34; We will only accept our wages in the port where we signed our articles.&#34; The <inline font-style="italic">Peregrine</inline> is one of the ships on which a difficulty in this connexion took place, and the ship-owners said to the men, &#34; We shall pay you in Melbourne, but we will make this deduction.&#34; The laws of Victoria would not allow them to make the deduction, but the employers said, &#34;We are not going to pay this money ourselves.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- They were quite right from their point of view. They say, &#34; If we are compelled to pay, you will have to go out of our ship.&#34; The result in the case to which I refer was that the men were discharged. Cannot honorable senators see that there are here the makings of a maritime strike? It is possible that before long not a single man will agree to the deduction from his wages of10s. a year for the Government of Queensland, and will refuse to go to Queensland ports. We took counsel&#39;s opinion on the point, and found that the law was against us. Yet honorable senators on the other side would not allow the Seamen&#39;s Union to spend a penny of their funds for the purpose of bringing about an alteration of the law. </para>

                        <para>- The Queensland branch is prepared to pay this income tax. It is no hardship for its members to pay an income tax in a State in which they get all the protection they desire. But it is a hardship upon men who are domiciled in New South Wales or Victoria, and who pay a State income tax, to be compelled to contribute to a second State which virtually does nothing for them The seamen who are domiciled outside Queensland have not a vote, in that State, and therefore it is a case of taxation without representation. It has been held by the Courts that persons who have invested their money in Queensland debentures, with the interest payable in London, are not liable to pay income tax. We are advised, on the best legal authority, that even although the wages accrue in Queensland ports, and are payable in. another State, the seamen have to pay the income tax. Yet honorable senators would give the Seamen&#39;s Union no preference if they had a rule on the subject, or passed a resolution for the purpose of distributing literature or publishing advertisements asking the people of Queensland to remove &#39;this disability from the seamen who visited their ports. The case of the captains ought, I think, to convince honorable senators that they are doing a gross injustice in adhering to the position they have taken up. Would it not be a legitimate thing for the masters to combine for the purpose of protecting the interests of their profession, and seeing that laws were not passed to their detriment? </para>

                        <para>- Surely honorable senators do not wish to take away from captains the privilege of safe-guarding their interests as far as they may be affected bv legislation, and in expending a reasonable portion, of their funds for that purpose? If a master makes a mistake - if it is thought by some person that he has made a mistake, he is brought before a Court of Marine Inquiry, and called upon to defend himself. In different. States regulations are being passed requiring shipmasters to possess certain physical qualifications, and to have their eyesight tested every year. There is no class which is so much hampered by legislation as the seafaring class, yet honorable senators oi&#62; the other side would absolutely debar seafaring me;; from combining and establishing a fund to look after their special interests. </para>

                        <para>- What was the primary cause of the great maritime strike? It was the food which was supplied to the men. The trouble originated on a Tasmanian boat, and developed until it threw the whole of Australia into a turmoil. The food, which is part of the wages, is; regulated by law. The accommodation for the men and the payment of their wages are also regulated by law. It is suggested that the seamen could have two unions. But under clauses 62 and 63 even a political union could be proclaimed. We are told that it would only be as a last resort that the Government would proclaim a union. But we know from bitter experience that during the heat and turmoil of a strike or lock-out a Government will take pretty strong action for the purpose of quelling the strikers. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> quite realizes what his proposal to omit clauses 62 and 63 means. The senators for New South Wales would be only too glad to support such an amendment, because it would leave the Act without any compulsion. Suppose that the Seamen&#39;s Union or the Shearers&#39; Union had a dispute extending beyond the borders of the State, and wished to appeal to the Court, with a view to preventing disaster overtaking, not only themselves, but the commercial interests of the Commonwealth. Without those provisions in the Act no power would be available to make the employers appear before the Court. A strike would take place, and then people would want to know why legislation was passed which was absolutely ineffective, since it applied to only one party. It has been urged by the Attorney-General and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> that it would only be as a last resort that an organization would be proclaimed. But very strange things have been done by a Government during a strike. In Queensland the military were called out, and camped all over the place. In many cases men were brought up and imprisoned for doing things which, I believe, were not against the law. In cases where men were charged the Executive sent special men to the districts with the object of manufacturing bogus evidence to secure their conviction. Not only were those things done in Queensland, but the Government forced through Parliament an Act to enable their officers to stop any man on the road in proclaimed districts, take him back 20 or 30 miles, examine him there, and if he had in his possession nothing which would incriminate him, so far as his connexion with an organization was concerned, turn him loose on the road. Men who were camped on the road were aroused in the middle of the night by troopers who were going round with the avowed object of seeing that the law was being observed. Yet we are told that a Government will do nothing of this sort, except as a last resort. During the maritime strike in 1891 things were done which I believe no Government would attempt to do in calm moments. In New South Wales a warrant was written out for the arrest and imprisonment of every man who was taking part in that strike as a responsible official. Is that an action that would be done by men in cool and calm moments? It was only because of the turmoil of a strike that the Executive at that time scarcely knew how to deal with affairs, and were prepared to resort to any measure, with a view to quell a possible disturbance. </para>

                        <para>-The law was not powerless at all. In nearly every case the men were most law-abiding. There might have been a few cases where men went to extremes. That is usually so. But the Government were prepared to take action in the heat of the time which they would not have considered for a moment if they had been cool and calm, and had reasoned out what the results would be. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that. A fair statement of our case has been put before the Committee by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> It is all very well to say that the organizations will not register under the measure. They may say, &#34; We do not want your Act, and do not desire to have anything to do with it ; we prefer to keep in our hands the power to strike when there is a dispute between ourselves and our employers.&#34; The proviso we are considering might become one of the greatest engines of oppression ever passed by a Parliament to deal with trade unionists. In the event of the members of a union wishing to keep clear of registration altogether, because they cannot refrain from political action in matters affecting their trade, or matters of State politics, or municipal politics, this measure enables the Executive - which, as I say, may act under an impulse - to compel the organization to register, or to proclaim it as an organization, and force it to alter its rules and regulations, and even to confiscate every penny of its funds which the men have been subscribing ro for years with the object of securing soma; amelioration of the conditions under which they work. At bottom, this is a deliberate attempt to retain in the hands of the Executive the power to break up organizations, whenever a dispute may be pending, or actually taking place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> said that there is no need for these organizations to take political action - that they can form other organizations outside for political purposes. We have had a great deal of talk at one time and another about the strength of political organizations. I contend that the strength of political organizations outside the industrial organizations, is not worth a snap of the finger. Any person who has ever been acquainted, not only with political organizations of employers, but with political organizations of workmen, must realize that they have absolutely no strength apart from industrial purposes. Employers&#39; organizations in times of strife are able to command enormous sums of money, with the object of defeating trade unions. But these same employers&#39; organizations, when they endeavour to work together to take political action, are comparatively weak. In Queensland, just before the last general election, there was a tremendous blare of trumpets about the effort that was to be made on the part of the employers. There was a great meeting  in the Centennial Hall, at Brisbane. There was to be no whisky or anything which might inflame the passions and the utterances of men. It was to be just a tea party. They wanted  &#163;10,000  as a fighting fund, and many thousands of pounds were promised by the people who assembled. </para>

                        <para>- The chairman of the Pastoralists&#39; Association, and the chairman of the Employers&#39; Union. They wanted to form a fund distinct altogether from their funds for industrial purposes. I believe that the whole amount that they were able to get. throughout Queensland was a little over ^2,000. If there had been an industrial dispute, they would have b,een able to raise two or three times that amount for the purpose of defeating the organizations, of workmen. But when a question of politics was concerned, men said, &#34; We are nor prepared to make any effort to help you. We will find money for you for industrial purposes, but in political matters we prefer to retain our own freedom.&#34; Then take the political organizations of workers. It is of no use to blink the fact. We are told that the workmen are splendidly organized, and are able to command the services of numbers of helpers. But, as a matter of fact, the political organizations outside the industrial unions are very weak. I myself know of political organizations of workmen that consist of twenty -five or thirty members. These men are prepared to work at all times, with the object of creating political feeling, but they have never been able to do much, apart from the industrial organizations. What they have been able to do is this : By their consistent work they have been .able to point out to the great majority of workers in the labour unions that their interest lies in a certain direction. The drift of opinion amongst the members of organizations runs in the direction pointed out, because they realize that their interests lie in that direction. When an election comes round it is difficult to induce them to subscribe to the funds of a political organization, though, at the same time, their votes will be cast in the direction advocated by the members of the political organizations. That has been the case in Queensland, at any rate. When we are told that we have powerful political organizations, we reply that their power depends principally upon the strength of the labour organizations. Our industrial unions would be fifty times better off if this Bill were thrown into the waste-paper basket rather than passed in its present form. It is not only absolutely useless - it not only gives no protection whatever to the men . who have been carrying on organizations for a number of years - but it can be used&#34; as a positive engine of oppression to crush out of existence industrial organizations as they already exist. What is the use of honorable senators saying, &#34;We believe that trade unions have done a great deal of good, and that because this Bill is based upon organization the members of organizations should have preference,&#34; if at the same time they&#39; are prepared to vote for a clause which will practically destroy those organizations? Why vote for giving them preference, and at the same time put into the Bill a clause which not only precludes them from getting preference, but which, in the event of a dispute being engineered by employers, would enable ,the Executive to coerce the unions? I should also like to point out this further danger. I believe in agitation being open and above beard. When there is any dissatisfaction, if you attempt to stifle it you merely force it underground. You do not kill it.. By-and-by you will have a far greater disaster than you would have had by allowing the discontent to come &#39; to the surface. Every one knows that coercive measures have the effect of making men resort to actions which they would never dream of taking under other circumstances. Honorable senators have again and again pointed that out with regard to political affairs in European countries. Yet here we are endeavouring to compel the members of industrial organizations to resort to fraud and subterfuge, with the object of securing their funds and enabling them to be used in the way that the people who subscribed them intended. If the unions desire to take action in connexion with municipal, State, or Federal politics, it would be far better for the community to give them an opportunity to do so rather than force through a clause which will practically have the effect of driving discontent underground, where even the Executive of the day, with all the force they are able to command, will not be able to check it. </para>

                        seems to think that if, after men have practically been compelled or induced to come into unions, they are unanimous as to political or any other matters, political action should not debar them from claiming preference. But when men are practically compelled to join unions, they are practically compelled to surrender their liberty. I presume that about two-thirds of the workers, or, at all events, a large number, remain outside the unions. Some do so because, as
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline>
                        pointed out, they are conservatives, &#39; and do not believe in all the methods of the

But when all classes of workmen find that under the preference clause they cannot get work, so long as there is a unionist idle, they will be induced or compelled by legislation to join a trade union; and it is then they surrender their freedom and liberty. And when they have been compelled to join, I should not be at all surprised if they all, lamb-like, did: what the committee of management told them, and sat passively by while the union funds were being used for political or any other purposes. I do not agree with the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who has not got rid of the objection which he perceives, namely, that the compulsion and surrender of liberty occur when, in order to get employment side by side with unionists, men have to join organizations. </para>

                            has made a very interesting speech, which, however, had nothing to do with the provision before us. The honorable senator describes this legislation as most oppressive; but I do not think that any such language can be fairly used. I reminded the Committee a night or two ago of the reason why this proviso was inserted ; but the Attorney-General has dwelt upon that point at much greater length. Having given preference to unionists - a preference to which many of us utterly object, and to which all&#39; of us see some objection - this proviso forbidding unionists to take political action is a natural consequence. When we come to consider clauses 62, 63, and 64, together with the schedule which provides for rules, we shall find that we have got ourselves into a very complicated position. Every union will have to set to work to frame new rules before it can become an organization under the Bill.

                        <para>- I am glad the honorable senator agrees with me in that Schedule B declares that unions which register must have certain rules, and I am driven back to the opinion which I have held from the first, namely, that the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> in another place represents the only proper way in which to deal with this matter, and that all organizations should be compelled to register for the purposes of the Bill only. I cannot accept the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, because, rightly or wrongly, I think that compelling men to join unions in order to get work side by side with unionists- </para>

                        <para>- I am. We have no business, in any shape or way, to compel men to join a political association. The desire of honorable senators opposite is to get rid of this sweeping provision, but the provision was intentionally made sweeping. Another place has said, and I believe rightly, that if unionists are to have the great advantage of preference, they must have nothing to do with politics. </para>

                        <para>- I say that this Bill will be incomplete unless it contains the provision now before us. Every well-drawn Bill searches about for plaintiffs and defendants ; the whole meaning is that this Bill must be worked by organizations of employers on the one hand, and organizations of employes on the other. If an organization of employers wished, as may happen once in fifty times, to invoke the Court, and the employes&#39; union disbanded or declined to register in order to avoid meeting the employers, the Act would be very badly drawn if it did not give the Court power to name a defendant or some person to represent the union. </para>

                        <para>- No. I am dealing with circumstances under which, there being no union of employes, the Court has power to proclaim one. But I agree with the honorable senator that, all through this Bill, unionists will be driven to subterfuge, simply because they want priority, and, at the same time, desire to expend their funds for political purposes. And no Bill will prevent them doing so. </para>

                        <para>- I do not desire to define those words, and I shall not do so. Unions ought to have nothing to do with politics, so long as they claim priority. Let them give up priority ; and if then they like, they may kill themselves by an undue use of the political machine. It is only a piece of subterfuge on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> to ask whether the presenting of a petition to Parliament would, under this clause, be &#34; political &#34; action. It is not relevant to the matter before us to answer such a question. The clause is perfectly plain - the intention of another place is perfectly plain. The unions are to have nothing to do with politics - they must not spend their funds for political purposes, or do anything of apolitical character, so long as they claim preference. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> and others declare that this clause presents great complexity, but, as a matter of fact, it is as plain as the sun at noonday - give up preference, and the unions may go on with their politics. Schedule B shows that unions register for the purposes of the Bill only, and a. similar remark may be made as to the funds. If the subscription to a union be one shilling a week, I suppose the . funds necessary for the purposes of this Bill could be represented by a halfpenny. There ought to be rules drawn up for the purposes of Schedule B, and the subscriptions to the special organization should be ear-marked and kept separate from the other money, which could be spent as the unions please. All this, to my mind, is perfectly plain, and we have complexity, simply because unions desire to have preference, and to exert as much political power as they can get. </para>

                        <para>- We might also have expected some little unanimity amongst the legal members of the Senate, in guiding us laymen out of the darkness in which we are struggling in attempting to find the meaning of the words. Last night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> who is a lawyer, freely and frankly admitted that the words were as vague in meaning as it was possible for words to be, whereas now we have . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> declaring that their meaning is quite plain. Time and again we have, by way of interjection, asked the Attorney-General to define the meaning for the satisfaction of the Committee, or at any rate, for the satisfaction of honorable senators on this side. The Attorney-General, however, has, I shall not say deliberately, evaded the question, but he has not treated the Committee with quite that amount of courtesy we might expect from one in his position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> last night went to the length of telling those who are in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s amendment how the provision could be evaded. What is the use of fooling the public or ourselves? Either the proviso is a good thing or a bad thing ; and why should we pass it as it stands, and at the same time acknowledge to ourselves, and declare to the world, that we know perfectly well how it may be evaded? That is not the spirit in which to approach important legislation of this character. </para>

                            Turley&#39;s remark was, I think, drawn, and rightly drawn, from him by the observations of

                            last night. It is not right to pass a provision of this importance, and at the same time declare, as it has been declared, that it is a farce and a sham. It has been suggested that the members of an organization may, by a little subterfuge, form themselves into another organization, and do exactly what the provision seeks to prohibit.

I am as anxious as any member of the Committee or as any man in the country, that no non-unionist or any one else shall be compelled to do anything of a political character against his conscience. But this clause, as it stands, is too far-reaching and too drastic, and I cannot understand how democrats like Senators Playford and Matheson, who are heart-whole in their desire to see this legislation made useful and effective, can be led away by the arguments of the other side. I think that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> who has given some thought to the matter, will, on fuller consideration, prefer the amendment.

                        <para>- Indirectly, the honorable and learned senator has slandered those who are supporting the preference clause; because he has said that we are trying to starve non-unionists. I think that every one will be able to judge at its true value the new-born tender regard for the non-unionist section of the workers of Australia which the honorable and learned senator has displayed. I am satisfied that the non-unionists and every other section of the workers of Australia know to whom they should appeal if they desire fo have justice done to them. They will not appeal to the Dobsons in the Parliaments of Australia, but to those who support preference to unionists. The workers generally will set at its true value all that has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and those who, with him, have repeatedly reviled and slandered in the most unfair way all who are supporting preference to unionists. </para>

                        <para>- The objection to preference to unionists which has been urged by honorable senators opposite is that it will compel non-unionists to enter unions, a certain portion of whose funds can be devoted to propaganda work in the interests of unionists, and also compel them to do something of a political character which is against their conviction. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s amendment meets that objection completely, and I should like to know what those who object to preference <inline font-style="italic">Vo</inline> unionists can urge against it. In the absence of the Attorney-General, I would ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council to say whether he does not think that either the Attorney-General or himself should clearly define what is meant by the words &#34; anything of a political character.&#34; It is very possible that we shall have a miners&#39; organization extending throughout the Commonwealth, and a mining dispute may be brought before the Court under this Bill. We know that the ventilation of mines in (Australia, and especially of our deep mines, is in many cases very bad. It is so bad, even in many of the shallow mines, that a large percentage of miners working in them die of miner&#39;s consumption in a very few years. I take the case of a mine, the ventilation of which is very bad, and in which unionists and non-unionists are working side by side. The unionists pass a resolution, which would be a binding decision, that in their interests they should approach the member for their district in the State Parliament to secure legislation for the improvement of the ventilation of mines. The resolution is carried at a meeting of unionists, and of course the non-unionists take no part in the matter. Later on a dispute arises in connexion with the mine, in which non-unionists and unionists alike are involved. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> say that, in such a case, when the dispute is brought before the Court, the unionists involved in it will be denied preference because under this proviso it will be held by the Court that they took action of a political nature ? </para>

                        <para>- The question has surely to do with immediate practical politics. It is a question which is most likely to arise under this Bill. We have agreed to a clause granting preference to unionists under certain conditions. In the case which I have put I think there can be no doubt that political action will have been taken by the unionists to secure the better ventilation of the mines, in the interests of unionists and non-unionists alike. A small portion of the funds of the union will have been devoted to carrying out that action, and later on, when a dispute occurs, in which unionists and non-unionists take part, the mine-owners, if they are inclined to be tyrannical, will have an opportunity to &#34; get back on&#34; the unionists who took this political action. According to our experience of some employers, it is likely that they will be disposed to vent their spite upon the unionist miners who took action to secure the better ventilation of the mine, and thus put the owners to extra expense. If they desired to discharge any men, the men whom they would discharge would not be non-unionists, but the unionists who, by their action, had put them to additional expense, and in the settlement of the dispute the Arbitration Court, under this proviso, would not have the power to grant preference to unionists, and that means that they would have to go. They would have to suffer for the action which they took to secure better conditions for the non-unionists in the mine, as well as for themselves. It is clear that such action as I have indicated would be political action, and, although the Committee have declared for the principle of preference to unionists in this Bill, honorable senators who assisted to carry that principle are now prepared to nullify it in a great measure by supporting the proviso to this clause. . </para>

                            is well aware that the exigencies of party government sometimes compel men to make a choice between two evils. The honorable senator is also aware that the members of our party in another place do not favour this proviso, and would have it made less drastic if they could. I am more strongly in favour of the amendment moved by
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline>
                            Largie than I was in favour of my own amendment to strike out the whole proviso. I did not think it was necessary, and for that reason I moved that it should be left out. I say with the utmost earnestness that I believe we shall do great injustice to trade organizations if we allow the proviso to remain as it is. If this amendment is not acceptable, can the leader of the Government or any other honorable senator suggest other words which, while they will prevent the danger which is feared, will still to some extent meet the desire of those on this side who do not like the words &#34; anything of a political character&#34;?

                        <para>- If the amendment is not carried I trust another amendment will be moved to make the wording of the clause less drastic and far-reaching. I think that even the Attorney-General should be willing to meet the wish of a large number of honorable senators who are willing to assist him to take out of the clause any danger of the kind he perceives. He might well show a little spirit of compromise, and meet us in the direction of making the clause less drastic. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie rose last night and moved his amendment the Attorney-General was going to accept it. </para>

                        <para>- I maintain that I am not mistaken. When the Attorney-General first read the amendment he was inclined to accept it. With his keen legal mind he would immediately have noticed if it contained any danger. He studied the amendment for a little while, and the very words with which he commenced his speech led me and others to believe that he was going to accept it. Practically he said, &#34;What a pity we have lost a day and a half in debating the amendment to strike out the clause when we were going to have this amendment moved.&#34; </para>

The words which the Attorney-General used last night led me and others to believe that hp was going to accept the amendment. But two or three honorable senators at once came along, and influenced him to some extent. Of course, he was quite within his rights in not accepting it. But as we on this side have shown a large spirit of compromise by moving the amendment, he ought to unbend now, and submit a proposal which might be acceptable to those who consider that the clause-is too far-reaching and binding. </para>

                        <para>- We are &#39;not dealing with individuals, but with organizations, whose political, rights are sought to be taken away by clause 55. I believe that if that were attempted to be done in any other way it would be condemned at once by all and sundry. I am satisfied that if trade unions were robbed of their political rights by this provision another kind of political organization would be brought into existence which might be less satisfactory to its opponents. In every country where an attempt has been made to put down constitutional agitation, public feeling has been expressed in other ways. Secret societies have been formed for the purpose of removing political tyrants, and have acted in such a way as to disgrace humanity. Trade unionists are neither better nor worse than the rest of humanity. Under similar circumstances we should have similar results in Australia as in Russia or America, or in any of the other countries where assassinations have taken place. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that if an attempt were made to crush the Australian worker, and to prevent the expression of his political feelings in an open constitutional manner, he would be driven into secret societies with results similar to those which have occurred in other countries. I am opposed to the introduction of secret societies into trade unionism, or Australian politics. An attempt was made a few years ago to organize the Knights of Labour on the gold-fields of Western Australia. Being president of one of the biggest organizations in the State, I was asked to join this secret society. I set my face against the formation of any such association on the gold-fields. I replied that I believed in constitutional methods, and intended to continue to exercise my rights as a citizen in an open, straightforward manner. I said that I declined to be a member of the Knights of Labour, because it was an attempt to carry on in a secret mariner the work which trade unions had always conducted in an open way. If, however, we had a law which prevented trade unions from giving public expression to their feelings, I should certainly agree to join a secret society. Human nature is the same the world over, and if clause 55 were successful in accomplishing the object of its framers, trade unions would find other means of carrying on their work. </para>

                        <para>- Worse means probably, so far as our political opponents were concerned. I believe that the greatest sufferers in the long run would be the opponents of trade unions. They might inflict much oppression and hardship, while they restrained the people from expressing their views in a constitutional way. But just as the despot has his hour of victory, so he has his hour of suffering. </para>

                            Gray has gone out of his way to interfere when the honorable and learned senator is quite capable of taking his own part.

                        <para>- There is no necessity for any heat, and if I misunderstood the Attorney-General&#39;s demeanour, I am sorry.. All through the debate the cry had been that minorities would be placed in a dangerous position if we insisted on forcing them to comply with the general wish of the unions - that is to say, that they should have no control over the funds of the unions, or over the manner in which they should vote at election times. I hold that my amendment reasonably safeguards the rights of minorities. Having defined what political action means, I do not see why my amendment should be objected to. Of course, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> contends for the total abolition of the political influence of the unions, I can understand his position. But he has shifted his ground very considerably if he takes up that attitude. </para>

                        <para>- I am pleased to know that, because the unions would never consent to .their political influence being taken away. That political influence is of greater value to them than any advantage that a compulsory arbitration law can give them. In the past the political influence of trade unions has been of the utmost service. At the time of the maritime strike in Sydney, such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> &#39; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> said that the unions did not go about their work in the proper manner. They said, &#34; Why bring about these industrial upheavals? Why punish the innocent as well as the guilty by these strikes? Why do you not send some men into Parliament, and endeavour to get your grievances redressed in a reasonable and constitutional manner &#34; ? We took them at their word, and I think they are very sorry that they ever gave the advice ; because the unions are to-day at the back of the most powerful political party in Australian politics. I can assure honorable senators opposite that if they think they are going to stem the .tide of the labour movement in Australia by these provisions, they are entirely mistaken. We are anxious to see this Bill placed upon the statute-book in a shape that would be of advantage to the industries of Australia. We do not wish to pass it for any political purpose. But apparently honorable senators opposite wish to use the Bill for the purpose of crushing the labour movement. There is always one consideration that should be remembered, and that is that honorable senators opposite are politicians of the Manchester school. They hold <inline font-style="italic">laissez faire</inline> principles. Therefore they can logically and conscientiously assume their present attitude. The great &#34; joss &#34; and founder of their school, John Bright, was the most bitter opponent of trade unions in England. So was Cobden, their other &#34; joss,&#34; who said that he would rather live under the rule of the Bey of Algiers than under trade union influence. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to draw attention to some of the influences which trade unions have exercised in the past. I do not wish to quote a partisan authority. I will not read the opinion of Tom Mann, John Burns, Ben Tillett, or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> I will quote the opinion of a writer who is looked upon as one of the greatest authorities in political thought of recent times - a man who in respect of political research has done more, perhaps, to throw  light  upon the industrial history of England than all the writers who went before him. I refer to Professor Thorold Rogers, at one time a member of the House  of Commons, and Professor of Political Economy in the University of Oxford. No one can say that his works are of a partisan character. In his <inline font-style="italic">Six Centuries of Work and Wages,</inline> at page 523, he refers to the work that has been done by trade unionists - a good work which they could not possibly do in the future if this clause were carried in its present form.

                    <para>My reader will observe that I set great store by the reparative energy of labour partnerships or trade unions in improving the material prospects of the working classes. These institutions were repressed with passionate violence and malignant watchfulness as long as it was possible to do so. When it was necessary to relax the severities of the older laws, they were still persecuted by legal chicanery whenever oppression could on any pretence be justified. As they were slowly emancipated, they have constantly been the object of alarmist calumnies and sinister predictions. I do not speak of the language used by newspapers and reviews which merely take the capitalist side of the question, and give anonymous utterance to the passion of the hour. Far graver were the allegations of such persons as Senior and Thornton, economists whom I knew and respected for their clearness of sight and the excellence of their intentions. Even my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mill,</inline> treated these forces of industrial life with a strange indifference. I confess to having at one time viewed them suspiciously ; but a long study of the history of labour has convinced me that they are, not only the best friends of the workman, but the best agency for the employer and the public, and that, to the extension of these associations, political economists and statesmen must look for the solution of some among the most pressing and the most difficult problems of our own time. </para>

                <para class="block">The opinion of Professor Thorold Rogers as to the good which has been done by trade unionism in the past, not only for the workers, but for the progress of all countries in which it has been permitted to operate freely, and for civilization generally, ought to carry some weight. I never yet met a really good employer of labour, who did not admit that trade unionism had promoted the interests of his particular industry ; and, while we may do some good by passing an Arbitration Bill, we shall certainly take away from the total benefit if we do anything calculated to lessen the influence and power for good of trade unions in any direction. There is scarcely a public question in the settlement of which trade unionism has not had a hand ; and I make bold to say that no society, no organization, no .institution, not even the church, has done so much good for suffering humanity as has trade unionism. We ought to consider well before we put the clock back merely for the sake of gaining a little political capital for the time being. That is really all that can be gained - party politics may benefit, but certainly politics will not benefit. The amendment has been proposed in order to prevent the exercise of party political influence by industrial organizations registered under this Bill. Surely that should be sufficient for any reasonable person ; and we on this side ought to be asked to make no further concession. People must be very short-sighted if they for a moment think it possible to thwart the aspirations of the working classes by crippling the political influence which has been used so well in the past. </para>

                        <para>- It is wonderful the time the honorable senator can occupy even when he has nothing to say. Trade unionism has lifted the masses out of the state of thraldom and semi-slavery in which they were steeped&#39; a few generations ago. Indeed, it is not necessary to go back generations ; I need only cast my mind back to the beginning of my own industrial life, and I am still, comparatively speaking, a young man. Such has been the vast improvement in the coal -mining industry, which I have followed since I was ten years of age, that when we contrast the conditions which prevailed in the early seventies in the west of Scotland with the conditions which prevail to-day, it is hard to realize that we are contemplating the same country or the same people. Just before the passing of the Coal Mines Regulation Act of 1872, the shocking state of ventilation in the mines of the old country was such that explosions were an every-day occurrence. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to show reasons why we should not in any way lessen the beneficent influence of trade unionism. At the general election in Great Britain in 1873, Alexander MacDonald, a native of my own town of Airdrie, was returned for an English constituency, along with Tom Burt, from the North of England, and these were the two first labour members who went to the House of Commons. They introduced a Coal Mines Regulation Bill, which, I am glad to say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> E. Gladstone assisted in passing. Had it not been for years of agitation and organization on the part of the miners throughout Great Britain, that Bill would never have passed. When we remember the grievances under which miners formerly worked, we can easily see the good which has been effected by political effort. </para>

I grant that we had sympathetic friends in other classes of society, such as Lord Shaftesbury, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone,</inline> and other reformers. </para>

                        <para>- No man hated the &#34; huckstering of the labour market, &#34; as he called it, so much as did Lord Shaftesbury. Considerably prior to the time to which I am now referring, Lord Shaftesbury had shown that the vast wealth which was being accumulated by individuals was due to the slavery imposed on women and children in the mines and factories of the Old Country. In my time women had been excluded from working below in the mines by Act of Parliament, but children were allowed to begin work almost at any age. I passed my tenth birthday in a coal-mine, and my case was not an unusual one; as a matter of fact, it was a general thing. Although I entered the mine very early in the morning, I never returned to the surface until very late a.t night, with the result that, in the winter, for week after week, and month after month, I never saw God&#39; s daylight, except on Sunday. I was in the mine long before the sun was up, and was still in the mine long after the sun had set. That is a condition of affairs which has been remedied by political influence. I may be told that all those grievances have been removed, and that ground for com plaint no longer exists ; but that is not so. Even in Victoria, as I mentioned last night, the ventilation and the sanitary conditions in the deep mines are almost as bad as they were in the Old Country in the early seventies. Considering the improvement that has obtained elsewhere it is a disgrace - to the people of Victoria that such conditions should be permitted in the mines. If this Bill were in operation in the form honorable senators opposite desire, and the Amalgamated Miners&#39; Association of Victoria petitioned Parliament on the subject, or sought to return a member - and; they are suffering now, because they have not done so - they would cut themselves off from the operation of the measure, so far as preference is concerned. I have no wish to make statements which cannot be proved, and I should like to refer honorable senators to articles which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Bendigo Advertiser</inline> on the subject of &#34;miners&#39; complaint &#34; or consumption, which is a disease brought about by bad ventilation. The pamphlet from which I quote is entitled &#34; Miners&#39; Complaint. The Primary Cause. How it may be combated. - A Reprint of Articles published in the <inline font-style="italic">Bendigo Advertiser</inline> in February and March, 1903.&#34; I find this stated - </para>

                    <para>That dreadful scourge generally known as &#34;miners&#39; complaint,&#34; but described in the medical world as &#34; tuberculosis in miners,&#34; is a subject upon which much has been spoken and written in Bendigo during the last twenty years, in fact, ever since our mines have penetrated deep down into the earth&#39;s treasure chest. </para>

                <para>And it is a subject which will continue to crop up for discussion until sufficient light is thrown upon it to show the way by which the community may effectively combat the ravages of the disease. To what extent Bendigo has actually suffered no one can tell. Accurate statistics are wanting. But the painful story need not be written in black and white, for it unfolds itself throughout the city and suburbs in all its painful details. We would fain close our ears to it, but the cry of men, aged in what should be their prime, of wives deprived of their husbands, of children in need of their bread-winners, is too piercing to be shut out. The facts are too glaring to escape our attention ; they intrude themselves upon us with a persistency which compels sympathy, and should compel practical assistance. Thanks to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. B.</inline> Stewart Cowen, who last year read a most interesting paper on this subject to the Eaglehawk branch of the A.N.A., we have abundant proof that that occupation is the most important factor in the case of Eaglehawk, at any rate, in causing a high mortality from tuberculosis. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cowen</inline> has gone into figures, showing that during the twenty years, ending 1901, the total number of deaths at Eaglehawk from tuberculosis was 318, as against 51 fatal accidents. These are convincing figures. They show that in Eaglehawk there are six times as many deaths from tuberculosis as from mining accidents. </para>

                <para class="block">The pamphlet is a very lengthy one, but I have read sufficient to show that there exists in Victoria at the present time the very grievance which the unionists of a generation ago sought to redress in the old country., and it must be redressed here in the cause of humanity. But if the miners of Victoria were to enter upon work of that kind, they would be told by the Court that they must be deprived of preference under this Bill. I could understand the attitude of the Government if its members were making any attempt to overcome the difficulty that this proviso, if passed as it stands, will prevent unionists continuing the good work in the cause of humanity in which they have taken so prominent a part in the past. The representatives of the Government in the Senate will not attempt to define what is &#34; anything of a political character.&#34; They have not shown any desire to limit the scope of the proviso as it presents itself to us. The Attorney-General has not minced matters. He says that unionists must not interfere in politics., and that their total exclusion from politics is the meaning of the proviso. If that be so, how can honorable senators opposite expect us to permit such a law to be passed without protest? I remind honorable senators that the work of trade unions is not confined to industrial matters, whether they be unions of employes or employers. Manufacturers&#39; associations do not confine themselves to the consideration of patents and improved methods which will enable them to increase the output of their factories. They take a hand in shaping politics where they consider their interests are involved. </para>

                        <para>- They will continue to do so, and honorable senators opposite cannot prevent them. We know that the members of farmers&#39; unions, when they meet, also take a turn at politics. Every organization, whether of employers or employes, enters more or less into the political field, and it is nonsense to suggest that we can have an organization that will not do so. For the same reason that organizations of employers take a hand in politics we say that unions of the working classes have a right to do likewise. We shall have nothing left to hope for in the future in the way of reform unless we continue to exercise our political power as a class for the betterment of working people. This is the course which has always been followed by trade unionists, and I am at a loss to understand what our place in the community would be if we did not continue to follow it. I hope that honorable senators who are disposed to vote against the amendment will give some reason for doing so. They should not vote against it unless they are able to show that there is no force in our contention that under this proviso as it stands our political influence will be curtailed. No attempt has been made to justify the proviso, except by saying that we are endeavouring to force men into organizations with the members of which they will not be in agreement politically. We have provided in the amendment a safeguard against anything of the kind, and I therefore trust that honorable senators opposite wil make some attempt to justify the attitude of opposition which they have assumed towards the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- The attitude which honorable senators opposite, and especially the Attorney-General, have assumed towards the amendment would be entirely inexplicable were it not for the fact that they have fold us that they are opposed to any form of preference. That is a full explanation of their objection to the amendment. The House of Representatives and the Committee of the Senate have decided in favour of preference to trade organizations for their own protection, and yet honorable senators opposite are now trying to nullify the provision to which we have agreed. The fact that this proviso is an afterthought is conclusively proved by the fact that it is made an addition tq clause 55, instead of being included in the clause dealing with preference. It is made an addition to a clause dealing with registered organizations, and any one who examines the Bill for a moment must see that it is out of place where it is, and must have been put there as an afterthought. I have no doubt that this proviso was introduced in another place, and is sought to be retained here, with the express intention - and I might even say with the avowed intention. - to nullify the decision that preference should be given. In view of what has already been done, I point out to honorable senators that it is quite conceivable that the rights of organizations and trade unions might be bitterly assailed in the future, and if this proviso is passed as it stands those organizations as such will be deprived of the power to take any political action whatsoever to prevent the political rights which they already have being taken away from them. It is within the bounds of possibility that men like .some of the honorable senators opposite may be disposed to go even so far as to take from trade unionists their votes. </para>

                        <para>- They did it when they passed the Act by which the State Parliament of Victoria disfranchised every man in the Public Service of the State. I believe- that if they thought they had any possible hope of succeeding they would to-morrow gladly try to deprive every trade unionist of his vote. I point out that this proviso is only an insidious and disguised attempt to do exactly the same thing. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear the honorable senator say so. I am stating what has been done only to show what those who are opposed to trade unionists might do in the future, and it &#39;is only what their adherence to this proviso seems to indicate some honorable senators would like to do in the present. Just as railway servants have been deprived of effective votes in Victoria, at some future time attempts might be made to deprive trade unionists of their votes. I have already stated that this proviso is an insidious attempt in that direction. If it were passed trade unionists would be absolutely powerless, as organizations, to protest even against an attempt to deprive them of their ordinary rights of citizenship. From the attitude of the Attorney-General last night, when the amendment was moved, I, in common with other honorable senators, was of opinion, that he was inclined to accept it as a reasonable compromise. But, having since heard his disclaimer, of course I know that I was wrong, and that he had no such intention. If he was right in the reasons he gave for opposing the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe,</inline> undoubtedly we were justified in expecting that he would accept the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. The whole ground taken up by him then was that under the provisions already passed, the tendency would be to compel men to join unions, and that therefore, it was not right or fair that any action could be taken by a trade union which would coerce any individual member to subscribe funds for political purposes, or for any political action. He applauded a similar statement when it was made from this side by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford.</inline> We wished to meet our opponents to the fullest possible extent, and, therefore, we proposed to put in a proviso which would not allow any individual to be coerced in any way. Having heard his previous arguments, it was only reasonable that we should expect the Attorney-General to accept this amendment. But what sort of attitude did he take up when it was moved ? He objected to the use of the words &#34; compel or require&#34; in the amendment and urged that the word &#34;permit&#34; should have been used. In making those statements he was merely throwing dust in the eyes of the public, because if the clause is read it will be found that whereas he wanted compulsion, we wanted freedom. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie wishes to amend the proviso to read as follows : - </para>

                        <para>-- We were not fighting the words which are in the clause &#39;at present, but the words &#34; compel or require &#34; in the amendment, to which the Attorney-General was objecting, and in which he said we should have used the word &#34;permit.&#34; He would have a set of rules drafted for the approval of the Court, so that a union should not even permit a man to vote to give a subscription towards the funds of any political party if he so desired, or to vote for any particular party. I have proved my contention that the Attorney-General and those who think with him wish to deprive trade unions and trade unionists of their votes. They would go to that length straight away if they could; and this proviso is an insidious attempt in an underhand way, if I may use that expression, to accomplish the same purpose. We have done everything which is reasonable to meet their objections. If they were in earnest when they said that they did not want political organizations to be made mere organizations for party purposes ; if they were in earnest when they said that they did not wish individuals to be dragooned, or controlled, or driven into contributing to party funds, or voting for any particular person, we have met them to the fullest extent. If they can suggest a way in which we can go further to meet their views, we shall be prepared to go that much further to accomplish that particular purpose. But they were not in earnest in what they said, as is shown by their attitude towards the present amendment. They object to all political action on the part of unionists. Time and again during this debate it has been shown that almost everything which a union does may sometimes have to be given a political colour, but entirely apart from party politics. Let me state a case which often occurred in Queensland before there was a Labour Party in its Parliament. On many occasions the Minister of Mines, in response to agitations, attempted to amend the regulations, which concerned &#39;the well-being, safety, and comfort of workers underground. In order to meet the wishes of the miners, and the mine-owners who were most interested, the Minister sent along a draft of the regulations to the Miners&#39; Union, and the MineOwners&#39; Association. As a member of the Miners&#39; .Union, on one occasion I acted with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson,</inline> and on other occasions when I was in different parts of the country, I acted with other men. Night after night we sat considering the proposed amendments, drafting suggestions for adoption by the Minister, and preparing a statement of our reasons for making them. Sometimes we had a conference with the Mine-Owners&#39; Association, in order to see if we could arrive at an amicable solution. Undoubtedly that was political action. Yet honorable senators opposite would deprive the unionists of the right to take part in such proceedings, or to do anything to insure a better set of regulations being adopted in that or any other industry .&#39; For what purpose are mines regulations chiefly designed ? First, to insure the safety of the lives of the people engaged in the industry&#93;; secondly, .to insure that the working conditions shall be as safe as possible, so as to protect the health and the limbs of the men from injury ; and, thirdly, to insure that the miners shall get as much as possible of the health-giving elements which are necessary, and which can be obtained underground. Very rarely is a Bill introduced for regulating the work which is done on the open fields. Why? Because the same necessity or danger does not exist. In the free open air, of course, there is no necessity for regulations regarding ventilation. A man is not then in a place where hundreds of tons of rock might fall upon him, or his comrades, and therefore there is no necessity to make any regulations in that regard. The Miners&#39; Union, whose safety, health, and well-being depend upon efficient political regulations being made for the management of the industry would be absolutely powerless to take any action, or to do a single thing in order to insure that any defects in the regulations would be remedied, or even that good regulations would be maintained. That is the position in which honorable senators would place us. Is it fair? We are willing to meet them more than halfway, in order to remove their main objection, if it was not put forward for some other reason. If, however, their objection is that the provision was only made to prevent men being forced into unions for political purposes, we have more than met them, because we are willing to put in the most drastic provision they can name, which will absolutely destroy any power that a union may have to take part in party politics. Will honorable senators meet us at all ? Do they possess any of that spirit of compromise about which they often talk to us so nobly? </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable senator that it is all compromise, because we are compromising all along the line. We are giving up the most powerful weapon which is known to modern times for the sake of getting peace. But what do we get in return? Honorable senators will not accept the decision, of the Committee. With one hand, they gave preference to us, and with the other they desire to take it away. That is a mere playing with words. They should not be imbued with that unreasoning spirit. We, on this side, are quite willing to meet them, but when an amendment ,to accomplish their expressed desire is moved, they immediately become silent. Their expressed desire does not find further utterance. Has a single reason, &#39; worthy of a moment&#39;s consideration, been given why this amendment should not be accepted? To unionists, non-unionists, and everybody else, we are giving the fullest possible freedom regarding political action in this amendment. That is what honorable senators opposite asked for and contended for. By this amendment, we say that no individual shall be either compelled or required to do anything of a political nature, to contribute to the funds of a political party, or to vote for any particular party. </para>

                        <para>- I know that many trade unionists have voted against me, as they had a perfect right to do. I believe I owed my defeat on one occasion to a number of votes having been bought from trade unionists by the person running my opponent. I never growled at any member of a trade union voting in any way he pleased. Honorable senators cannot point to a single instance in which any real attempt has been made to compel trade unionists to vote in a particular direction. Indeed, the ballot system would not permit any compulsion to be used. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has pointed out, the amount of good that has been accomplished by trade unions in the past cannot be disputed. The highest authorities on economic and social affairs, admit that trade unions have accomplished more for the salvation and emancipation of the workers than all other forces combined. The same is admitted by the leading statesmen in England to-day. Why then should an attempt be made to emasculate trade unions, and take away from them their power to accomplish similar work in the future? Do honorable senators opposite think that all that it is desirable to accomplish, has been done? I believe that there is still a great deal for trade unions to do for the betterment of the workers of Australia. The question of preference continually enters into this discussion. We are told that this is the price we have to pay for preference. I hoped that that question had been fully decided. Both Houses have agreed that preference shall be conceded. It has been fully shown to be absolutely necessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has shown from an instance regarding himself, and I have shown from my own case, that without preference, compulsory arbitration would be absolutely useless, and would simply result in victimizing the men who took a leading part in bringing cases before the Court. The secretary of the Anti-Sweating League of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline> has stated that, when the Wages Boards were first introduced in this State, the men who took a prominent part in the movement were systematically victimized. But preference being necessary, why give it with the one hand, and take it away with the other? A trade union as such can do nothing without a political colouring. All the good work which the unions have accomplished has been mainly in the direction of legislative action. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that it is expected that we should beg of the high influential men to grant benefits to the workers. We should go down on our bended knees to those who control the money bags, and the bosses of the financial institutions, and say, &#34; Will you please help us a little bit in carrying out these little ideas of ours.&#34; But we ask for no favours for the workman. It is not favours that we want, but rights, and if it takes us a hundred years, or a hundred decades, we shall get them. When I say &#34; we,&#34; I do not mean the representatives of labour in this Senate. I am speaking of &#34; we &#34; the workers of Australia; and, by-and-by, the workers of the world will be with us. Federation is in the air, and the time is not far distant when the organized employers of the world will have to face the organized workers. When that time comes, I have no doubt as to which side will secure the victory. Because, with all their boasted power and influence, and all their boasted wealth, the great capitalists and captains of industry would starve in a week if it were not for the workers. These people have to be spoon-fed, and they want to keep .a class in subjection and subservience to minister to them. It seems that honorable senators opposite are immovable on this question. No matter how faT we go to meet their wishes, we cannot satisfy them. I should have thought that they would gladly accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s amendment. We have gone the full length to meet the objections they have expressed, but they will not agree to what we propose. If they could suggest any further drastic proviso which would absolutely prohibit the unions as such from taking party political action or using the funds of the unions for the benefit of a party, I venture to say that honorable senators on this side would meet them to the full. But what they want is to clip the wings of the unions altogether. We are justified in saying that all this talk about the objections which honorable senators have to unions being allowed to exercise political power is hollow. If I were speaking in another place, I should say that it was so much arrant hypocrisy. I can understand the attitude of those who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> object to any preference. The Attorney-General himself said at one time that he objected to preference. But, as the leader of the Government in this Chamber, he does not propose to excise the provision relating to preference from this Bill. His Government father the measure, and yet it contains provisions to which they are totally opposed ! Why do not honorable senators opposite frankly accept the decision of&#39; the Committee that preference must remain in the Bill ? Both Houses of Parliament have agreed to the principle, but in the other House, at the instigation of a certain party, this proviso was inserted as an afterthought to nullify preference. The very fact that it was inserted in clause 55 instead of in the clause dealing with preference shows that it was an afterthought. Are we to be bound by the decision of another place, forced on parties there by political exigencies? We know the sort of fighting that has been going on there, and the necessity which sometimes compels parties to adopt provisions in which they do not altogether believe. But, at any rate, both Houses have affirmed the principle of preference, and! to nullify &#39;that principle afterwards by a subterfuge is unworthy of honorable senators. I shall vote for the amendment with the greatest of pleasure. If it is not carried, I shall be prepared to move another amendment in order to see whether we cannot meet honorable senators opposite. But I am afraid that they are mostly opposed to .preference altogether, and are doing their best to nullify it. No compromise will satisfy them. They are not amenable to reason. But we can accomplish one object, in showing to the country the sort of opposition that has been given to this Bill. We can let the public see that we are not the wild unreasoning party that honorable senators like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> represent. </para>

                        <para>- No language is too strong for honorable senators opposite and their press writers to use in denouncing us. This debate has shown that we are willing to meet our opponents in compromise to the fullest possible extent. But without preference this Bill would be useless, and preference with this provision attached would make the measure mischievous. The unions are being asked to give up a power, and are offered a stone in exchange ; because without preference the Bill would&#39; merely enable the employers to victimize every man who took any action to bring a case before the Arbitration Court. </para>

                    <para>- I regret that as usual I am struck with a run of hard luck. When this principle of preference was under discussion formerly, 1 propounded one or two questions to the legal light of the Government, but there was such a rush of eager talkers that the Attorney-General was not allowed to answer them&#39;. I believe that he made portion of an answer last night and another portion this morning. I had no opportunity to deal with his replies at the time, and now that I have an opportunity the honorable and learned senator is not here. </para>

                        <para>- I have not read that book, but I have had it in chapters from the author himself in several speeches in this Chamber. The attitude of the Government, and that of some honorable senators who are supporting the Government, is very difficult to understand. I have heard it suggested that honorable senators like Senators Walker and Gray are enthusiastically supporting the Government, not because they are antagonistic to trade unions, or because they have any deep designs on the Labour Party. but because of pure love and affection for trade unions. They know that prior to the introduction of the purifying influence of the Labour Party in the political arena, politics were very corrupt, and their regard for trade unions is such that they would prefer them not to dabble in politics, lest they lose their purity in the operation. It is quite possible that that is the motive; but those honorable senators could attain their end in a very much better way by using their influence to increase the number of the Labour Party, and thus insure pure politics. The contradictory attitude of some honorable senators has already been referred to. By one clause it has been decided to give preference to unionists, and now, by the clause before us, it is .proposed to take away that preference. I want it to be clearly understood that if the intention of the honorable senators who voted to give unions preference was genuine, their support of the Government on this clause is not genuine, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa</inline> - that they merely allowed the preference clause to pass, keeping up their sleeve the provision now before us, in order, by its means, to take away the advantage previously conferred. It is said that unions are not entitled to preference, if they have any connexion as an organization with politics - if they do anything of a political character. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that anything which has a political bearing, or the slightest semblance of politics, is banned by this particular provision. In maintaining that position, honorable senators seem to lose sight of the double-barrelled nature of this particular provision. One part of this proviso deals with the matter of union funds, and if the provision ended there, it would be well ; but it proceeds to place under a ban any union which requires its members to do anything of a political character. These are two different matters altogether, but they are dealt with in the one proviso. There is no one on this side of the Chamber who is not willing to assist the Government to provide as many safeguards of a drastic nature as may be desired in connexion with the distribution of trade union funds. But when it is sought to deny trade unions the advantage of the Bill, because they do anything of a political character, or anything which has a political bearing, or any relationship to politics, that is going far beyond what any reasonable man expects. </para>

                        <para>- Of course. By the way, &#34; trade unions &#34; is not a correct term, because the organizations of to-day embrace all trades and occupations. &#34; Trade union &#34; to a large extent indicates a particular class or kind of work, whereas unions, as we understand them now, embrace all classes of work. From that point of view, I should like any honorable senator to indicate any action which has been taken in the past, or is likely to be taken in the future by any industrial organization, which could not be said to have a political bearing. Can any honorable senator mention such a case, either in this, or any other State of the. Commonwealth? If my view is correct, what is the value of all this talk about political dominance in our industrial unions? If unions are to be denied preference because they enter politics - if they are to be denied the right of political action, and are to organize, as has been suggested, and alter their rules and constitution so as. to specifically state what are the objects of the organizations - all I can say is that we are weakening the structure which we have for years been building up, and the value of which we have proved. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators on the other side are very eloquent on the rights and protection to be accorded by the community through Parliament, to vested interests of a particular kind, of which they have almost a complete monopoly. But when the vested interests are those of the great bulk of the working people, those interests seem to lose a great deal of their glamour and brightness in the eyes&#39; of honorable senators opposite. </para>

                        <para>-What I do know is that all capitalists are not workers. Vested interests, in the particular sense in which we regard them, mean a marketable commodity, and if capital is &#34; stored up labour,&#34; the trade unions, under the new organization, have, as a result of their labour, become possessed of capital. And whatever the intention may be, the direct result of adopting the clause as it stands would be to filch from the labour organizations of to-day the capital which they have stored up by means of hard labour over many years. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is a lover of -fair play - if he is really a champion <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> vested interests, regardless of the class which possesses them - his plain duty is to vote for the protection of the stored-up capital of the labour organizations, which is jeopardized by the Government proposal. The representatives of labour are asked to deliberately undo the work of years, and to weaken the industrial organizations, simply because of sheer timidity or &#34; blue funk &#39; &#39; on the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;ait</inline> of honorable senators on the other side, who fear that we may sweep them off the face of the earth, or catch them by the heels and wipe the atmosphere with them. If this Bill is to have any solid effect - if it is to command the respect of the people of the Commonwealth, particularly those who stop to read and think, and who have intelligence enough to come to something like a sound judgment - there must be preference to unionists. Without preference, &#39; the Bill is not worth the paper or ink employed in its printing. Honorable senators, both last night and to-day, have argued that this proviso represents a bargain - that they voted for preference as a concession to the Labour Party, and that, in return, they have a right to demand from us the sacrifice of anything of a political character in connexion with the unions. I venture to say that not one of the honorable senators who take that ground now, ever uttered a word in that direction when the preference clause was under discussion. Can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> remember any suggestion, much less a statement, that there was anything in the nature of a bargain? </para>

                        <para>- That is a very important case in point. Could the members of the Pastoralists&#39; Association take action, not as individuals, but as an organized body, to approach a State Parliament to pass a Bill to provide for the destruction of rabbits? Would that not be action of a political character by men in combination ? We know that members of that organization represent various electorates, and they would approach the members of Parliament for those electorates to support their demand for legislation to exterminate the pest with which they have to contend. Whilst we are on this matter of preference and price - and I deny the price; it was never asked foi, never offered, and, so far as I am concerned, it will never be conceded - I may say that the Attorney-General and others who have spoken on the amendment have said, &#34; Now that you have got preference for unionists, it is only a fair thing that you should give up politics.&#34; I remind the Committee that the Attorney-General and Senators Walker, Gray, Clemons, and Mulcahy were not willing to give us preference, and for those honorable senators to say that they are supporting the proviso to clause 55 on the ground that it is only fair that trade unionists should concede something for the grant of preference, on which they were beaten, and which we obtained in spite of them, is a piece of chilled-steel impudence. </para>

                        <para>- What I referred to was the audacity of honorable senators who denied us preference under this Bill, and who, when we got it in spite of them, now say, &#34; In gratitude to us, because you beat us, you should &#39;be prepared to give up something which you already have.&#34; Honorable senators on the other side who have voted with us to secure preference to unionists might legitimately ask us for some concession in return, because they did something to assist us. But for honorable senators who, on the question of preference, fought us tooth and nail, and were prepared to die in the last ditch before they gave it, to say that what we are asked to do under this proviso is but a reasonable concession which we should make to them, is a piece of audacity which will take a lot of beating, even in this Committee. It is just as well, not only that this discussion should have taken place, but that it should have taken the particular and peculiar turn it has taken. It will enable the electors to know precisely where certain honorable senators are, though I do not think they know very well themselves. With that knowledge they will know, when the opportunity presents itself, where they should put them. Some of them need a rest, and I am. inclined to think they will get it. The majority here may be able to carry a certain provision, but they are not the final court of appeal. There is the little ballot box ; and I can assure honorable senators opposite that if I am alive and well at the time, with lungs in good order, the public will be likely to hear something from me on the subject before their votes are cast. </para>

                        <para>- I shall have a double object in view at the time. I have found that even union men in Tasmania are a long way behind the times. The union that is powerful and effective to-day, and is a real union in the broad and proper sense of the term in the rest of the Commonwealth, is not established in Tasmania, and as one of the founders of the new unionism, I shall be delighted1 to extend my missionary work to that little island. I shall have another object in view, and that will be to carefully explain to the unionists of Tasmania exactly what the attitude of my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> has been on this particular question. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> must remember that he has to count not only on the men whose names are down on the union registers, but on the men whom they will influence. Honorable senators sometimes speak lightly of the percentage of working men following a given- occupation who belong to the union of men engaged in it, but it should be well known that the number of men on the trade union registers does not give anything like an adequate indication of the real strength of the political Labour Party. </para>

                        <para>- Well, the honorable senators they have returned have time to recant and repent. There is a penitents&#39; stool to which they might come. We are told of the small number of men who are really members of trade unions, and honorable senators leave out of consideration the fact that the trade organizations actually represent a very much larger number of men. I venture to say that in Queensland every man registered in the unions represents more than one outside of them. </para>

                        <para>- In some instances men refuse to join a union because they do not like the chairman, or because the secretary is objectionable to them. From my experience, as a member of a union, and one who has held official positions in unions, I am able to say that immediately any industrial trouble arises men flock into the unions to assist them. I know that at one time an effort was made in the mines on Charters Towers to increase the hours of labour. It 1 was sought to compel men to go in at 12 o&#39;clock on Sunday night, and to continue to work until 1 2 o&#39;clock on the following Saturday night - six shifts all round. That was objected to by the miners. They wanted the well-recognised .miners&#39; half-holiday on the Saturday afternoon continued. The Miners&#39; Union was 600 strong. The intimation of increased hours was given to the men on the pay day, Tuesday, the new condition was to come into force the following week, and I can assure honorable senators that that union before Saturday night was somewhere about 2,800 strong. The condition was declined, and the mine-owners withdrew their demand. The first time I stood for the State Parliament of Queensland the number of nominations for the seat exceeded the number of candidates required. When those who were nominated went to the selection ballot, I topped the poll with a total vote of 220, but when the actual polling took place I topped the poll with a vote of 2,240. It must be clear to honorable senators that the 220 who voted for me in the organized union actually represented the political opinion of the great majority of the electors of Charters Towers. In his speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> pointed out that we could suffer no very great hardship, because we should still have our State rights. I understood him to mean that we ought to dissociate ourselves as an industrial union from anything of a political character for the purposes of the Act so far as the Commonwealth was concerned,&#39; but at the same time we should still have our unions, and could use them exactly as they are now used in the States, and that, therefore, in his view, with that fact in front of him, we were really not asked to surrender anything. That appeared to me to be a most extraordinary proposition.  His  main contention was that the association of politics with a union was bad, and, therefore, should be prevented. He proposes to remove this evil thing only for the purposes of the Act, and with regard to the Commonwealth as a whole. He would allow the evil thing which he denounces to continue its existence in every State. What kind of a mind must he have? </para>

                        <para>- It is idle for the honorable senator to try to fence in that way. Surely it is fair to assume that if any organizations were to come under the Act and register, they would be the existing organizations. When honorable senators on the other side say that these organizations cannot come under the Act unless they get rid of their political character, are they not interfering with the rights of the unionists in a sovereign State? What else are they doing ? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is the leader of a very important party, and in the absence of his comrades he can speak authoritatively for the party. There has not been very much evidence of political morality shown in the Senate. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has left the Chamber, because some time ago he had something to say about the morality of trade unions. I read very carefully the quotations which he made from the pamphlet of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macgregor,</inline> and though he denied that he used the term &#34;morality&#34; in the sense in which it was taken by us, the quotation can bear no other interpretation, and when the proper time comes he is likely to hear about it. While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> denounced politics in connexion with unions as being bad and vile, he was quite willing that it should remain in active operation in the States, and saw no harm in it, still he was very careful to point out that by a little piece of ingenuity, even in the Commonwealth, for the purposes of the Act, trade unions could evade this very provision for which the Government are fighting so hard. &#34;Make a pretence,&#34; he said, &#34;of obeying this provision, but at the same time take other steps, in a round-about sort of way. Practice some deception. Deceive as much and as cleverly as you can and you will be as right as ninepence. Bulldoze the authorities.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- Yes. &#34; For the purposes of the Act,&#34; suggested <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> to us, &#34; do away with your politics, and you will get your Bill and your preference, but be hypocritical and deceitful enough to take the necessary steps to protect yourselves in a political sense, and go on exactly as you are.&#34; The difference between, the honorable and learned senator and the Labour Party is that we wish to go on as we are, but in a straightforward way and without resort to subterfuge, deception, or hypocrisy. Following in his wake, the Attorney-General not only took up that attitude, but went a little further. Although he did not make a plain statement, still he gave us an idea as to how easily the Act could be evaded. We are exceedingly thankful to him and our other opponents, and we shall endeavour to make the best possible use of his Valuable suggestions if necessity should compel us to do so. But in the meantime we are not prepared to go under without making a struggle and letting the people know who are responsible for this provision. Although it would be possible to have in each case a separate organization, purely political and composed of the same persons, with the same president arid secretary, still it would be necessary to adopt a different set of rules, keep a different set of books, levy a special fee for membership, and meet separately. All this could be done, but it would be exceedingly awkward and inconvenient. At one time the Associated Workers&#39; Union was confined strictly to industrial matters, and alongside that body we had the Workers&#39; Political Organization. The two bodies met separately, but, actual experience demonstrated that it would be more convenient, more economical, and more effective to have only one body. By turning these two bodies into one union we saved much expense, and got everything into good working order; indeed, so much so that all the tricks which our opponents had learned from a long; parliamentary life did not enable them&#39; at any time to catch us asleep. We are required now by this provision to go back to that state of things. We have no desire to retrace our steps. We prefer to remain as we are. At the present time each Associated Workers&#39; Union is limited to a State, but we are gradually paving the way for the establishment of one Associated Workers&#39; Union to represent workers. The Employers&#39; Federation &#39;is moving in a similar direction, and instead of having an Employers&#39; Federation for each State, we shall have soon an Employers&#39; Federation for- the whole Commonwealth. </para>

                <para class="block">Personally - and many of my old trade union friends agree with me - I welcome the formation of employers&#39; unions and federations. I hope they will in time embrace the whole Commonwealth, having a central executive, representing the whole of the States, and operating in behalf of the whole of the employers of Australia. The same kind of organization will then be formed to represent the. workmen. Such organizations will be the best guarantee and safeguard of peace and harmony that we can have in the industrial world; and if at any time there should be an outburst of obstinacy on either side, they would lead to the dispute being settled rapidly in a peaceful way. </para>
