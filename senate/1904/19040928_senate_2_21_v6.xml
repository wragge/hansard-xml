                    <para>- I regret that I was not able to give the Attorney-General sufficient notice of the question which I asked just now to enable him to answer it before the Senate adjourns. The question is one of great importance, and this Parliament has a right to know what instructions ware sent by the previous Government to their representative in London with regard to the Pacific Cable Conference to be held next November. I wish to correct some erroneous statements which have been circulated with regard to the Pacific Cable Company&#39;s value and usefulness. It has been stated in an influential quarter that it is a burden to Australia, and valueless to the Commonwealth. I have no hesitation in saying that a full consideration of the whole facts of the case must lead one to the conclusion that such statements cannot in any way be substantiated. From 1869 to 1902 the cabling business of Australia was absolutely in the hands of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. For thirty-three years that company had an absolute monopoly of all telegraphic communication to Australia, and, with a capital of a little over ;&#163;i ,500,000, made a profit, not altogether out of Australia, of ^6,500,000. Every honorable senator must .admit that that is beyond what may be called a fair trade profit, and that the company had become a great monopoly, which had to a considerable extent exploited the people of Australia for its own benefit. The cable rate which it charged was 9s. &#60;;d. per word, including, of course, the address and the signature. That price whs so extortionate that it was only possible for a&#39; wealthy company or well-to-do persons to use that means of communication. Other persons were debarred from cabling, and had to resort to the slower process of communicating by letter. In that way a very great injury was done to Australia. and to commercial expansion. In every way this monopoly was proving very burdensome, expensive, and injurious to the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- If my honorable friend will only allow me to state my case, he will find that I shall do sp perfectly fairly, because I know all the facts. The construction of the Pacific Cable has caused the cost of cabling to be reduced from 9s. 4d. to 3s. per word. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has said that that statement is not correct. Before the first Conference was held in London in 1887, but subsequent to the calling of it, the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company offered to reduce &#34;the cable rate to 4s. 9d. per word, but that was done solely for the purpose of blocking the construction of the Pacific Cable. While there was no competition the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company not only insisted upon a high rate, but desired guarantees&#39; from the various States that its enormous profits should be maintained. Directly a joint proposal of various communities was broached, that another company should be started to compete with the monopoly,&#39; the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company tried to kill the movement by immediately proposing a large reduction in the rate. At the conference in London, in 1887, the Honorable Alfred Deakin made the following remarks: - </para>

                <para class="block">I could quote . dozens of extracts from various speakers, Australians, Canadians, and others, to confirm that view. There is not the slightest doubt that the company would not have reduced its rate but for the fear of competition breaking up this monopoly, and its desire to strangle that effort in its very inception. . What has that reduction meant to the people of Australia ? Excluding press and Government messages, which go at a lower rate, considerably over 2,000,000 words are transmitted annually. So that the reduction means a&#62; saving of considerably over &#163;600,000 a year to the people of Australia, while Victoria alone benefits to the. extent of &#163; 250,000. That is the benefit which Victoria and the other States have directly received as a result of the construction of the Pacific Cable. </para>

                        <para>- The merchants get the advantage of the reduction, but the development of trade and commerce benefits every individual. It benefits the merchants and stockbrokers directly, but it benefits all indirectly. The expenditure which Victoria has had to incur has been &#163;10,000 a year in order to reap that enormous benefit of an annual saving of ,&#163;250,000 to its people, -n. second advantage has been derived. When the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company reduced the rate from Australia to Great Britain to 3s. per word, it also had to reduce the rate from Australia to India, because the latter country is on the direct route, and situated about half way between Great Britain and Australia. Therefore the company reduced its rate from 4s. iod. to 2s. 6d. per word. So that another result of the construction of the Pacific Cable has been a considerable reduction in the cost of cabling between Australia and Asia. A third advantage has been obtained. The Cape Cable, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Cocos Island, was built simply as the result of the agitation for the .Pacific Cable. At the Jubilee Conference, held in London in 1887 to consider these matters, the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, in order to kill the Pacific Cable project, made a proposal to lay a cable to Great Britain from Australia, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> South Africa, if the people of Australia would give it an absolute monopoly for all time of cable communication with their country. That proposal was, of course, refused. Then the company made a second proposal. It said that it would lay a cable <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> South Africa if Australia would give a guarantee ito the extent of &#163;100,000 a year. That proposal was also declined. Then the company started to work immediately to construct a line <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> South Africa with the intention of killing the Pacific Cable project. That line has given us direct cable communication with that continent, and is of enormous advantage to Australia. At the Hobart Conference, held in 1895, the representatives of the various Colonies agreed to guarantee the Eastern Extension Company to the extent of &#163;227,000 a year. It must not be forgotten that the result of the construction of the Pacific Cable has been that we have done away with these guarantees and payments to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, and where we paid a certain sum to the Pacific Cable Company we benefit by stopping all subsidies to the other company. Another great advantage which will be appreciated by all Australians is that we now have direct communication with an}&#39; other continent. With North America, containing a population of 100,000,000 English speaking people, we must have enormous trade relations in the future, seeing that it is situated in another hemisphere and its seasons are, consequently, different from ours. Our trade relations in the future will be enormously greater with North America, with its 100,000,000 people, than with South Africa, with its 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 of white people and coloured races. What are these meagre polyglot populations, compared with the enormous populations in North America? That is another advantage which has accrued from the construction of the Pacific Cable, completing a direct chain of cable communication between Australia and every continent on the planet. If I might summarize the advantages, I would say that the people of Australia have been saved the annual expense of &#163;600,000 as a result of reduced <inline font-style="italic">cable</inline> charges, that the rate to Asia from Australia has been reduced from 4s. iod. to 2s. 6d. per word, that we have direct communication with the continent of Africa, that we have wiped out the large subsidies and the large guarantees that we gave to the old company, that we have direct communication with the 100,000,000 people of North America, and that our trading relations with those people will increase enormously in the future. These are some of the direct advantages which we have gained from the Pacific Cable, which has been stated to be a burden to the Commonwealth, and absolutely useless. Three States are bearing the whole burden of any deficiency in the working of that cable, viz., Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria, and as Australia&#39;s share of t&#39;he loss was about &#163;30,000 last year, each State had to provide a third of that sum. The action of New South Wales in allowing the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company unfair trading competition with the Pacific Cable Company two or three weeks after it had signed an agreement to construct the Pacific Cable, and guarantee any loss thereon, was most extraordinary. New South Wales was one of the guarantors <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the Pacific Cable Company against any loss which might be incurred ; but in spite of that fact, it allowed to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company unfair privileges, which have the effect of decreasing the profits of the Pacific Cable Company, and necessitating the provision of a considerable sum to make up the deficiency. Whereas they got no benefit whatever from a monetary point of view from the Eastern Extension Company. If Victoria desired to do so, she could more than make up the loss that accrues as her share in the deficiency on the Pacific Cable. She could do that in connexion with the terminal and transit rates. The terminal and transit rates charged on cables sent both by the Pacific and Eastern Extension lines, are 5d. per word. But the division is different in each case. If a cable is sent from Victoria <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Eastern Extension Company, Victoria gets id. per word of that terminal rate, and South Australia gets 4d. per word. If a cable is sent from New South Wales that State gets id. per word, and South Australia gets 4d. Then cables sent from Broken Hill do not come through Victoria. But, with regard to the Pacific Cable, the terminal rates are divided between each State through which the message comes. If, a cable is sent from Victoria <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Pacific Cable, the fivepenny terminal rate is divided equally between Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. Therefore, for every word that is sent from Victoria <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Pacific Cable, the revenue of Victoria benefits to the extent, of practically fd. per word. New South Wales benefits to the extent of 2&#189;d. on every message sent <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Pacific Cable because she divides the 5d. equally with Queensland. On the other hand, New South Wales receives only id. per word on every cable sent <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> South Australia. Therefore, if the eastern States liked to send their cables - or a fair proportion of them, and that is all I ask for - <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Pacific Cable, they would be able, not only largely to increase their internal revenue, but that plan would more than compensate for the loss they have to make up on the Pacific Cable. Victoria alone would benefit to the extent of more than double what she is paying now to make up the deficiency. She would not only increase her internal revenue, but those extra messages going <inline font-style="italic">via.</inline> the Pacific Cable would turn an annual deficit into an annual surplus, and make the Pacific Cable pay directly it got a fair proportion of the Australian cable business. It seems to me that the Pacific Cable has been very unfairly treated by the people of Australia, and by some of our Legislatures. I have no personal axe to grind in this matter. Western Australia does not benefit and does not lose by the Pacific Cable. She has nothing to pay in connexion with the deficiency, and she does not send <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> worth of cables across the Pacific line. The Western Australian cables go by the Eastern Extension, line, which lands at Broome and Fremantle. Western Australia gets no revenue from terminal rates from the eastern States, because no cables are sent <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> those lines, and she suffers no loss if the Pacific Cable does not pay even working expenses. It has been suggested that we should have what is called a joint purse; that all the revenue from the four cable lines - three belonging to trie Eastern Company and the Pacific line - should be put into a joint pool. That is to say, it is suggested that we should arrange a division of the total revenue. It has also been suggested that the Pacific Cable should be leased to the Eastern Extension Company - that is, that Australia should once more be placed in the octopus grasp of a company which would have an absolute monopoly of the cabling business of Australia. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline>SMITH.That would mean deliberately returning to the thraldom of the monopoly under which we have been suffering for thirty-three years, and which was never broken until a new cable began to compete for business. It would not only be unfair to our partners, who in good &#39; faith have joined with us in building this British-owned cable line - unfair to New Zealand, Canada, and Great Britain - but if we look into the matter, we shall see that it would be a most unbusinesslike proceeding from an Australian point of view. It is not difficult to insure a fair division of the traffic of Australia for the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s lines, and the Pacific Cable. I do not ask, and have never asked, for more than that. I have always recognised that the Eastern Extension Company, being the pioneer company, has spent a lot of money on the development of its Australian business, and that it came here on the invitation of the States. Therefore, it is impossible for us to say to that company that we will bundle it out of Australia, and not allow it to continue its cabling traffic. </para>

The working expenses of the Pacific Cable are only about one-third of the working expenses of the Eastern Extension Company. The working expenses of the Pacific Cable for the year ended 31st March, 1904, were &#163;54,000. I have no later balance-sheet of the Eastern Extension Company than that dated December, 1902. But for that year their working expenses were in round figures , &#163;139,000. </para>

                        <para>- No ; but the working expenses of the company have been increased since then, because they have opened new offices, and have an army of canvassers, by whose means they are endeavouring to induce people to send their cables <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Eastern Extension Company. That company, in spite of the fact that it enjoys more than two-thirds of the total cable traffic of Australia, now complains that its Australian cables are run at a loss. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hesse,</inline> the general manager, and the <inline font-weight="bold">Hon&#39;. Mr. Peel</inline> were here they told me that the cables running to Australia were worked at a loss. But whose fault was that? The company deliberately reduced the cabling charges to 3s. a word, at which rate, I believe, the traffic will not pay. The Pacific Cable Company did not make the reduction. It was the Eastern Extension Company that did it. Apparently, 3s. . 1 word is not now sufficient to enable both companies to pay. The Eastern Extension Company is increasing its working expenses in order unfairly to filch from the Pacific Cable the traffic that it is legitimately entitled to. The Pacific Cable is admitted to be one of the best laid cables in the world. It was opened on the 8th December, 1902, and from that day to this there has not been a single interruption of the line. There are, according to a return I saw, fewer mistakes per message made on the line than on the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s line:, The Pacific Cable is less liable to interruption, because it does not cross any volcanic belts, as do the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s cables. </para>

                        <para>- No, but two of the company&#39;s cables stretch over some of the worst volcanic country in the world, and there are continual interruptions. The Pacific Cable is the quickest means of communication between Australia and the old country. As a proof of that statement, I may say that, when the&#34; last great cricket match was being played between the English and Australian elevens in Sydney, the result was sent home <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Pacific Cable in three and a half minutes, which is a world&#39;s record when the lines have not been cleared for any particular message. It is a record which I believe the Eastern Extension Company has never approached, unless it has cleared all its lines for a message. The great difficulty with the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s messages is that after 12 o&#39;clock messages sent from Australia by that company are delayed at&#39; Singapore by the enormous amount of Asiatic traffic, which clogs the line&#39;s for hours at a time. When messages with regard to important horse races, or cricket matches, in Australia are sent home, in order that they may reach England as soon as possible, t&#39;hev are, I believe, sent by the Pacific Cable. I am saying this in order to point out that the Pacific Cable offers equal, if not superior, advantages to those offered by the Eastern Extension Company, while it is worked at about one-third of the cost. Yet it is proposed that we should have a joint purse, so that the enormous loss on the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s business should, be borne by the people of Australia. If there were a&#39; joint purse, the loss to Australia on the Pacific Cable would be infinitely greater than it is at the present time. Any one who looks at the facts must see that that must be the case. All that I desire is that the same facilities shall be granted to the Pacific Cable as are granted to the Eastern Extension Company, and that the people of Australia shall have a perfect right to send their messages by which cable they please. </para>

                        <para>- It is not unfair for the Post Office to send messages by the Pacific Cable if the Eastern Extension Company adopts such tactics. What I should like to see is an equality of opportunity between the Pacific Cable and the Eastern Extension Company in allowing people to send bv whatever line they please. That would be a fair deal. But if the Eastern Extension Company is going to keep open offices, and go to an enormous expense to attract business, and if it is going in for cut-throat competition, which will necessarily increase our working expenses, we have a simple remedy, and one which I think would be very effective. Article 10 of the Berne Convention of 1903 allows each State in Europe to fix differentia&#93; terminal and transit rates. That applies equally to Australia. Australia can be divided into different zones with different terminal rates. In fact, at the very inception of this Pacific Cable, the British authorities wrote out suggesting that we should have differential terminal rates in each State. . Now, if the Eastern Extension Company persists in its present policy, all that we have to do is to divide Australia into two zones - Western Australia and South Australia being in one, and Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, and New South Wales being in the other. </para>

I am concerned with the interests of the people of Australia, and am endeavouring to conserve those interests.

                        <para>- I admit that. But, as the eastern States assisted South Australia to maintain the telegraph line from Adelaide to the Northern Territory, it would be equally competent for the Commonwealth to contribute towards the loss of revenue to South Australia on account of the decrease in her cable revenue. We must have a fair division of the existing traffic of Australia between our own British Cable, and the Eastern Extension Company ; and it is just as well to know what our powers and rights are if the Eastern Extension Company will persist in opening offices in the various States, and in going to enormous and unnecessary expense in granting facilities which are not required by the people. </para>

If I came with a four - in - hand drag and . offered to drive <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> to Parliament House every day, his acceptance would not prove the necessity of the offer. Every reasonable facility is given by the Post Office ; and Victoria is bemoaning a loss of &#163;10,000 a year, which could be prevented, while the internal revenue could be enormously increased by sending one-half of &#39;the messages bv the Pacific route. New South Wales would benefit to a much larger extent, and Queensland would divide with New South Wales and Victoria the whole of the advantages from the terminal rates. </para>

                        <para>- South Australia ; but it would be quite competent for the Commonwealth to contribute towards any loss sustained by that State in the erection of the telegraph line from Adelaide to Port Darwin. I want to be perfectly fair to every State. I object to the Eastern Extension Company monopolizing two-thirds of the traffic, and using every means consistent with honesty - because I never accused them of doing any business that was not honest - for the expansion of their business. But the Eastern Extension Company are using their influence as a private concern to make the Pacific Cable unpayable, and suggestions are made in influential quarters that that company should be allowed to acquire the Pacific Cable, and thus clinch their monopoly in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The Pacific Cable is one of the greatest socialistic enterprises the world has ever seen. Four nations have come together in a joint commercial undertaking, and I desire to see that undertaking a success. I am a Socialist to the extent that I believe in nationalizing dangerous monopolies, such as that which the Eastern Extension Company have enjoyed in Australia for thirty-three years. The Pacific Cable has broken that monopoly, and most strenuous efforts are being made by the Eastern Extension Company to make the former unpayable. They are conveying messages at a loss, and sacrificing their own profits in order to make the Pacific Cable so burdensome to the eastern Stares that the control of the rival line may be handed over, and the old monopoly re-imposed. I am sorry that the leader of the Senate was not able, in consequence of the short notice, to give a reply to my question as to the instructions sent to the representative of the Government at the Conference to be held in London in November next. This Parliament, and the people of Australia, who own one-third of. the Pacific Cable, have a right to know what has been communicated ; and I hope that when Parliament meets again&#39; the Attorney-General will be able to lay on the table information which will show that the instructions (end to conserve the interests of Australia, and provide for fair play between the partners in this great enterprise. </para>

                        <para>- What was it possible for the Eastern Extension Company to do in the old country? They were able to obtain from an official in the British Civil Service an expert report to the effect that it would be impossible to lay a Pacific Cable, because the depth at some points was not less than ten miles, but when the ground was gone over it was found that the greatest depth was three miles. The Eastern Extension Company were even able to move the British authorities in such a way as to cause the removal of a vessel which was supposed to be making a trial survey, and the fact was not known to the public until some four years had elapsed. </para>

                        <para>- Will honorable senators believe that some time ago, a gentleman in Tasmania wrote asking me whether it was possible for him to obtain press cable news, and suggesting that some newspaper proprietor in Queensland might join him in an endeavour to get press messages at the usual rates. This gentleman had found that in Tasmania it was impossible, owing to the huge &#34;ring,&#34; to get press cable messages. We talk about fair play, and equal opportunity for all - we talk about the Berne Convention, and its decision that everybody shall be able to send press messages, over the wire at uniform rates - and yet there is in Australia this infamous &#34; ring.&#34; I can characterize it as nothing but an infamous &#34; ring &#34; of newspaper proprietors, who have combined with the Eastern Extension Company to block any competition. If honorable senators desire that Australia shall go ahead, and that the public of the Commonwealth shall obtain reliable cable news, instead of the wretched twaddle at present sent here, they will support the Pacific Cable. </para>

                        <para>- For the reason&#39; that cabling is a very expensive item. The press rate is somewhere about is. a word, and the charge for 1,000 words is what a struggling newspaper cannot stand. There is no speculation or industrial enterprise1 in which a fortune can be sunk more quickly than a newspaper, and that is owing mainly to the excessive cost of cabling. </para>

                        <para>- When we see an article in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> as we did on Monday morning last, making the most of the loss on the Pacific Cable, and suggesting that that cable should be let to the Eastern Extension Company - an article which attacked <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sandford</inline> Fleming, who, after some twenty-five years of fighting has almost beaten the Eastern Extension Company - we know very well that it is written in the interests of the newspaper &#34; ring &#34; and the Cable Company. My view is that we ought to keep Victoria and Queensland as a close preserve for the Pacific Cable. If we did so we could make that cable a financial success, but if we allow the Eastern Extension Company to come in and exploit the ground, they will adopt their own methods. The Eastern Extension Company will make secret arrangements with business people. </para>

                        <para>- I was here when that clause was discussed and passed, and it was inserted simply to enable certain station proprietors to erect telegraph lines from one station to another. If the Government entered into an agreement with the Eastern Extension Company under that section, they have distorted the Act. The Eastern Extension Company, if allowed to come into Victoria, will, as I say, adopt their old methods. They will go secretly to business people, and arrange to take cables at a lower rate than that charged by the Pacific Cable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> must know that the Pacific Cable being a national concern, promoted in the interests of the people, is bound to charge everybody equal rates. It is not likely that the managers of the Pacific Cable will go to one merchant, and, on consideration of his sending all his messages by that line, offer to charge him so many pennies per word less than are charged to his competitors. But the Eastern Extension Company is prepared to do this, and I believe they are doing it at the present time, and it may shortly be too late for the Pacific Cable to make up the ground. With reference to the loss which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> fears South Australia will suffer, it is the duty of the Commonwealth, if the fears be realized, to bear that loss, -because the Pacific Cable is a national concern. Merchants and other cable users of Australia are at the present time reaping an advantage of something like &#163;750,000 per annum by the construction of the Pacific Cable. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to bring under the notice of the Attorney-General a matter which, though small as compared with the Pacific Cable question, is very important to the men concerned. I hold that it is no part of the duty of this Parliament to inflict any injustice or hardship on any citizen, and that, above all, the Government in its dealings with citizens should be not only fair, but also courteous I have in my hand a letter containing statements which I have taken an opportunity to verify, and which show that a great deal of discourtesy, hardship, and unfairness is displayed towards certain persons bv the Commonwealth. In .the latter part of 1902, the Public Service Commissioner advertised that a competitive examination would be held to fill twenty-eight vacancies in the clerical division in Queensland, and invited persons to compete .for the positions. An examination was held in April, 1903,&#39; and it was passed by fourteen candidates, but not one of them has yet received an official intimation that he has been successful, or whether his services will be required immediately or in the future. </para>

                        <para>- The results were announced at the time, but no official intimation has yet been sent to the successful candidates, who have been hanging on in the hope of getting the employment which they were led to believe would be given to them by the Commissioner when they had passed&#39; the test. What is the result of this system ? In the case of these fourteen successful candidates, over eighteen months of the best portion of their lives have been wasted, while they have been waiting for billets which apparently are never going to come to them. That is manifestly unfair and unjust. When these youths were invited to go up for this competitive examination they had to pay a fee of 15s. each, and after having passed the examination they find that there is no work for them to do in the Public Service. Unless that money is refunded, I hold that it was obtained by the false pretence&#34; that if they succeeded in passing the examination a situation would be available for them. It is grossly unfair and unjus&#39;t that the money of these youths should be taken in that way, and that they should be kept hanging on as they are. I should like to receive some definite information from the Attorney-General, so that they may know where they stand. I hope that this injustice will be quickly rectified. I do not know whether it has been applicable to all the States, but in Queensland a new rule has been enforced in the Post and Telegraph Department. Letter sorters, although they have worked their full time, are generally expected in an emergency, such as the arrival of an English mail, to come on again and work overtime. For thirty-five years in that State they have received payment for the overtime, but, following a penny-wise and pound-foolish policy, an instruction was issued on or about the 27th July last - I do not know by which Government - that it should no longer be paid. </para>

                        <para>- Whether it was issued by a Labour Government, or by any other Government, the payment for overtime should not be stopped. By this miserable cheese-paring policy, the Government will save from &#163;2,000 to &#163;2,500 a year in Queensland. At whose expense will this great saving be effected? If it was to be saved at the expense of highly-paid officials, who could very well submit to a little cheese-paring, the position would be different, because they would not be deprived of any of the comforts or luxuries of l&#39;fe. But it is to be saved at the expense of the hardest worked and poorest paid class in the Public Service. Letter sorters get very small salaries, compared with the nature of their very arduous work. It must be patent to anybody that if a man does more than the regular work for which he is paid, he is entitled to be paid for overtime, and if he is not, his employers are taking an undue advantage of his complacency in submitting to be called back to do certain work which he did not agree to do. The Department expect the men to work for certain hours, and to be always available in those hours. I contend that when a man has done his work, his time should be his own, and that if the Department wish to make a further claim on his time, it should be prepared to pay. </para>

                        <para>- That is a proceeding which would meet with my approval at any time. If men are available for. the work, they should be engaged rather than the regular hands, who have done a very&#39; large amount of work, and who, in many instances, receive&#39; very scanty pay. I hope that neither this nor any other Government will go in for a miserable cheese-paring policy of that kind, in order to save in one State &#163;2,000 or &#163;2,500 at the expense of a poor, badly paid, hard worked class of civil servants. It is not in consonance with the dignity of the Commonwealth that it should go in for such a cheese-paring policy at the expense of poor people. </para>

                    <para>- It is a very extraordinary thing that the Public Service Commissioner, after advertising that there were twenty-eight vacancies to be filled by competition, has not had the courtesy or the consideration to inform the fourteen successful candidates that their services will not be required. I wrote a letter to him recently on the subject, but I have not yet received a reply. I understand, however, that the reason why not one of these young men was appointed was because of a request received from the State Government that no further expense should be incurred. That may or may not be the position. But, in any case, one would imagine that ordinary feelings of consideration for the young men, whose time was being wasted, would have prompted the Commissioner to intimate to them that their services would not be required. His omission to do so was a distinct act of discourtesy on his part, and the Senate ought to express its disapprobation at such treatment, and to express a hope that it will not recur. </para>

                        <para>- Under the old regime in Queensland a certain branch in the Post Office was classed in the clerical division, and the work was done by young men who had passed the regular Civil Service examination. The Commissioner has put this work into the general division, and decreed that these young men, although they have passed the Civil Service examination, shall receive only the increases of pay prescribed for the general division. That, 1 maintain, is not only a distinct breach of faith with the young men, but also illegal, because the Constitution expressly reserves to every civil servant whatever rights he possessed at the time of his transference to the Commonwealth. These 3&#39;oung men were doing clerical work for Queensland, had passed their examinations, and were getting exactly the same increases and promotions as other clerical employes. They are now classed in the general division, and the Commissioner has informed me in a letter - and I suppose he thought he was acting very graciously towards them - that while allowing them to retain their clerical status he is giving them only general division increases and promotions. So that to all intents and purposes they are relegated to the general division, and will be there until, in the course of time, as vacancies arise, they will be drafted into the clerical branch. I submit that if these young men are employed on general division work that is not their fault, but the fault of the Department. Having- passed their examination, they are classified servants, and are entitled to the same increases and promotions as other classified servants. I specially ask the attention of the Attorney-General to this matter, because it appears to me that the legal &#34;rights pf these young men are being interfered with. There seems to be a great deal of nagging going on in the Public Service. Parliament has been doing its level best to do away with any injustice which may have existed with regard to this branch. But in some way or other, every effort of Parliament seems to be thwarted by some authority. I do not know how it happens, but every possible obstacle is put in the way of the abolition of grievances. &#39; Take, for instance, the case of letter-carriers. Some time ago the Commissioner decided that their hours of employment should be&#39; 84 per fortnight ; then he increased the hours to 93, and now a ruling has been issued that these men have no definite hours, as they are not under supervision. Honorable senators can easily understand the feelings of the men in these circumstances. They do not know what their hours are to be. They may be asked to work 83 or 93, or 103 hours per fortnight. The position is an extremely unsatisfactory one to them. I have asked the Commissioner to give a ruling on the matter, but he has not done so, and I think that the Government ought to intervene. If he is to be supreme ih these matters, it is the duty of Parliament to see that he does not abuse his authority, or do anything contrary to the spirit which seems to pervade Australia with regard to its employes. Again, after mail money had been paid for thirty-five years in Queensland, it has been abolished by order of the Commissioner, with the result that a large number of poorly-paid officials have had their salaries practically reduced by from &#163;18 to &#163;26 per annum. I find, however, from a classification list that large increases have been given to a number of the more highly-paid officials. It seems to me that the Commissioner is addicted to the rule which has hitherto been applied very freely in the Civil Service - </para>

I do not think that the Parliament of the Commonwealth desire&#39;s that this sort of thing should continue; and if the Public Service Commissioner continues to act in this manner, I think we shall have to take steps. That is just about the size of it. We will not threaten the Public Service Commissioner, but we desire to tell him very plainly what Parliament desires him to do. I should like to read to honorable senators an .extract which appeared in a Brisbane newspaper, and which details the work done by these letter-carriers. They commence duty on English mail mornings at 5.30 a.m. Many of these men live in the suburbs and have to get up at about 4.30 a.m. for breakfast, in time to deal with the 5.30 a.m. mail. There are no trams so early in the morning. They are not in a position to take cabs, and very few of them, I suppose, ride in&#39; their own carriages - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>On other mornings they go on duty at any time before, but not later than, 7 a.m. as required. Up till 8 a.m. their time is occupied in sorting mails and arranging correspondence for their deliveries. The first delivery takes from 8 a.m. till 10.30 a.m. till in some cases 1 p.m. . . . They must breakfast at home, and, as most of them live in the suburbs, this means at 4.30 a.m., and sometimes no breakfast at all, if they unfortunately sleep too long, as they are liable to fines if not present at roll call. If required, they must be in attendance t-&#62; sort steamers&#39; mails between deliveries, and also attend in turn at any time from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. </para>

                    <para>They have the usual inside work, and one delivery on all holidays, except Good Friday and Christmas Day. For thirty years they have been paid English mail allowance, to cover all claims for overtime and holidays. This being a fixed amount, was an incentive to diligence and a preventive of loitering. If a man was absent on English mail morning he received no allowance for overtime or holidays worked during the week. To deprive the poorest paid of postal employes of the sum of &#163;18 per annum is .retrenchment of a very drastic kind. The Commissioner overlooks the fact that the conditions of labour in the Queensland Postal Department are not the same as in other States of the Commonwealth. If more money is paid in Queensland for overtime than in the rest of the States, more is demanded from the employes, lt is worthy of note that, even in times of the greatest financial depression and consequent retrenchment in Queensland&#39;s Public Service, this allowance was never interfered with. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That shows pretty clearly the conditions to which these men are subjected. If the English mail money is not restored some equivalent provision should be made. The practical result of the abolition of this allowance has been to reduce the wages of the men from &#163;18 to &#163;26 a year. </para>

But I would point out that the great object in appointing the Publicl Service Commissioner, and setting up the present system, was to keep all matters of detail affecting the service under the control of the Commissioner, and not unnecessarily to interfere.

                            <para>- We, in the Senate, are much more likely to pass a vote of no-confidence in the Government. I have had a motion on the paper for a considerable time. It concerns a matter of great consequence to the whole Commonwealth. At the suggestion of the Attorney-General I postponed it when it first appeared on the paper. But honorable senators must be aware that if one does not take advantage of the date when one&#39;s motion has precedence it is quite possible that that motion may never be reached. I find that my motion is set down for the 6th of October, that is, to-morrow week. It has precedence on that day. If, however, the present motion of the Attorney-General is passed, and the Senate adjourns for a fortnight, I shall lose my opportunity. If the Government do not wish to proceed with their business, why should not private members be allowed to go on with theirs? We are sent here to transact the business of the Commonwealth, and many of us are doing so at considerable personal inconvenience and much financial loss. But when we attend we are asked to adjourn week after week. Cannot the Attorney-General see his way clear, under present circumstances, to move for an adjournment for a week ? </para>

                            <para>- Does that interjection mean that honorable senators object to come here to do the people&#39;s work? . If honorable senators cannot find time to attend this Chamber, their constituents should see that they get representatives who can ? I take a severe view of the duty of the parliamentary representatives of the people. Senators may say that they are masters of the situation for the period for which they are elected, but unless they attend to the wants of their constituents they ought to be relieved of their parliamentary duties. I intend to carry my protest so far as to call for a division ; or; perhaps, the better way would be to move an amendment. I move - </para>

                        <para>- I am not satisfied that we are increasing our prestige as a Senate by these frequent adjournments. At the same time, I think that some consideration should be given- to those who, if they are brought back next week, will be deprived of a visit to their States, which are a thousand miles nearer Victoria than is Queensland. It occurs to me, however, .that inasmuch&#39; as the other House has on, at least, two occasions paid no attention whatever to motions of want of. confidence carried by the Senate, there is no reason why we should&#39; not go on the even tenor of our way, provided the Attorney-General and the Vice-President of the Executive Council are willing to conduct the business. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt there is a certain amount of business which we could do while the discussion is going on in another place. We could discuss motions of the character of that of which&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has given notice ; indeed, we might even proceed with the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. Let us continue our business until such time as the Government is turned out, when we could adjourn to allow another Government to take office, or an appeal to be made to the electors. I sympathize with those honorable senators who are anxious to do some business. We have been here for six months, and so far as I can remember,&#39; the only Bill we have passed is that dealing with the &#39; Federal Capital site. I feel bound to support the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> on the ground that the other House does not pay this Chamber sufficient respect, and &#39; further that we should do more for ourselves and the country by ignoring the little squabbles in an: other place. </para>

No Government who are the subject of a no-confidence motion, which may terminate, as those Who moved it seem to hope, though not very s anguinely- </para>

Those hopes are not likely to be realized, but there is no objection to their being entertained, and if they are realized by any mischance some other Government will be responsible. </para>

                            <para>- I have just ascertained the position of matters, and I am sure the honorable senator does not impute to me any desire to throw obstacles in the way of his motion. When we meet on the 12th October, it is hoped there will be a- clear field, whatever the eventualities are in respect to the motion of want of confidence. All the motions will be on the business-paper, and, beginning with Thursday, 13th, the business may be arranged for each subsequent Thursday. The honorable senator will, therefore, be in a better position to make sure of the time when the motion will come on than be would be if we met next week, when it would be impossible, at any rate, with a view to pledging the Government to any particular action, to discuss a proposal of the kind. As to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs&#39;</inline> remarks, I may say I find my position in. not being able to carry on the business of the Senate most embarrassing. If honorable senators were&#39; to adopt a motion to adjourn until only next week, and agree that that motion should be treated as one of confidence in the Government, and as an inspiration to me, I should favorably consider the propriety of carrying on the business. However, I do not think that that is the intention, and I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> not to press his amendment. </para>
