NEILD. - I suppose that we shall have an adjournment for two or three weeks, and, with your permission, sir, I would point out that as the Select Committee is now reduced to five members, and a quorum is four, it will be practically impossible to hold meetings. Therefore, I was going to ask the leave of the Senate to propose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator Higgs</inline> be appointed to the Select Committee. But perhaps it will be more convenient for. a Minister to move the motion. </para>

Every senator will be. given a list containing the names of all the members of the Senate, and will strike out two names, and two only.

                        <para>- Under present circumstances, should we not receive a formal announcement from Ministers as to the constitution of the new Administration? You have already stated, sir, that you have no official knowledge that the two honorable senators, whose names have been mentioned, are Ministers. It appears to me that the proper course to have pursued would have been for one of the new Ministers to make an announcement. Then, the Senate having ascertained that they were Ministers, they could have said that, having been appointed members of the Government, they would like to be relieved from attendance on the Committee on Privilege. That appears to be the natural order in which the business should have been conducted. </para>

                <para>Vice-President of the Executive Council - The Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator G.</inline> McGregor. In &#34;moving that the Senate adjourn until the 1 8th May, I think that honorable senators will acknowledge that, on account of the length of the present session, and the many difficulties that naturally face a new Ministry many of the members of which have had very little Ministerial experience in the past, whilst some have had none whatever - they are really entitled to a little consideration. I am almost certain that every member of the Senate will be magnanimous enough to grant to the new Ministry the length of time asked for. Without going into any statement of policy - which would really be injudicious, and which, in fact, I should be unable to do at present- I may state that in due course the Government will put their policy before Parliament, and will await the approval of both Houses. I therefore submit the motion which I have already indicated. </para>

                        <para>- It is, of course, natural that the incoming Ministry should ask for some time to prepare their policy. Those who have been in office - and there are many honorable senators who have been in that position - recognise the difficulties that face the Government. We in the Senate shall, I hope, be in the future, as we have been hitherto, critics, but I trust that we shall always be fair critics. We recognise that in order that a new Ministry may have absolutely fair play it is necessary that they should have sufficient time to prepare their Bills and to bring them down to Parliament. When we do meet again I hope that the Government will have their Bills ready, and that we shall be able to go on with the work of the session. I have therefore no objection whatever to the motion moved by my honorable friend the Vice-President of the Executive Council. </para>

                    <para>- It must be understood that it would be a very objectionable practice if motions which may involve principles should as a rule be moved without notice. As the motion which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has just moved is connected with the leave of absence of an honorable senator, and as under the peculiar circumstances at present existing an- unexpected adjournment of the Senate for three weeks is about to take place, I feel that I am justified in putting the motion without notice. </para>

                    <para>- I ask the consideration of honorable senators for a few moments that I may correct a mistake which affects others as well as myself. During the course of the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> in the debate on the Address-in-Reply, by way of interjection, I took, on behalf of the late Government of Tasmania, a certain amount of responsibility, in fact, the principal responsibility in connexion with the position which had arisen between the Defence Department and the Military Forces in Tasmania. At the time believing that the late Tasmanian Government were, to some extent, to blame for the members of the Defence Force in Tasmania being paid at a lower rate than those in other parts of the Commonwealth, I made the interjection to which I have referred. I did so in a spirit of fairness to the present Tasmanian Government. In justice to my late colleagues in the Government of Tasmania, as well as to myself, I now desire to make an explanation. I have to say that my attention has been called to the matter by the late Premier of Tasmania&#34;, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Elliot</inline> Lewis, and the late Treasurer of Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bird,</inline> and both those gentlemen have assured me that my statement was erroneous. The late Premier of Tasmania, I find, made no request whatever to the Defence Department of the Commonwealth to have the Military Forces in Tasmania placed upon a footing in any way different to the Military Forces in the other States. As a matter of fact, in justice to the late Premier of Tasmania, I should state that his policy was to leave entirely to the Commonwealth Government and the Tasmanian representatives in the Federal Parliament the conduct of all matters connected with the Commonwealth Departments. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Elliot</inline> Lewis has called my attention tq the matter because my statement has been made use of in the Parliament of Tasmania. I make the correction at the earliest possible moment, and I have now to say that any action taken as between the State Government of Tasmania and the Commonwealth Government in connexion with the Defence Force in&#39; that State originated entirely with the present Tasmanian Government. </para>
