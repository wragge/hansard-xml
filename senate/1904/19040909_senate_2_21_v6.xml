          <para>- I am reluctant to take up the time of the Senate on a Friday in discussing the features of the Government policy, but it is impossible to allow one or two matters to pass without comment, and I hope that I shall be able to deal with them fairly briefly. The utterances of the Government in regard to the transcontinental railway have really astonished me. I gather that it is their intention to pass a Bill for a survey of the line. If it were being introduced with a view to incurring further expenditure on the construction of the line, after the survey had been completed, I could perfectly understand the position of the Government, because in the past we have been led to understand that the Prime Minister was heartily in accord with its construction. My authority for the statement is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, who, when he was a member of the Deakin Government, had occasion to attend a meeting of the Protectionist Society, held somewhere in this city. At that meeting he complained bitterly that his own Government were only prepared to  say that they would see about the construction of the railway, and he said &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Reid will build the line.&#34; I quote from the newspaper reports of that meeting, and from an electoral &#34; dodger &#34; which was freely circulated in Western Australia at the time of the recent election. I do not understand that the statements made in the circular were ever contradicted. The people of that State were asked , in the circular to vote for those who would support <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Reid&#39;s policy. They were shown clearly that it was their only chance of getting this railway, because the Deakin Government were not prepared to support its construction. </para>

We find that he advocates a survey, in order that he may discover whether the project is practicable or not.

            <para>- The honorable senator would have been right in making that remark prior to the result of certain exploratory work which has been carried on, and to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has referred this morning. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> receives the report of that work, he will find that the water trouble has been solved, and that there will be no difficulty in constructing the line if the Commonwealth Government are prepared&#39; to find the necessary funds. In that case what is the good of talking of a survey to discover whether the project is practicable or not? What we want is a working survey on which a contractor might tender. What is the good of getting a flying survey unless the Government are prepared to go on with the work ? </para>

            <para>- Unfortunately, the Constitution gives the Commonwealth no power to construct a- railway without the consent of the State.- I called attention to that unfortunate position when the draft Constitution Bill was being debated in the Legislative Council of Western Australia. I had only just been returned for the gold-fields, and I regret to say that I could not get any support in the Legislative Council, to an amendment I suggested, to make it feasible for the Commonwealth to build a railway, if it was considered necessary in its own interests. The amendment was poo-poohed, because the people on the coast were afraid that it might be applied to the Esperance railway, and the result was that the Constitution was left in its present shape. Do I understand, from the Attorney-General, that the Government of South Australia make the preparation of this survey a condition precedent to their discussing the question of authorizing the construction of the railway ? </para>

            <para>- I know that <inline font-style="italic">;t</inline> far exceeded the amount for which Western Australia would have been responsible. I propose (o leave that topic, and express my regret that the Government have not seen fit, in their programme, to make any allusion to a Council of Defence. Some days ago, when the Attorney-General first addressed the Senate, as a member of the Government, I very shortly expressed the hope that he would be able to definitely state, when he met us yesterday, what the policy of the Government would be on this question, but I regret to say that he has not seen his way to throw any light on the subject. I propose to deal with the question at some little length, because it is one which is most important, and does not seem to be very clearly understood by a number of honorable senators. When the Labour&#39; Party came into power, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson,</inline> the Minister of Defence, looked into the whole question. To put it shortly, he appointed a committee of experts, who were instructed to report. We do not know what they actually did report, but the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> apparently obtained some information on the subject. Whether it was obtained officially or not, I cannot say, but it appears from the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> that the Committee recommended the appointment of ^ Board of Advice, a Council of Defence, and an Inspector-General. According to their recommendation, the Board of Advice apparently corresponds with a body in England, which is called the Army Council. The local Committee followed up to this point the lines laid down by Lord Esher&#39;s Committee, which has lately sat in England, and made a very voluminous report in three chapters. I wish to explain the difference between the Board of Advice and the Council of Defence, because from what I have heard, both here and outside, a considerable amount of ignorance exists as to the duties of the two bodies. They are entirely distinct. The Board of Advice, as recommended by the local committee, appears to be a rather unfortunate substitute for the Army Council. Now the Army Council, as recommended by Lord Esher&#39;s committee, consists of a board, which takes the place of the General Officer Commanding ; in fact it is the General Officer Commanding, in committee. In the few remarks I intend to make I shall use the term &#34;Army Council,&#34;- because that conveys the exact meaning of what the board is, and the phrase &#34; Board of Advice &#34; does not. </para>

            <para>- I&#39; do for that specific purpose; but I propose now to deal with the Council of Defence, and to touch on the Army Council .. incidentally. The Council of Defence, as recommended by the local committee, appears to be a consultative body to act as an advisory committee to the Minister. It is very much, in fact, the sort of council that I advocated here towards the end of last session, but with nothing like as ample powers. My suggestion was embodied in the following provisions : - </para>

          <para>The expert committee in ils report suggested that two bodies should .be constituted - one a Board of Advice, and the other the actual Council of Defence. The Board of Advice, -it was recommended, should; consist of the Minister, the Secretary for Defence, the Chief Staff Officer at head-quarters, and representatives of the Militia and Volunteer Forces and the Rifle Clubs. The duty of this board would be to secure uniformity of administration throughout the Commonwealth, and supervise the working of the Department in each State. Its meetings should be at least monthly. The Council of Defence, it was suggested, should consist of the same officers, with the addition of the Inspector-General and the Naval Commandant. This Council would be of the nature of an advisory committee to the Minister, who would preside over its deliberations. He would not, however, part with his prerogative to initiate the defence policy of the Commonwealth, although he would look to the Council for advice regarding any scheme he might put forward from time to time. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>This council, constituted in that way, would be on an entirely wrong basis, that is, according to Lord Esher&#39;s Committee. I do not wish any members of the Senate to suppose that I set up as an expert. I have simply studied the report of Lord Esher&#39;s Committee, and applied the principles which it lays down as far as possible to the circumstances prevailing in the Commonwealth. I do not think that one could have a safer guide than the advice embodied in Lord Esher&#39;s report. Lord Esher&#39;s Committee point out that the Army Council should consist entirely of executive officers for the higher administration of the Defence Force, plus the Minister of Defence ; but that the Council of Defence, being a deliberative and consulting body, should not include any of the officers who are charged with the administration of affairs. They are, in fact, like managing directors. They have the sole responsibility for carrying out effectively the decisions of the Council of Defence} and as such they ought not, to be able to sit in the.- Council of Defence and frame suggestions for the control of the Army. Their duties are simply .executive, and their members should be renewed from time to time. Now I come to what the Council of Defence should consist of. I am dealing with this matter very briefly, because I understand it is desired to bring this debate to a determination this afternoon. The Council of Defence, as laid down by the Esher Committee, should consist of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and the Minister of Defence. Then we have to make a divergence, because the Esher Committee deals &#39; with a set of circumstances entirely different from the circumstances here. The. Esher Committee suggest the appointment of the head of the Intelligence Department of the Navy and the head of the Intelligence Department of the Army. We have no equivalent officers in the Commonwealth. Therefore I would suggest that the technical members should be the Chief of the Staff, the Inspector-General and the Chief Naval Officer. The Esher Committee lays special stress upon the desirability of having a certain number of permanent technical advisers on the Council of Defence, because they point out that in no other way could continuity be secured in carrying out the defence programme of Great Britain. The same consideration would obviously apply to the defence programme of this Commonwealth. But, in addition, I propose, as I proposed last year, to have on the Council a certain number of members of both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament - say, one from each House. And for this reason : As things stand at present in the Commonwealth, we get no parliamentary responsibility of any sort or kind &#39;in connexion with defence matters. We get a nominal responsibility on the part of the Minister, but when Ministers are changing, say, every six months or so, I put it to the Senate - what responsibility of any sort or kind can we get in connexion with the defence of the Commonwealth ? </para>

            <para>- The control of the Defence Department is more a matter of policy, whereas the control of a Department like the Post-office is more a matter of routine. When once the lines of policy are laid down in the Customs Department, or the Post-office, the Departments run perfectly smoothly. But in the Defence Department circumstances are changing from day to day, and the policy has to be changed to suit the ever-varying needs of the Commonwealth, and all the changes which necessarily take place in defence policy throughout the world. Under these circumstances it is absolutely necessary, to my mind, to bring Parliament more in touch with its actual responsibility. It is impossible to see how this can be secured unless the question of defence is entirely. separated from party politics. That haw been the trouble with the defence question from the very commencement. Whenever, the party in. power were attacked on any defence question they gave in sooner than force matters to an issue on a question about which members knew extremely little. Therefore the defence of the Commonwealth suffered more and more, every time an attack was made upon the Government, from the apathy of Ministers. </para>

            <para>- I think it would do a good deal of good, but of course it is impossible. Now, I come to the Inspector-General. He can be left off the Council of Defence, or not, as the Parliament thinks fit. There are many advantages in including the Inspector-General in the Council of Defence. But the one place where he ought not to be is upon the Army Council. Because his duty is to report upon how the members of the Army Council carry out . the instructions of the Defence Committee. That is his <inline font-style="italic">raison, d&#39;etre.</inline> And though his advice would probably be extremely useful to the Council of Defence, I do not know. that it is absolutely essential that he should be a member of that body. The important point that I want again to emphasize is that the Council of Defence should arrange the policy of the Defence Forces, and should consist partly of Members of Parliament, and partly of experts, and that it should report to Parliament direct. That is where another trouble has arisen in connexion with this Department. Reports go in to the Defence Department, and unless they happen to please or suit the! views of the Minister in charge of the Department, they get pigeon-holed, and it is impossible for Members of Parliament to ascertain what they contain. We want to know the truth, and the only way in which we can get the1 truth is to have this Committee reporting to us direct. Now I come to the question of the Army Council. I think I have made sufficiently clear to the Senate the1 difference that exists between the Council of Defence and the Army Council. What Lord Esher&#39;s Committee says of the Army Council is that it is not, and cannot be, a representative body as regards the several arms and departments. I want the Committee clearly to appreciate that, because according to the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> report, it seems to be proposed that the Army Council or executive body should consist of the Minister of Defence, the Secretary of Defence, the Chief Staff Officer at Head-Quarters, and representative&#39;s of the militia, volunteers, and rifle clubs. This is absolutely at variance with fundamental principles. I have already stated that this Council ought simply to be! a board of officers for carrying into effect the schemes approved by Parliament and by the Defence Committee. I do not wish to be entirely destructive in my criticism. I wish to be constructive as well. Because criticism is extremely easy. It is easy to say, &#34; So-and-so is wrong &#34; ; but not always so easy to suggest what would be right. I have taken some trouble * therefore to avoid that criticism being applied to myself. I have taken the trouble to analyze Lord Esher&#39;s scheme, and apply it as far as possible to the Commonwealth in connexion with this Army Council. Applying on a small scale the recommendations of Lord Esher&#39;s Committee to our needs, I would suggest that the Army Council should be constituted as follows : - First of- all the Minister of Defence, the head of the Department; then four military men, who would be the executive chiefs of their various Departments, and upon whom I have conferred the titles given to them by Lord Esher&#39;s Committee. They consist of the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General, the Quartermaster-General, and the Master-General of Ordnance.&#39; In addition to those we require to have a finance member and a naval member. But on no account - and on this point Lord Esher&#39;s Committee is most emphatic - should the Secretary of the Minister of Defence be a member of the Army&#39; Council, as apparently he would be under the scheme which has been prepared -for the Commonwealth. His duties are to be purely secretarial, as between the Minister and Parliament, the other Departments of the State, and the law officers of the Crown. He ought to be responsible - which, apparently, he is not at present, as far as I can gather - for the actuarial and statistical returns in connexion with the Defence Department. I have had occasion several times lately to criticise the statistical statements furnished in various reports, and I have been told that those were statements emanating from Major-General Hutton, and that the Department was not responsible for them. That is not a position of affairs which ought to prevail. The Secretary of the Department ought to be absolutely responsible for all the statistical information placed before Parliament, and the Department ought to be responsible through &#39;him for their accuracy. Each member of the board, plus the Minister, would have specific duties to perform, and <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> specific Department to control. In order to prove to the Senate and to the public that that is advisable, and that there is no difficulty in applying Lord Esher&#39;s recommendations to our circumstances, as far as defence is concerned, I have taken a very useful table, which will be found at the end of Major-General Hutton&#39;s report for 1902-3, and which is called  Appendix- A. It sets out the duties of the various officers under Major-General Hutton&#39;s control, and I have allocated those duties more or less in accordance with Lord Esher&#39;s recommendations to the officers whose titles I have mentioned. They are as follows: - The Chief Staff Officer would have the following duties : - </para>

        <para>Then we have one innovation of Lord Esher&#39;s recommendations. That is the Naval member. One has to bear in mind that there are only about 1,500 members of the Naval Forces of the Common - wealth, and it would be absolutely preposterous to have a full Naval Board, separate from the Army Council, to deal with the affairs of our extremely small Navy. Such -a council might become necessary later on, when we increase our ships and increase the number of men enrolled. But at present it would be absolutely unnecessary. Therefore I suggest that a naval member should be included, who should be given general supervision as Chief Naval Staff Officer, equivalent to Chief of Military Staff. Control of entire Naval Force about 1,500 men. That practically embraces everything.. As to the Inspector-General, I want to add a few words in connexion with Lord. Esher&#39;S report. Lord Esher&#39;s Committee says - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Inspector-General and his staff should have no executive or administrative functions. They are intended to provide the Secretary of State and the Army Council with eyes and ears, and their reports should deal only with existing facts, pointing out defects, commenting upon efficiency, and thus enabling the governing body of the army to know the practical results of the measures it adopts..... The Inspector-General should form an opinion, either personally or through his staff, as the Army Council may direct, on the efficiency of officers and men, on the handling of troops, on the standard and system of training, on the suitability of equipment, and generally on all that affects the readiness of the forces for war. He should act as an umpire at manoeuvres, and have a small personal staff. He should prepare an annual report to the Army Council, and also send reports on matters requiring immediate attention to the Secretary of the War Office. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Under these circumstances I think it must be clear to the Senate that, as I said before, the Inspector-General ought on no account to be a member of the Army Council, as is suggested apparently by the report of the Committee with regard to the Commonwealth Forces. That completes what I have to say on the subject of the Army Council, and the Council of Defence. I have dealt with the question fairly briefly, but at the same time I hope that I have made the various duties of these bodies sufficiently clear to the members of the Senate. Now, I wish, as shortly as possible, to deal with the reasons why a Council of Defence, reporting direct to Parliament, is an absolute necessity. To do that I shall have to. go back to a small extent over the history of . the Defence Department. </para>

            <para>- But on the occasion to which I refer, he was dealing with, a specific statement that one of the batteries was a shell trap. There is a wall of rock behind, and -any shell thrown must splinter and decimate the men in charge of the guns below. I wish the Senate to observe that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, though head of the Defence Department, knew nothing whatever about the state of affairs at Albany. This is the more remarkable, in view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest is a representative of Western Australia, and had, presumably, as Premier of that State, previously visited this battery. But the great point is that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest was in charge of this Department ; and his want of knowledge in this instance emphasizes the necessity for the appointment of an intelligent Committee of Defence. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> as the representative of the Government, replied to me, he pooh-poohed my statements, which he said could do no harm, as they did not come from an authoritative source. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> further questioned the patriotism of my action, and said that no useful purpose could be served by bringing this matter up. In that I am quite willing to admit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> was quite .-.right, for I certainly served no useful purpose, seeing that I got no satisfaction, and that matters to-day remain exactly as they were then.

Finally, on the 30th June, 1904, I received a note from the Secretary of  the Department, stating that the annual report for 1903-4 would shortly be in the I hands of the Minister, and would give all : the information in regard to the deficiencies of equipment which, in the opinion of the General Officer Commanding, it was advisable to make public. That note I received nearly twelve months after the report had been called for by the Senate. I submit, again, that if there had been a Council of Defence, the Senate would, within a month, have received the information to which we were perfectly entitled, and we should have been able to deal with the report when the Estimates were under consideration. But there is something even more interesting to be said- in connexion with the forts.

This instance only shows the extent to which opinions may differ on any one subject. We have arrived at the fact that quite apart from being a shell-trap, Albany is not defended in any sense of the word. The 6-inch guns are absolutely useless to protect the mine-field, for which, if honorable senators read Major-General Hutton&#39; s report, they will see the guns were intended. Those guns would be out-ranged by guns on any modern cruisers sent to attack the forts. Then at Albany, there is no search-light apparatus, no plant for generating electric light, and no staff of submarine engineers. </para>

            <para>- Of course I accept the&#39; ex-Minister&#39;s explanation, but so far as the reports and the Army list are concerned, no submarine miners or engineers are stationed at Albany, or, in fact, in Western Australia. I am sure the ex-Minister of Defence deserves the thanks of the Commonwealth if he was the means of having these men sent to the fort as a very necessary complement to the defences of that State. This is what the Colonial Defence Committee, the great English authority, had to say on fixed defences in their report, dated 30th March, 1901 : - </para>

        <para class="block">That is to say, the guns in the fixed defences or forts should be able to out-range any guns likely to be brought against them, or otherwise the former are absolutely useless. There is no use whatever in paying thirty-six men, as we do year after year, to play at the defence of Albany, unless the guns of which they have charge are able to out-range any guns likely to be brought against them. What the result of such weak defences is we have seen in connexion with the Japanese war. The ships or batteries containing long range guns are out of the range of the defending forces, and are able to shell and destroy the latter. There are no guns that would be of any use in the defence of the Commonwealth for long range purposes except a 9.2 inch gun - no gun of a lower calibre would be of any value.

            <para>- That is a possible argument, with which, however, I do not quite agree, though I understand the drift of the honorable, senator&#39;s interjection. I wish to lay further stress on this question of the 9.2 guns. On the 29th August, of the present year, a telegram came from England to the effect that the British Admiralty are abolishing 4.7 and 6-inch guns in favour of 9.2 guns ; and I may say that my notes for this address were put together before that telegram arrived.. At the same time, I do not wish to be misunderstood. The duty; of 9.2 guns is to keep the enemy out of range, and prevent. them from shelling the forts, but 6-inch guns are also absolutely necessary for the protection of narrow channels, where the enemy must come within short range. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">I do not wish to be understood for an instant to say that the 6 -inch guns are not necessary. In those places where we had not 9.2 inch guns, the enemy, after having shelled their batteries, and destroyed the 6-inch guns, would be able to send in their torpedo boat destroyers, and destroy the mine-field. The protection of all these ports, I understand, is the mine-field&#39;, which is laid down under the immediate protection of the 6-inch guns. Now, the 6-inch gun is a quick firer. A certain number of shots can be fired extremely rapidly, because the cartridge can be put into it by a man. But anything above a 6-inch gun requires machinery for loading, and therefore a very) much reduced number of shots can be fired in the same time. I hope that up to that point I have the Senate with me in proving the necessity for a Council of Defence. We now come to the 13th of July of the current year. On that occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> wished to know how many obsolete guns were being used by the field artillery, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> said that of his personal knowledge he could say nothing on the subject, but that he had made it his business to inquire at the Department, and that the reply he got was that the Department was utterly unaware of any obsolete guns being used by the field artillery at the present time. On the 28th of July, 1904, I moved for a return, which was laid upon the table on the nth of August. It is an analysis of the schedule of field guns in present service, as shown in Appendix K of the General Officer Commanding&#39;s report of the 1st May, 1904. Of eighty-two guns, sixteen are 15-pounder guns with the modern breech action, and to that extent up-to-date; twelve are 15-pounder guns, with&#39; the obsolete breech action; sixteen are 12 -pounder guns, which have the obsolete breech action, and are going to be converted; thirty are muzzle-loaders, fit for nothing but the scrap heap, or for parks; four are breech-loading howitzers, with . the obsolete breech action, and four are breech-loading 40-pounder siege guns, with the obsolete breech action. </para>

            <para>- It could be done at a cost of&#163;1,500, to say nothing of the freight. I wish to explain why the obsolete breech action completely puts the guns out of account, as far as efficiency is concerned. At the barracks here a man is taught to work these guns on a one motion breech action. The object of the tuition is to teach the men to fire as many shots as possible in a given time, and to do that each man must become a mete machine in loading the gun. After he has become a mere automaton, he goes down to Queenscliff, where he finds himself placed in charge of a gun with the obsolete breech action, which requires three motions. What is the consequence? After he loads the gun, he slams the breech to, and does not give the handle the other two turns. When another man pulls a string, the cartridge goes off, the breech block is blown out behind, and if a man is there he is killed. It is reported in the press this morning that on one of His Majesty&#39;s ships of war a breech block blew out, and killed several men. </para>

            <para>- It may be the fault of the officer, but it arises from the fact that after a man has been trained at the barracks here to the use of one gun he is put in charge of another gun, and he has become more or less of a machine in giving his orders, quite forgetting that three turns are necessary instead of one. These guns are more dangerous to people behind them than to people in front of them. I now come to another question, which the Council of Defence will have to deal with, and that is the cost of converting these obsolete guns. I question whether we are justified in spending a single penny in that direction. To begin with, the guns are absolutely obsolete from, the point of view of the British Government. For their field artillery the British Government have now adopted the 18- pounder gun. Last year I called attention to that fact, and one would have imagined that in the interval some steps would have been taken bv the Department of Defence to ascertain the cost of the new 18-pounder guns, which are described as being extremely efficient, and a great improvement on anything in use at present by Continental nations. </para>

          <para>The new guns throw 18-lb. and.12&#189;-lb. projectiles; the former shell being the heaviest of the kind in Europe. Great rapidity of fire can be obtained. The guns ride close to the ground, the breech mechanism, is of the single motion pattern, and fixed ammunition - that is to say, the cartridge and shell are combined - is used. These characteristics have enabled as many as twenty-eight rounds to be fired with one gun in a minute. </para>

        <para class="block">When the Government of Great Britain are discarding all their 15-pounder and 12- pounder guns in order to adopt the 18- pounder guns, I ask the Senate whether it is a wise policy on our part to spend &#163;523 in converting a 12 -pounder gun into a 15- pounder? It is impossible for a private senator to express an opinion on the point, but to most business men it would certainly seem a very doubtful line of policy. Here, again, I wish to point out the absolute want of business capacity shown in the Defence Department in connexion with the valuation of their property. In a report made on the 21st June, 1901, a committee of experts advised that a complete schedule and valuation should be made of all the transferred military stores and property. It will be remembered that only yesterday I received a reply from the Attorney-General, to the effect that no such valuation has ever been made. Although the States will have to be paid for all these stores and guns, still no steps of any sort have been taken to assess their value, or come to any arrangement with the States. </para>

            <para>- I never said there was any harm in it. I say that it is a complete waste of time and money. Even every breech-loading gun has a different throw of its projectile; and it is laid down in one of the reports of the Colonial Defence Committee, that it is extremely desirable that the captain of a gun should be attached to the gun he is going to use in time of war, in order that he may know its tricks, to such an extent do breech-loading guns differ. How useless must it be, therefore, to train artillerymen to use muzzle-loading guns ! Now I come back to Western Australia, and in the position of that State with reference to defence I find one of my . strongest arguments in favour of a Council of Defence. From the very commencement of the Commonwealth, we in Western Australia have suffered from systematic neglect. </para>

            <para>- I find from the Estimates that in 1902, the Albany garrison figured at forty men ; but as a matter of fact, they only had about 50 per cent, of the total number in the garrison. That is to say they had twenty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> when Vice-President of the Executive Council, pooh-poohed my statement to that effect, and said that it was the imagination of a fevered brain. I passed over to Western Australia a fortnight later, and investigated the situation. I found that there were enrolled at Albany at that moment eight commissioned and non-commissioned officers, and thirteen men. that is to say, twenty-one men in all. So much for the imagination of my fevered brain ! Of these men several were on leave. So that, as a matter of fact, on an average there were on the roll during one week in October, 1902, only five men per diem at that fort - not sufficient to clean the guns. The then Minister of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, when the question was brought before him, was of course not aware of the position. Proving that I was thoroughly right, sixteen men were sent over in 1902, including a sergeant. Then what happened? There was a most ridiculous position of affairs.. These men were enrolled under the Victorian Act. When they reached Western Australia they were under no Act whatever. The Officer Commanding in Western Australia had no legal power to enforce any penalty or. any discipline on any one of these men. The ex-Minister of Defence can confirm that statement. &#34;Until we passed the Commonwealth Defence Act, members of the Defence Force in one State, who were sent into another State, were absolutely free of all control, owing to the fact that they were enrolled under a State Act, which was in force only in the State from which they had come. </para>

            <para>- I say nothing about Melbourne, because I do not know, but I want to make clear the -position so far as Western Australia is concerned. I want to show that Western Australia has suffered from systematic neglect from the beginning. On the 30th June, 1902, provision was made on the Estimates for &#163;5,600 for drill halls in Western Australia. We find from the Estimates, dated 30th June, 1903, that only &#163;640 of that sum had been spent. The rest had been saved. Then, again, when we come to the Estimates dated 30th June, 1904, as I pointed out last year, &#163;13,270 was voted. At least &#163;9,000 of that was never spent. </para>

            <para>- No; only &#163;5,000 was put into small arms, a very small proportion of which went to Western Australia. This treatment of Western Australia is not confined to the Defence Department. It is part of a systematic course of neglect of Western Australia on the part of the Commonwealth Government. I find in the Estimates for 1902 that a sum of ^2,300 was set aside for Customs buildings at Perth. In the Estimates for 1903 the same sum for the same buildings is set down. The buildings have not been erected. In the Estimates for 1904 we find the same sum over again ; and, probably, when the Estimates for 1904-5 come along, we shall find the same sum upon them which we have had year after year. It seems to be nobody&#39;s interest to see that&#34; the money is spent. I went into the question of the defence of Fremantle on a previous occasion, so that it is of no use to deal with that again. I come to another point in connexion with the defence of Fremantle, and it is this : The present proposal, as I understand it, is to put 7 &#39;5 inch guns into the Fremantle fortifications. I must insist that no- arm is of any use for the defence of any of these forts and for keeping off an&#39; enemy but 9&#39;2-inch guns. That, again, is another question which&#34; a Defence Committee would go into and advise Parliament upon. </para>

            <para>- What has population got to do with . the necessity for defence? It is locality that matters. It is the wealth that can be taken out of the country. It is the danger to the whole of Australia if Western Australia were seized and held by a foe. What have those considerations got to do with the relative number of men in the various States? I suppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> would say that, as there were so many hundreds of people in one . State, and so many hundreds of thousands in another, therefore, there ought&#39; to be ten men and a captain in Western Australia, and tens of thousands in other States. The Commonwealth has not contracted to defend the States in proportion to population. The contract is to defend the States regardless of population. Honorable senators will find the provision in section 119 of the Constitution. </para>

And that is all the attention that the Commonwealth pays to our necessities in the West ! The very scheme of defence that has been outlined, shows the absurdity of the whole business. When I came to .look into this question, I found the following facts : - That our mounted infantry in Western Australia is brigaded for defence purposes with the mounted infantry of South Australia. That is to say, in time of war, they would be under one brigade staff. As a matter of fact, at the present moment, our infantry in Western Australia is brigaded with the infantry of Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania. To have an effective field force under a mobilization scheme, you would have to bring all these regiments together under one commanding staff. I should like to ask how that is likely to be done effectually. That is another question that the Council of Defence would have to go into. The very basis of the Defence Forces of the Commonwealth would, have to be reconsidered. The constitution  of our defences is, as a matter of fact, based upon the idea of a force leaving Australia. It is based upon an offensive, not upon a defensive scheme. It is only under an offensive idea that the scheme becomes at all practicable, and then I question whether it could be carried out in an efficient way. </para><interjection>

I should like to read what Major-General Hutton had to say about organization, because then the Senate may judge how far he has been successful in carrying out his own schemes.

The conclusion is inevitable, that there must be some body, apart from political parties, to deal with defence matters - some body responsible and reporting to Parliament direct. In no other way shall we ever get any efficient defence organization. There is a great deal more that I should like to say, but I observe that it is now after mid-day, and I shall draw my remarks to a conclusion. I hope that what I have said is sufficient to convince honorable senators that unless the Government are prepared to constitute a proper Council of Defence some steps should be taken to force their hands. </para>

            <para>- That is so; and the terms of the bond are publicly stated, so that they may be known by all. This scheme for a Transcontinental Railway is of prime importance to the smaller States. I hope I am as true a federalist as any man in this or the other chamber, but in a matter involving immense expenditure, it is&#39; the duty of representatives of the smaller States to see that the interests of those States are properly conserved. Tasmania staggers under a national debt, not so large as that, of other States, but still large enough, and most of it has been incurred in connexion with the building of railways. Then, again, half the annual revenue of Tasmania is required to pay the interest on that national debt, and it seems rather unfair to the taxpayers of the small States, that they should be called upon to contribute towards the cost of a railway, the most direct benefits of which will go to Western Australia and South Australia. I do not say for a moment that this great railway will not prove of . considerable convenience to all the States in providing quicker- transit for mails and passengers; but no one can deny . that the two States I have mentioned, will benefit more than any of the other States of the Commonwealth. I think we are quite justified in looking at the project from this point of view, without laying ourselves open to the charge of being anti-Federalists. I now understand from the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> and from interjections by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and other Western Australian representatives, that the Government of that State have made a magnanimous offer. I knew that some offer had been made, but I thought that all it amounted to was that the Western Australian Government would make up any loss in interest on the cost of construction, or take&#39; a fair share of any loss, as divided . between that State and South Australia. However. I am glad to hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> that the offer made by the late Premier of Western Australia is that all loss as between the earnings of the line and the working expenses, plus interest on the cost of construction, will be guaranteed by Western Australia for some period of years. If that be the case,- no representative of any State need have much objection to supporting an expenditure of &#163;20,000 for a survey. </para>

            <para>- We require some more information before we agree to the proposal for a survey of this line, and it has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that we shall also have some details as to the water supply along the route. If the expenditure of &#163;20,000 is undertaken for a survey, I presume that the construction of the line will follow. If the two States which are most directly concerned, and which will benefit most from the construction of the line, were willing to give to the taxpayers of other States some guarantee to make up even a portion of the loss, the representatives of those other States might be willing to come to some arrangement. Failing this guarantee, however, States with big public debts ought not to be asked to assist in building a railway to connect Western Australia and South Australia; and that is- a view which I think cannot be regarded as anti-Federal. We have heard a great deal as to the reasons why the late Government were turned out of office. I do not wish to go into matters which might involve personalities, but I am justified in asking the reason for the delay there  has been in Federal legislation for the last five, or six months. Why is it that, although Parliament has been in session for six months, we have done so little business? I am sorry to say that, in my opinion, the whole of the blame - must be laid at the door of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> I admire that gentleman, not only for his charming personality, but his splendid abilities. I also admired <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> for his statesmanship, but that admiration has ceased after1 .what has recently occurred. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> likened the political position to three elevens in the cricket field, but I think his simile most unfortunate. </para>

        <para>In the first place, it is impossible for three elevens to play together, and, in the second place, it is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> who has made legislation impossible during the last few months. What was the object of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> in taking the course he did, and how was his object achieved? His desire was to evolve two parties out of the three parties in Parliament ; but surely <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was aware that for all practical purposes there were then only two parties in Parliament. He had known for three years that what was known as the third party had supported him and worked with him in the interests of the whole of Australia. What <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has succeeded in doing is to evolve four parties out of the three. It may be admitted that two of the parties sit on one side, and the other two on the other side, but each is a distinct party. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has not been able to merge his protectionist followers in the free-traders ; and the Labour Party, on the other hand, are certainly not merging their individuality in that of the Liberal or Radical Protectionists&#39; wing. We have, however, formed an honorable working alliance, as the other two parties have done, for a term. On the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> there was a dream - or perhaps it had better be called, a nightmare - as to the impossibility of carrying on constitutional government with three parties in the House of Representatives. He regarded the position as intolerable. </para>

            <para>- Whom have the late leader of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> and the protectionists in the present Coalition Government to thank for having put their Tariff on the statute-book? Have they to thank their present allies or their present opponents? The members of the Labour Party are twitted with being divided on the1 fiscal question. We do not make fiscalism the be-all &#39; and end-all of our politics, or the first plank in our platform. We put social legislation above fiscalism. I as a protectionist am very glad to be able to say that it was the protectionist members of the Labour Party who made it possible for us io have a protectionist Tariff.

            <para>- What happened when the Barton Government sent up their Tariff, to the Senate which was almost evenly divided on the fiscal question ? In their hour of trouble, when they wanted every vote which they could fairly look upon as their own, they found that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Fraser from Victoria, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> from Tasmania, who had been returned to support t&#39;heir policy, were going over to the other side on almost every division. . It was the presence of six protectionists in the Labour Party of eight senators, which made it possible for the Barton Government to get their Tariff through the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and I took a big political risk in voting for the Tariff, but we believed in protection, although it had not been made the first plank in our platform. The Bar-, ton Government were deserted not by the members of the Labour Party, but by two honorable senators who had been returned to support the whole of their policy. Yet the Deakin Party deserted the Labour Party and embraced the gentlemen who had bitterly fought them on every measure of progressive politics. </para>

He knew very well that it was quite impossible for the members of our party to meet until the 17th or 18th of May. And yet in the face of that fact he took the leader of the other party into a small cottage in Richmond, and allowed himself to be drawn into a coalition of another kind.

            <para>- It does not matter whether it was to be as one party or not. But supposing that condition was made, no one can deny that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> knew that his proposal could not be considered .by the Labour Party until the 17th of May. Ten days before that date, however, he had drawn up and signed a programme for a coalition with another party. That was not fair political dealing. </para>

My complaint against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> is that many days before it was possible for his proposal to be considered by his natural allies he drew up a programme for a coalition with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> to submit to his1 own party. </para>

            <para>- And the public of Australia are entitled to hold their view. That view has been pretty generally voiced since the honorable senator turned from being a protectionist to a free-trader, and announced himself as a straight-out supporter of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid.</inline> But I am inclined to think that it was not so much a matter of free-trade and protection with him. What displeased him was that the Barton Government brought before Parliament legislation which he thought was introduced too soon. I refer specially to the legislation dealing with the kanakas. </para>

They believe in reciprocity, provided it is not with citizens who live under the same flag. For the sake of foreign traders they are prepared to sacrifice all.

        <para class="block">Deakin&#39;s late party? He is sitting in opposition to more men who supported him for the last three and a half years than can be found on his own side of the House. Without dealing at any great length&#39; with the reasons given for removing the late Government from office, I wish briefly to mention that, in my opinion, in the first place, the whole of the trouble sprang out of the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> over a detail in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I take the view that, in that case, the then Prime Minister was absolutely wrong in making that detail vital to the life of his Government. It was not properly in accordance with the meaning of constitutional government, that a cabinet should go out of office on such a detail of a Bill. Of course, we are aware that there was a great difference of opinion on the point, and that, unfortunately, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> had practically pledged himself to resist the inclusion of State or railway servants. We are aware that the Labour Party went to the country and made the inclusion of those servants a point in its programme. We are also aware of the political treachery which marked the conduct of some of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid&#39;s</inline> supporters in&#39; the House of Representatives. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> decided to make the issue vital, he was the judge of his own actions, but the country and Parliament thought he was wrong. Now we come to a rather interesting stage of the question. When the Watson Government, in consequence of the advice which&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> gave to the Governor-General, came into power, they took up the Arbitration Bill at the stage at which it had been dropped, What happened ? We find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and, unfortunately, several of his late, colleagues, voted repeatedly against important provisions in that Bill. Certainly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> himself supported the Watson Government to a certain extent. But it is worth while remembering that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> Fysh, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman, Sir John</inline> Forrest, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner by way of a pair - making four out of a Cabinet of eight - voted for almost every amendment proposed by the Opposition, which included a large number of those who were absolutely opposed to an Arbitration Bill in any form. In view of these facts, what about the cry of minority rule? That cry which has . been raised against the Labour Party may very well be applied to those members of the Deakin Government. &#34;We can only infer, as four members of that </para>
        <para class="block">Government voted against clause after clause of the Bill, that when that Bill was being considered in Cabinet there was strong opposition to its provisions, and that it was only by a minority vote that it was allowed to be introduced. </para>

            <para>- No; but I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> will enlighten us about the conduct of four out of eight members of the Deakin Government, who, when the Bill was in charge of a succeeding Government, voted against clause after clause of it. Four out of eight members of the Deakin Government have shown . themselves to be opposed to nearly every clause of the Bill, showing that they were opposed to that measure when it was being considered by their own Government, and that it was not the product of a majority of the Cabinet. If that be not the explanation, then those four members were wreckers, and immediately turned a somersault and voted against their own convictions. Either they voted in Cabinet against their convictions in allowing the Bill to be introduced, or, when they were out of power and another Government took up the Bill, they voted against their convictions when they opposed all its principal clauses. </para>

            <para>- I leave the question with this further remark: that, with reference to the question of preference to unionists a great deal has been heard, and much more will be heard when the measure comes before the Senate. I feel sure that there is a majority of members of the Sen ate who are genuinely in favour of arbitration, and that there is a sufficient majority in favour of preference. Without preference to unionists, the Bill is absolutely useless. Without it <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> when asked for bread in the shape of industrial peace, gave us a stone in the shape of industrial strife, which is bound to occur if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay&#39;s</inline> amendment remains in the Bill. It is only fair that members of the Labour Party should be allowed to say one or two words in reply to the old charge of Socialism which is hurled against us. Have honorable senators read the words which were uttered by the present Prime Minister only last week, when addressing a gathering of farmers in Melbourne? The quotation was used last night in another place, but it is worth repeating, because it cannot be too widely known what are the real views of the head of the present Government, who is constantly railing against the Labour Party, who, he says, are Socialists. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> on the occasion referred to, said - </para>

            <para>- In two years&#39; time, possibly, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> and I face the electors on separate platforms, I shall be able to point to the fact that I have converted him in some respects. I do not think that I need take up the time of the House by asking any anti-Socialists whether they are in &#39; favour of such services as I have indicated being municipally or locally owned. It is the most empty and arrant humbug that we hear about the Socialism of the Labour Party ruining Australia. There is a kind of Socialism which appeals to some of the supporters behind the Prime Minister, namely, the Socialism of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole,</inline> the paid agitator of the Employers&#39; Federation, is the advocate. The other day <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> said -that this Employers&#39; Federation had by its action rendered the Factories Act harmless, and had justified the existence of the organization. We are, therefore, justified in regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole,</inline> the representative of that federation, as one who believes that the evils and conditions which existed prior to the introduction of the Factories Acts in this and other States should be allowed to continue - conditions which prevailed at the time when Tom Hood wrote his memorable <inline font-style="italic">Song of the Shirt.</inline> Is that the kind of anti- Socialism of which the Attorney-General or his leader approve? It is the kind of anti-Socialism which a number of the supporters of the Government in another place approve. Let us see what a leading Melbourne paper says, for instance, in reference to the wages of dressmakers, in &#34;the following paragraph, which is published under the headings,&#34; Wages of Dressmakers, &#34;Employers Dismiss Hands&#34;: - </para>

          <para>It appears that, as a result of the determination of the Wages Board in the dressmakers&#39; trade having come into force, a number of employes in some of the leading establishments have been dismissed. The scale&#39; fixed by the board will appear to most people to be at least not a high one - many will think it exceedingly low - yet the employers and. the trade consider it too high as a basis for the remuneration of their work people. </para>

          <para class="block">After a poor unfortunate girl has worked for five years she is allowed enough to enable her to keep herself from starvation, and cover herself with scanty rags, but not enough to enable her to keep herself in a decent state.

            <para>- No; and the honorable and learned member knows that the Labour Party did not do so. All that the Labour Party did was to alter the phrasing of the clause - to first provide for railway servants, and then for all States servants who are engaged in industrial occupation. Does not the word &#34; industrial &#39; &#39; occur in the Constitution, and is it not the correct word to use? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> told the Governor-General that he could get a majority with which to carry on the business of the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> is going to do one of two things - he is either going to send up an Arbitration Bill, in which he does not believe, or he is going to suffer a defeat ; and I think I know what he will do rather than meet the latter. I do not believe the present Government is &#34; game &#34; to put the question to the test in order to ascertain whether they have majority rule, after all their trouble. Another reason urged against the Labour Government was that the members of the party are professional politicians. If our experience in Australia, during the last three years of the professional and amateur politician is to be taken as a criterion - if we have to contrast the attendance and the work done by those politicians in both Houses - then it seems &#39; to me that the professional politician is the better servant for the people. Who are the loudest in the denunciation of professional politicians? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> Smith, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norman</inline> Cameron, and one or two others in another place, who have the worst record for attendance. They draw their monthly cheque for only a few days&#39; work. There are some honorable senators who have spoken here against the professional politician; but they are gentlemen who attend only occasionally, perhaps a day now and again, or for an hour or two in a day, when something of importance to them or to their friends is before the Senate. Week after week, and month after month, during the last three and a half years, the amateur politician has refused to sit here continuously doing the work of the country, although he was re- turned to do that work, but he has had no scruples about drawing &#39;.&#163;33 6s. 8d. per month as payment for doing it. But let us get away from the personal point of view, and look at the matter from a broader basis. Would any business man intrust the management of a large Department to an amateur? Would he not rather pick out a professional, a man who was competent to take charge because of his training, his special knowledge, his attention to affairs, and his diligence? . Surely if that principle holds good in the management of private businesses, it should hold good in the management of the affairs of the country. The cry about professional politicians injuring the country is an empty one. One of the reasons why it is alleged that the existence of the Labour Party is inimical to the interests of Australia is that it is driving capital from the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> has said that on more than one occasion. </para>

            <para>- Let us examine the statement by means of statistics. I find that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company last half -year . paid a dividend of 10 per cent., and the Colonial Bank of Australia a dividend of 5 per cent. The London Bank of Australia has this year paid a dividend of2&#188; per cent., its first dividend since &#39;the great bank smashes of 1892. Twenty Australian banks are now on the dividend list, and are doing better to-day than during any other period since the bank failures. </para>

To quote from another financial newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Record,</inline> seven life assurance companies show a net expansion of business during last year of , &#163;3,163,117. It will not be denied by any reasonable man that the expansion of life assurance business may be taken as evidence of increased prosperity. Then I find that Tooth and Co., a big Sydney brewery, made a net profit for last year of &#163;61,942, and declared a dividend of 8 per cent. </para>

            <para>- Yes. If it were not for that policy, three .or four of those who are now sitting behind them would not be supporting them. I have here a few figures which must appeal to our friends the anti-Socialists, and they are gathered at random from statistics supplied in <inline font-style="italic">Coghlans</inline> book, which is the statistical bible common to us all. I find that in 1901 the deposits in banks, including savings banks and in building societies, where the information has been available, amounted&#39; to &#163;44,954,947 ; and in 1903 they had increased to &#163;47,065,620. It will be admitted that that is a very considerable increase, and <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> explains that on these lines the increase in those three y&#39;ears was larger than the increase in the previous ten years. I find further that in 1891 the. number of depositors in savings banks was 158,426, and the aggregate amount of money deposited by them was &#163;5,342I35In 1903, thirteen years later, the number of depositors was 323,212, or more than double the number in 1891, whilst the amount deposited had increased to &#163;12,425,464. It will be seen that the amount deposited was also doubled in the same period. I direct the attention of honorable senators to the fact that during the last ten years the Labour Party had more power in the New South Wales Parliament than in any other State, but in spite of the figures I have quoted we are being continually told that the Labour Party is driving capital out of the country. </para>

If the party at present in power be so nearly allied to the Labour Party in matters of Socialism, as shown by the utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> and if it cannot be proved that they have driven capital out of the country, and, further, if the present Administration are not going to establish the majority rule for which they have fought, and if they are not going to bring to an end minority rule - and I do not think they will try to do so on the question of the inclusion of State servants in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill - what difference is there between their policy and the policy of the Labour Party ? If there is no difference, I am entitled, on behalf of the people of Australia, who have to pay the piper, to ask what is the reason for the delay which has &#39;been caused by the change of Government, by the turning of one set of men off the Treasury bench, in order to allow another set of men to occupy their places to carry out the same policy ? </para>

Who was it that exposed the swindle of the fraudulent Chinese certificates ? Who first burst up that practice which had probably been going on for some years in Australia, I do not say with the connivance of the Deakin and Barton Governments, but probably because there was not quite so much energy shown in the administration of the Department? Directly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> came into power he discovered the evil, or if he did not actually discover it he at all events grappled with it. In doing so he came into conflict with the State Premier of South Australia, and we know that some rather severe passages appeared in the press in connexion with the matter. Under the Constitution, where a State and a Commonwealth law come into conflict, the Commonwealth law must prevail. When the Premier of a State and the second in command in the late Commonwealth Ministry came into conflict the Commonwealth Minister prevailed ; the Premier of South Australia had to admit that &#39;he was wrong, and he had to take a back seat. These instances show the capacity exhibited by the late Minister, and no charge has been levelled against his administration of his Department. Then we come to the Defence Department. I do not know whether it is next in order of precedence, but that does not matter. </para>

            <para>- The work of the Attorney-General is not patent to the public eye. I do not think that if we took a plebiscite of the people of Australia to-day, there would be a very large majority found voting to say that the late Minister of Defence made many mistakes in his Department. I believe that the majority of the people would say that he filled the bill very well, and possibly that he did better than any of his predecessors. The honorable senator was, at least, the first Minister in charge of that Department, who let one of the servants of the Commonwealth know that the Commonwealth is first, and that servants of the Commonwealth must obey. It was the late Minister of Defence who told the General Officer Commanding that he was not the ruler of the Defence Department of Australia, but was the servant of that Department. I could quote other instances to show that the late Minister of Defence was, at least, as well able to administer the Department as any of his predecessors, and I venture to say that he left it with the good will of the people of Australia, because no charge has been hurled against his administration. Then I come to deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon,</inline> as Postmaster-General. Has any other honorable gentleman who has occupied that high and responsible position, taken the same stand? Was it not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon</inline> who first put an end to all the frivolous nonsense in the Department whereby a subordinate officer, if he were a volunteer holding a higher rank than a man above him in the Department, could insist that his official superior should address him by his full military title? Who was it that put an end to all that nonsense, and declared that when volunteers came into the Department they came in to do the work of the Department for which they were paid, and had to leave behind them all the titles connected with their military calling. </para>

            <para>- When they come to do the work of the Post Office Department now they are not colonels, captains, or anything else, but have to answer to their proper names. Again, who was it who upheld the right of the employes of the Department to organize, so that their united voice might be heard by the highest authority, in a proper way ? It was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon.</inline> In that matter the honorable gentleman came into conflict with the Deputy Postmaster-General of Victoria, and I think that, in the opinion of the people of Australia, the late Postmaster-General got considerably the best of his deputy in the argument. Again, who was the first Postmaster-General to declare that, so far as he or the Public Service Commissioner could have it done, the public servants of his Department should not any longer continue to victimize their tradesmen. We know that a very great deal of opposition was offered to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon&#39;s</inline> proposal to make it a misdemeanour for the servants of his Department to be continually dunned by their creditors during office hours. In thus compelling &#91;them to pay their just debts, the honorable gentleman did what was absolutely right in the interests of fair play to the tradesmen. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon</inline> is a member of a party who make it a vital plank of their platform to see that every man employed by the Government shall be paid a fair wage, which will enable him to pay his debts. If, after he has given a fair return, he is given a fair wage, so far as the Labour Party can do so, they are prepared to see that he shall pay his just debts. In that matter again <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon</inline> showed that he had a grasp of the situation, and was well able to administer his Department. He probably administered it better than it had been administered before, and I may at least say that he administered it quite as well. No charge has been brought against his administration. I now come to the administration of the Home Affairs Department, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor.</inline> No sooner did the honorable gentleman take office than he started to grapple with its difficulties in a businesslike way. He attended his office day after day for more than the regulation eight hours, in the endeavour to evolve from the chaos produced by the Commonwealth Electoral Act some state of order for the next elections. It was only to be supposed that passing an electoral law as we passed it, without full knowledge of the circumstances operating all over Australia, it would contain a number of defects. Those defects were made apparent at the last election, and all we could be expected to do was to try to remedy them. Directly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> assumed office he grappled with the difficulty in a. business-like way, with the result that the recommendations he has left on the subject are admitted by the present occupant of the office to be very valuable, and I think that they are certain to be adopted&#34; by him. I have said sufficient on the subject, and it is generally admitted, even by our opponents, that no charge can be brought against any member of the late Government in connexion with his administration of the Department committed to his care. In the circumstances, I may well ask why so much indecent haste was shown to turn the members of that Government out of office? It was certainly not because they were discourteous, or because they had not shown themselves to be honorable and fair-minded men. I intended to quote the opinion which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> expressed of the Labour Party during the time when he was &#34; in the hollow of their hand.&#34; But, if any inquiring person will refer to the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> he will find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> has placed on record the statement that he always found the members of the Labour Party imbued with the strictest integrity, the greatest impartiality, and the finest courtesy, and that they were absolutely fair in every respect.  lt is only fair to say this, and it is one of the things which stand to the credit of the Labour Party, that during the whole of my five years&#39; connexion wilh Them in t -he Parliament of New South Wales they never endeavoured to intrigue themselves into office. </para>

            <para>- No ; we prefer to have the certificate of the people of Australia. We know that a certificate of the Prime. Minister is not worth a snap of the fingers, because next week he is likely to say something else. I propose to quote what he said about some honorable senators, because it will make it all the more difficult for him to state what was the reason for his indecent haste in ejecting the Labour Party from the Treasury bench. I now come to the peculiar connexion between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> ; and I propose to quote what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> said about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and all his colleagues, incidentally.

          <para>The Government introduced the Electoral Bill in the Senate with a provision for minority representation. That was the main provision of the measure. The Senate knocked it out. Then the Senate put in a provision against plumping. The other House removed it, and the changes were running between the two Houses, in which several Ministers voted in several ways during the several stages of the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> said last night that that Bill gave manhood and womanhood suffrage to Australia. I say that this Government, to serve its political interests, robbed hundreds and thousands of electors of their just rights. (Loud applause.) </para>

So long as they were willing to keep Mm in power, ind to be political newers of wood, and drawers of water, they were a noble body, and even in England he preached about the merits and virtues of the Australian Labour Party.

          <para>Let me now deal with three measures which involve large questions of national policy. One was the Immigration Restriction Act. I believe in making that Act speak honestly and straightforwardly the determination of the Australian people that we should have a White Australia. (Cheers.) I stood side by side with the Labour Party on that occasion, but I was beaten. I think it was a hypocritical pretence when you wish to exclude coloured races to submit even your own countrymen to the language test. </para>

There is one part of the Bill which provides that no one is to be admitted into Australia if there is a danger of his becoming a charge on the public funds. No one can object to that. But, at the dictation I have previously referred to, it was provided that another sort of person must be treated as a criminal - for that is what it really amounts to.

A number of men got their billets before they came ; they were brought here to interfere with the fair rate of wages paid to Australian workmen, and that was the reason for that provision in the Immigration Restriction Act. Unless the leader of this Government asks the Parliament to repeal that provision he will stamp himself as the worst kind of political turncoat.

Some reason ought also to be given for the change of Government which has taken place, and for the delay in the transaction of public business, which has consequently happened. The present situation must stand condemned before the people of Australia as absolutely devoid of common sense. Those who have taken the reins of Government ought to tell the people what is the difference between their policy and ours. They found no fault with the administration of the late Government. They have copied our methods. </para>

          <para>- There is not a plank in the platform of the Labour Party which has not been there for many years before the late Government came into existence. The greater part of our platform is derived from the brains of the members. of the Labour Party. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> calls our policy a crawling policy, but, nevertheless, he adopts it. I ask again : what are the reasons for bringing the coalition into existence? Can it be that honorable senators opposite object to the Labour Party, because they do not mix in the highest social circles ? That is a deplorable thing to suggest, but I cannot explain the situation otherwise. I believe that some honorable senators opposite in their inmost hearts and consciences, subscribe to the ideal of Government which was expressed . by an American millionaire the other day, when he said that &#34; the rights and privileges of the working people of this great country will be best conserved, not by agitators, but by the Christian men and women, to whom God in his infinite wisdom has given the control of the property and interests of the country.&#34; Do honorable senators opposite subscribe to that doctrine? Do they say that the rights and privileges of the people of Australia will- be best conserved only by the class of individuals who own the property ? </para>

            <para>- Then the honorable and learned senator should get out of the present Government at once, because I can assure him that his friends in Queensland will not recognise him as a democrat so long as he remains a member of it. I am impelled to the opinion that the majority of the supporters of this Government do adhere to the ideal which I have described. </para>

            <para>- Our ideal, on the contrary, is that the rights and interests of any community should be paramount to the rights and interests of any individual or class, and that so long as human nature is constituted as it is, and until we reach the millennium, the rights and interests of the mass of the people must be paramount to those of any individual or class. After all, government in itself and in the abstract is not a &#39; good thing. Government is essentially a recognition of the weakness of human nature. While human nature is what it is, we must have some form of Government ; and the Government in which I believe is that which uses every fair means to make individuals recognise the claims of the race to which they belong, and of the community in which they live. </para>

            <para>- Before I put the motion, I think it only right to mention to the Senate that His Excellency the Governor of Western Australia is present. My attention has just been called to the fact, or otherwise I should certainly have invited His Excellency to take a seat on the floor of the Senate. I am sure the Senate would have accorded so distinguished a visitor that privilege. I was not informed officially that His Excellency was here, or I should have taken action. </para>
