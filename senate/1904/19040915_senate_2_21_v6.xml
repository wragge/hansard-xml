                I beg to ask the Attorney-General, without notice, first, whether Ministers have satisfied themselves by expert evidence thatÂ£20,000 is a sufficient sum to provide for a proper survey of the proposed transcontinental railway route; second, is it the intention nf the survey party to obtain evidence as to the character of the country which the proposed railway will traverse, and if so will that evidence be obtained by . the surveyors or by an officer specially appointed to accompany them ; and, third, in view of the information which will be obtained by. the two States interested, ought not those States, in the opinion of the Minister, to bear a portion of the cost?

                NEILD. - I think the terms of the .motion sufficiently indicate the reason for its submission. I might add, perhaps, that certain alleged documents have appeared in the press, and it is desirable, in a matter of importance as affecting the public interests, that there should be no garbled representation of correspondence. As part of the correspondence has been made public it is only fair that the whole should be produced.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>
                SYMON (South Australia - Attorney-General). - Honorable senators will agree with me that it would be scarcely fair, either to the Senate or to the General Officer Commanding, that the motion should be passed in the terms proposed.
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                has very properly - if he .will allow me to say so - modified the terms in which the motion first appeared oh the notice-paper, terms which, indirectly at any rate, committed the Senate to an opinion on the conduct of an officer before being placed in possession of material on which to base a judgment. But while the motion, as now submitted, reduces the objection on that score, it is scarcely fair to ask the Senate to express ah opinion about some memorandum which is unknown to the general body of senators, so far as concerns its effect in reflecting - a term which conveys an injurious imputation - on the General Officer Commanding, until we have an opportunity to know it's contents. The ' usual course might, I think, very well have been adopted ; and with a view to assisting
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline>
                T suggest that the motion should simply ask for the production of a document which can be identified by its date, without conveying any imputation, or committing the Senate to any opinion. The amendment I am about to submit was I understand, communicated to
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake.</inline>
                I. have not read the memorandum referred' to, and,' therefore. I am not in a position tq say whether or not it reflects on the General Officer Commanding. If my amendment be adopted, any other papers connected with the matter can be laid upon the table, if the Senate desires. I move -

            <para class="block">The inference as to any reflection is one which we may or may not draw, but certainly it is an inference we ought not to place on the records of the Senate, until we have had an opportunity to see the document. I am sure that neither the late Minister of Defence nor any honorable senator would desire to say that a document reflects upon any one until it is shown that it does so reflect. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>
                SYMON. - But the motion indirectly places it on the records of the Senate that there is a document which is alleged to reflect on the General Officer Commanding. We ought to be ready to condemn when condemnation is necessary,, but slow to convey, even indirectly, an imputation in respect to any officer, until we have had an opportunity to consider whether or not the allegation is borne out. The Government have no objection to lay this document and the reply upon the table.

                (Queensland). - I . have absolutely no objection to every document to which I, as Minister, put my signature, or any reply sent by the General Officer Commanding, being laid upon the table of the Senate for the inspection pf honorable senators. I understand, however, that what
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                wants is not only the particular memorandum which was published in the press, but other minutes which passed ' between the General Officer Commanding and myself during my term of office.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DAWSON.</inline>
                - The memorandum, I may say, is a kind of valedictory document. The practice of leaving "such memoranda was initiated by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John'</inline>
                Forrest, and followed by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman.</inline>
                I fell in with the idea, with the difference that I stated what I believed to be the absolute truth.

                certainly do not think they did.

                - Well, I say that, knowing the relations which existed between one branch of the Defence Department and the other, and having the opportunity to read those valedictory memoranda, I came to the determination that I would not write one similar. I am prepared 10 defend the memorandum I left behind. It has ' appeared in the press, but only one newspaper published the full text, and I shall be very pleased indeed to see the document laid upon the table of the Senate, for the perusal of honorable senators. There are other documents which
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline>
                if he chooses, can move for one at a time, but that course would only prolong the agony. Personally, I have not the slightest objection to the whole of the correspondence being laid on the table.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS</inline>
                (Queensland). - I suggest tha't the amendment be altered to provide for the production of all the correspondence between the late Minister of Defence and the- General Officer Commanding concerning
                <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan,</inline>
                the pistol pattern, the secret code, and the relations ot the late Minister of' Defence with the Department. Those documents would bt very interesting to the Senate, and instructive to the public, judging by the portions which have already appeared in the daily press.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline>
                observes, the documents, have been published in an emasculated form, and in order to avoid waste of time, I suggest that the amendment be altered in the direction indicated. Will the Attorney-General accept the suggested addition of words ?
            </para>
            <para>The PRESIDENT.- I think- the suggestion amounts to more than the addition, of words, and that it would be necessary for the Attorney-General to. withdraw his amendment </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline>
                would give me an opportunity to consider his suggestion, and not press mc to accept it . at this moment. My opinion is that we ought to pass the motion as proposed to be amended, and on a subsequent occasion, move for the production of other papers, if that be desired. ' That, as I say, will give me an opportunity to consider these matters, of which, of course, I know nothing, because they were not indicated when the motion was submitted.

                NEILD (New South Wales). - I desire to say that I at once accept the amendment moved by the Attorney-General, because I see that the honorable and learned senator has taken an exception to the motion -which others might take. I still think that what I intended might be covered toy the word " stated," and the motion might be read in that way.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson.</inline>

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>
                NEILD. - When the Attorney-General places such an interpretation on the motion, I recognise at once that it may be read in more ways than one. As it is my desire to move for the production of the papers, and not to attempt in doing so to pass any reflection upon the Minister or General Officer Commanding, I am prepared to accept the amendment.

                        <para>- I have always taken exception to these frequent adjournments of the Senate. I take special exception to an adjournment on this occasion, because, even if it be undesirable to go on with Government business, the leader of the Government in the Senate might have delayed his motion until private members' business had been considered this afternoon. We have had many adjournments while waiting for business to come from the House of Representatives, and now, when we have plenty of business, before us, we should go on with it. </para>

                            <para>- The proposed adjournment is not likely to make our record any better. Many honorable senators have come a very long way to attend to public business, and these frequent . adjournments are entirely unfair to them. I enter my protest, and shall push it to the length of calling for a division on the motion. </para>
