I am assured that there is no probability of a division being taken, and the matter being finally disposed of before to-morrow night, and that possibly the debate may extend to Friday.

              <para>- Unfortunately for myself I was absent, but that does not make any great difference. I fail to see why, when a motion of no-confidence is being debated in the other House, all business should be suspended in this Chamber. If this precedent is to be followed it will simply mean that the Senate, which was by the Constitution made equal with the other Chamber, will be relegated to an inferior position. The Senate, as far as I understand it, was never intended to be a party. </para>

          <para class="block">Chamber. It was designed by the framers of the Constitution as a States&#39; House, having for all practical purposes equal power with the other House. It was quite competent for us to continue doing business even though a no-confidence motion was being discussed in tha other House. For instance, we might have gone on with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. Possibly it will be answered by the Attorney-General that while the fate of the Government was trembling in the balance, it would not have been decent or profitable for the Senate to go on with business of that character. But looking at the matter broadly, I do not see why any difference ought to be made because a no-confidence motion is being debated in the other House. If the present Government did not take up the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, some other Government would, and if that other Government did not the Senate could assert itself by refusing to deal with any business from the other Chamber until its business had been finally dealt with elsewhere. The manner in which business has been hung up here from fortnight to fortnight will, I think, have the effect of belittling the Senate in the eyes of all Australia. It will detract, very largely from its influence, and, I might also say, from its usefulness, and elevate the House of Representatives to a position which was not contemplated under the Constitution. It is said that we have not the power of making and unmaking Governments. I never understood that the business of Parliament was primarily to make and unmake Governments. What we were sent here to do was to legislate, and if honorable members in another Chamber choose to engage in what I consider to be a mere scramble for office - and that is how it appears to me, one side being probably just as much to blame as the other - I do not see why the Senate, which is far removed from this party struggle, should suspend its sittings and allow its members to roam over the continent in a way that demoralizes them to a certain extent. </para>

              <para>- They are demoralizing the Senate by giving it almost a perpetual holiday, without, as far as I can see, any good reason. We might have utilized all this time in passing very necessary legislation, to be proceeded with when this wrangling between the two, three, or four parties in the other Chamber is ended. If we had been doing our duty, there would have been plenty of work ready for the other House to go on with. The members of the other House have done nothing, and we have done nothing except draw our salaries, which I suppose we have all done with alacrity. There is a great amount of business to be transacted, and I do not see any good and valid reason why the Senate, because of a motion of no-confidence, should continue to suspend its sittings. </para>

But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> must recollect that no legislation can be passed without the concurrence of both Chambers. Seeing that the Senate has only half as many members as the other House to discuss matters, and seeing that we are not so long-winded as our friends in another place, is is absurd to say that we should sit so frequently as that House. It might have been well if at the commencement of the no-confidence debate we had cleared our notice-paper of private business. </para>

            <para>- It is a mistake to talk about refusing an adjournment. I regret as much as anybody can that the Federal Parliament has done so little work since the last election. I pointed out on a previous occasion one of the causes. We have misunderstood and are misunderstanding the meaning of &#34; responsible government.&#34; We are giving far too narrow an interpretation to that term. Governments are responsible for too much in connexion with legislation, and unless there is a wider and different meaning given to the term, the position we are in now will become chronic. I have also risen in consequence of an expression used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> which I think was erroneous. He said that the Constitution created the Senate equal in every particular with the other House. That is not so. If that position were taken up by the Senate it would lead to unnecessary friction. The Senate is clothed by the Constitution with special functions, which it is considered the other House does not possess. In that respect the Senate may be considered superior to the other House, but generally it must be understood that the Senate is the second Chamber, whose function is to revise, to review, and, if necessary, to reasonably delay measures, but ultimately- </para>

              <para>- The Senate represents the States as States, and that is a very strong reason why it would be undemocratic and unwise to claim for it equality. In the Senate 100..000 or 200,000 persons in one State have as much representation as 1,250,000 in another State. If, with that kind of representation, the claim were to be set up that the Senate is in every particular equal with the other House, it would be a bad position to take up, and it certainly was not intended by the framers of the Constitution. </para>

              <para>- Quite so. I rather regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has taken this occasion to raise the point which he has raised, and I think that he has been altogether answered by the constitutional - and if I may say so, the more dignified - view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> with regard to the true position of the Senate under present circumstances. I regret it because I do not think that we are belittling the Senate in any way by declaring that whilst the constitutional stability and constitutional responsibility of the Government are challenged in another Chamber, the Senate will not proceed with business until that challenge has been settled in one way or the other. But it does appear to me - if I may say so with all deference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> - that it is rather belittling the Senate, after we have already determined this question twice, to raise it again now. It may appear to the outside public not only that we do not know our own mind&#39;s, but that we are uncertain as to our constitutional course of action, which we settled after what I think was an excellent debate in 1901 in anticipation of a no-confidence motion in t&#39;he other Chamber in connexion with the Tariff. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> will recollect that he had given notice of a formal motion in anticipation of the possibility of such a thing taking place, During the discussion on that occasion our esteemed friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> - now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor - expressed himself with great force and lucidity as to the position. It involves no inferiority as far as the Senate is concerned. It simply gives effect to the principles of responsible government, upon which, rightly or wrongly, our Federal system is founded, and in accordance with which the government of the country is supposed to be carried on, and the proceedings of Parliament conducted by a responsible Ministry, some of whose members are in the Senate, and some in the other House. We cannot differentiate between them, and say that we have confidence in the Ministry, as represented in this House, while the existence of the Ministry, as a whole, is challenged in the other House. These are questions which I do not desire again to raise, but I should like to read a few sentences from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor&#39;s</inline> observations. They seem to have a bearing upon the course of action which was taken on that occasion, and which has already been pursued, and will continue to be followed on the present occasion.

            <para>The Government is one Government. It is represented in the House of Representatives by certain Ministers, and it is represented iri the Senate by other Ministers.

We differ from other second Chambers in many other respects. We have infinitely more power.

            <para>- Since the last sitting of this Chamber there have appeared in the press of Victoria, New South Wales, and, I have no doubt, in the press of other States, certain statements seriously reflecting upon the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and upon myself. As to the reflections upon the Prime Minister, of course. I have no reason to address the Senate by way of a personal explanation. But so far as the matter refers to myself, I ask the indulgence of my fellow senators while I make a statement regarding an allegation which, if true, would warrant the Senate in expelling me, notwithstanding my election by large votes on two occasions. If the matter were one that did not concern &#39;the whole Commonwealth - because I take it that the honour of every member of the Commonwealth Legislature is of importance to the Commonwealth as a whole - I should take no notice of it; because in New South Wales, where I am known and respected, and where <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> John Lyne, to whose statements in the press &#163; refer, is known and detested- </para>

            <para>- Order. The honorable senator asked the indulgence of the Senate in order to make a personal explanation. No attacks ought to be made upon other persons in the course of a personal explanation. A personal explanation should be an explanation as to how the senator making it has been misrepresented or how any words of his have been misconstrued, but he ought not to attack Other persons. For this reason - no answer can be made ; no debate can take place. The honorable senator is the only person who can speak. </para>

If he is, every honorable senator will, I presume, have the right, every time a newspaper makes an attack upon him, to make a personal explanation concerning it, and the Senate Chamber will become the scene of wrangling about newspaper statements. </para>

I suggest that the standing order under which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is making a personal explanation refers to the proceedings of the Senate, and the power to explain applies to something in connexion with the proceedings of the Senate. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has said, if honorable senators may rise to explain or to refute statements which have been made with reference to them outside, the business of the Senate will be considerably retarded.
