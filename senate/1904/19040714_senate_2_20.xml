        <para class="block">My reason for submitting this motion is, that an attempt is being made through the; medium of the press, notably by one powerful organ in Victoria, to show by a devioususe of figures, that the present Tariff is operating injuriously to the industries of the Commonwealth, and particularly to certain industries in Victoria. The <inline font-style="italic">Victorian Year Book,</inline> as pointed out by that very journal in its leading columns to-day, shows that the facts are quite to the contrary j but still the assertion is being made, and, in certain circles, is giving rise to the belief that the existing depression in Victoria is partly due to the Federal Tariff ; {Hat the Federal Parliament,, having in its wisdom reduced a number of the duties, which were previously very high in Victoria, suffering has resulted to the industries of that State. If that be the fact, it is well that the people of the , Commonwealth should know it ; at any rate, the matter is of sufficient importance to warrant the production of accurate figures on which to base an opinion.- It is within my own knowledge that the figures published by the press are creating a disturbed feeling in the minds of a large number of people. This movement oil the part of the journal to which I. have referred is evidently inaugurated for the purpose of causing a revival of the Tariff struggle, and the re-casting of the Federal Tariff in certain particulars ; and it is well that before the agitation grows to any dimensions the&#39; true official figures should be placed before both Parliament and the people. It should be shown whether or not the figures which are now being published by interested parties - that is, by both the revenue tariff organ and the Protectionist organ - truly represent the facts. The return can be prepared at small cost, seeing &#39;that the details are in the possession of the Department of Trade and Customs ; and there is not the slightest doubt that such information will be most valuable to Parliament, and instructive to the community. I think the Senate might very well accept the motion, in order to&#62; ascertain what has been the effect of the </para>

It is too bad that in the month of July, it is not possible to get full details of the Commonwealth imports -and exports for last year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in his motion, speaks of exports from one State to another.

For goods passing from one State to another entries have to be passed giving the value ; but the value given includes the duty paid. A large quantity of tobacco and cigars are sent from New South Wales and Victoria to other States, and the value of these goods is increased three or four times over by reason of the fact I have mentioned, so that the returns are very unreliable. The statistics relating to goods passing from State to State should be kept distinct from those relating to exports and imports, the latter being limited to trade with the external world. </para>

            <para>- When this motion was last before the Senate it was debated at considerable length, but it was thought desirable that a division should not be taken, because there was a very small attendance of senators, and that was my reason for moving the adjournment of the debate. I felt satisfied at the time that the majority were in favour of the motion, but. I considered it would be more satisfactory to the mover, and those who thought with him, as well as fairer to the other side, that a division should not be taken until honorable senators who were then absent had an opportunity of dis-&#39; cussing the question. The arguments that were advanced on that occasion were mainly in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> motion. Very few were advanced in opposition to it. The bitterest opponent of day labour was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> and his position seemed to be based more upon theory than upon actual facts. He adduced verv few facts to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> contention was incorrect, and that contract labour is preferable to day labour in connexion with Government works. I would call <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> attention to two very important works in his own State, the facts in connexion with which should show him that the con- tention which he advanced is entirely wrong. I would recall to his mind, first of all, the work known as the North East Dundas Tramway. It is really a 2 -ft. railway. It is seventeen and three-quarter miles in length, exclusive of sidings, and the total cost was &#163;46,776, or ,&#163;2,775 Per mile. An estimate was made before the work was commenced by competent experts in the employment of the Government. It was what might be called a flying estimate, based upon a rough survey of the route which the line was to traverse. The estimated cost of the work was &#163;2,000 a mile. The estimated cost of the earthworks was 2s. per cubic yard. The surveyors went ahead of the construction gang, and, after a more  careful survey was made, it was discovered that the country was very much rougher in character, and the timber very much denser, than had at first been thought. As a matter of fact, the work altogether was discovered to be very much more difficult and expensive than had been originally estimated. The chief fact which I wish to impress upon the minds of honorable senators who favour contract as against day labour is that the actual cost per cubic yard of the earthworks, including rock cuttings, was is. nd., as against the engineers&#39; estimate of 2s. a yard. There were some seven and three-quarter miles where the earthwork consisted chiefly of rock cuttings. These earthworks cost &#163;3,600 per mile. The construction of that line by day labour proved conclusively that the day-labour system was cheaper than the contract system. It has been proved beyond dispute, since the work was completed, that the work done upon the line, such as bridge construction, was certainly very much better performed than it would have been under the contract system. That railway stands as a strong argument in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> contention that day labour is preferable to contract labour in the construction of Government works. </para>

              <para>- It would be better for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> to endeavour to prove his case from instances from his own State,  rather than choose them from another State. I intend to confine myself to cases occurring in the State which I have the honour to represent, and to works of which I have, personal knowledge, and which I have seen. I leave it to others to adduce instances from their own States. Another instance in Tasmania is furnished by what are known as the Macquarie Harbor Improvement Works. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is conversant with that work, the object of which was to deepen the navigable channel at Macquarie Harbor by building a breakwater at the entrance. A large contract was let and was partly carried out, but before the work was completed it was found advisable by! the Macquarie Harbor Board, which had control, to depart from the contract system and adopt day labour. </para>

              <para>- Whether the Board is bankrupt or not has nothing to do with the case. If it is bankrupt it is because it now has no revenue. It was indubitably proved that the portions of the work which were constructed under the day-labour system were carried out more cheaply, yard for yard, than the portion constructed under the contract system, and what is of infinitely greater importance in a work of this kind - a breakwater being subject to the swell of the ocean and to the -force of storms - they were infinitely better carried out. That fact is being confirmed by the tremendously severe storms which recur every few months. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable and learned senator, next time he is in Hobart, will make inquiries, he will find that there was a saving over the estimated cost of completing the work ; and, of course, that estimate was based upon the cost of the work that had already been done under the contract system. It has also to be remembered that the -work done by day labour was infinitely more difficult and important than the work done by contract, because it was the end of the breakwater going farthest out into the sea. The difficulty and importance of that part of the work must- be palpable to any one who is at all conversant with works of the kind. </para>

              <para>- By the wellknown fact that there are too many leakages in connexion with contracts, and that contractors do not carry on business from motives of philanthropy, but to make as much profit as they can out of the works which they carry out. The State, by carrying out the works itself, saves the contractor&#39;s profit. Those honorable senators who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> are utterly opposed to the day-labour system, cannot get over the fact that in many instances the re lations&#39; between contractors and officials supervising Government works have not been what could be called clean. </para>

              <para>-&#34; One swallow does not make a summer.&#34; We have heard a great deal of the &#34; Ca&#39; canny system,&#34; and &#34;the day labour stroke,&#34; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> might remember that there is such a thing as what has been termed &#34; the perverse ingenuity of unprincipled avarice&#34; on the part of contractors. The subject is an important one, seeing that the Commonwealth will, in the near future, have large works to carry out. It is important that we should determine whether those works shall be done under contract or under the day-labour system. But, so far as the arguments used in this debate have gone, they prove that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> contention is correct, and that the day-labour system is preferable to the contract system in the construction of Government works. I trust that the motion will be carried. </para>

            <para>- At first sight, in considering a  subject  of this character, one might assume that the Government would save money in carrying out works by day labour, as there would be no contractors&#39; profit. But, after all, we have to be guided by the experience that has been gained by the different States which have adopted the day-labour principle. I cannot speak of the experience of other&#39; States than New South Wales. But  I know that New South Wales has had a very bitter experience of the results of the day-labour system. </para>

              <para>.- The system has grown since the party to which I had the honour to belong went out of office. Very little day-labour work was done before that time. But since then we have had notorious cases, in which scandals occurred, so that it . became necessary to make full inquiry into them. The cases have been alluded to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> who has had the papers before him. One is what is known as the Fitzroy Dock case, and the other the Prince Alfred Hospital case. They afford glaring examples of the results of the day-labour system. I am perfectly willing to admit that the reply may be made that the scandals were in consequence of the unsatisfactory way in which the departmental officials, members of Parliament, and Ministers dealt with the matters that came before them. But it must be recognised that while we have Ministers, who are dependent upon political support for their tenure of office, we shall be likely to have such abuses. The more important the work, the more liability will there be to have the day-labour system abused. It was found by the Fitzroy Dock Inquiry that really no control was exercised by the superintendent of the works over his men.&#34; If he saw fit to dismiss a man all that the man had to do, if he had amember of Parliament at his back, was to get that member to interview the Minister, when he was sent back to work again. </para>

              <para>.- What I have stated has been shown in evidence. If the dismissal had been made by a contractor for any good &#39;reason the man would not have been taken back. The contractor would not have had any member of Parliament wielding political influence behind him. Under this system, if a man chose to do an honest day&#39;s&#39;work he did it j but if he chose to shirk his work he shirked it. If he was dismissed, he quietly went to the member for the district, the member went to the Minister, and the Minister insisted upon the man going back to work again. &#39; In this way it became known that the superintendent had lost all control over the men. </para>

              <para>.- An honorable senator who is provided with these extracts will probably read them to the Senate at a later stage. Take the case of the additions to the Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. The result of the inquiry was to show that, owing to the employment of day labour, the estimated cost of the work had been vastly increased. The estimated cost of the stone work had been increased by 25 per cent. These are two notorious instances. Again, take the post office which was erected at Newcastle. Although it was tendered for at less than&#163;20,000, it has cost nearly . &#163;35,000 to complete the building by day labour. </para>

              <para>- There is a pneumatic tube which the Post and Telegraph Department do not wish to take over from New South Wales, because of its excessive cost, and of tEe inferior way in which it was carried out. Honorable senators must not think that I am saying that day labour should not under any circumstances be employed by the Government, but I submit that it is very difficult to supervise such work, and to see that it is done in the manner in which it should be. We know quite well that there is a tendency to lessen the amount of work done in a given time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> quoted from an English publication the other day evidence that owing to the action of the trades unions the number of bricks laid in building in a day has been decreased. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps it was, but it shows a tendency to minimize, as far as possible, the quantity of work which should be done within a given time. The Government will be utterly unable to control- the work as it should be controlled if they employ day labour on all occasions. I admit that there are some works which probably can be carried out most efficiently under the supervision of their officers with day labour ; but ,works which involve a great many operations, and entail a vast expenditure, do not come under that category. </para>

Because it was found that the pressure of members of Parliament was of .such a character that the works were unduly expensive. There was more trouble and expense in carrying out works by the multiplicity of officers who were thrown upon the Government by means of political influence. </para>

I do not wish to see the motion either affirmed or negatived, because I recognise that it is very much better that the Government should be left free and untrammelled in dealing with the construction of public works from time to time. They should have the opportunity of placing work either in the hands of a contractor, or of carrying it out under their own officers with day labour, as they think best. In that way, each system could be given a trial. Each case ought to be -dealt with on its merits. I am not going, either to unduly praise or run down contractors. I recognise that contractors are like everybody else. If a contractor takes a contract, he wants to make money. When any one does any work, does he not want to be paid for it ? </para>

In every State of the Commonwealth, in every part of the world, contractors have been very necessary, and have done very good work for governments, communities, and citizens, as they will continue to do. Apparently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> wishes to wipe the contractor out of existence. A contractor is just the same as any other&#39; individual. He has to spend his money in &#34;the community in which it was earned, and the community are assisted by the presence of a larger number of persons in their midst than would otherwise be the case. </para>

              <para>- If we could manage to bring about an ideal system, we might be able to carry out the views of the honorable senator; but we have to take human nature as it is. We have to recognise that we cannot perfect human nature all at once, and that we are not going to achieve that result by adopting a hard-and-fast rule for the employment of day labour. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> could see his way . to do so, after the discussion/ of this very important question, he would be consulting the interests of not only this, but any future Government, by withdrawing the motion. Let a Government be responsible for the way in which a work is carried out. If it can be shown that in the case of any work the Government have thrown away money which could have been saved by adopting either one system or the other, let them answer for their mistakes, if of a serious nature, but do not tie their hands. I was asked to give concrete instances. Well, I have stated some notorious facts which have, I believe, been published in the press from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. If honorable senators wish to see the authority for these statements, .let me refer them to the report  of the inquiries held concerning the Fitzroy Dock, and the Prince Alfred Hospital. </para>

              <para>.- A little time ago, it was proposed that certain locomotives should be built in New South Wales. The Fitzroy Dock sent in a tender, and when an inquiry was held it was found that the price had been fixed by a rule-of -thumb. They had taken the amount which it cost to land engines in New South Wales, and &#34;added a certain percentage, and, without making further inquiry, said, &#34;We will tender at that rate.&#34; Of course, they tendered in open competition with others. If the contract had been given to the Dock and the work had cost double the amount of the tender, who would have lost? The State, not a contractor. </para>

              <para>- I could not say exactly what it was, because the papers have not yet been laid before the Parliament. I endeavoured to obtain a copy of the papers, but I found that they had not been tabled. Whether this motion is carried or not, I dare  say  that the Government will very probably to a large extent act upon the suggestion.- Perhaps their own ideas will lead them in that direction. Let them be given full liberty to do what they see fit. If the Government should carry out works with day labour, I should be very pleased to find that the trial of the system had been a success, and that money had been saved to the Commonwealth. It is out of no spirit of hostility to the Government, or to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> that I have spoken in this way. </para>

            <para>- I intend to support the motion. I recognise that it embodies a great principle. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> that we should have some regard for the experience of the various States in this matter. And if we are guided by the experience of Western Australia, we shall come to the conclusion that it will be a wise thing for  the Federal Government &#34;to adopt the principle of day labour. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> mentioned that, while a contractor offered to erect the Newcastle Post Office for &#163;20,000,  the cost of its construction by day labour was  &#163;35,000.  Even if that were the case, I could instance contractors in Western Australia who have received three times the amount of their tender. I could also instance jerry buildings which in a very few years will be falling to pieces, and which are held up to public ridicule. To the Law Courts, for instance, crowds of men in the building trade go on Sunday to examine the jerry work which was put into its construction. The Newcastle post-office is now regarded as one of the finest stone buildings in New South Wales; and, having travelled nearly round the Continent, I would go so  far as to say that it is one of the finest stone buildings in the Commonwealth. That confirms me in the belief that the extra expenditure on the building was well incurred. </para>

              <para>- In his speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> referred to contractors and their ways. A meeting of the Contractors&#39; Association was held in Perth a few nights afterwards, and a small committee of, I think, four members was appointed to reply to his statements, not in the press of the State, where the people know the facts of the case, but in the press of the Eastern States. A reply, drawn up by these four gentlemen, was duly wired to the press of Sydney, where I read it. </para>

The Western Australian Mint furnishes another instance of the way in which contractors derive large profits. The original price in the tender foi this work was &#163;22,199 8 s. 3d.&#62; while the cheque drawn by the contractors was  &#163;55,888 ns. 3d., or an increase of &#163;33-689 3s. </para>

              <para>- By carrying the motion, can we not remove many of the means by which corruption is brought about ? Let me describe the system of contracting in Western Australia. Contractors are asked to send in alternative tenders. They send in one tender to erect a building chiefly of stone, and another tender to erect the building chiefly of brick. Having ascertained beforehand that the&#34; building is intended to be erected with brick, they put in the lowest possible tender for the stone building, and the highest tender for the brick building. The tender for the stone building is accepted. The work is commenced, but as soon as a little time has elapsed, the Government Architect &#39; finds out, after consulting with the contractors, that it is inadvisable to continue the building with stone. Consequently, they make the alteration, and so give the high price which the contractor knew before he contracted he would ultimately receive. This is corruption of a very bad order. I am pleased to say, although it may not gratify every member of the Senate, that a party is coming into power which will do away with a great deal of that corruption. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> referred to the Coolgardie water scheme. I notice that in some criticisms it has been stated that it was a very costly job, and could have been done more cheaply by contract. Corruption was so rife during the progress of that job, that it had to carry on its shoulders an expert called Couston. For what reason he was employed, and of what use he was, I do not know. He was supposed to be the inventor of a patent caulking machine, in respect of which he received a large sum of money from the Government, in addition to a salary of , &#163;10  per week for supervising the work. It was found, however, that the machine, when handed over, was absolutely useless - that when it was employed, the work had to be done over again by hand. For two years, or thereabouts, the Government kept the workshop going with two mechanics and one labourer, testing and experimenting with the machine until it was rendered serviceable, and quite a different machine from that which had been handed over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Couston.  Nevertheless, the Government continued to pay this man for his services, and for the use of his &#34; patent.&#34; As an indication of the scheming which went on over this work, I may say that the engineer had to be dismissed, and the position of affairs became such that the EngineerinChief was impelled to take his own life. If the Coolgardie water scheme appears to have been a costly job, it will be seen that there were other reasons for that than the employment of day labour. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in reply to observations made in the press regarding his observations when he introduced this motion, wrote the following letter, which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of Saturday last: - </para>

            <para>My attention has been called to a report telegraphed from Perth of a meeting of contractors conveying a resolution passed by them expressing surprise at my &#34; daring effrontery &#34; in quoting the Coolgardie water scheme in support of my motion in favour of public works being carried out under the day labour system. A somewhat similar report was published in the Melbourne daily press, but in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> the public and myself were given trie advantage of knowing the names of the mover and seconder of the above resolution, Messrs. Hedges and Atkins. </para>

          <para class="block">I might explain that these two gentlemen have been conspicuous in Western Australia for their success in piling on extras in every contract with which they have been connected. </para>
          <para>When the public know, as Western Australian people will, that these gentlemen have a personal interest in the matter, both being large Government contractors in the past, and, further, that both of them are suffering^ the after-effects of a severe defeat, at the recent State elections (W.A.) - one <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hedges)</inline> receiving a very severe defeat at the hands of a labour representative - the public of the Eastern States will appreciate the reason for the vitriolic nature of the attack. Now as to their statements. First, a reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will show that I never claimed that the Coolgardie water scheme proved that day labour was cheaper than contract ; in fact, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> I admitted that, no tenders having been called, it was impossible to make a comparison. My critics have picked out one portion, that of the pipe-caulking, which cost about &#163;150,000 out of a total expenditure of &#163;2,500,000. A reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will show that I also called attention to the fact that the Commission had unsparingly condemned this portion of the work, but on the authority of the Commission report, Part IV., claimed that the excessive cost was largely due to the &#34; contract &#34; entered into for the supply of patent caulking machines. </para>

            <para>Of the weir,  a most important part of the scheme, which cost &#163;300,000, the Commission report (paragraph 1) &#34;That the work has been done at a reasonable cost.&#34; The statement is made that the Engineer-in-Chief, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> Y. O&#39;Connor, before his death, had to confess &#34; that the day labour system was a failure.&#34; I defy these persons to produce any such statement of his. On the contrary,&#39; on page 351 of the Commission&#39;s report, in answer to a similar statement made in the Assembly, will be found a memo, written by him, in which he emphatically denies that he has ever gone back on his previous convictions, which were that day labour was1 the best. Another statement - that the State Government, after building a number of railways by day labour, being convinced of the excessive cost, were constructing all railways now by contract. This is a very ingenious argument, for the reason that the Western Australian Government are not at present, as far as I am aware, constructing any railway by either system. The statement <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> Fremantle wharf is exactly the opposite of what occurred, as it was the contract portion winch proved faulty, and the same is true of the Bunbury jetty. </para>

This man, in effect, said, &#34; If you. do not give me the contract I shall make the job spin out, and cause it to cost &#163;20,000 more, and shall let the people on the gold-fields&#39;, even at this time of the year, remain another two months without water.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> contends that we should consider the question very carefully, inasmuch as no other countries have ever thought of adopting the principle of day labour. </para>

              <para>- The Manchester Corporation, after hearing the reports of the city engineers, found it necessary to stop the contract work and complete the sewers by day labour, but that was not before the contractors had drawn some &#163;600,000.

These municipal bodies are composed largely of crusted Conservatives like my friends, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> It is on record that in Great Britain thirty separate local Government bodies directly administer &#163;400,000,000 of capital invested in works, and directly employ over 300,000 workmen. Those governing bodies have laid out &#163;88,000,000 in various municipal works, and are receiving annually a net profit of &#163;3,613,668. This capital is invested in water works, ;gas works, electric lighting works, and similar undertakings. The total capital invested in water works is &#163;48,434,890. </para>

              <para>- I have not the figures. I have, however, given the facts and figures in regard to Western Australia, though I confess I have not gone very deeply into the matter as it affects England. I may say that the total amount invested in Great Britain by those bodies in water works is ,-&#163;48,434,890, and the average annual net profit received is &#163;1,744,361. The amount invested in gas works is &#163;20,175,764, and the average annual net profit is &#163;1,180,208. In tramways the capital invested is &#163;3,213,654, and the annual net profit is &#163;133,390. </para>

              <para>- It is peculiar that honorable senators on the other side, as business men, should object to this principle, when others, with large sums invested in various ways in Australia, adopt it&#39; for their own profit. Messrs. Sargood, Butler, and Nichol built their Western Australian warehouse by day labour, in order to secure for themselves the profits which would otherwise have gone to the contractor, and that warehouse is one of the best buildings of the kind in  Western  Australia. . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anthony</inline> Hordern, of Sydney, is now engaged erecting his new warehouses by day labour, and I doubt whether any honorable senators opposite can claim to have the business experience of that gentleman. </para>

              <para>- I am pleased to retract my words, but I can only go by the report of the debate. I join in the appeal made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to withdraw the motion- after it has been debated. I recognise that- on a division the vote would be in favour of the motion, but I think there is a higher consideration. The responsibility for the expenditure of public money lies with the Minister in charge of public works, as the trustee for the people of the Commonwealth. This motion is proposed by a Ministerial supporter, and he ought to recognise that if the Minister desires, in the interests of the Commonwealth, to expend money on a particular work, he should be left to exercise the responsibility of determining upon the system of labour to be adopted. If he thought it wise, he might employ day labour. But he should not be compelled to do so otherwise. Therefore, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> could see his way to allow the debate to close without taking a division, he would be doing a kindness both to the Ministry and to the Commonwealth . </para>

              <para>- I think that the Ministry is, for the time being, the trustee of the Commonwealth in administering its affairs, and I contend that that position carries with it a great responsibility. Although my political experience has not been so great as that of many honorable senators, I cannot recall a case in which anyParlia  ment has interfered by directing how an expenditure should be carried out by the Government. It is especially strange that a direction of that kind should be given at the instance of a member of the Government&#39;s party. </para>

              <para>- I hope to convince the honorable senator that that is not the case. I do not know what is the meaning of the word &#34; practicable &#34; in this motion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal</inline> interprets it in the ordinary business acceptation of the term, but I take it. that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> puts a very much broader construction upon it. The examples by which he supported his motion included one in which the Western Australian Government undertook a work involving the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds without any estimate having previously been given as to what the cost would be by contract as against day labour. Such a- course as that is not business-like. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> does not see his way to withdraw the motion, he should at all events modify it, so as to fall in with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford&#39;s</inline> idea that we should know exactly what we are to spend before we undertake a public work.

              <para>- If that be the case, the report which I hold in my hand cannot be true. At this meeting it was resolved -  &#34; That this meeting expresses its surprise at the daring effrontery of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in quoting the Coolgardie Water Scheme in supporting his motion in favour of day labour for the construction of public works, as&#39; against the contract system. We refer him to the report of the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the cost and management of the above works, and especially to section 14, which reads as follows : - &#34; The question of contract work <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> departmental day labour has been the battle-ground of rival forces for years past, and has been prominent in this connection. So far, however, as this undertaking is concerned, it may be safely said that it will never be cited by the advocates of departmental day labour as an example in support of their principles; whereas their opponents have strong . testimony in their favour when they can point to the pipe trench and manhole excavations as having cost about 3s. per cubic yard on this work, instead of is. 6d., for which it could have been done under contract. How much of this excessive cost was due to weak supervision, and how much to Government stroke the Commission is unable to decide.&#34; </para>

          </continue>
          <para>Could a more serious condemnation of day labour as applied to that particular work be made? Here is a Royal Commission absolutely stating that the work cost double what it ought to have cost. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> never told us a word about that. </para>

              <para>- The report goes on -  . . namely, the Boulder-Brown Hill, completed in 1902 ; Northam-Goomalling, completed in 1902 ; Menzies-Leonora, completed in 1902 ;  Cue-Nannine  completed in 1903 ; Owen&#39;s Anchorage, Woodman&#39;s Point, completed in 1902 ; and, being convinced of the excessive cost of the day labour system, are now constructing railways by contract. The Fremantle Wharf, constructed by day labour, subsided, and left its alignment, whilst the contract work has proved to be of excellent character. We also ask him to read the Royal Commission&#39;s reports on the Fitzroy Dock and Prince Alfred Hospital pavilions, Sydney, both reports being strongly condemnatory of the system he wishes to impose on the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. The late Engineer-in-Chief had to confess before the completion of the Coolgardie Water Scheme that the day labour system was a failure. </para>

Upon so serious a question I would not, under any circumstances - no matter what my own personal views Were - exaggerate one way or the other in order to attain political ends. I want to get at the truth of the matter as far as I can. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was wise when he stated, at the commencement of his speech, that he brought the matter forward at this stage because at present there are no great Commonwealth works in progress, and because the subject is one that ought to be well debated. It will be a benefit to the Commonwealth to discuss the subject in that spirit. My contention is; that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would be wise to leave the matter to be determined by the Government themselves, allowing them to take the responsibility of carrying out works by day labour if they choose. I would point out that whilst there may be a number of irresponsible bodies, who are not spending their own money, who are prepared to carry out works by day labour, it is very rare indeed that business people,, in a large way,  undertake buildings by day labour in preference to contract. Why is that so? Why is it that all the world over it is believed that building work should be carried out by contract? It is because, in the present condition of affairs - especially in these States, as distinct from the condition of affairs in old established countries - we have a Labour Party, which has. a larger domination here than elsewhere. It is, to a great extent, on .those grounds that it will be found that irresponsible bodies of men are prepared to spend money by day labour in preference to having work done by contract. I venture to say that if honorable senators had saved money, and were&#39; able to undertake works of their own, there is but a very small percentage of them who would not want to know in advance what their buildings were likely te cost. They would obtain tenders for the works. But honorable senators who support this motion wish to compel the Government to carry out works without an estimate being formed in advance as to the  price for which they could be done by contract. Of course there may be persons who could profitably carry out works by day labour. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> is one who would probably be able to do that, because he has a knowledge of all the details which are necessary in the carrying out of large works successfully. He knows where to put his hands upon foremen and upon first-class workmen, and he knows where he can obtain materials at bedrock prices. Where an individual can set to work with that knowledge, I have no doubt that day labour is profitable. I have never heard any one who would venture to say that day labour in itself means bad labour. Day labour means absolutely the best of labour. I do not hesitate for a moment to say that. It would be nonsense to suppose that the case was otherwise. But with human nature as it is - in Australia, at all events - I venture to say that he would indeed be a bold man who would spend his own money upon any large buildings without entering into a contract for carrying them out. </para>

              <para>- I could give a reason for that, but do not care to do so. I am not sufficiently strong in my knowledge of the circumstances to say whether what I believe to be the case is absolutely the truth. But I will say that I have every reason to believe that there were influences at work; and it must be remembered also that Anthony Hordern is able to buy materials at bed-rock prices. </para>

              <para>- I do not know of any Government that does it. I do know of a Government that has spent upon materials from 30 to 40 per cent, more than the price for which they could be purchased by other people. If our Governments were composed of men who would be absolutely certain to safeguard the interests of the taxpayers in regard to the purchase of materials. I should say that it would be safe to employ day labour ; but, things being; as they are, and with the knowledge that we have, a man would be a fool to intrust his money, or to vote for a Government spending money, for carrying out works by day labour without having estimates made in advance, and without surrounding the work with safeguards. If such precautions were not taken, we should under present conditions simply give every encouragement to wasteful extravagance, and should also, I an-, bound to say, run a great risk of political corruption. That is a strong word to use. But I venture to say that no one can read the evidence which is contained in these two reports without coming to the conclusion that for years there has been absolute corruption in New South Wales, and, from what I can hear, in Western Australia as well, with regard to the expenditure of public moneys. Do honorable senators suppose that in its initiatory stage the Commonwealth can safely say - &#34;We will dc without all safeguards, we will take no notice of what has occurred in certain States, and will give <inline font-style="italic">carte blanche</inline> to a Government which is supported by the party who were the principal means of allowing all this corruption to take place in New South Wales.&#34; Honorable senators may smile at my remarks- </para>

              <para>- No; there was no sweating about the work. In the case of the Technical College, at Broken Hill, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Perry,</inline> the Minister of Justice, in the Labour-Lyne-See Government, stated that the work was done by day labour, and exceeded the estimate by 50 per cent. I have here <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne&#39;s parliamentary estimate of the cost of the Commonwealth celebrations, but I do not think it is fair to publish the figures, because, although it was an extraordinary expenditure, still only a certain part of the work must be put down to day labour. These are all the cases I have been able to obtain up to the present time, as I have been sick. But the day-labour principle has been in vogue in New South Wales for four years, and it has simply led to waste, corruption, and demoralization. </para>

              <para>- I daresay that there has been plenty of corruption under the contract system; but, as a business man, I submit that a contractor can only do what is wrong by collusion with somebody else, and that other person is just as likely to do wrong if he has a chance, under either system. What is the difference between day labour and contracting? In the case of the Government of -a State, the contractor who submits the lowest estimate gets the work, and then, perhaps, owing to  competition, he is not able to fulfil the conditions of the contract unless he has recourse to indirect means. A business man who proposes to build  large works, acts in an entirely different manner. He goes to a responsible architect, and authorizes the number of tenders to be called. As a business man, he takes care to ascertain the character of the tenderers, and that a contractor will be able to carry out the contract at the amount tendered. In no case have I accepted the lowest tender from the architect. When the tenders have been received, the business man inquires as to the character and position of the tenderer, and if the result of the inquiry is satisfactory, a contract is let. But in the case of a Government, the lowest tenderer gets the work, whether he is a good man or not. </para>

              <para>- There may be; but, so far as my experience goes, most of the contractors who have made money have been engaged on Government works. The advantage which a reputable contractor has over the day labour system, is that h&#39;e knows exactly where to pick men. He knows that a certain number of men can be relied upon as being able and skilful workmen. He knows, too, that he can get more work out of those men than he could by engaging indiscriminately a number of workmen. If one thing is emphasized more than another in the reports of these Royal Commissions, it is that when an inexperienced man has been put on to work alongside one of the best men, the latter has been brought down to the level of the former. Let me state what is going on in the catchment area outside Sydney. In the report of this Royal Commission, it is stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidd</inline> - who is a member of the Government - and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Storey</inline> - who is a Labour member - have during the last fifteen months nominated over 2,000 men for employment in that catchment area, which is in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidd&#39;s</inline> electorate. The Engineer-in-Chief states in this report that he could have saved &#163;25,000 on that work if he had been authorized to engage the men, instead of their being put on under the pressure of political influence. There is a case of indiscriminate labour being, put together. One man is able to do four shillings&#39; worth of work- </para>

              <para>- It was a peculiar tone to employ for that purpose. Speaking as a man who is anxious that not only New South Wales, but all the States, should progress, I believe honestly that if it goes forth to the civilized world that the Senate of the Commonwealth has passed a resolution of this kind without any safeguard, giving a sort of instruction to Ministers to spend the people&#39;s money on day labour, it will have a most injurious effect on the already weak financial position of the States. </para>

I have here the report of the Royal Commission, appointed by the Government of New South Wales, to inquire into the working and administration of the Government docks and workshops at Cockatoo Island. According to that report the complaints which led to the appointment of the Commission indicated that affairs at the dock were very unsatisfactory, inasmuch as there appeared to be a &#34; lack of discipline, and symptoms of general disorganization.&#34; In that portion of the ieport which deals with hindrances to efficient and economical management, and with the political influence that was exerted, there is a paragraph as follows - </para>

            <para>The desire to act in this way is rather general, and much of the Minister&#39;s time has on occasions been occupied in listening to appeals of this kind, many of which obtained his practical sympathy. The office of superintendent is thus deprived of the dignity and respect which it should command from the workmen, and the superintendent himself becomes disheartened, so that he finally ceases to urge necessary economies, lest he should suffer the further humiliation of seeing his recommendations ignored. This power of a manager to select, to reward, to dispense with men, uncontrolled by any &#39;other considerations than the maintenance of the establishment in a state of highest efficiency, is of the most vital importance. </para>

            <para>I would like to point out that the practice of members of Parliament asking for positions for men, has been going on for a great many years. It is not the growth of a few years. You can see from some of the evidence which has been quoted, that it was in existence then. I think it has -always been in existence, and that is one of the reasons why there has always been a want of discipline. I am quite willing to admit that it would be better if this power.were taken out of the hands of the Minister altogether. I would be glad to have it taken from me. </para>

For instance, the Minister does not hesitate to communicate directly with the superintendent of the dock with regard to the men.

              <para>- I am sorry to say these events did occur in New South Wales; but my regret would have been as deep if they had occurred in Victoria or any other State. With the knowledge thus gained of what has been done under the domination of the unions in Sydney - with the knowledge that the unionists dominate the Labour Party, and that the Labour Party dominate the Ministry - I ask the representatives of that party in the Senate, in these early years of the Commonwealth, to take a higher than a mere party view. We should take care to establish safeguards against political interference under any circumstances in connexion with public works undertaken by the Commonwealth. It is impossible for a thoughtful person not to see that in the Commonwealth there is a rising tide of political domination, engineered by a certain section of the Labour Party. I believe that the members of that party desire the best interests of the Commonwealth, as those interests reveal themselves from their point of view; but interference in matters beyond the sphere of trades unions must work irreparable mischief to the Commonwealth, if any loop-hole be left for the exercise of political influence in any form, either by the Labour Party, or any other party, I care not which. The Labour Party, if they are sincere in their  anxiety to do what is best for labour, broadly speaking, throughout the Commonwealth, will do their utmost to prevent any repetition of what we have witnessed in some of the States. </para>

              <para>- -Yes, absolutely from the Labour Party. In Sydney at the present time there are 20,000 unemployed, and the State 3 per cent, stocks, which four years ago stood at &#163;104, and were the highest in Australia, are now at &#163;86. I say deliberately that that state of affairs has been brought about, if not altogether, in a great measure by political influence, which has forced the Government to do that which is not right, but that which is necessary to placate the Labour Party, by whom the local Parliament is dominated. </para>

It is for the first Labour Government to prove that they are worthy of their position, because by that means they may to a certain1 extent relieve Australia of the discredit it has earned in consequence of the class of legislation which has characterized the last few years. I am sure there is no honorable senator who really believes in his heart that Australia has now the good name she enjoyed four years ago. </para>

              <para>- &#34;The proof of the pudding is in the eating;&#34; and the condition of affairs in Sydney prevails in spite of the large extra amount of money which New South Wales has received under the Commonwealth Tariff. When we see the Western Australia 3 per cent, stock standing the lowest amongst the stocks of the States, we must come to the conclusion that the position of the Commonwealth is not what it should be. As a business man, I should like to be able to draw a different picture; but I cannot. The future depends to a very great extent on the manner in which the Government conduct the affairs of the Commonwealth. This motion I regard as the first attempt on the part of the Labour Party to bring pressure on the Government to depart from a mode of business which&#39; has proved most effective throughout the world. Whatever exception there may be in the case of private people with large means, the fact remains that all the great works in the world are carried out by contract. I ask /Senator Pearce to with&#39;draw his motion when the debate has been closed. The responsibility for the expenditure of money on public works ought to be left with the Government, and then it would be impossible for political influence to obtain a footing. </para>

            <para>- The question I have to decide is whether or not the ruling given by the Acting  Chairman  of Committees is, in my opinion, correct That ruling was that a certain amendment, which it was suggested should be made, was not relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill. But, before dealing with the question as to whether the suggested amendment can or can not be entertained by the Committee, it would appear desirable to state what is the test of the powers of such Committee.. There are different tests as to what ought or ought not to be in a Bill at. different stages.- When a Bill is first introduced, it is provided by standing orders 179 and 180 -  179. The title shall agree with the order of leave, -and no clause shall be inserted in any such Bill foreign to its title. 180. Every Bill not prepared pursuant to the order of leave, or. according to the Rules and Orders of the Senate, shall be ordered to be withdrawn. </para>

        <para class="block">These are limitations on the senator who has obtained leave to introduce the Bill, and do not in any way refer to or restrict the powers of the Committee on the Bill. When the Bill has been read a second time, it has become a Bill of the House, and the House - for convenience of procedure - refers it to a Committee of the whole. The Senate affirms, on the second reading, the principles of the Bill, and refers it to a Committee to consider the details, and delegates to that Committee certain powers. That Committee is an inferior, subsidiary body, and has a delegated&#39; authority only. Its resolutions have no effect unless and until adopted by the Senate. Amongst other powers given to the Committee, is that of making amendments. Standing order 194 says - </para>

          <para>On the 16th May last a ruling was given by me in our Legislative Assembly, which has been taken by some honorable members as initiating a new practice, and the correctness of which has been privately questioned by one or two members of the House, whose standing makes their opinion worthy of grave consideration ; I should, therefore, though hesitating to again encroach upon your time, be glad if you would &#39;give your opinion upon the ruling given. </para>
          <para>The Point of Order submitted from the Committee of the Whole was whether it was regular to consider an amendment or new clause which, though fairly covered by the title, was not relevant to the provisions of the Bill itself, as brought - in and read a second time. The  Chairman  of Committees had ruled the new clause out of order, and I, for the reasons which you will see fully stated in the Parliamentary Debates sent herewith, sustained his decision. </para>

          <para>You stated conclusively that the relevancy of an amendment to a Bill must be tested not by the title of the Bill, but by its &#34;subject-matter ; in. deed, it was to establish this principle that the House of Commons passed our standing order No. 34. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>So that it is quite clear that the test, and the only test, which we have to apply, is : Is this amendment, or suggested amendment, relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill?&#39; We have to lay aside all considerations as to the title of the Bill, the scope of the Bill, or of the order of leave, as to whether the amendment is in accordance with the provisions of our Constitution, and as to whether it is a good amendment of a bad one. Those considerations have nothing to do with the question I am asked to decide. The question is simply as to what was the power delegated by the Senate to the Committee. The Committee had power to make amendments. Therefore, the only question is : Is this amendment relevant to the subjectmatter of the Bill, as disclosed by the Bill itself? The Bill is a Bill to impose penalties on anv one who -  applies a false trade mark or a false trade description to goods. </para>
        <para class="block">The punishment may be either by way of  fine,  imprisonment, or by prohibition of the importation of the goods. This is the subjectmatter of &#39;the Bill. The Bill does not provide or contemplate that the owner of any goods shall be obliged to apply any trade mark or trade description, except so far as is necessary to prevent an imitation of trade marks or trade descriptions which have been acquired in Australia. This exception is in no way contradictory to the principles and objects of the Bill. The amendment is intended to prohibit the importation of - all  goods to which a trade description is required by  regulation  to be applied, and to which the prescribed trade  description  is not applied. </para>
        <para class="block">This introduces a principle not contained in the Bill, as read a second time, namely, that the Executive may by regulation prohibit the importation of goods to which no trade mark or trade description has been applied, to make it compulsory on an importer to apply a trade mark or a trade description to goods, if a proclamation has been issued requiring him so to do. It is true that a trade description under the Bill includes a &#34; Customs entry,&#34; and that&#39; therefore a false Customs entry is a false trade description. So that, by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of clause  13,  goods concerning which a false Customs entry has been made may be prohibited from importation. But the proposed amendment goes far beyond this, and seeks to compel the owners of  the  goods to apply to the. goods themselves a trade mark- or a trade description, if required so to do by proclamation. I have come to the conclusion, therefore - I may say with considerable doubt and considerable difficulty - that the amendment is not relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill, and uphold the Acting Chairman&#39;s ruling. 1 may, however, in addition, point out that the Executive, in all probability, already have the power which the proposed  amendment  seeks to give them. By sub-section <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of section  52  of the Customs &#39;Act  1901,  prohibited imports&#39; include &#34; all goods the importation of which may be prohibited by proclamation &#34; ; and section 56 provides that- </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The power of prohibiting importation of goods shall authorize prohibition subject to any- specified condition or restriction, and goods imported contrary to any such condition cr restriction shall be prohibited imports. </para>
