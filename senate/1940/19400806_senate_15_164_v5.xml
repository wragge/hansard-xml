                    <para>. - I knew the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archer</inline> well, although not as a member of this Parliament, because he retired from it many years before I was elected to the Senate. Probably I knew him best as a pioneer in the pastoral and dairying industries of Queensland, and for his wonderful contribution to the municipal life of Central Queensland. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archer</inline> devoted a considerable part of his time to the service of his fellow citizens. For some time he was  chairman  of directors of the Port Curtis Co-operative Dairying Company: he was  chairman  of the Calliope Shire Council for four years, and later was  chairman  for many years of the Fitzroy Shire Council, and also  president  of the Rockhampton Agricultural Society. He was not of my political faith. I wish to pay a sincere tribute to the wonderful and unselfish service which, during his life, he gave to the people of Queensland, and, of course, to Australia. </para>

Although I did not know the deceased gentleman for any considerable time, his work has left its mark on the central district and the central west of Queensland.

Prior to federation he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales from 1889 to 1894. He was elected to the House of Representatives in the first Commonwealth Parliament in 1901, representing the division of Illawarra, and was reelected in 1903, 1906 and 1910. He was a member of the Select Committee on the Bonuses for Manufactures Bill 1902, and of the royal commission appointed in that behalf in 1903; of the Royal Commission on the Customs Tariff, 1904-1907, and of the Royal Commission on Stripper Harvesters in 1909. He attained ministerial rank in June, 1909, as Minister for Home Affairs, and he held that office until April, 1910. He was a member of the parliamentary party which visited England in 1911 at the invitation of the Imperial Government on the occasion of the Coronation of the late King George V. On leaving the sphere of federal parliamentary activities, he again became a member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales in 1915. He was Chief Secretary from 1916 to 1920, and was Acting Premier of New South Wales in 1917, when the Premier visited Great Britain. In 1919, a knighthood of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George was conferred on him. He was Premier of New South Wales from April, 1922, to June, 1925. In 1928, he was appointed Agent-General in London for New South Wales and occupied that position for some years.  His  was a life devoted to public service and to the interests of his fellow men.

                    <para>- I desire to associate myself and the members of the Country Party in the Senate with the motion, more particularly as I had the privilege of serving in. the New South Wales Parliament as a colleague of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Fuller, who was my political chief. One remembers with admiration and affection the straightforward and. high character of the deceased gentleman. I recall those unhappy months in 1917 when a great industrial upheaval occurred in New South Wales and the unpleasant burdens which fell upon his shoulders, and when all sections of the community, I believe, recognized in him a man with a kindly heart who always wanted to be fair. He always sought to do what he conceived to be his duty without the slightest sign of bitterness or unpleasantness towards his fellow men. He enjoyed the confidence, respect and, I believe, the affection of most of the members of all political parties of the parliament of New South Wales. I consider it a privilege to be able to pay tribute to the memory of a man who gave his life in the service of his country. </para>

                        <para>. - I direct attention to the decision of the Senate in respect of my motion for the printing of the petition, signed by 2,340 electors of the Commonwealth, praying this chamber to urge the Government,  to provide for&#39; the issue of interest-free money, through the Commonwealth Bank, for the requirements of Australian defence. Those honorable senators who voted against my motion totally disregarded the finding of the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Systems, and disregarded also the resolutions passed by three State Parliaments asking that the facilities of the Commonwealth Bank be utilized to provide interest-free money for war purposes, as well as for the assistance of our primary producers. During the  la3t  few years hundreds of public meetings have been held in different parts of Australia to discuss this important phase of Commonwealth policy, and resolutions on the lines of the petition presented this afternoon to the Senate, have been forwarded to the Menzies Government. There is widespread dissatisfaction with the present Government for making only limited use of the national credit for defence and other Commonwealth purposes. lt is well known that the Commonwealth Bank has made contributions to a number of war loans. On more than one occasion I have asked whether interest is to be paid on these loans. Once again I emphasize that the money which this Government requires so urgently ian, and should, be obtained in the manner indicated in the petition. It is wrong for the Government to disregard the request of thousands of electors. As every Minister and supporter of the Government opposed my motion &#34; that the petition be printed &#34;, the electors will know the attitude of these gentlemen on this important subject. It has been said on more than one occasion by the Treasurer of Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dwyer</inline> Gray, and others in responsible positions, that it is just as necessary to defeat the present financial system as it is to defeat Germany. If the Government persists in borrowing money under the present policy, it will ultimately encompass the financial ruin of Australia. The Government, by ite action to-day, has ignored the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Systems. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> through his representative in this chamber, refused to tell me how much of the &#163;10,000,000 loan was subscribed by the private banks and how much, was provided by the Commonwealth Bank. I asked a similar question when an appropriation of &#163;12,000,000 was being sought and I received a negative answer. It is unfair to the electors and to the people of Australia generally to continue to disregard the wishes of a large section of our people. Why does the Government continue to borrow money under the present system? I have said previously that the present Government was elected by the banks, and not by the people. I have also said that although 111 members of this Parliament visit Canberra to represent the views of those who sent us here and to frame our legislation, the country is controlled, not by a Government representative of the nation, hut by the associated banks. </para>

                        <para>.- Under a regulation framed under the National Security Act, landlords were not permitted to increase house rents beyond those which were in operation on the 31st August, last year ; hut apparently that regulation lapsed in December last, with the result that throughout Victoria - I suppose the position is the same in the other States - rents are being increased unduly, and occupants of dwellings have no redress. The rents of many houses occupied by soldiers and munition workers have been increased. Some landlords have said that as munition workers are receiving good money, they arc able to pay higher rents. As consumers are protected under the National Security Regulations, a regulation should be re-introduced to protect those who are compelled to rent properties. This matter was brought under my notice in Melbourne on Friday last by a person who subsequently sent to me the following letter : - </para>

                        <para>In reference to the National Security Act in reference to the rent problem I would like to draw to your attention the way the landlords raise the rent. When an apartment house changes hands they will not accept the new tenant unless they agree to pay increased rent. I saw a reputable agent and he told me there was nothing in the act to prevent them doing so when there was a change of tenancy of any house. And I can point out many instances of rents being raised 10s., 5s. and 7s. 6d. a week lately for eight or ten roomed houses and as you know this must be passed on to the room tenants many of whom are soldiers&#39;  wives and munition workers. In one instance the house owned by a government servant told nic; that they increased the rent as munition workers were making big money and could afford to pay more for rooms. Trusting you will have success in your endeavours to get the act amended to end this exploiting of the poorer class. </para>

                        <para>, - I bring to the attention of the Government a remarkable letter written by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hal</inline> Colebatch, who was once a distinguished member of this chamber, on the subject of the profits made by the major oil companies. The letter, which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper, on the loth July, has caused a great deal of comment throughout the country districts of Western Australia, and particularly at Kalgoorlie, where the retail price of petrol is 3s. 3d. a gallon. The letter reads - </para>

                        <para>While the rationing of petrol used for purposes of pleasure might well have been introduced months ago, together with restrictions on other luxury expenditure, the severity of the proposals .now announced is such as to threaten the efficient conduct of many of our industries, particularly some of the already hard pressed activities associated with primary production. The purpose of rationing is to conserve dollar exchange, and it would be heartening to the community to know that the Commonwealth Government has exhausted all other avenues for achieving this end. Several weeks ago your cable messages made brief reference to the action of the Government of British Columbia in cutting down the price that the original supplier - the oil companies - might charge. The companies revolted, there was a strike and a case in the courts, the incident ending with a compromise, but it is reasonable to assume that it took the form of some reduction in initial price: a saving of dollar exchange. </para>
                        <para>More recently, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Stewart was able to announce that he had arranged substantial reductions in the price of petrol supplied to the Commonwealth Government; another saving of dollar exchange. But there vere two features of this reduction that need some explanation. Tn the first place it does not appear that any attempt was made to obtain an equivalent reduction for the Australian consumer generally, and, secondly, it was made clear that to obtain the reduction <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> had to seek the good offices of a company outside the combine: in other words, he had to go behind the back of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited - a company in which the Commonwealth Government has a large holding and over which it exercises some measure of control. </para>
                        <para>With characteristic modesty the oil companies have refrained from any display of the details of their operations, but certain facts are well known, For instance the statements of Lord Bearsted at a meeting of thu Shell Company some few years ago, made it clear that the total cost of producing petrol and landing it in Australia was less than lcl. per gallon. The proceedings of certain royal com missions that have sat in Australia - unhappily with inconclusive results - will bc remembered. The meagre facts revealed in no way disturbed this estimate of landed cost and the findings of the  chairman  indicated that the petrol companies were making very high charges to their Australian organizations with the result that most of the profit resulting from the Australian trade appeared to be made outside Australia and consequently escaped Australian taxation. The British Parliament dealt with this situation as far back as 1915 by levying taxation on the actual profits &#34; as at the source and the then Chancellor of the Exchequer described the practice of loading invoice prices a? &#34; evasion &#34;. </para>
                        <para>It is well known that for years past the price charged by the supplying companies in England has been at least 4d. per gallon less than in Australia; the same companies, the same petrol and quite irrespective of any difference in customs duty. Kerosene, in like conditions, has been 33 per cent, cheaper in England than here, while for lubricating oils there is a still wider disparity in prices - to our serious detriment. All this suggests that the time is more than ripe for some such action as was taken by Great Britain a quarter of a century ago, and some such action as British Columbia ventured upon as a war-time measure. </para>
                        <para>But this is only a part of the tale. The petrol having been landed in Australia at a price that goes a long way to creating additional American millionaires without a reasonable contribution to Australian income tax revenue, we impose additional heavy burdens on the country consumer. I have had occasion - on public business - to travel extensively in the country during recent weeks, and have noticed the prices paid- for petrol by those who have generously afforded me conveyance. With every few miles from the city up goes the price, at a rate altogether disproportionate to the cost of its transport. For instance, at a centre 150 miles from Perth by road, the price is 2s. lOd. - 6d. above the Perth price, although large consumers in that locality, who can afford to equip a truck and take down their own supplies, have assured me that the total cost of such a procedure does not exceed Id. per gallon. Surely something beyond drastic rationing needs to be done about the petrol business. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable senators will be glad to learn that the ability of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hal</inline> Colebatch hits been recognized by his recent election to the Legislative Council of Western Australia. At a recent meeting of the Municipal Council of Kalgoorlie his letter was discussed. In view of the controversy now waging in that city with respect to the price of petrol, the Town  Clerk  has brought the matter under the notice of the representatives of Western Australia in this Parliament, and has asked that their opinion be obtained as to the correctness of some of the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hal</inline> Colebatch. The subject is of vital interest to the whole of the community, but particularly to the users of petrol in -country districts. In a question of which I gave notice to-day, I asked that if the rationing of petrol is to be introduced, every consideration should be extended to country residents who depend upon an adequate supply of petrol for use in the motor trucks in which they cart their produce to the nearest railway station. Any rationing system should protect employment, particularly in the primary industries. Petrol is used extensively in. country districts, not only in lorries employed for wheat and wool carting, but also by co-operative dairy companies in collecting cream for transport to the railway, and for carting superphosphate, seed, &#38;c, over the farm itself. Motor vehicles are the only means by which thousands of settlers can transport their produce from 10 to 25 miles to railway stations, whence they also obtain their stores. Such vehicles are also essential to visit the nearest township. In these circumstances the Government should give every consideration to the claims of country residents. Residents in the cities would not suffer any considerable hardship if supplies for private purposes were reduced considerably, because they can use the railways, trams, ferries and omnibuses ;is a means of transport. It is true that some omnibuses use petrol, but the most modern buses are equipped with diesel engines and consequently do not have to use  petrol. Many persons residing in the suburbs of our capital cities use their motor cars to travel to town although other services are already provided; but no such services are available in country districts. I trust that an assurance will be given by the Government that ample supplies of petrol will bc made available for residents in country districts who have to depend upon petrol-driven, vehicles to transport their produce to a railway. In view of the position which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hal</inline> Colebatch holds in the community, particularly in Western Australia, and his recognized ability as an economist, his letter deserves full consideration by the Government, and I hope that the Government will be good enough to give to me, and to other Western Australian senators who may be interested in the matter, a detailed reply to his observations. </para>
                <para>I, too, am of opinion that the Government should take action to control the price of petrol in Australia. It is true that to-day there are special difficulties, including high freights and insurance charges, but, in years gone by, despite the many inquiries which have been conducted by royal commissions and other bodies, petrol has never been retailed at a. fair price in Australia, even taking into consideration the high Commonwealth duty. In view of the low price at which petrol is sold in the countries of its origin, and even with the high transport and insurance costs involved, the price of petrol should have been much lower in Australia. This is an even more urgent matter to-day, when rationing is imminent, and steps should be taken to eliminate profiteering by petrol companies, not only in Australia, but also at the source of supply. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall see that my colleague, the Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir FrederickStewart),</inline> receives a copy of the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline> I assure the honorable senator that the Government is fully sympathetic to residents of country districts who have special transport needs, and it was not with any degree of pleasure that the Government found it necessary to impose a restriction amounting to one-third of the normal petrol consumption. However, it was absolutely essential that there should be a drastic reduction of the amount of petrol imported in order to conserve dollar exchange for the purchase of other essential war requirements. As honorable senators are no doubt aware, a committee has been set up for the purpose of deciding what is the most satisfactory method of imposing the restrictions necessary to help the Government meet the many difficult problems associated with war finance. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> is aware that a direct representative of the primary industries has been appointed to that committee in order that he may put forward, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> has done this afternoon, the case for the primary producers. 1 quite agree that the man on the land is faced with transport difficulties which are infinitely greater than those encountered by the more fortunate residents of the cities, who, in the main, run their cars for pleasure over areas which are adequately served by trams, buses or railways. It is a much simpler matter to restrict the use of pleasure cars in urban areas than to curtail transport which is essential to the livelihood of country residents. I hope that the committee will succeed in evolving an equitable formula which will result in equality of sacrifice by all sections of the community, and will give special consideration to residents of country areas. </para>
