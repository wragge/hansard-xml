                        <para>. - I do not propose to attempt to make anything approaching a second-reading speech on this measure. I realize how difficult it is to regulate the proceedings of Parliament in order that the last-minute rush at the conclusion of a session or period of a. session may be avoided, but I protest, as I have done on many previous occasions, against these complicated taxation measures being brought before this chamber in this way, which prevents honorable senators from examining them. It maybe said that if members of the Opposition in the House of Representatives did not talk so much the Senate would get these measures earlier; but all we of the Opposition can do in this Parliament is talk; the Government is the only authority with power to act. The practice of rushing legislation through Parliament is improper, but I realize (hat even should we decide to sit next week, we should, in the concluding stages, still have insufficient time to discuss it. Parliament should have assembled a. month earlier, and got on with its job. There is no reason why the income tax proposals should not have been tabled weeks ago. I realize that the Opposition in the House of Representatives took certain action which resulted in improvements being in serted in some bills for which Ave are grateful. I think that I can claim to be no less capable than the least brilliant of honorable senators opposite. I have not had an opportunity to examine the full purport of these measures. I have read again this morning the second-reading speeches delivered by the Minister, but I am not now in a better position to speak intelligently on these proposals than I was yesterday. This measure and those to follow are highly complicated, and I do not think that even the Minister understands them. He is not expected to; he must rely on the advice of experts in the Taxation Department who understand them. As this period of the session will terminate to-day we cannot give these measures the intelligent consideration they deserve. We are being paid to do a job on behalf of the people, but I feel that in the circumstances I am forced to do that job more or less indifferently. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Like my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown,</inline> and others, I believe that income tax is the fairest method to obtain revenue. I do not agree with the contention held by some that income taxation is never popular; it is a direct- tax and we know what we have to pay. As citizens of the Commonwealth, we should be prepared to do our best in the difficult times through which we are now passing, and we should pay our taxes cheerfully, especially when they are levied directly. I do, however, object to indirect taxation, such as the sales tax, because it gives traders an opportunity to impose upon the people, and will cause unemployment. In order to arrive at the income tax rates to be imposed, the Government must first ascertain the amount of revenue required; then the taxation experts are asked to submit what they consider to be the best method by which the revenue can be obtained. The Government should consider, not only the amount to be collected from taxpayers, but also the amount they will have left; that is what really matters if equality of sacrifice is to be achieved. It is not an act of heroism for a wealthy man to sit down and write a cheque for the Taxation Commissioner for a large sum of money. If his income be &#163;6,000 a. year a tax of &#163;3,000 would not affect him. </para>
                    <para>It must be borne in mind that in the imposition of taxes there is a limit beyond which the Government cannot go. Nearly all taxes tend, in the final analysis, to bear most harshly on those members of the community who have the lowest incomes. We should realize that taxes, almost without exception, are passed on. Even members of parliament indirectly pass their taxes on to others. On account of the heavy financial burden to be borne by us, we shall have to practise certain economies by doing without some of the things to which we have become accustomed. The final effect of the economies to be practised by me and other legislators may be that some shop assistant will be dismissed from his employment, or that some factory will go out of business or partially close down. There is no process by which Australia can starve its way to prosperity. </para>
                    <para>The original proposal to reduce <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> income tax exemption figure from &#163;250 to &#163;150 was cruel and drastic. I am delighted that, as the result of collaboration and the display of a spirit of sweet reasonableness, it was possible, through the Advisory War Council, to have the proposal reconsidered. Although the Opposition did not obtain all that it desired, it realizes that what it did secure will be of great value to persons on the lower ranges of income. Members of my party would have preferred the statutory exemption to have been left at &#163;250. The Government would not have been seriously embarrassed had it allowed the exemption to remain as it was, because the consequent shortage of revenue could Iia ve been made up readily by a slight increase of tax on the higher incomes. </para>
                    <para>This budget undoubtedly affects the lower and middle classes more severely than it does persons in receipt of the larger incomes. The taxes being imposed in Australia are not nearly so drastic as those in operation in other parts of the Empire. In Great Britain, for instance, there was no hesitation in taking the whole of the war-time profits. No argument is heard in the British Parliament as to whether a tax of 15s. or 17s. 6d. in the &#163;1 is too drastic. In the event of an increase of profits beyond those obtained on a certain date, the tax is 100 per cent. </para>
                    <para>The Opposition is grateful that the Government saw fit to alter the definition of a single man, so that a man with a dependent mother will now be able to obtain a concession which he could not get previously. I, in common with other members of the Opposition, realize that the demand for a huge war expenditure is imperative, and, in no circumstances, shall we deny the Government any revenue it needs to carry on the war effort. We may criticize the incidence of taxation, or we may claim that certain expenditure is not wise, but, in -view of the urgent problems confronting the Government, we shall help it to raise the requisite revenue. </para>

                        <para>1 10:55&#93;. - I am not in agreement with everything that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has said. I claim that the Government should have acceded to the request made to it to leave the statutory exemption at. &#163;250. The raising of the amount from &#163;150 to &#163;200 was due to representations made by supporters of the Government, who forced the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> to descend from his high horse and make a concession. Under the Government&#39;s proposals, undue hardship will be placed on the members of the community who are on the lower rungs of the social ladder, whilst it will be found that there are sufficient loopholes in the income tax legislation to enable the wealthy .to escape some of the tax. The workers in industry should have been shown greater consideration than they have received. The potential parents, who are <inline font-style="italic">trying to</inline> save sufficient money to enable them to purchase homes, or who have taken up shares in co-operative building societies, should not- be taxed so heavily as they will be under the Government&#39;s proposals. The members of the working class are giving their all in the war effort and will put their last ounce of strength into it. They have done it before, and they will do it again. Many who have obtained jobs as the result of war expenditure are now to be called upon to make a substantial contribution to the revenue of the Commonwealth. A more equitable scheme than has been propounded by the Government should have  been introduced. The Government should have kept the statutory exemption at &#163;250. I am not inclined to imagine that the working classes will be particularly pleased that the Government has been given credit for having generously raised the exemption from &#163;150 to &#163;200. It did not do so; instead, it reduced the statutory exemption from &#163;250 to &#163;150. The people will mot appreciate that action.  The  Government may consider that it has done a good, job, but thousands of taxpayers believe that it lias taxed them to the limit, both directly and indirectly, in order to place them in the position in which it wishes to keep them. </para>

                        <para>. - This bill would not have been necessary had the Government accepted the advice which I have given to it on numerous occasions. I claim to have proved &#39;beyond all doubt that the war could be fought without increasing taxation, or materially adding to the national debt. I &#39;have supplied incontrovertible evidence that that could ,be done. For my pains I have been .both praised and condemned. Some honorable senators w&#62;ho have not been convinced by my arguments have credited me with having at least honesty of purpose. My leader has pointed out that every increase of taxation lowers the standard of living. A friend has written to me saying that this increased taxation will mean that he will be unable to buy a suit this Christmas. The worker whose wages will be commandeered each week will not have enough left to buy a new suit. I have shown that wars &#39;have been run on credit. A royal commission appointed by the Commonwealth Government reported that that could be done in Australia. The great American, Lincoln, defied the bankers and issued his own currency. I have yet to find a Government supporter who is willing to controvert my arguments. </para>

The commission showed what could be done, and left the decision to the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J, McLachlan told us a few days ago about a Chinese, named Wang, who adopted unorthodox methods in his day. But Wang came to a tragic end. Evidently, even in 56 B.C. there were some unorthodox people. Lincoln, who financed a war by defying the bankers, came to an untimely end, and, it is generally believed that the financiers were responsible for his death. I am afraid that some day I shall be found with a hole in my head. I realize that I am up against the conservative mind. I had some hopes that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer,</inline> our newest colleague in this chamber, would have a refilling influence on men who have sat in this cham&#39;ber for many years. I gave to him a pamphlet entitled <inline font-style="italic">Victory without Debt</inline> which, on a previous occasion was referred to as <inline font-style="italic">Victory without Death.</inline> The conservative mind is always upset when new ideas are advanced. I had hoped to return to my home for -Christmas consoled by the thought that I had influenced some members of this Parliament; but I have no evidence that I have converted any one. I assure the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> that if he charges &#163;1 16s. a week to residents of Barton House, he will add to his troubles. </para>

If the Government continues to tax the people&#39;s money, the landlords will have to go short. Recently the Minister for the Interior said : &#34;I do not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> would have done without the Commonwealth Bank? &#34; I replied, &#34;It is a pity that this Government does not realize what can be done with the Commonwealth Bank&#34;. Yesterday, I asked whether the Commonwealth Bank had charged interest on the &#163;750,000 which it had lent to the Government, and I was informed that it had charged interest at 3J per cent. When will the Government learn sense in regard to finance? The Commonwealth Bank belongs to the people, and its profits go to the nation. That being so, why charge interest which goes back to the nation in the form of profits? </para>

                    <para>Why should I borrow &#163;1 on Monday and repay myself 25s. on Friday? That is what the Government is doing. There is no need for it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham</inline> Towers, of the Canadian Central Bank, was once asked whether a government bank could lend money to a government free of interest, and he replied, &#34; Yes &#34;. He added that there would be no need to pay back the capital, because the increased prosperity of the nation would mean that the money would be repaid to the government indirectly. Already this country has paid &#163;3,000,000 in interest on money borrowed since the war started. I have commented from time to time on our huge interest bill, which already is about &#163;1,000,000 a week. The people of Great Britain are called upon to pay &#163;200,000,000 a year as interest on money borrowed during the last war. How can Australia, with a population of about 7,000,000 people, carry this huge burden of interest? Unless a different policy be inaugurated there must be repudiation. Why not save that disgrace by utilizing the national credit? I recently produced a balance-sheet which proved1 that we have to the credit of the nation at least &#163;1,000,000,000 upon -which we could draw to finance the war. That was the first time in the history of Australia that a truly national balance-sheet was presented. The Prime Minister assured us some time ago that he was prepared to use the credit of the nation, but, so far, he has not done so. The reason is that he is here to look after the interests of the private banking institutions. </para>

                            <para>- Why does not the right honorable gentleman use the credit of the nation, as he promised to do? The reason is that he places the interests of the money-lenders before the interests of the taxpayers. We were told recently that &#163;6,000,000 had immediately been subscribed towards the new loan. On other occasions I have shown how that is done, and also how the money is ultimately held in the banking system. Of the amounts subscribed towards the various loans which have been floated, 80 per cent, is held by the banks. I have already told the Senate how the money subscribed by the Australian Mutual Provident Society is provided; the manager of the society merely instructs his banker to apply for bonds. I register my emphatic protest against the inefficiency of a government which is prepared to pay 3f per cent, for money which could be obtained free of interest through the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                        <para>.- I have made it a rule that, if I support a decision, I shall stand by it to the end. A compromise has been effected in regard to the budget, the outstanding weakness of which is that the income tax exemption has been lowered. Like every other honorable senator, I am aware that the taxing of low incomes is a calamitous proceeding; but I realize also that this nation is facing the crisis of its life. I could speak at some length to prove that the  sale3  tax will ultimately come out of the pockets of the workers. I could show that, notwithstanding the allegedly high wages earned by the workers, many of them are only employed intermittently. </para>

                    <para>As a member of the Labour party and an Australian I am prepared to pay my share of the cost of this war. Bills are preferable to bombs. No one has greater realization than I of what the winning or losing of .this war will mean to this country. The cost of this war will rise in proportion to its duration. When the time comes for the budget for 1941-42 to be presented to Parliament whoever is then Treasurer will have had to devise means to raise even more revenue than is contemplated in the budget for this year. The capacity of the workers to pay taxes will be reduced by the taxation measures now before Parliament. The only assistance that I can offer is a suggestion that during the next twelve months the Government and its advisers should study closely the financial policy of the Labour party. Some members of this Parliament ask what the people outside are saying about the increased taxes. The electors had the opportunity in 1934, in 1937, and in 1940 to put into power in this Parliament a party which would give effect to at least a part of the policy which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> expounds so frequently. Reimbursement of the cost of defence by means of taxes is provided for in Labour&#39;s platform. </para>
                    <para>I have not had the time to study the details of the Income Tax Bill, except as it affects me. My feelings were not eased by a realization that I shall still have to pay State taxes. The exigencies of war will force the abolition of State Parliaments, or, at least, the concentration of the taxing power in the hands of the Commonwealth Government. The speech on the Income Tax Assessment Bill delivered yesterday in the House of Representatives by the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> is an important chapter in the history of our income tax legislation and I look forward with keen anticipation to the day when the policy enunciated by him will some into operation. When that day arrives the Commonwealth Government will be able to avoid some of the more unpleasant features of its present taxation proposals. In time of war high taxation is inescapable. Twelve months hence the rates of taxes will be even higher than they are in this financial year. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> has often emphasized, in the last years of peace, Australia&#39;s annual interest commitment amounted to &#163;45,000,000 per annum or &#163;180,000 a day. That commitment will rise to &#163;60,000,000 per annum or more before the war ends. I hope that the Government has in mind a solution of the problem of how such a huge commitment can be met. Our export trade in many commodities is already at a standstill; we cannot ship our fruits and wines, and it is only with tremendous difficulty that we can ship part of our surplus stocks of grain. Methods considered to be unorthodox will be forced on the Government. I do not admit the economy of blowing millions of pounds worth of munitions into the air. I could talk even more loudly than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> about credit, but it would not get me anywhere, because I, like the honorable senator, am a member of a minority party. So long as the people refrain from giving the Labour party control of this Parliament we cannot give effect to our policy. Meanwhile, the job of fighting this war must go on and I refuse to do anything which would hinder the war effort of the Government. The only &#34;fly in the amber&#34; is the reduction of the statutory exemption to &#163;200. Even at this stage I am hopeful that .the Government will relent and restore the exemption to &#163;250. Taxes hit the workers hard, but the man who has &#163;6,000 a year and has to pay &#163;3,000 in tax still lives in luxury. When the loan pool drys tip other means of financing the war will have to be devised. We may discuss that when Parliament reassembles in the new year. </para>

                        <para>. - Some honorable senators opposite do not seem to realize the seriousness of our position. We are locked in a death struggle with an enemy who is as powerful as he is unscrupulous. To beat him, as we must, calls for sacrifices from every body. In spite of the speeches of some honorable senators opposite the wealthy do not escape taxation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> mentioned salaries in the &#163;6,000 a year group. I point out to the honorable senator that the rate of income tax rises to a maximum of 14s. in the &#163;1. If the whole of the incomes of the wealthy were taken we should still have insufficient money with which to conduct this war. Whether it be much or little that is taken from a man by way of taxes, his standard of living may be reduced, but we are fighting to preserve the standards we now enjoy. It is better to sacrifice a little in order to preserve the remainder than to lose all. </para>

                    <para>My views concerning the statutory exemption differ from those honorable senators opposite. I have as much consideration as they have for the men on the lowest rung of the social ladder, but I do claim that men and women without dependants with incomes of &#163;200 a year should not be exempt from federal taxes. They are well able to contribute a few shillings a week directly to the Consolidated. Revenue in order to assist not only in the maintenance of their own incomes and living standards but also in the preservation of their lives. The exemptions in respect of wives and families should be greater. </para>
                    <para>Brief mention has been made of the war-time companies tax. We cannot deal with that tax in this debate, but I am glad that certain amendments have been made. The proposed methods of assessing and collecting that tax are now more in accord with my ideas than were those provided in the bill before the House of Representatives last session. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators opposite have taken credit for the improvements that have been made in the budget, hut those improvements were possible only because the representatives of the various parties on the Advisory War Council were able to reach a compromise. If they can do that as members of the Advisory War Council, the principle should be extended to a national government so that members of the Opposition would leave their mark, not merely on the income tax and the companies tax, but also, with beneficial effect, on all other war-time legislation. The Opposition has a duty to the people of Australia not merely to be represented on an advisory council, but also to get right into the Cabinet forgetting if necessary even their own party in order to do the war job as it should be done. If that had been done the budget could have been improved still further. </para>

                            <para>- Sometimes the electors do foolish things. I believe that the people of New South Wales will regret the decision they made at the ballot-box a few months ago. However, I am not concerned with party alignments. We have a job to do, and we should concentrate on that job to the exclusion of every other consideration. That leads me to emphasize that had the various parties in this Parliament displayed the same spirit of compromise on every issue confronting thom, as was shown in respect of the two or three points on which agreement were reached by the Advisory War Council, we should now be enabled to do a better job. This revenue must be found. It is idle to say that we can fight a war which will involve the expenditure of millions of pounds unless every individual in the community bears at least some portion of the burden. The heaviest portion of that burden, of course, should be placed on the shoulders of those best able to bear it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> would dispense with all of the means by which we intend to raise this revenue. He said that we should extend credit, to what limit neither he nor any other honorable senator knows. When property is destroyed or damaged by war, fire or storm, the damage can be repaired and the loss restored only by sacrifice. In respect of national works of a reproductive character, it is safe to expand credit; but destruction cannot he restored by that method. </para>

I again express pleasure that the budget has been improved as the result of discussions at the Advisory War Council ; and I repeat that had a greater degree of collaboration and compromise been exercised by the various parties in this Parliament, we should now be considering an even better budget. The budget has been improved only by compromise. Although I shall not remain a member of the Senate for very long, I hope that this Parliament will soon unite and show its ability to guide the destinies of Australia. That will be done only so soon as each party is prepared to compromise, not merely by 50 per cent., but by 100 per cent. If that day arrives before I vacate my seat in this chamber, I shall feel that my departure has, perhaps, contributed to a state of affairs under which all of us, including myself, will be better off. </para>

                        <para>. -  I make one plea to the Government. It is obvious, as has been emphasized by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings),</inline> that measures of the kind which we are now considering have become so complex that no individual, however humble or wealthy, is capable of grappling with them. Those difficulties react on everyone, from the man with an income of &#163;200, up to the millionaire. Yet matters of this kind should be handled in the simplest form possible. We have brought about a situation in respect of income taxation which can be met only by the employment of specialists. Superimposed on that difficulty, are the complexities of the taxation systems of the respective States. An effort was made by a previous government to bring about uniformity between Commonwealth and State systems, and some progress was achieved in that  direction. I ask the Government to press on with that good work in order to relieve industry, and the individual, of a great deal of these troubles, and, at the same time, avoid the waste of money and effort which companies and individuals are now obliged to incur in dealing with their taxation returns and assessments. &#34;We are in a maze. We must simplify our income tax systems. Even a system under which the Commonwealth is obliged to dole out specific sums to the States would be an improvement, on the present complex arrangements, because it would at least rid us of many of the  intricacies  that cause so much worry to-day. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>This budget is indeed a bitter burden; but in the near future we may be called upon to shoulder a heavier burden. It is in that spirit that I accept the bill. It was absolutely essential that the Government should raise the statutory exemption from &#163;150 to &#163;200. One realizes the difficulties which a man with dependants has to meet. Whilst much can be said for the contention advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> that bachelors with incomes of &#163;200 should be called upon to pay something, I have no doubt that such men will soon be brought within the scope of taxation, unless we have successes against our chief enemy greater than the victories which we are now winning against his junior partner. The adoption bv the Commonwealth of the method now employed by the States of collecting unemployment tax will mean that the Commonwealth will have the free use, as it were, of much of the taxpayers&#39; money for a considerable period. By that means we should save a considerable amount in interest, and, for that reason, I am sure the collection of income tax by weekly instalments will appeal particularly to my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey.</inline></para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - The Government fully appreciates the difficulties which, as the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> stressed, confront the Senate owing to the circumstances in which bills of this character are placed &#39;before this chamber. The present  practice, however, is unavoidable. Owing to the character of the Senate, I believe that the House of </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Representatives is able to give greater consideration to legislation initiated in the Senate, than we are able to give to legislation which originates in the other branch of the legislature. The Senate, however, is not competent to initiate money bills. Consequently, we commence our sittings whenever such (bills must inevitably be placed before us in (the manner in which we are receiving them to-day. Everyone admits that in these circumstances, it is most difficult for honorable senators to thoroughly examine complex measures. </para>
                    <para>Very little difference of opinion exists among honorable senators as a whole regarding the principles by which the Government should be actuated in the application of taxes. I do not think that many senators will deny that, on the scales of tax now proposed, the people enjoying higher incomes will contribute substantial sums to revenue. All differences arise mainly in respect of degree. Some say that the higher incomes should be taxed more heavily, and the lower ranges exempt, or more lightly taxed than is proposed under this measure. In these matters we ave guided, of course, to a considerable degree by precedent and practice. In a time of war the Commonwealth is called upon to meet financial burdens which do not concern the States. Consequently, the Commonwealth might reasonably be expected to go further than the States with its taxation measures. However, in spite of the criticism that has been hurled at the Government for proposing originally to reduce the statutory exemption level to &#163;150, the exemptions allowed by the various States suffer by comparison with the concessions allowed by the Commonwealth. The Leader of the Opposition and other honorable senators opposite said that they were opposed to taxing lower incomes; but I would remind them that even in Queensland, where a Labour government has been in power for years, and there is not an upper House, the income tax exemption is &#163;150. In Western Australia and Tasmania, where Labour governments are in power, the exemptions for a single man are &#163;100 and &#163;126 respectively. Therefore, it cannot  be  argued that even the proposed statutory exemption of &#163;150 was  not justified. I appreciate very much the support given to this measure by honorable senators, and I trust it will have a speedy passage. </para>

                        <para>In introducing this bill. I warn honorable senators at the outset that a heavy increase of rates of income tax is contemplated. The necessity for an increase, and a large increase, is obvious; we are at war with a ruthless enemy whose avowed objects are the destruction of democracy, and the imposition of a form of government utterly repugnant to a free people. We have undertaken our own defence against that menace, and not the least part of the task is to pay for the war. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The Opposition agrees with that statement. We know what the situation is, and we realize that we shall have to pay the price. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> said yesterday, it is far better that we should pour our last asset into the common fund than we should lose the liberty and freedom which we now enjoy. In the second paragraph of his speech the Minister said, &#34; Sound finance is as important as an adequate supply of armaments &#34;. We agree with that also, but we deny that the Government&#39;s financial policy is sound. In fact, we contend that in various important phases it is most unsound. As has been pointed out frequently in this chamber there are three ways to obtain revenue - taxation, loans andbank credit. The borrowing programme must of course come to an end sooner or later; the Government cannot go on piling up the burden. </para>

                            <para>- I know that. The interesting point is that the Minister and other honorable senators opposite are never prepared to admit that fact when a demand is made by Labour representatives that a definite attempt should be made to end the war against poverty and its terrors. When such a demand is made we are asked &#34; Where is the money to come from?&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that it could be obtained for nothing. I repeat that the Government&#39;s financial methods are most unsound, and unless some change be made, either in the financial policy of the Government, or the Government makes way for some other government with a sound policy, this country, with its 7,000,000 men, women and children, must inevitably face national insolvency. The Government is charged by the people of this country with the responsibility of government, and it must face up to its obligations. </para>

                    <para>The Minister also said that, under the bill now before the Senate, a greatly increased burden would be placed on the wealthy. The Opposition knows that, hut it claims that that is the proper place to place the burden  of taxation. That is where we find the assets which the fighting forces here and abroad have been called upon to defend. The tangible assets of those who have little of this world&#39;s goods are negligible, but I realize that the working classes have the same interest as the wealthy in the intangible asset of liberty which is imperilled by this war. Next year more money will have to be raised to finance the war, and we should realize now that, if the Government continues to dip into the pockets of the people, thesupply will be exhausted, and it will be necessary to adopt the financial policy of the Labour party. </para>
                    <para>The Minister referred to the severity of the State income tax imposed upon the people of Queensland, and even upon those with the lower incomes. In Queensland the State Government is in absolute control. </para>

                            <para>- With the exception of one period of three years, a Labour government has been in office in Queensland for 25 years. The Minister stated that in Queensland the State Government had descended to a very low point in the scale of income in imposing income tax. That is true, but it is also true that the workers in that State receive in return a tangible asset. </para>

                            <para>- No; I am referring to the fact that income tax is collected from those in receipt of low incomes. The Queensland Government has imposed a super-tax on incomes, and there is also a State development tax. Furthermore, a commission investigates the best way to develop the State. No country in the world has so little unemployment as Queensland. Practically every worker is employed at full award rates, and the State is carrying out developmental works that will prove to he permanent assets. </para>

If the Minister means that, because of their numbers, the total amount of the income earned by that class is greater than that of any other section of the community, he is telling the truth. If, however, he means that they have the greatest proportion of the national wealth of this country, his statement is inaccurate, and he is merely indulging in a little sophistry, so that persons on the &#163;400 a year mark and below it may be, to a certain extent, comforted by the fact that he states that they have the great bulk of the nation&#39;s income. That is true, but they also have the least of the things that make a nation really great. </para>

                        <para>The tax is unequal and harsh in its incidence. These features of it are due to its peculiar construction, which, as shown by the figures quoted, permitted escape from the tax of the vast majority of large and old established businesses which have made consistently substantial profits, both in amount and in percentage on capital employed, whilst small and struggling businesses, particularly those which were commenced before or after the outbreak of the recent war. were obliged to pay relatively heavy amounts in tax. Many young businesses, however, find themselves in positions of technical difficult}&#39;, from which there was no relief for them under the law. Some of those businesses had clearly benefited by the war, though it was impossible to ascertain whether their prices had been reasonable or unreasonable. Others of the young businesses had clearly made profits, apart from war conditions, and would probably have made greater profits if the war had not occurred. </para>

                    <para class="block">Members of the Labour party drew attention to these defects when the original bill was before the House of Representatives. We pointed out then that the proposed taxes, which never operated, would not be paid by the big companies. We realized then that this field of taxation had not been explored, and accordingly we are glad that this bill enters that field, thereby making the taxation proposals of the Government more just. I hope that should the need for additional revenue arise, the revenue from this quarter will show an upward trend. </para>

                        <para>. - I had intended to discuss the financial proposals of the Government, but not to attempt to analyse the budget or the incidence of taxation as outlined in the statement presented to the Senate. Necessity is compelling the Governmentto seek greater efficiency in taxation matters. I refer, not to means whereby more money may be extracted from the people, but to attempts to reach a better understanding with the States. The gravity of the international situation has at last forced the Government to make strenuous efforts for the defence of this country. I should like to see the same energy displayed  in  planning for the future production of wealth as is now exhibited in taxing the wealth that has been produced. The Government has consistently held the view that the future production of wealth in this country is a matter for the States; it has attempted to divorce the National Parliament from the real problems of the nation. The only way to meet the situation that confronts us is by marshalling the forces of the nation and developing its resources in the interests of the people generally rather than of a privileged few. The Government should confer with the States with a view to planning for the future production of Australia and the wise utilization of its resources. We hear a great deal about a new order in the world. I should welcome a discussion on that subject. The Senate has always been reluctant to face squarely the problem of the wise development of the resources of the country, and the maintenance of the living standard of its people. Under our present system, finance must be obtained from certain sources. I believe that the advice tendered to the Government by its experts has been sound, and I am pleased that the Government has shown a willingness to explore fresh avenues from which revenue might be obtained. The same zeal and energy should be displayed in planning for the future. Instead of setting State against State, and class against class, we should develop a national outlook. The only way to maintain our living standard is to plan for the greatest good for the greatest number. Indeed, that is the only policy which will bring lasting peace to this war-torn world. </para>

                        <para>. - This clause provides, amongst other things, for the delegation of powers by the Commissioner of Taxation to deputy commissioners. I want to know who they are, because on one occasion the Queensland income tax legislation was amended in a way which had no precedent in any part of the British Empire. The amended legislation enabled&#39; the State Treasurer, or any person whom .he appointed, to require the Commissioner of Taxation to allow such a person to search the income tax records of any taxpayer. I must be assured that there is no such provision as that in this bill. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave - 1</inline> An unusual difficulty seems to have arisen in regard to transport from Canberra to Sydney. Honorable senators who wish to leave for Sydney to-night have been informed that no sleepers are available. We have been told that a few sleepers from Cooma may be available to us at Queanbeyan. As some of us made our bookings a fortnight ago, and the majority as early as last Wednesday, those berths will be rushed. This development means that most of those honorable senators who contemplated returning to Sydney to-night will now be obliged to travel by the train leaving Canberra at 4.15 p.m. In view of the fact that we made our bookings a fortnight ago this development is most unsatisfactory. </para>

            <para class="block">The object of this short bill is to preserve the rights of Commonwealth public servants who may be appointed arbitration inspectors under the Conciliation and Arbitration Inspectors Regulations made under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. No provision exists in that, act for the preservation of the rights of such officers, or for their re-appointment to the Public Service, when they cease to hold their appointments as arbitration inspectors. The Officers&#39; Rights Declaration Act now preserves the existing and accruing rights of certain officers employed under the acts specified in the schedule thereto, and it is proposed , by clause 5 of the bill, to include the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Actin that schedule. As arbitration inspectors are appointed under regulations and not under the act itself, consequential amendments to sections 3 and5 of the principal act are also necessary. At the same time an opportunity has been taken to amend subsection 3 of section 6 of the principal act in order to make it clear that the re-appointment of an unattached officer is to be made by the Public Service Board. </para>

                    <para>The purpose of the bill is to extend the benefits of the Post and Telegraph Rates (Defence Forces) Act 1939-40 to representatives of certain organizations which are engaged in providing welfare services to members of the Commonwealth forces in Australia, or on active service overseas. The present act applies only to members of the forces as defined in the act. It is considered that persons attached to the forces and performing duties for these organizations should be entitled to avail themselves of the cheaper mail and telegraph rates provided for in the act. This bill contains a definition of &#34; representative of an organization &#34;. The organisations are to be such as are authorized by the Minister for Defence Co-ordination bo provide philanthropic, welfare or medical services for members of the forces. For the purposes of the bill it is proposed to authorize organizations such as theRed Cross Society, the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association, the Australian Comforts Fund, and the Salvation Army, to provide the services mentioned. </para>

                    <para class="block">The amendment embodied in this bill is designed to remove an anomaly which has arisen in relation to gold tax deducted from the proceeds of gold recovered by tributers. In the gold-mining industry, it is a common practice for a mine owner or lessee to let portion of the mine to tributers, who in return for certain royalties, are empowered to search for, win and dispose ofany gold ore recovered. Ore recovered by the tributers is ordinarily disposed of to the owner or lessee of the mine under tribute, and is crushed and treated at the mine battery or treatment plant. Gold recovered from the ore treated is delivered by the mine owner or lessee to the Commonwealth Bank, or its agent, and the proceeds of the gold, less certain deductions, are paid to the tributers. As required by sub-section 2 of section 7 of the Gold Tax Collection Act, the Commonwealth Bank or its agent, in making payment to the mine owner or lessee for the gold delivered, deducts the amount of gold tax payable thereon. Under the existing law, however, a mine owner or lessee in Western Australia in accounting to the tributer for the proceeds of the gold has no legal right to reduce the amount payable by the amount of the tax deducted by the bank. This position exists by reason of the operation of a provision in the Mining Act of Western Australia, enacted prior to the imposition of the gold tax, which limits the deductions which the mineowner or lessee is legally authorized to make to deductions to cover - </para>

                    <para>I enclose you copy of a press statement 1 niii.de on the federal budget a couple of days ago. The <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> published a fair portion of it, but, perhaps not unnaturally, suppressed the actual criticisms proffered by myself in connexion with the flimsy nature of the federal financial statement. Certainly, unless federal Treasurers alter their methods, it will be a very long time before the Grants Commission will describe any federal budget as a &#34; standing budget &#34; enabling all to see at a glance the truth in reference to federal finance. This is a tribute the Grants Commission repeatedly paid to my methods in compiling the financial statement of Tasmania. </para>
                    <para>However, this is not the material matter, the important point is that Tasmania (and every other State too) is entitled to know by bow much  their  burdens&#39; will be increased by additional federal taxation in 1040-41.

                    <para>The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dwyer-Gray)</inline> said yesterday that a perusal of the text of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fadden&#39;s</inline> annual financial statement, as Federal Treasurer, as printed in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the 21st November, with its accompanying budget papers, filled him with amazement tha.t the Federal Parliament could be satisfied with such flimsy, insufficient and confusing expositions of the financial ali:airs of the Commonwealth. He was not blaming <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fadden,</inline> who was a very able and most likeable man, and who, in any case only recently assumed the office of Federal Treasurer. In that capacity he had. unfortunately, inherited a very bad federal tradition in these respects. The only budget paper showing &#34;the  estimated revenue of the Commonwealth for 1940-41&#34; given in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> was not only utterly lacking in proper detail, but was headed &#34; .Based on Kates of Taxation as Amended in May, 1940&#34;, which made the table utterly out of date and useless. What was plainly required was a detailed table showing the estimated revenue as affected not only by what was decided in May, 1040, but as affected by the Federal Treasurer&#39;s proposals of the 21st November. Cbe budget table of estimated revenue was &#163;81,100,000 short of its proper total, because the Treasurer&#39;s proposals of the 21st  November  included additional taxation to that amount, which, added to an additional &#163;14,000,000 approved in May, 1940, made a total increased taxation amount of &#163;45,100,000. On the other hand <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fadden</inline> indicated that &#34;the increase in estimated total taxation this year, compared with the actual collections last year, waa &#163;36,314,000&#34;. These figures were, no doubt, reconcilable, but they were both confused and confusing, and it would take experts a considerable amount of research to find out what were the actualities. The Federal Treasury must be perfectly well aware, nol only what amount of taxation was really involved, but should be able to give details as to what amount of extra taxation, under  what headings, would be involved for each State, and he (the Treasurer) trusted that some Tasmanian representatives would immediately ask for full details as far as the; affected Tasmania, especially in regard to income tax. Every State was entitled to know what increased amount the Federal Government intended to take from its taxpayers and through what sources, and all such details must be known at the Federal Treasury, otherwise bulked estimates would not be possible. One of the most important matters, on which the public should be fully informed, was by how much the Federal Treasury would benefit by lowering the exemption for federal income tax from &#163;250 to &#163;150, and figures for each State should be given, as this particular alteration would probably tell much more against Tasmania than other States. To give calculations showing what would be obtained from &#34; incomes under &#163;400 &#34;, which the Federal Treasurer had done, without allowing the public to know how much he would receive by lowering the exemption was, in his opinion, the opposite of candid on the part of Treasury officials responsible for the calculations. It might be said that some of these matters had been contracted in <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard.</inline> If so, he thought they had been very unwisely contracted. As everybody knew, ho <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Dwyer-Gray  ) believed in giving the public all possible financial figures and facts. Another issue he desired to raise, in the interests of Tasmania, related to interstate trade figures, which were all-important to Tasmania. About 81 per cent, of Tasmania&#39;s total trade for 1938-39 was interstate. He had made use of the full figures for 1038-30 at the sessions of the Com mon wealth Grants Commission in Hobart in February last, but when the other day, in order to bring the story up-to-date, he asked for the figures for 1939-40, he was informed that no interstate trade statistics were now available or published on account of the war. He could not see how anything could possibly be more stupid than that. Surely all actual or potential foes could learn sufficient from the 1938-39 figures, and those of previous years, about the sea routes involved in Australia&#39;s interstate trade. Uptodate figures could not inform the enemy of anything they did not already know. It was very necessary to have some reliable indicators as to the effect of war conditions upon Tasmanian trade in time, so that some remedy could be taken, if there was a trend towards untoward developments, before it was too late to check the mischief. </para>

                <para class="block">Tasmania is suffering a great disability at the present juncture. Its direct shipping service from Sydney to Hobart has been suspended for some months. The large overseas steamers which usually call at Hobart are not visiting Tasmania at the present time, and the return fare between Tasmania and the mainland is now twice what it was when a direct service was provided. The Government should do all that it can to provide the State with at least one steamer for the Christmas traffic. </para>

Tasmania was the first State to export apples to Great Britain, and eventually it evolved a system whereby fresh fruit could be landed at Southampton in good condition. Orchardists in the other States have enjoyed the benefits resulting from Tasmanian expenditure and experience.

                <para>There is a monument outside this House, and it is almost completed. For some months I have wondered why it was being erected, and with that thought in my mind I recently fell asleep. . I dreamt that it was a monument erected by the &#34; social creditors &#34; of Australia to mark the occasion when the people were induced to turn from unsound and unsafe finance to the sane, sound and sure financial system which I have advocated in this chamber. &#39; I dreamt that the intention of this committee was to put an enormous figure of myself on the top of the monument. My natural modesty prevented me from agreeing to that proposal, but I suggested that the magical figure &#34;504&#34; should be cut into the enduring stone, so that he who runs may  read. I believe that I shall live to see my dream come true. When I began to speak in this chamber on the subject of finance, I was described as a voice crying in the wilderness. I stated that, so long as there was a financial wilderness in Canberra, my voice would continue to be heard. One of several names that have been applied to me is &#34; Richard Coeur de Lion &#34;. One needs the heart of a lion and the enthusiasm of a crusader to carry on the fight for monetary reform. I feel sure that the financial views that I have expressed in this chamber from time to time will eventually bear fruit. I believe that next year we shall have the sound, sane and sure monetary system which I have advocated, and which will save Australia. </para>

                    <para>It had been impossible, said the Minister, for the Government to make Hotel Kurrajong pay owing to the scale of charges to members of Parliament and other guests not being high enough to meet expenses. It was quite possible, however, that under private management better results might be shown and under private management Barton House would no doubt be made to pay. </para>

                <para class="block">As a member of this Parliament, and as a boarder at the Hotel Kurrajong, I enter a protest against that statement. As to the Minister&#39;s remark that the hotel does not pay, owing to the scale of charges to members of Parliament and other guests not being high enough to meet expenses, I point out that members of Parliament pay &#163;2 10s. a week for full board and residence. In the capital city of Queensland I can obtain board and. lodging, and also soft washing, equal to any accommodation available at the Hotel Kurrajong, for 30s. a week. For 35s. a week I could live at a palatial boarding establishment. </para>

                <para class="block">If no charge had been made to cover a percentage of the overhead costs of the department, the Hotel Kurrajong would never have shown any loss because its receipts have always equalled the expenditure. I do not begrudge the payment of &#163;2 10s. a week to live at the Hotel Kurrajong; it more nearly approximates to a &#34; home from home &#34; than any other place in which I have lived. I am reminded of a man who was seeking accommodation, and when he saw outside one boarding house a notice containing the words, &#34;Just like home&#34;, he said, &#34;Who wants to go there? &#34; The service at the Hotel Kurrajong is excellent, although, perhaps, the Government could exercise more supervision over some of the contractors who supply its requirements. No chef, however, can serve boarders with tender joints if the contractors supply tough meat. I direct the attention of the Minister, whom I compliment on the splendid way he is standing up to his job, to the following extract from page 46 of the financial statement for 1933-34: - </para>

Nothing has since been appropriated towards the maintenance and upkeep of the establishments still under government control and no provision has been made in the Estimates for 1040-41. </para>

                        <para>- Brisbane has 300,000 inhabitants, whereas Canberra&#39;s population does not exceed 12,000. The Minister should not lose sight of the fact that when the government hotels in Canberra were handed over to private enterprise, the new landlords retained the services of the managers. Where did the privately-controlled hostels get the women-folk who look after the Hotel Canberra and the other establishments in this city? It is strange that the same management has made a success of those hostels under private enterprise, whereas; according to the Minister, the hostels did not pay when the same persons controlled them for the Government. It is evident that the people behind the scenes who control the  Government  are not doing their job properly. As an example of the success that can attend governmental control, I direct attention to the trading results of the Postal Department. No one suggests that that department should be placed under private control. Ite administration is so satisfactory that a person can walk into the post office in the humblest bush hamlet and buy a postage stamp and receive other services, notwithstanding that the administration is from Canberra. The Minister knows that private enterprise could not. make such a satisfactory job of the postal business. The records of the insolvency courts are eloquent testimony to the fact that private enterprise is a failure. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot understand why the Government has not taken action to pay compensation to members of the militia and universal trainees who are injured or killed during the course of their training. Some months ago the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mulcahy)</inline> directed the attention of the House of Representatives to the case of a member of the Militia who was killed while in camp. The Government refused to accept responsibility, but offered to his parents an <inline font-style="italic">ex gratia</inline> payment of &#163;50 which, I understand, they have refused to collect. The Minister, in reply, said that the Defence Act did not contain any provision for the payment of compensation in such cases. As honorable senators know, the rights of members of the Australian Imperial Force are safeguarded, as, indeed, they should be. These trainees do not enter camp voluntarily but are compulsorily enlisted, and should the hazardous nature of the work that they are sometimes called upon to perform lead to injury or death, provision for payment of compensation to their dependants should be made. The Minister added that an amendment of the Defence Act would be necessary before payment could be made in such cases. I ask why that act has not already been amended, in order to place these men on the same footing as members of the Australian Imperial Force. </para>

Its report is not yet to hand, but I assure him that when it is presented it will be given careful consideration.

                        <para>. - Improved travelling facilities are needed on the  East-West  railway. The shortage of passenger accommodation is such that people have had to wait for three or four weeks before being able to book berths. The booking was so heavy when I last returned to Western Australia that I was unable to accompany my colleagues, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cunningham</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> on the journey. I should have to book now to return to the west in January. As a matter of fact, I think that berths on all trains on the East- West line are fully booked until the end of January. </para>

                        <para>. -  Could provision be made from the proposed vote for the Department of the Army to improve arrangements for dental treatment of soldiers. I have heard of cases of soldiers having to wait, months for dentures after having had their teeth extracted, and meanwhile being compelled to live on army &#34; hard tack &#34;. It seems wrong that such conditions should exist, especially at military camps near large towns where dentists are. available. </para>

                    <para>The expenditure on civil aviation works is occasioned, largely by defence requirements. In addition to the amount of &#163;.1,176,000, which is to be appropriated from revenue for postal works, a further amount of &#163;2,000.000 will be provided from loan fund. The latter amount was the subject of a loan bill. The total .expenditure on postal works in 1939-40 was &#163;3,178,000. The amount, required for territories of the Commonwealth shows an increase of &#163;240^000 over last year&#39;s expenditure. This increase is attributable to large developmental programmes necessitated by the increasing populations of both the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. In Canberra substantial expenditure is necessary in the provision of cottages and the necessary engineering services. An amount of &#163;75,000 has been included towards the cost of the Canberra hospital. At Darwin also considerable expenditure is required in the provision of a hospital, and electricity and water supplies to meet theneeds of the rapidly-expanding population. </para>
                    <para>The appropriation of &#163;3,421,000 does not include works constructed out of the Federal Aid Roads grant to the States, which this year is estimated to amount to &#163;3,100,000. It also excludes works for defence and war services, which are being charged to loan fund, and works made possible by the Commonwealth grant of &#163;100,000 a year in aid of interest and sinking fund on public works carried out by local authorities. Although certain works in progress at the 30th June last have been carried on by credits from Treasurer&#39;s Advance, this bill authorizes the commencement of a number of new works which it is highly desirable should be put in hand at the earliest possible moment. I trust, therefore, that honorable senators will facilitate the speedy passage of the bill. Any details required regarding specific works can be supplied during the committee stage. </para>

On one occasion, the cable between Tasmania and the mainland was cut by the reef which it crosses, and it is likely to break again because it still crosses that reef. Until the station at King Island is ready for use, and the cable can be diverted to another course which will obviate crossing the reef, whenever a breakage occurs the cable will have to be joined. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill proposes to amend the Australian Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Act in respect of service pensions. The maximum rates of pension for members of the forces and their wives will be increased by an amount equal to the proposed increase of invalid and old-age pensions. </para>
                    <para>Service pensions, which were instituted in January, 1936, are really a scheme of invalid or old-age pensions for members of the forces, on a more liberal basis than that of the invalid and old-age pension scheme for the general community. It is more liberal to a member right from the initial stage when he lodges his application, and is informed as to the grounds on which a pension may be granted. Such a pension may be granted on account of age, being permanently unemployable, or suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. </para>
                    <para>On the ground of age, a service pension maybe awarded five years earlier than is possible with the ordinary old-age pension ; male ex-members of the forces can be admitted at 60 years of age, and an Australian Imperial Force ex-nurse, at 55 years of age. </para>
                    <para>If admitted on either of the two other grounds, not only is he eligible for a pension, but his wife, and children up to four in number, may also be granted pensions, merely on relationship. No such provision exists in respect of pension under the Invalid and Old-age Pension Act. The maximum grant under that act to an invalid would be 20s. a week; under the service pension scheme it would be, in the case instanced, 44s. a week, being 17s. to the member, 17s. to the wife, and 10s. for the children. </para>
                    <para>As will be seen from the clauses of the bill, the rates of pension for members and wives have been increased by 2s. a fortnight, except where the pensioner, being in a public institution, is paid the rate prescribed under Section 45ao for such a pensioner. At present that rate is 14s. a fortnight, the difference between that amount and the ordinary rate being paid to the institution towards the maintenance of the pensioner. It is intended that, of the increase of 2s. a fortnight,1s. shall go to the pensioner, and1s. shall be made to the institution. </para>
                    <para>With this increase of the service pension the maximum rate for a wife is now the same as the war pension for the wife of a soldier who is totally incapacitated as the result of war service. </para>

It will be  recalled  that as a result of collaboration between members of the Advisory  War  Council certain improvements in the Government&#39;s budget proposals were agreed to, one of which was an increase of ls. in invalid and old-age pensions. As a. result of the granting of that increase it was decided that a similar increase should be made in the service pension. That is the whole intention of the bill. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of the bill is twofold - first,  to  increase the maximum rate of invalid and old-age pensions from &#163;1 to &#163;1 ls.  a  week, and secondly, to make provision for the maximum rate of pension to be varied automatically in accordance with variation of the cost of living. </para>
                    <para>The new maximum of &#163;54 12s. per annum, or &#163;1 ls. a week, will be the highest amount to be received by pensioners since the introduction of Commonwealth old-age pensions in 1909. The variations in the pensions rate since that time have been as follows: - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="165332194012134_24_5.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para>There are at present approximately 333,000 invalid and old-age pensioners, and they will all receive the benefit of the increase of ls. a week provided for in. the bill. The additional cost will be &#163;900,000 per annum, which will bring the total cost of invalid and old-age pensions up to &#163;18,000,000 per annum. The additional expenditure for the remainder of this financial year will be &#163;470,000. </para>
                    <para>The bill preserves the existing margins  of  permissible income, namely, &#163;32 10s. per annum, - or 12s. 6d. a week, in the case of pensioners other than .permanently blind persons, and &#163;175 10s. per annum, or &#163;3 7s. 6d. per week, in the case of blind pensioners. Consequently, the limit of income, plus pension, will now become &#163;S7 2s. per annum, or &#163;1 13s. 6d. a week, in the case of pensioners other  than, permanently blind persons, and &#163;230 2s. per annum, or &#163;4 8s. 6d. a week, in the ease of blind pensioners. </para>
                    <para>The second purpose of the bill - the linking of the pension to changes in the cost of living - is not entirely new. This principle was first introduced in October, 1933, in the Financial Relief Act. Provision was then made for the pension rate to rise or fall, within the limits of 17s. 6d. to &#163;1 a week, by 6d. for every variation of 100 units in the retail price index number for food and groceries for the six capital cities of the States, as ascertained by the Commonwealth Statistician for the twelve months ending on the 31st March in each year. The basis of these variations is shown in the following table :- </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="165332194012134_25_6.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">Under this table, there was a rise of 6d. in the pension in July, 1935, i.e., from 17s. 6d. to 18s. a week. </para>
                    <para>In September, 1936, under the Financial Relief Act No. 2, a new table of price index numbers was substituted for the previous table. The same index was retained, but the numbers were regrouped and. related to higher rates of pension, within the limits of  18s  - instead of 17s. 6d. - and &#163;1 a week. The new table was as follows: - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="165332194012134_25_7.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">The immediate result of the new table was an increase of the pension rate from 18s. to 19s. a week, which became operative from the 24th September, 1936. </para>
                    <para>In September, 1937, the Pensions Act was again amended to give a further increase of the pension from 19s. to &#163;1 a. week, and the provisions relating to cost of living variations were repealed. The pension has since remained at &#163;1 a week. </para>
                    <para>As already stated, the food and groceries index was previously used as the basis for measuring variations of the cost of living for the purpose of variations of the pension rate. On this occasion, however, it has been decided to adopt the all items index of household expenditure, &#34; C &#34; series, as the basis for variations of pension. This series takes account, not only of food and groceries, but also of rent, clothing and miscellaneous items of household expenditure. It is also used by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in determining the basic wage. </para>
                    <para>It will be observed that under the bill the new maximum rate of &#163;1 ls. a week will continue while the price index number does not exceed 9S1. The latest available figure is 959. The bill also makes provision for the pension of &#163;1 ls. to rise by 6d. a week for every 23 units, or portion thereof, by which the price index number exceeds 981. Thus, a rise in the price index number to 9S2 will result in a further increase of 6d. a week in the pension. The bill provides that the maximum rate of pension shall not fall below &#163;54 12s. per annum, or &#163;1 ls. a week. </para>
                    <para>Groups of 23 units have been decided upon with a view to securing variations of the rate of pension proportionate to the variation of the cost of living. In this connexion, it should be noted that the cost of living provisions which operated from 1933 to 1937 required variations of 100 units in the price index number for food and groceries to secure a variation of 6d. in the weekly pension. The effect was that variations of the pension were not by any means proportionate to the variations of the cost, of living. The equivalent of 100 units in the food and groceries index is about 60 units in the all items index. The fact that it has been decided to adopt groups of only 23 units for every variation of 6d. in the pension indicates that the provisions regarding the cost of living variations contained in this bill are much more liberal than those previously in operation. </para>
                    <para>It is also worthy of note that, in October, 1925, when the all items price index number was 1001, the maximum pension was only &#163;1 a week, whereas under this bill, should the price index number rise to 1001, the rate of pension would be &#163;1 ls. 6d. a week. Should it rise to 1005, the pension would become <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 2s. a week. Furthermore, comparing the purchasing power of the new maximum rate of pension with the maximum rate existing in October, 1925, a pensioner will now be able to buy (with his pension of &#163;1 ls. goods which would have cost &#163;1 ls. lid. in October, 1925, when his pension was only &#163;1 a week. This comparison is based on the comparative price index numbers, all items series, namely, 1001 and 959. </para>
                    <para>A special feature of the bill 13 that provision is made for a determination of the maximum rate of pension to be made in each quarter, according to the price index number for the quarter immediately preceding such determination. If sufficient variation has occurred iu the price index number, the new maximum rate of pension will become operative from the first instalment payable in the next succeeding quarter. Thus, the variations of the rate of pension will, so fac as practicable, keep pace with the variations of the cost of living. The previous legislation of this nature, which was in force from 1933 to 1937, provided only for annual determination of the pension rate based on the index number for the twelve months ending on the 31st March in each year. The effect was that the variations of pension lagged behind the variations of the cost of living. The present bill is thus a definite improvement on the former legislation in that respect. </para>
                    <para>The retention of the existing margins of permissible income in connexion with the present increase from &#163;1 to &#163;1 ls. a week has already been referred to. These margins, namely, l&#39;2s. 6d. a week in the case of pensioners other than permanently bind persons, and &#163;3 7s. 6d. a week in the case of blind persons, will also be preserved with every variation of the pension on the changes in price index numbers. </para>
                    <para>Provision i3 made in the bill for pensioner inmates of benevolent asylums and hospitals to receive an increase of 6d. a week in the amount of 6s. a week which they at present receive as institutional pension. Possibly it will be contended that the full increase of ls. a week, which pensioners outside institutions are now to receive, should also be paid to those who are in institutions. It will be recognized, however, that the payments made to pensioners in institutions are scarcely in the same category as the pension payments made to persons outside, who have to provide from the pension money the full cost of their maintenance. In the case of inmates of institutions, the cost of maintenance is borne almost entirely by the institution, and the pension payment made to the inmate is practically in the nature of pocket money, which enables him to purchase tobacco and other comforts which may not always be provided by the institution. </para>
                    <para>In this connexion, it will be of interest to mention the changes in the amounts paid to inmates of institutions since these payments were commenced in 1916. They are as follows : - </para>
                    <para>It will be noted that, in 1920, the institutional pension of 2s. a week represented only 13 per cent, of the full pension, which was then 15s. a week, whereas the present institutional pension of 6s. a week represents 30 per cent, of the full pension of 20s. a week. The new rate of 6s. 6d. a week represents 31 per cent, of the new maximum pension rate of 21s. a week. </para>
                    <para>Furthermore, pensioner inmates of hospitals are given a special privilege in that the pension for the first 28 days of the period in hospital is preserved intact for the pensioner, and paid to him in full on  his discharge. For this period the hospital receives nothing from the Commonwealth. After 28 days, the hospital is paid 14s. a week, i.e., the balance of the pension over the amount of 6s. a week paid to the pensioner. Similar payments are made to benevolent asylums in respect of pensioners admitted, but in these cases the payments of 6s. a week to the pensioner and 14s. a week to the institution, commence from the first pension pay-day after the date of admission. </para>
                    <para>After careful consideration of all aspects of this matter, the Government has decided that pensioner inmates of institutions will be very fairly treated if given up to half the amount of any increase paid to pensioners outside. The bill, therefore, provides for the pensioner inmates of institutions to receive half the present increase of ls. a week and, within the discretion of the Minister, up to half of any further general increase which may result from a rise in the price index number. This discretionary power operates conversely, so that, in the event of a decrease of the ordinary pension following a. fall of the price index number, the Minister may, in his discretion, decide that the pensioner inmate shall not be required to bear any portion of the decrease. </para>
                    <para>The amendments effected by the bill are to apply to the fortnightly instalment of pensions due on the 26th December, but pensioners will actually receive the increased &#39;payments on the 19th December, owing to the special arrangements for payment a week earlier on account of the Christmas holidays. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable senators on both sides of the chamber will agree, I think, that this bill is more welcome than most of those with which wc have had to deal in the last few days. I notice with some pride that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll),</inline> in the second-reading speech which he has just concluded, was able to say that the pension to be paid to invalid and old-age pensioners will now be higher than at any other time since its inception. We are all glad of that. So far as the Opposition is concerned - and I believe I may also say it of honorable senators opposite - there is a tinge of regret that it was not possible to make the pension somewhat higher. However, I trust that it will be recorded to the credit of the three parties which took part in the negotiations, that the rate of pension has been increased. Honorable senators will agree that it would have been very gratifying to us all if, before we adjourned for the Christmas recess, we could have sent forth the glad tidings to the pensioners that the increase was a little more than ls. a week. However, that cannot be done; we must accept the position as it is and be glad that wc are now able to say that the pension will be higher than ever before. I am delighted that provision has been made in the bill that as the cost of living rises the pension will rise proportionately by 6d. a week in accordance with the formula explained by the Minister. It is gratifying to know that we have also been able to safeguard the interests of the pensioners to the extent that the amount of their pension will not, in any circumstances, fall below 21s. a week. I support the bill. </para>

                        <para>.- The one sad feature about the budget is that we have not been able to induce the Government to increase by more than ls. a week the pension paid to invalid and aged persons. The platform of the Labour party is clear on the point that their pension should not be less than &#163;1 a week. That amount represents about one-third of what many spend each week in pocket money. Out of their meagre pittance the pensioners have to provide for rent, food, and clothing, and all the medical attention which their increasing years render necessary. When we hear the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> say that the granting of this concession will cost the Government &#163;900,000 pei1 annum, we are reminded that other and better organized sections of the community are able to squeeze both parties and collect millions of pounds from the government in assistance of various kinds. By these means wheatgrowers have received no less than &#163;14,000,000 during the last five years. Only a few days ago the apple and pear acquisition scheme was dropped after incurring a loss of &#163;750,000. Although we have to honour the agreement arrived at between our representatives and the representatives of the Government who dealt with the rate of pension to be paid, I trust that at the very earliest opportunity the position of invalid and old-age pensioners will be reviewed. Some people say that they have no sympathy with the old-age pensioners be cause in their earlier years they were not thrifty and made no provision for their old age. Everyone knows that the wages paid in Australia are sufficient only to provide food and clothing and a place in which to sleep. I hold no brief for any particular section of the community, but the party to which I belong cannot ignore the just demands of the 330,000 pensioners, who, with their relatives, represent a voting strength of 1,000,000. Although I loyally support the compromise agreement arrived at in this matter, in future I shall do my utmost to see that the invalid and old-age pensioners are treated more fairly. I conclude by saying that although the pension rate is to be only &#163;1 ls., it will be higher than the rate paid in any country in the world with the exception of New Zealand, where a man and his wife may each receive a pension of &#163;1 10s. a week even though they own their own home. Such liberality is made possible by the fact that all sections of the community in New Zealand pay a flat tax out of which the cost of social services is met. I visualize the day when this Government, if it remains in power, or the Labour party, if it holds the reins of government, will treat with greater liberality those who have borne the heat and burden of the day and who, through no fault of his own, are compelled to apply for a pension. </para>

                        <para>. - I welcome the bill. My only regret is that the pension is not to be increased to &#163;1 5s. a week. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber are obliged to support the bill because it provides an increase, even though it is only ls. a week. We have been able to provide huge amounts for the assistance of other sections of the community. Last year, this Parliament voted approximately &#163;11,000,000 for the relief of wheatgrowers which may never be repaid, and &#163;750,000 has been expended in connexion with an apple and pear acquisition scheme which benefited fruit-growers in all States. If we can afford to make such handsome provision for other sections of the community, we should also be able to increase the pension for aged and invalid people to &#163;.1 5s. a week. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree that the Government has improved the position of the invalid and old-age pensioners by the introduction of this bill. Is it an improvement to which they are entitled? The majority of these old-age pensioners helped substantially to create the great wealth of this country, but all that they receive in return, in the shape of pension, provides merely for subsistence. Paradoxical though it may seem, the harder they worked and the more wealth they created - particularly after the introduction of machinery in industry and improved methods of manufacture - the less they received proportionately. In the days of the craftsman the time required for the making of a table, for instance, would be ample to-day for the manufacture, by modern methods, of at least two tables. After they are worn out, having given of their best in the service of commerce and industry, we pay to them the bare cost of the necessaries of life. In the autumn of their lives they probably require more medical services and other necessities than they did in the days when their health and strength was not impaired. The rate of pension should be computed with the basic wage as a minimum; instead it is measured by the lowest amount necessary to sustain life, and the pensioners are expected to be thankful. Some people, who patronize the old-age pensioners, say that we are giving to them something which we are really not entitled to give. The actual truth is that we are giving to them only a negligible quantity of the wealth that they helped to produce. When we point with pride to the progress that has been made in this country, to our palatial buildings, and to our modern public utilities, we should not forget that the old age pensioners helped to pioneer these achievements. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I can remember when workers were paid no more than that wage. Whatever is given to the pensioners is given grudgingly instead of in a spirit of generosity and appreciation for their labours on behalf of the nation. Men who occupy high positions of political authority base their beliefs on the assumptions and categories which make it impossible for them to understand the outlook of honorable members on this side of the chamber in connexion with pensions. Therefore, I regard it as my duty to point out, whenever possible, that the old-age pensioners have a very much stronger claim to recognition than the Government accords to them. A case I have in mind relates to a Scotsman, 72 years of age, who worked on the wharfs in Melbourne for 35 years, during which time he, and thousands of his fellow workmen, helped to build up enormous fortunes for the shipping companies. Recently he found that it was impossible for him to stand up to the rigours of his work and was obliged reluctantly to apply for a pension. That was due to the fact that, during his long period of service to the shipping companies, his wages had not been sufficient for him to put aside savings which would have made him independent of outside help in his old age. Surely it is not too much to ask of the Government, and others in responsible positions, that they take a more generous view of the position of old-age pensioners. Instead of assessing the rate of pension at the lowest possible amount, they should try to assess it on the basis of the maximum amount which the country can pay. These old people are the human elements behind the wealth with which we are surrounded to-day. This building, the palatial offices in our capital cities, and our shipping and railway services are examples of their achievements. The bill provides for an improvement of the circumstances of invalid and old-age pensioners, but certainly not the improvement to which they are entitled. </para>

                        <para>. - This bill is a step in the right direction, but I would have been very much more pleased than I am had the increase proposed been a little greater. A rate of 22s. 6d. a week would have been reasonable; that would have provided a man and wife in receipt of pensions with a joint income of &#163;2 5s.a week. Taking into consideration the cost of the necessaries of life to-day. the increase of1s. is not very helpful. I know from experience that public subscriptions are often raised in order to assist pensioners whose incomes cannot provide them with the services which they need. Nevertheless, this measure is something of which we should be proud. It is a gift; it is not paid in response to a demand as are the taxes which have been agreed to by Parliament within the last few weeks. I hope that the Government will endeavour to increase the rate of the old-age pension to 22s. 6d. a week or more. </para>

All honorable senators  realize  that this year has been a difficult period for the various staffs associated  with the work of Parliament. The mailmatter of members has very largely increased, and, no doubt, the officials have had to cope with a far greater volume of work than ever before. Each of the parliamentary staffs has been of the greatest assistance to honorable senators during the year. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, as usual, has discharged its duties in a most efficient way. </para>

                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline>
                            on the manner in which you have discharged your duties. We have all received generous treatment from you, and we thank you. We are also highly appreciative of the work of the officers of the Senate and of the

                            staff. This year has been one of the most momentous in the history of Australia, and certainly in the history of the Labour Movement. During the nation&#39;s greatest crisis we have witnessed a change in the policy of the Labour party. It has entered into an arrangement with the Government, which is formed of parties to which it is politically opposed, and it has closed its own ranks in the interests of the nation. I trust that we shall all experience a happy Christinas, and that, when we return to our duties next year the international outlook will have improved considerably.
