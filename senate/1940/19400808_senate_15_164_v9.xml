                        <para>I understand that there are only two tanneries in Tasmania engaged in the tanning of hides. Prior to the commencement of the hide and leather marketing scheme, inquiries concerning hide dealings in Tasmania allowed that Hobart tanning interests obtained most of their hide supplies from Melbourne and Sydney, and that there was no direct overseas export of Tasmanian hides, which were forwardedeither to Melbourne or Sydney. For those reasons no arrangements were made for the appraisement of hides in Tasmania. Some months ago, when there was a general shortage of hides in Australia by reason of tanners' increased requirements, the Australian Hide and Leather Industries Board mode arrangements for Tasmanian tanners to purchase their hide requirements direct from local suppliers, which is not permitted in other States, at prices in accordance with the table of limits for Victorian hide auction sales classifications and prices, less the estimated cost of freight that would be payable to transport the hides fromTasmania to the mainland. That is, in effect, their ordinary value. It does not appear that the establishment of a hide appraisement centre in Tasmania is necessary. </para>

Owing to the change of organization in the present force from that of the original Australian Imperial Force, some differences are unavoidable, as the actual number of battalions in a division has been reduced. The unite mentioned by the honorable senator were initially part of the First Division, but were subsequently transferred to form part of the Fourth Division of the original Australian Imperial Force.

                            <para>Arrangements were made in June for the New Zealand Government to export approximately 5,000 tons of potatoes to Australia - 1,000 tons per month for the months of July, August and September, and 2,000 tons at a later date - to meet a shortage in the Australian supply. Latest advices indicate that under normal conditions the Australian market will absorb the total Tasmanian production and the New Zealand shipments. In the meantime to conserve the Australian stocks, deliveries from Tasmania are being regulated. By this means it is hoped that a shortage with its accompaniment of high prices will be averted later. Under the arrangements made for controlling supplies, excess stocks on the wharves in Tasmania are not being allowed to accumulate, and no deterioration has taken place in Tasmanian potatoes on account of New Zealand shipments, lt was necessary to introduce these shipments gradually over a period, because there was no guarantee that shipping space would be available for concentrated shipments in a short period when the Tasmanian supplies were approaching exhaustion. In. controlling shipments the Government is maintaining a constant check upon supplies available not only in Tasmania but nieo in the other States, and every effort is being made to regulate weekly deliveries in accordance with the supplies available and with the desire of the Government to maintain a price that is equitable to both producers and consumers. </para>

                            <para> During December,  1939, the Government gave consideration to the action that would be necessary to increase the output of the Glen Davis shale oil project by a further 20,000,000 gallons of petrol per annum, but it was found that it would be preferable to defer consideration of the matter until more reliable information could be obtained following upon the more advanced development of the project towards the original anticipation of output of 10,000,000 gallons of petrol per annum. Since that date the Government has decided to protect all shale and coal spirit to the extent of 7.4d. per gallon over imported petroleum spirit and 5.5d. per gallon over petrol refined in Australia from imported crude oil for a period of fifteen years on the understanding that there will be no limit as to the quantity which can be produced; but production must be undertaken within the next two years. These were the full rates of duty which applied to these imported products prior to the outbreak of war. It is expected that, as a result of this protection, production will be expanded at Glen Davis and will be undertaken in other localities. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have moved for the disallowance of the regulations in Statutory Rules, No. 128, issued under the National Security Act passed on the 21st June, 1940, because these regulations, which are the first instalment of industrial conscription, supersede Statutory Rules, No. 91, issued on the 24th May, 1940. Clause 2 of regulation 59a reads -  (2.) The training and employment of any person in accordance with any such arrangement shall be lawful notwithstanding anything contained in any enactment other than the National Security Act 1939, or in any instrument (including any award, determination or agreement) having effect by virtue of any such enactment, but nothing in this regulation shall authorize the imposition of any form of industrial conscription. </para>
                    <para class="block">Clauses 1, 2 and 3 of Statutory Rules, No. 91, are identical with clauses 1, 2 and 3 of Statutory Rules, No. 128, with the exception that the vital words " nothing in this regulation shall authorize the imposition of any form of industrial conscription" are omitted from clause (2) of thelatter. The omission of these words, which are so vital to the workers of Australia, have compelled me to move for the disallowance of the regulations. The Minister cannot deny that those words have been omitted, and that the amended regulation means the removal of the safeguard which existed to prevent industrial conscription. The regulations issued on the 24th May, 1940, prohibited any form of industrial conscription ; but on the 21st June the Government amended the legislation to permit the marshalling of men, women and children and to subject them to certain forms of industrial compulsion. The Defence Act provides that only persons between the ages of 18 and 60 years can be called up for military service in the Commonwealth; tout under these regulations there is no age limit, and it is possible to apply industrial conscription to boys and girls of fourteen years of age and under. These regulations give the Government the right to take children from the control of their parents and to place them in industry, and in that way prevent their parents from directing their education. They can also be deprived of the right of determining the employment in which they shall be engaged. That can. be done unless their parents can give good reasons why their services are required elsewhere, or they are able to secure a permit to leave their present place of employment. Under the regulations no employer could accept  them for service unless they produced from their previous employer a certificate that they had completed their term of employment or that their employer was prepared to allow them to leave. This is the first step to secure deliberate control over the people of Australia. In effect, clause 1 of regulation 59a provides that if it appears to the Minister that the efficient prosecution of the war is likely to be prejudiced by reason of a shortage of persons skilled in any particular trade, he may introduce other persons into the industry. This, of course, will lead to the dilution of labour, which will be done on the recommendation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Essington</inline> Lewis or of a State Munitions Board. Naturally the Minister would agree to any request made by those authorities. Therefore employers would be subject to the direction of authorities other than this Parliament. Who are the members of these boards which have such power? Let us examine the political credentials of the sponsors of the so-called Labour representatives. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Phillip</inline> Goldfinch, who is the  chairman  of the New South "Wales Munitions Board, is manager of the sweetest of all monopolies, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, and a former United Australia party member in the New South Wales Parliament. There is also <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> J. Hartigan, Railways Commissioner for New South Wales, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> Kneeshaw, general manager of the Australian Portland Cement Company. He was, and may still be, a member of the United Australia party consultative council. As a New South Wales senator I am not well acquainted with the . personnel of the Munitions Boards of Victoria and Western Australia. In Victoria the  chairman  of the State Munitions Board is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Stewart, consulting engineer and director of various industries, including subsidiary companies of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. He is not likely to be a Labour sympathizer, and does not appear to me to be a suitable selector of labour representatives. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> has the valuable support of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norman</inline> Harris,  chairman  of the Victorian Board of Railways Commissioners, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>
                    <para class="block">Charles Ruwolt, a leading engineering industrialist. In Western Australia the  chairman  of the board is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> 0. Law, the  president  of the Cham'ber of Manufactures. The other members of that board are <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ellis,</inline> the Railways Commissioner ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brisbane,</inline> a leading manufacturer; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tomlinson,</inline> a leading industrialist, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> Mills, the chief mechanical engineer of the Western Australian Railways. In view of the power given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Essington</inline> Lewis he is virtually Parliament, Cabinet and Prime Minister combined. The workers will not forget that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited is the greatest iron and steel monopoly in the world, and has for years been an industrial octopus and the arch-enemy of the workers. The so-called labour members appointed to the Munitions Board include <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cranwell,</inline> of New South Wales, who was not appointed by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions or the Trades and Labour Council, and was not recommended by any union. He was appointed 'by those who control the Munitions Board in New South Wales. In Victoria the labour representative is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleary. His</inline> appointment was not recommended by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions or by the trade unions. In Western Australia <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trainor,</inline> who is the labour representative, was recommended, not by labour organizations, but by persons who support this Government. The Prime Minister admitted in the House of Representatives yesterday that the labour representatives were selected and appointed by the Munitions Boards. The trade-union movement did not recommend these people for the jobs, and, as a consequence, trade unionists will not have any more faith in them than they have in other members of the Munitions Board. Apparently, on the recommendation of such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Essington</inline> Lewis the Government has already agreed to the dilution of labour in some defence industries. Under regulation No. 2 the Government is empowered to break all arbitration awards whether they have been made by agreement between the parties or by decisions of the arbitration courts. Clause 3 of this regulation permits the dilution of skilled labour by unskilled or juvenile labour. This is a most extraordinary procedure. In Australia there is ample scope for the absorption of unemployed in key industries, without resorting to the use of juvenile or female labour. There is a danger that this action will give rise in Australia to the same state of affairs which existed in Great Britain during the last war, when women and children were given jobs in munitions factories. On that occasion the trade unions were promised that the measure was only a temporary one, and that normal conditions would be reverted to upon the cessation of hostilities. That promise was not honoured and' now, although 25 years have elapsed, the men have not gone back into the factories. Instead they are on the unemployed scrap-heap. Women are doing their jobs. The same thing will happen in this country if these regulations are not disallowed. Under this provision for the dilution of labour unscrupulous employers will be able to employ skilled men at labourers' wages. </para>

                            <para>- They sought better jobs and better pay. Surely that is the prerogative of every man and woman in Australia. These regulations prevent advancement and destroy initiative. Regulation No. 4 prevents an employer from offering an employee wages in excess of those provided in the second schedule. That is a denial of the first principle of arbitration, which merely fixes the minimum in awards. It compulsorily makes the minimum the maximum, and leaves no margins for tie recognition of skill and efficiency. Clause 2 of regulation No. 4 does not reduce the higher marginal rate payable to persons engaged before the introduction of the regulation, and as a consequence, an undesirable state of affairs will arise in factories in which men doing the same work on the same machines will be paid different rates of pay. Fully-skilled men going into defence industries now will not be paid the same wages as others who went in prior to the making of these regulations, although their work in each case is identical. </para>

That state of affairs would foment trouble in a factory. For that reason I ask the Government to disallow the regulations. </para>

Senators Armstrong, Arthur and myself voted against the bill because we knew that these regulations would follow. We do not propose to interfere with the first or second schedules which merely set out classifications and marginal payments. So far, it would appear that the Government does not intend to attack these standards; but no doubt they will be attacked in the future. We shall not be a party to any interference with them because we regard them as the irreducible minimum. </para>

The attacks made by the honorable senator upon some of the most reputable trade-union leaders in this country contrast strangely with his claim to be the leader of any section of the Labour party. This agreement has been entered into between the Government and the Amalgamated Engineering Union solely for the purpose of enabling us to proceed as rapidly and efficiently as possible with the manufacture of our munitions requirements. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> knows that the greatest difficulty with which we have been confronted in the past in this connexion has been a serious shortage of skilled labour. </para>

                            <para>- The short-sighted policy supported by the honorable senator of refusing to allow boys to be trained as artisans is very largely responsible for the position that we are faced with at the present time. In entering into this agreement with the Government, the Amalgamated Engineering Union has shown far more patriotism than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> has exhibited this afternoon in moving for the disallowance of these regulations. The honorable senator endeavoured to lead us to believe that the regulations provide for what he termed the conscription of labour in every walk of industry. He knows perfectly well that exactly the reverse is the case. The regulations provide for the carrying out of an agreement in relation to certain classes of labour which are set out definitely in the first schedule. Honorable senators are aware of the numerous appeals made by the Government for the co-operation of workers of all classes in order to enable us to utilize our manpower in industry to the full in carrying out our war programme. The regulations are designed to help us to achieve that objective. In addition, the rights of workers affected are completely protected under these provisions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> objected to any prohibition designed to prevent skilled men from travelling from shop to shop, with a view to securing higher wages. ' Every honorable senator will admit that in view of the urgency of munitions manufacture, we should do everything possible to prevent competition of that kind. Indeed, that has been one of the difficulties with which we have been confronted when we have previously attempted to utilize our skilled labour to the full. As the result of open competition between shops, operations in various units in munitions manufacture were seriously disturbed and the output retarded. </para>

                            <para>- I have here a copy of the agreement, and the honorable senator can study it for himself. I do not propose to go over all of the ground covered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour,</inline> because he made a series of mis-statements, and dealt with many matters which are irrelevant to the subject. Sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of regulation No. 3 provides that a permit to enable a worker to transfer from one shop to another, or from one industry to another, may be issued by the Director of Labour in the Munitions Department. To-day, that office is occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley,</inline> who was a member of the Scullin Labour Government. At this moment, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> is in conference in Victoria endeavouring to settle a minor dispute which !has arisen in connexion with defence works coming under the control of my department. When the dispute developed, I was glad to seek his advice and help in clearing up the matter. Under this regulation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> is empowered to grant a permit to a man to transfer from one factory to another. However, it is ridiculous for any honorable senator to suggest at a time such as the present, when we require the services of all skilled workers in the prosecution of our war effort, that we should not adopt this system for the dilution of labour. Every honorable senator knew that this was the Government's idea when the matter first arose, and insofar as the Government's proposal was embodied in the National Security Act, only three honorable senators voted against it. Consequently, it cannot be said that any honorable senator was not aware of the Government's intention to proceed along lines as set out in the regulation to which objection is now taken. </para>

Consequently, the Government says that it shall have first claim on the services of these men, which are so valuable to us in our present need. Our soldiers who are serving in England and Palestine will demand that we utilize to the full the skill and brains of our craftsmen in order that we may be able to supply to them the munitions and guns necessary to enable them to play their part effectively in the sphere of hostilities. </para>

                    </continue><para>I point out that no complaint against this agreement has emanated from the members of the union concerned. Tt has simply come from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour,</inline> who is protesting simply because of the political "scrapping" that is going on in the ranks of honorable senators opposite. The honorable gentleman said that those who claimed to speak on behalf of the men involved were not leaders of industrial unions. The gentlemen who signed the agreement on behalf of the union are industrial leaders of the highest repute, and they render a far greater patriotic service to Australia than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> when he seeks to have this regulation disallowed. Under the regulation, unscrupulous employers will be prevented from inducing skilled workers to leave employment which is most vital to the interests of this country. If the schedule of rates, which forms par i of the regulation, were to disappear to-morrow, the wages of the men concerned would be automatically reduced by approximately 6s. a week. If honorable senators opposite had had the same experience that I have had in connexion with the construction of defence works, they would readily realize the necessity for this system of the dilution of skilled labour. Recently, in order to expedite construction on certain defence works, we found ourselves obliged to draw on skilled labourers engaged on unimportant private work. It was in connexion with that matter that I sought, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley's</inline> intervention. </para><para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline>
                        indulged in cheap sneers at the expense of industrial leaders, whom he described as prominent members of the United Australia party. That shows just what kind of a man the honorable senator is. There is no greater or better industrialist in this country than the Director-General of Munitions Supply,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Essington</inline>
                        Lewis, the head of Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. As a member of the Ministry, I have had the opportunity to witness the industrial revolution that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lewis</inline>
                        has brought about since taking control of the Munitions Department. Honorable senators may be interested to know that ever since the outbreak of war he has given the whole of his time to the service of this country without one farthing reward. That is more than can be claimed by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour.</inline>
                        The way in which
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lewis</inline>
                        . has organized industry in this country is a tribute to his genius. We should go down on our knees and thank God that we have a man like him willing to devote himself to the interests of the nation in its time of crisis. Who are the other men at whom the honorable senator gibed? Every one of them is a man who has been responsible for the creation of industry and employment in Australia. They should not be sneered at in this Senate because they have been successful  in the industrial world and are ready to come forward and give their services to this country at this time. These men have all done something big in life, built ships, erected factories, created new industries and given work to thousands of people. Yet in consequence of a political feud in the party opposite, they are sneered at by a man like
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour,</inline>
                        who is not fit to clean their boots. I say that because I have knowledge of the service that they have given. There if no reason why the regulations should be disallowed, and I am certain that they will not be. The regulations are working well. The interests of the men are protected ; I know of no request from them that there should be any breaking of the arrangement that exists. The men engaged in the production of munitions realize the responsibilities that have been cast upon them. I am convinced that after the vote has been taken the regulations will continue to operate and that the defence programme will go on undisturbed.

                        <para>- I am perplexed. I believe from the speech of the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> that the Government desires that these regulations be not disallowed. I have taken some trouble to ascertain the opinion of the unions involved in this matter. I had no opportunity to do so until shortly before 3 o'clock. All of the telephones on our side of the chamber were out of order from 9 a.m. and are still not useable. I asked that the debate be ad journed until the next day of sitting - a particularly reasonable request - in order that as an. intelligent Opposition, we might have the opportunity to review the whole situation so as to be able, on the next day of 'meeting, to continue as co-operators with the Government in its war effort as we have been from the beginning. We have been in complete dissociation from the two honorable senators who call themselves the non-Communist party. But we find the Government voting with them. The Minister says that these men are endeavouring to sabotage the war effort; then because of political exigencies, and the opportunity is presented to make trouble for the Opposition on the eve of the election - evidently he would like to be able to go out and say that we have been false to the promise of full co-operation in the war effort - he allies himself with two honorable gentlemen who, he has said, are doing the work of the enemy. Yesterday I said that I had seen in connexion with another matter, namely, taxation, a disgraceful political intrigue in order to deceive the electors. I declared it was worse than the intrigue which went on for months in this Parliament between the competing parties in the Government. I take nothing back. The proceedings this afternoon have degraded British parliamentary practice and democracy to the level of the sewer. If I could think of any stronger condemnation of what has just happened I would use the appropriate language. I am ashamed of members of the Government. I have never liked them politically, but 1 did believe that there was ameasure of honour among them even as there is honour among thieves. I find, however, that in the Government parties there is not a vestige of honour. The spectacle that we had in the division just taken stands as an eternal disgrace to Government supporters. </para>

                        <para>- I am now referring to the Amalgamated Engineering Union, in which all of the persons referred to in the second schedule to the rule, are employed. But employees in other sections of the metals industry, who do not come immediately under the provisions of this rule, are also desirous of being brought under it. I wish to be fair to these unions, and to say that, in the short time that I have had for a conference with them, I have ascertained that they have a decided dislike to regulation No. 3, giving power to do certain things to which the workers might take exception. I pointed out to them that the Opposition could not amend the rule, but must either agree to its disallowance or vote for its continuance. </para>

                    <para>I realize that I shall be charged with supporting the Government in its nefarious designs to impose industrial conscription on the workers, but I can prove that that accusation is unsupportable. When Australia is threatened, as it is to-day, any government needs these powers in order to prepare satisfactorily at least for the defence of this country. I still think that the Government has not used its powers as adequately as it should have done. The defences of Australia should have been in a far more advanced condition than they are at the present time. There is nothing wanting in the powers already given to the Government, and I contend that it has fallen down on its job. </para>
                    <para>The Opposition realizes that nothing is now to be gained by criticizing the Government for having left undone what it might have done; but we must face the realities of the situation, and do what is now urgently necessary. I regret that there should be any suggestion of a division of opinion on a matter of this kind. I shall read a communication that I have received from London. There, a personal friend of mine, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ernest</inline> Bevin, was, until lately, general secretary of the greatest transport workers' organization in the world, and is now Director of Labour. This organization in Great Britain has 750,000 members, not including railway men, who have their own organization. I want to show what a Labour man in that country is able to do. I know that, if they can prevent it, the members of this Government will not allow the state of affairs which I am about to mention to occur in this country; but they will be unable to prevent it. Before there is a trial of strength at the forthcoming general elections, I am anxious to free myself of any charge that I have ever done anything to prevent the Government from doing the right thing in its effort to provide for the defence of this country. The statement reads - </para>

                <para>As if by the wave of a magic wand, Britain has become practically a Socialist state. Not only the lives of the people but their property also have come under the control of the Government, and what some of us have spent a long lifetime to achieve has been brought about by the war emergency in two hours. It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill,</inline> an inveterate individualist, remains Prime Minister. It is true that some of the Stick-in-the-Mudders still cling precariously to office by tolerance of colleagues who arc reluctant to cause a break in Parliamentary unity. But the seats of real power are occupied by Labour. </para>
                <para class="block">Yesterday, I read an extract from a speech by this Labour Minister, in which he said that he must have control of industry and of men, and that he must have the right to say that employees must go where directed. He also said that he must have the power to protect their wages and conditions, and that he intended to go on doing so. The Statutory Rule which the Senate is now considering provides only a further step to take complete control, and had the Opposition been offered a balance of power in a national government we would have been compelled to make a similar demand. </para>

                    <para>We do not deny that, if the situation deteriorates further, some such action as this Statutory Rule provides for must be taken. Although we hope that it will not, there is a strong probability that it may. This is One country in the world where every adult person enjoys a greater measure of liberty than do the people of any other country. I am merely stating facts and expressing the earnest hope that we will be victorious in the struggle in which we are engaged. I say without reservation that I oppose this motion for the disallowance of the regulations. If I could amend the regulations, I would endeavour to do so; but, under the Standing Orders, I have not that right, ft is the responsibility of every member of this Parliament to make himself acquainted with the laws of this country. I. a in not suggesting for a moment that the (Government is doing this job in the way that I think it should bc done. If the Government were amenable to reason, it would arrange for a secret session of this Parliament, such as has been sought, at which we could clear up some of the difficulties. Had such an opportunity been provided, I would have asked the Government to reconsider regulation No. ?&gt;, but we are denied that opportunity. Section 7 of the National Security Act reads - (1.) A person shall not, by reason of anything done by him on behalf of the Commonwealth during the period commencing on the twenty-fifth day of August, One thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine, and ending on the date of the commencement of this Act, be liable to any proceedings if the doing of that tiling could validly have been authorized had ti,is Act been in force throughout that period. (2.) Where during the period specified in sub-section (1.) of this section the Governor-General or any Minister or officer has purported to make any regulation or order, or to do any act or thing which could have been validly made or done if this Act had been in force throughout that period, that regulation, order, act or thing shall be deemed to be as valid and effectual, and shall, at all times, as on and from the date of the making or doing of the regulation, order, act or thing, bc deemed to have been as valid and effectual, as if this Act had been in force on that date, and the regulation, order, act or thing had been made or done under or in pursuance of this Act. </para>

                            <para>- I merely said that the supporters of the Government are deriving a great deal of satisfaction from a situation which they created. I then suggested that if they were not satisfied with the position, they should not have recorded the vote which they did. That was not a reflection on the vote of the Senate. This is not the place in which to reflect on votes cast; but the attitude of the Government in this matter will undoubtedly be mentioned on the hustings in a week or two. </para>

                            <para>- I know that it is disorderly to interject or to reply to interjections; but in order to protect every member of the Opposition from misrepresentation during the approaching election campaign, I ask the Minister for the Interior to remember that the Opposition in this chamber, with the exception of the two responsible for this motion, has never refrained from supporting any war measure which this Government has introduced. I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind and be honorable enough to admit it on the hustings. The Minister can reflect upon me personally, if he so desires. Having experienced political persecution, slander and misrepresentation since I was eighteen years of age, when first I became interested in politics, I have become inured to abuse from my opponents. I am, however, not unmindful of the honour which should be associated with the proceedings in this chamber and I do not wish Ministers to endeavour to score some mean political advantage by misrepresenting the party to which I belong. Honorable senators opposite have a perfect right to cite what we have said as recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard:</inline> but they must not misrepresent us. I am making this appeal now in the hope that, later, they will not commit political perjury. </para>

                        <para>.- It was quite a pleasure to listen to some parts of the speech just made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> because at times he forgot to argue, and poured out his soul with such enthusiasm as to reveal a robust patriotism which, coming from the Opposition side, was quite refreshing. Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> was quite sincere and honest, when he made the admission, rarely heard from the other side of the chamber, that the object of this war was to preserve for Australians living conditions and working standards which are second to none in the world. That is very seldom acknowledged by members of the Labour party, and I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition on that phase of his speech. At the same time, t regret that he has been placed in such an unenviable position by certain honorable senators opposite. </para>

                        in moving for the disallowance of these regulations, fell in badly when he advanced reasons in support of his contention. Some of his statements were really ridiculous, coming from a man of his training. For instance, he told a pathetic story about the hardships of women and children employed in factories, who might be prevented from transferring to other employment, even at the request of the members of their families. If the honorable member will look at the regulations, he will see that, according to the schedule, those affected are persons employed as electrical fitters, electrical mechanics, forgers and faggoters, instrument-makers, machinists, tool-makers and tradesmen - fitters and turners. I have been in the manufacturing business for a long time, but I have never yet seen a woman or child engaged in any of those trades. The honorable senator has been mistaken in his interpretation of the regulations. These regulations were found to be necessary because there was a great shortage of skilled labour in factories engaged upon munitions supplies. We must provide munitions of war in tremendous quantities in order to safeguard the lives of those in the fighting services. In this war munitions are as important, or perhaps more important, than man-power. If the fighting men cannot get munitions, they have no chance in modern warfare. They would be murdered. Those who are working long hours in the factories producing munitions are doing their duty just as much as are the men in khaki. As I have said, there is a great shortage of skilled tradesmen. I shall not endeavour to assign the responsibility for this, though I could do so if necessary. The shortage exists, and we must overcome it. The disallowance of the regulations would play into the, hands of the profiteers. Private manufacturers engaged upon civil work would then be able to lure away skilled tradesmen from the munitions factories, and employ them for their own profit.

                            <para>- Owing to the scarcity of skilled labour, men in munitions factories, and even apprentices, have had to work twelve hours a day. Those who have had any experience in such matters know that a man may work twelve hours a. day for a short while,  but if he continues to work such long hours over a period, his health will suffer and his output will diminish until, in the end, he will be actually producing less than the normal output for an eight-hour day. These regulations are necessary to protect the men. I know that certain of the workers, tempted by the extra money and ignoring the fact that long hours of work are bound to undermine their health, have asked the employers to allow them to work for twelve hours a day, and have threatened to leave their employment and go elsewhere unless this were conceded. Therefore, the regulations are necessary in order to protect the men against themselves. </para>

                            <para>- I know, but I am inclined to think that there has been some misunderstanding regarding the proposal for the dilution of labour. The Amalgamated Engineering Union deserves great credit for realizing the situation, and agreeing to what has been called the dilution of labour - that is, permitting the introduction of unskilled men who would gradually work up to the position of skilled tradesmen. They made the condition that any man thus doing a tradesman's work should receive a tradesman's pay. A further condition was that such men should be the first to be put off if, after the war, there was a scarcity of employment. That was a reasonable proposal from the point of view of the union, and is, I think, fair to both sides. If extra men have to be employed at this time, it is not right that they should displace the old, skilled tradesmen should jobs become scarce later. It is to the credit of the Amalgamated Engineering Union that in the present crisis it agreed to disregard its ordinary rules and make this agreement in order to allow of the dilution of labour. I think, however, that some misunderstanding exists as to the connexion between the agreement and the regulations itself. The agreement was made between the Government and the union apart altogether from the regulations. </para>

                            <para>- The contention that employees receive such concessions only because employers are forced to provide them is the silliest I have ever heard. The fact remains that employees of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited are given conditions which excel those provided by any other industrial organization. Within 25 years it has become the key industry of Australia and, to-day, in the face of the enemy, we rely almost solely upon it to enable us to proceed with the manufacture of munitions and war material on an adequate scale. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly, when we were friendly with Germany, we endeavoured to maintain friendship with that country by trading with it. As a matter of fact we were anxious to help <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> through its economic difficulties. In any case, we were justified in trading with Germany in a time of peace. Now, however, when an armed Germany is facing the world, it is ridiculous for the honorable senator to charge any organization with having traded with it in years of peace. </para>

                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition referred to the action of the Labour party in Great Britain in participating in the government of Great Britain, and he quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> in order to show what was being done for labour in England. All honour to the Labour party in Britain for what it has done in co-operating in Britain's war effort ; but I cannot reconcile the attitude of the British Labour party with the stand taken up by the Labour party in this Parliament. Honorable senators opposite say that they are willing to participate in the formation of a national government provided that they enjoy the balance of power in such a government. Surely, in view of their numerical minority in the Parliament itself, such a request is unreasonable. We on this side charge the Labour party with refusing to shoulder its fair share of responsibility. We give to members of that party full credit for their honesty and sincerity in refusing to hamper the activities of the Government. But the people expect something more from them. They should accept direct responsibility in a national government on behalf of the great body of workers whom /they directly represent. </para>

                    <para>I hope that honorable senators will reject the motion for the disallowance of these regulations. The provision protects the interests of the men concerned, and prevents bargaining as between one factory and another. At the same time it consolidates the workers' position in munitions factories. In addition it will prevent our munitions factories from being depleted of vital workmen who would, otherwise probably be enticed elsewhere by the offer of higher wages. I strongly support the regulations also because they will do away with 12-hour shifts which are abominable. If such long shifts be worked the efficiency and health of the men will be detrimentally affected. For these reasons these regulations will operate in the best interests of the workers themselves, the employers and the men who are fighting to keep Australia safe. </para>

It sometimes happens that no actual ore is mined during a quarter, even though the ore, previously mined, is treated during the quarter. The Commissioner of Taxation is convinced, as the result of advice tendered by gold-mining experts and Mines Department officials in the various States, that the present provision is inequitable and should be altered so that the cost of production will have reference to the cost of the actual ore treated. </para>
                    <para>A drafting correction is necessary in section 10 (a)c in order to ensure that the maximum amount to be taken into account as the average cost of development shall in no case exceed the sum of £2 per oz. of fine gold. This was the definite intention set out in the second-reading speech on the original bill, but the existing provisions fail to give proper effect to that intention. </para>
                    <para>Mining experts consider that a fixed quarter is not a convenient period for all producers in the industry. Books, statistics and records are, in some cases, kept either on a weekly or four-weekly basis. The proposal is : that the act be amended to provide for variation in the period of a " quarter ". A new section 10a is being inserted in order to give discretion to the Commissioner of Taxation in determining the exact period on an application from a producer. </para>

                        <para>. - I bring under the notice of the Government a matter which is deserving of serious consideration. I should like the responsible Minister at some future time to be able to give an assurance that the matter of which I intend to complain is not the result of instructions given by the Commonwealth. Government. As the Senate, no doubt, is aware, the question of conscription is agitating the minds of many of our people, and during the course of discussions, both in the Senate and the House of Representatives, assurances have been given by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and other responsible Ministers that there will be no conscription for overseas service. As a matter of fact, legislative provision has been made to prevent conscription for overseas. Notwithstanding assurances on that score, and also the declaration of the Prime Minister that freedom of speech and assembly will continue in Australia, I am advised that, at least in Melbourne, those who desire to address the people on the subject of conscription are having all sorts of difficulties placed in their way. The police have interrogated them and asked for their names and addresses. </para>

                            <para>- That is not the question. We. still have freedom in Australia. We still believe in democracy. In view of the assurances given by the Prime Minister and other responsible spokesmen of the Government that these subjects are open for public discussion, it seems that some subterfuge has been resorted to by officials of the Commonwealth in order to authorize harassing tactics. I hope that the Leader of _ the Government in the Senate is in a position to assure us that these activities are not  carried  out at the express direction of the Commonwealth Government. But it is significant that the Government saw fit to-day to curtail discussion in this chamber of national security regulations. The importance of the subject warranted a lengthy debate. How can we accept the assurances of the Government that industrial conscription will not be introduced when the tactics of which I have complained are being carried out by underhand methods? A great deal of- the uneasiness which prevails in the Labour movement at the present time will be allayed if the honorable gentleman will give the assurance that I seek. </para>

Therefore I am justified in bringing the matter to the notice of the Senate and asking the responsible Minister for information on the subjectHonorable senators on this side of the chamber agreed to give to the Government powers that we would never have dreamt of giving in time of peace. We did. so because we were anxious for a 100 per cent, war effort in Australia. Now it seems that certain abuses have occurred in spite of the solemn assurances given to us. </para>

                            <para>- The interjection of the honorable gentleman is unworthy of a Minister who has been entrusted with the responsibility of leading the Government in the Senate. A man who is so impulsive as to make a remark of that kind shows himself to be unworthy of the great trust which his colleagues in the Government have reposed in him. It should demonstrate to the people outside of Parliament the unworthiness of the honorable gentleman to be a member of this chamber. The action that the Government has taken is a betrayal of the promises given in this chamber when the special national security legislation was passed. </para>

                        <para>. - I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate to investigate the histories of some newspapers that have been suppressed by the censorship authorities. These authorities have permitted the publication of certain newspapers printed in French, Greek and Yiddish to continue, whereas a newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Napredar,</inline> printed in the Jugoslavian language, was suppressed without prior warning from the Government. I have been assured that the publishers of this journal have at no time done anything to conflict with the wishes of the censorship authorities. Without any previous notification, instructions were suddenly issued that the publication of this newspaper should cease. If it be right to allow newspapers to be published in French, Greek and Yiddish, sound reasons should be advanced for the action that has been taken. Many of the readers of the Jugoslav journal can speak English, but cannot read the English language. I am assured by those responsible for the publication of this newspaper that they have carried out to the letter every request made by the censor. In Western Australia, these nationals have unmistakably displayed1 their loyalty to Australia, and many of them are naturalized British subjects. </para>

If everything is to be done according to the experts, then I say, " God help Australia ". My remark applies with particular significance to our defence preparations. The Minister stated, in reply to my question, that there was no accumulation of surplus potatoes in the ports of Tasmania. I say definitely that potatoes have been accumulating during the last three or four weeks on the wharfs all along the coast of Tasmania. Up to 15,000 sacks have so accumulated. Only about a fortnight ago, when 40,000 sacks were on the wharfs, Tasmania was allowed to ship to Sydney only 20,000 sacks. </para>

I have listened to him by the hour while he has read printed speeches that have been prepared for him by departmental officers. The least he can do now is to maintain silence while members of the Opposition place before the Government matters in which they are interested. </para>

Why should not Australian potatoes be permitted to go upon the market while they can be supplied? We have no reason to believe that the Tasmanian growers will fail to meet the needs of the market for at least another two months. If any growers are to be called upon to store their potatoes, why should not the New Zealand growers do that until the Tasmanian crop is marketed ? </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but, even so, Tasmania has more than sufficient potatoes to supply the market in the next two months. In reply to my question to-day, the Minister said that potatoes did not deteriorate while stacked on the wharf awaiting shipment. That answer shows his lack of knowledge and his unfitness for his office. The Government's action in this matter is another injustice to Tasmania, which has suffered many injuries at the hands of this Government. If we take into account the returns from potatogrowing over a number of years, it will be found that the growers do not make huge profits. There is only about one good season in four seasons. </para>

                            <para>- I speak for my own State; the position may be different in Victoria. The least the Government should do for the Tasmanian growers of potatoes is to enable them to market their produce before potatoes from New Zealand are allowed to flood the market and force prices down. The Government has seen fit to fix a maximum price for potatoes in Sydney. I desire to know whether it is prepared to fix a minimum price for the whole year, and if so, whether it will be sufficient to cover the cost of production. Had it not been that the seat of a supporter of the Government was in jeopardy, the embargo on the importation of potatoes from New Zealand would never have been lifted. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that it is a subsidiary of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. A representative of the company has told the growers of the urgent need to grow flax, but no one has told them what they are likely to be paid for the flax when it is grown. The Minister has told us that no contract between the company and the Commonwealth Government is in existence. If it be intended that the Commonwealth Government shall take over  the  whole of the flax crop, I desire to know what is to be done with the flax, and whether the company referred to is to process the fibre. If that is the intention, surely it is time that the <inline font-style="italic">Government</inline> announced the terms of the arrangement. The Minister also said that the flax would be paid for according to its quality. It is time that the Government announced the price that will be paid. There are rumours that about £5 a ton will be paid. </para>

                            <para>- Flax straw is the flax after it has been cut, and when it is ready to be carted to the mill for processing. In view of the fact that in England processed fibre is worth £160 a ton, that the Australian Government was offered £180 a ton for it, and also that the British Government is paying to the growers from £10 a ton for the raw flax before it is processed, surely the Commonwealth Government is in a position to say something more definite than that the flax will be paid for according to its quality. Since the farmers undertook to grow so many acres of flax, the cost of fertilizers has risen considerably, and the growers may find that they have produced the flax at a loss. I do not wish to say anything which might restrict the acreage to be sown with flax. </para>

                        <para>.- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett,</inline> who has just resumed his seat, does not know more about potatoes than he knows about flax, I am afraid that his knowledge is limited. Through the Government of Northern Ireland the British Government has purchased, at £4 per ton, flax straw produced from 60,000 acres. Evidently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> does not know what straw is. It is flax from which the seed has been removed. For this the grower is paid about £28 a ton. The price of seed varies considerably according to the quality and kind of flax. The 400 tons of seed which arrived in Australia from Britain is of special quality. This flax of a special quality produces a small quantity of seed and a high percentage of fibre. Therefore it is necessary to pay a higher price for the straw for fibre. The growers in Ireland will receive a return of approximately £20 an acre on this basis.  I  do not know what the growers in Australia are likely to receivebecause no arrangements have been made with Flax Fibres Proprietary Limited, a company which the honorable senator says is a subsidiary company of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. I have never heard such an absurd statement. Those associated with the company are well-known persons; I know who they are, but I do not intend to enlighten the honorable senator. The Government, I understand, proposes to purchase, at a fair price, the British Government's requirements of straw which is made into fibre, and also to pay a reasonable price for the seed. That is all that can be done until the position becomes clarified and the necessary arrangements are made by the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron).</inline> I am confident that Australian producers of flax will get a reasonably good return for the production of this commodity. The production of flax is not a new industry in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- An agreement has not yet been reached, but the growers can rest assured that the Government will give them all that there is in it. The Government is not interested in the industry for what it can get out of it, but is anxious to assist the producers. Flax has been grown in Australia for over 30 years. Crops are produced in my district, and the product sent to the factories, where it is treated. I understand that a new process is being evolved which seems to embody an excellent idea. This new process is at present being investigated by interested officials. Inbuying flax for the British Government the straw will be cut and threshed and the seed removed, and instead of retting it, it will be crushed and the residue, which is stock fodder and contains 3 per cent. linseed oil, removed. The crushed fibre in an untreated form will be shipped to Great Britain, where there are the necessary retting pits and machines. In a year or two we may be able to treat the crops grown in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The seed was only landed on Monday last, and I have not the slightest doubt that those who are interested know what is proposed. The honorable senator knows nothing of the subject which he has raised. I believe that many persons will be able to produce flax successfully in this country, and that the flax industry will become well established particularly in late districts such as Ballarat and in parts of Tasmania and of Queensland. Eventually, flaxgrowing should become an important industry. We do not want only to grow flax but to handle it and to process it. Something in this direction will have to be done because we cannot continue to produce wheat and other primary products for which there is no overseas market. Flax-growing is an industry whichcould be carried on in conjunction with mixed farming and should prove profitable. The growing of flax has been carried on profitably by many farmers in my district. A neighbour of mine has 200 acres under  flaxand others have50 acres or more. I am certain that the Government will takethe necessary steps to see that the farmers producing flax will receive very fair treatment and that they will not be deprived of a single shilling. </para>

                        <para>. -On Tuesday last I asked an intelligent question, and although I am under the impression that I speak the King's English the Minister to whom the question was directed was apparently unable to understand the English language. I endeavoured to obtain some information about "Cooper's snoopers". I asked whether the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullet t)</inline> had engaged menand women to obtain information on certain subjects as has been done by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duff</inline> Cooper in England. Several days ago a woman came to Queensland and engaged people to go around and ask questions of certain individuals. Money was paid for doing the work. I know one person who was so engaged and I am anxious to ascertain whether such persons arc associated with any governmentactivity or with a private organization. I understand that the name of this body is the " Markets Research Specialists of Australian Census of Public Opinion " but I have been unable to find any one who has engaged these people. Are these Australian " Cooper's snoopers" some of "Murdoch's mystery men " or have they been engaged by the Australian Broadcasting Commission? One question asked was " What do you think of the Federal Government's war effort?" The answer given was "What war effort? ". I cite some questions and facetious answers which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Truth</inline> newspaper published in most of Australia's States - </para>

                    <para>I now ask the Minister in all seriousness whether he will inform me next week who is responsible for the appointment of these persons, and whether they are in any way associated with any governmental activity. The Criminal Investigation Branch in Brisbane tried unsuccessfully to discover by whom they were appointed and I now suggest that inquiries should be made by the Commonwealth Investigation Branch, I should like to be assured that Government money is not being wasted in obtaining answers to suck foolish questions. </para>
