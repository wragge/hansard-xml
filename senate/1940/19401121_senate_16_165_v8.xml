                <para class="block">I am deeply conscious of the honour which has been conferred upon me in being asked to move theAddressinReply. The motion includes an expression of loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign. Such a motion would at any time commend itself to all sections of this community, but at this period in our history the expression of our loyalty to  His  Majesty has special significance. I think that I can associate with that portion of the motion sentiments of goodwill towards all the peoples of this great Commonwealth of Nations, particularly the men and women of Great Britain, who, since the Commonwealth Parliament last assembled, have, in facing one of the greatest tragedies in history, displayed all those characteristics, including doggedness and courage, which have made the members of the British race famous. In the tragic circumstances which prevail, we cannot forget the dangers being faced by all the people of Great Britain from  His  Majesty the King down to the humblest citizen working in the mine- or in the fields. Within the last three months the people of Britain have written history before our eyes, and I venture to predict that when, the whole story is told it will be a record of courage and devotion such as has never been excelled in the history of the British race. During this period we in Australia have had the good fortune to continue our activities free from interruption or danger, to conduct a. general election, and in that way exercise to the full the rights which our democratic system provides. The general election may not have been quite as satisfactory as honorable senators on this side of the chamber desired, but it resulted in the return of the Menzies Government. I congratulate the Government upon the success it achieved. I also extend my personal congratulations to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> who, in his own electorate' received an overwhelming majority from the people who know. him best. The result of the election was a recognition by the people of Australia of the excellent work which this Government has performed since the outbreak of  war, and indicates the people's approval of the policy which was placed before them. The Government has received a mandate to continue to give effect to its policy directed to attaining victory in the great . conflict which is now being waged. </para>
                <para>Recently some of us were privileged to inspect some of the excellent work which is being performed in Australia in new industrial undertakings, particularly those concerned with aeroplane construction and' the manufacture of munitions-. The success which ha3 been achieved in this direction is due largelyto the solid foundations which have been laid. We must also pay tribute to the executives controlling the undertakings, and to the men and women who are giving of their best to ensure that our forces shall be supplied with the machines arid munitions which they need. </para>
                <para> I experienced some disappointment when I learned that a national ministry, representative of all political parties in this Parliament, was not to be formed. I do .not intend to "throw bricks" or cast reflections upon any particular section; but I think that I am justified in saying that no blame can be attached to the party to which I belong. It is true that an .Australian Advisory War Council has been  established,  which, possibly, is the best alternative. It is better that we should have that than there should bo no machinery by which the representatives of all of the parties in this Parliament can assist in a co-operative movement towards the winning of the war.' The new body that has been created provides a. means whereby the representatives of the parties who meet in it may, at least, by the goodwill which I am sure they will all- display, reduce the number of the subjects upon which we are divided, and reach agreement more and more  upon  those things which are essential for the full attainment of the purpose that we have in view. </para>
                <para>I congratulate the Ministry upon one new departure which has been made in the course of the last few weeks. I. refer to the appointment of a Minister for Labour. It is apparent that continuous production in our factories, fields' and workshops is essential if we are to carry on the war effort at the full momentum which is required. I regret, and I am sure that many other members of this chamber also regret, that these activities have been interfered with in. some ]nea- sure by the occurrence of a few unfortunate strikes. For many years we have had a system of arbitration for the con: trol of conditions of labour, in order to ensure that, in the long run, the working men and women of this community, shall get a fair deal. "It is true that the system which has operated up to the present time is not free from imperfections. The Commonwealth arbitration system- is, unfortunately, limited in its operation by reason of the provisions of the Common^ wealth Constitution. In addition, we have had the difficulty of. conflicting dercisions by Commonwealth and State tribunals. Now, in this period of war, a great opportunity is presented to mould the <inline font-style="italic">H'O</inline> systems into a comprehensive whole, so that the Australian community may have a method of control of wages and working conditions which will be efficient and free from technicalities, and which will avoid the conflict that has hitherto occurred between the  awards  of State and Federal tribunals. I am sure that we all desire to. avoid unnecessary stoppages of. work, whether .by strikes or lock-outs. If we .desire,, for .the sake of the national war. effort, to avoid these things, I believe that the community should provide the workers with a system of arbitration, and --control of industrial disputes as efficient . as it can be made, so that there will be" no excuse for men to go on strike. . I have no doubt that the Minister for Labour and National Services, .in his consideration of' these matters, will here and there come across opportunities for improving and strengthening, the present- system, and I hope that- he will enable us to prevent the strikes- which, unfortunately, have been a feature -of the news during the last few weeks. By resort to arbitration we can do a great deal towards the ultimate' settlement of disputes, but we should also prevent their occurrence by a constant process of conciliation. The oversight, by departments such as the Department of Labour, of industrial activities and conditions, should go far towards preventing workmen from being tempted to leave their workshops and go on strike. </para>
                <para>I shall refer to one other matter which, I think, is worthy of the commendation of all of us - .the policy that has been pursued by the Government since the war began in protecting the community from undue increases of the prices of commodities. This is a subject near to the heart of the general mass of the community. I believe that the maintenance of stability in prices under conditions such as those now prevailing is a contributing factor to the maintenance of industrial peace. It is well known that the people who suffer most in a period of rising prices are those working on wages and salaries, for wages and salaries never catch up with the increased cost of living. This Government has, since the commencement of the war, followed such an intelligent financial and economic policy that we have been able to avoid the worst features of the evil of rising prices which manifested itself in the course of the last war. The Department of Commerce has recently published a most interesting booklet concerning the whole machinery of the control of prices, and the record which has been obtained i3 a matter of great satisfaction, I am sure, to the Minister in charge of that department, and also to the commissioner and other officers who have worked efficiently under him. For the first eleven months of this war, retail priceshave risen by only 1.9 per cent., as compared with 40 -per cent, in the first elevenmonths of the last war. That may be said to be not- a fair comparison, because the circumstances are different. It is true, of course, that we have had the advantage during this war of the knowledge and experience gained by the mistakes of the war of 1914-18; but similarly favorable figures are obtained when we compare prices in this country with those in the United Kingdom. Wholesale prices of food and groceries in Australia rose during the first eleven months of the war by 14 per cent., whilst in the United Kingdom they increased by 42 per cent. Retail prices in Australia during the same period' rose, as I have said, by only 1.9 per cent,., but in the United Kingdom they increased by 1S.S per cent., or  nearly  one-fifth. </para>
                <para>I express my commendation of the Government upon the appointment to the important office of Minister Plenipotentiary to Japan of one well known to all members of this Parliament - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham. I believe that the Commonwealth has to-day, and in the years to come, a most important  part to play in the affairs of the Pacific because of its position in that ocean. The Government is to be congratulated, not only upon the creation of this new diplomatic post, but also upon having been able to secure the services of one so able and so well fitted as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham is to perform such an important task. In the last few months, some of the effects of the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> as the representative of Australia at Washington have become evident. I have no doubt that he has played an important part in the growth in the United States of America of the friendly sentiment that is so manifest there to-day towards British people, and which is of vital importance to us in regard to the successful prosecution of the war. </para>
                <para>Thi3 Parliament now meets during the most momentous period in the history of not only this Commonwealth, hut also our Empire. We are at the moment, perhaps, in the valley of the shadow, and we feel we have a long and thorny path to fol.low; but I think that we are all conscious of the fact that, although darkness may surround us, we can see ahead the first glimmering of dawn. We are confident that we shall pass beyond the valley of the shadow into the brilliant sunshine, before the sun i3 at its zenith, and that there we shall enjoy the green pastures of victory and the still waters of peace. My fervent hope is that the members of this Parliament- may still be here when that happy day dawns, and that, in addition to dealing with the problems of war, we shall have a hand in the establishment of a just- and lasting peace. </para>

                    <para>. - I have pleasure in seconding the motion for the adoption of the excellent Speech delivered by the Governor-General, setting -out the legislative proposals and policy of the United Australia party-United Country party Government led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> for the present short parliamentary session. In passing, I' congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> upon his maiden speech in this Parliament; it showed that he is a valuable addition to the fighting and debating forces behind the Government. Every member of the Senate joins in. the expression of loyalty to the Throne contained in the motion, and, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer,</inline> sympathizes with the people of Great Britain, and of London in particular, in the terrible ordeal through which they are passing. It is well to remember that unless victory, attends British arms, it will be only a matter of time before we in Australia will be subjected to somewhat similar treatment. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Whilst admitting that the war position is grave, the Speech states that recent events strengthen the confidence of the Government in ultimate victory. Although the difficulties and dangers con fronting the British Empire are greater than at any other time in its history, the Speech indicates that the German plans for the invasion of Britain have, for the time being at least, been foiled. The Speech makes it clear that the Avar position is such that- the whole Empire must pull its- full weight if victory .is to be achieved. Australia's maximum effort can be obtained only by the full use of all of our resources - men, material and ]non CV - in one united effort; the support of the whole of the people and of every poli tical party is necessary. I commend " the Menzies Government for its attempts to secure the co-operation of all political parties in Australia's war effort. Those endeavours have been only partly successful, but I prefer to speak of the measure of success that has been achieved rather than of the degree to which the Government's efforts have failed. </para>
                <para>I am glad that since the election .an Advisory War Council, representative of all political parties in this Parliament, has been set up under the authority of the National Security Act. The functions of the council are to advise the Government regarding Australia's war effort and the problems relating thereto. The forma-: tion of this advisory council and Labour's participation in it is a step - if only a short one - in the right direction. It is interesting to' note that the War Council, one half of whose members represent the two Labour parties  in this  Parlia-ment,  has- given grave consideration, to industrial stoppages- in. war-time. If the frequent stoppages, or: strikes, from which Australia has suffered with  alarming  frequency during the war, can. bc prevented by the establishment, 0L the Advisory War Council and the setting ups of a Ministry, of Labour, these innovations will have more than justified themselves. The Speech sets out that' industrial disturbances, constitute a. real blow- at our. national security. All honorable- senators will admit that Australia is provided5 with adequate and easily accessible1 machinery for the settlement of disputes1 and the adjustment of' grievances by arbitration. Consequently, there can be' no justification for direct- action, and Ihope that we shall' have no recurrences of ill-advised- strikes while the war  lasts  I hope that Labour's participation in ti- </para>
                <para>War Council is a step towards a much closer co-operation with the Government in the conduct of the war. Both before and during the recent election I advocated the formation of a real national government, in which Labour would accept its fullshare of responsibility for the administration of activities associated with the war effort. I do not wish to say anything which may render such co-operaation more difficult, but I am sorry that Labour did not accept the generous offer of eight portfolios in a government of sixteen members which Mr.Menzies made since the election. </para>

                        <para>- So far as I am aware, the offer of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> is still open, and if that be so, I hope that wiser counsels will prevail and that the offer will be accepted by the parties opposite. The best brains in this Parliament should be in a national ministry to guide Australia's war-time effort in these dangerous times. Only by such full cooperation can Australia play its part. Should Labour decide to join in a national government, it will follow the magnificent example set by the Labour party in Great Britain, where Messrs. Bevin, Attlee, Morrison and others, hold important portfolios in the War Cabinet with the full approval of the trade union movement of Great Britain. Labour's participation in a national government had the support of 23,000,000 trade unionists, whilst only a few tens of thousands of them opposed the proposal on a card vote. I believe that the trade unionists of Australia would record a similarly overwhelming vote in favour of a. national government if they were consulted. </para>

                        <para>- The trade unionists of Australia have never been consulted as were their fellow unionists in Great Britain by the calling of a convention to consider the formation of a national government. In Great Britain the rank and file of the Labour movement in the United Kingdom authorized the acceptance of portfolios by their leaders.

                <para>I heartily congratulate the Government on its return to power as the result of the recent general election, and particularly on the signal' moral victory that it achieved, as is evidenced by the result of the Senate election. The Senate is the more democratic of the two branches of the legislature, for it springs direct from the people who record their opinions </para>
                <para>Onbroad principles of policy. In five of the six States their opinion was recorded decisively in favour of the present Government, which advocated the formation of a national ministry. If honorable senators wish to draw any conclusion from the election figures, I direct their attention to the fact that those candidates who advocated a national ministry and held the gate open for Labour to enter it, were returned in five of the six States. I regard the vote for Senate candidates as a truer reflection of the will of the people than the votes cast for the House of Representatives, because the Senate vote is not so influenced by parochial considerations. I can quote no better authority for that statement than the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber on the 1st December, 1937. The Government should be gratified that it still retains a majority in the House of Representatives. It is true that that majority is small, but it is likely to be increased in the near future. There is no doubt that the Government will he able to retain the reins of office unless and until a national government is formed. </para>
                <para>The Speech points out that the principal business of the present sittings of the Parliament will be the making of financial provision for the carrying on of our share of the war, and for the ordinary public services. So far as I am concerned, the paramount question for our consideration is how best we can organize Australia's war effortfor the successful prosecution of the war. We all hope that victory will soon be achieved ; but until that is done every other issue must be subservient to the vigorous prosecution of the war. </para>
                <para>The Speech tells us that, within a few days, the Treasurer will introduce a budget which will place on the Australian people burdens heavier than they have ever before been called upon to bear. </para>
                <para class="block">The courteous action of the Opposition in the House of Representatives in agreeing to the suspension of the Standing Orders will enable the budget to be introduced into that chamber to-day. The Speech does not disclose any details of the heavy taxation which it foreshadows, but we know that this year's budget will be a record, for it will provide for the raising of no less than £277,000,000, of which £1S6,000,000 is to be set aside for :war and defence purposes. That is an enormous sum for a little over 7,000,000 people to contemplate raising. Of course, expenditure on- this tremendous scale must involve heavy increases of "both direct and indirect taxation. The imposition of heavier burdens' on the people is never popular, but this is an occasion on which an increase of taxes in order to provide a more substantial contribution towards the cost of the war cannot -'be questioned by any responsible person. Most Australians realize that, in this war, our national existence -is at stake. They realize that no sacrifice is too heavy and no price too high to ensure the safety of our land and the freedom of our people. They only ask, and ask vigorously, that the taxes shall be levied on the basis of ability to pay. The burden must be distributed in accordance with , the capacity of the various classes of the community to meet additional imposts. That, I believe, is the policy of the Government. </para>

The serious condition of the wheat-growing industry, combined with this year's drought, leaves growers in urgent need of an additional payment. When one visits the wheat-growing districts, particularly those areas in which there will be only small crops in the coining harvest, one is met with the same request, " When are we going to get a final payment of, we hope, an additional 6d. a bushel, on last year's crop?" I urge the Government to give attention to this matter. </para>

                        <para>-The official estimate is 75,000,000 bushels. Not more than 40,000,000 bushels will be available for export. Of course, from the Government's point of view, the smaller the crop the easier it will be with a home consumption price of 5s. 2d. a bushel to pay a good price for the coming harvest. Approximately 32,000,000 bushels' are required for home consumption in Australia. With the operation of a home-consumption price of 5s. 2d. a bushel, which is a fixed item of Country party policy, the Government should have no difficulty whatever in paying to the growers at least 4s. a bushel f.o.r. ports, particularly when we realize that the volume of the coming harvest will be so small. I hope that we shall soon have a pronouncement by the Government on this point. It is officially estimated that the marketable crop . this year will not exceed 75,000,000 bushels, whilst prominent growers go so far as to suggest that it will not be half that quantity. In any case, we should be unduly optimistic to expect a harvest in excess of 75,000,000 bushels. In his speech,  His Excellency  pointed out that interruptions to shipping, disturbance and loss of foreign markets, and, in recent months, the occurrence of a disastrous drought, have seriously aggravated the difficulties confronting our primary industries. However, the Government is giving sympathetic consideration to these problems, and is dis cussing them with representatives of the industries concerned. Only last week the representatives of the wheat-growers attended a conference in Canberra, whilst at the moment representatives of the apple and pear growers are here conferring with the Government. I commend the Government upon the efforts which it is making to solve theseproblems. I am particularly pleased to note the re-appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page as Minister for Commerce. In that capacity, his wisdom, experience and sympathy with ourprimary producers will again be exerted for the benefit of our primary producers as a whole. Without labouring the point, I take this opportunity to bring to his notice the need for establishing a wool appraisement centre at Albany. I feel sure that now that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page is at the helm he will quickly take steps to see that the Government's decision on this matter is carried out. I believe that when the Government decided to establish a wool appraisement centre at Albany, every member of it, as a matter of common justice to wool-growers in that district, desired to see effect given to that decision as expeditiously as possible. </para>

                    <para>. - In view of the eulogy of myself just voiced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> I almost feel too modest to say anything at all  Upon  this occasion. I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .Spicer</inline> -on' his speech: He gave evidence of debating ability of which the Government parties in this, chamber are sorely in. need. By <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer's</inline> advent, the Government's serious deficiency in that respect is- partly relieved. ' I regret that the Government senators did hot show, due appreciation-  of-  the fact that a new colleague of theirs in this chamber was making his maiden speech. While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> was speaking, only six Government senators were present in the chamber, although, I ani proud to say, thirteen honorable senators on this side remained to hear what he had to say. In the course of his remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> said that he had no desire to throw bricks. I remind him that throwing bricks . is a dangerous practice; along that road there is two- way traffic. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston's</inline> speech, of course, was characteristic of whatthe honorable senator does whenever a by-election is pending in Western Australia. . Nevertheless, I commend him on. the speech he made, just as I commend  the Government on its decision in respect of the wheat industry. Obviously, the Government did only what it is wise politically for it to do on the eve of a by-election. I could not follow the mover and seconder of the motion in their repeated congratulations of the Government upon certain decisions the value of which seems- to me to be more apparent than real. Before replying specifically to - those honorable senators, however, I propose to deal with the Governor-General's Speech. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>All of us know; of. course, that the Speech was not prepared by the Governor-General himself. If that were the case, I should feel much more inclined to let it pass without comment, because I should not like to be severe in my criticism of a gentleman of the calibre of  His Excellency.  The Speech was, of course, prepared by the Government, and simply delivered by the Governor-General on its behalf. It contains a serious flaw; I . should say, indeed, a positive -blot which should never have been allowed to appearin such a document. Members of thisOpposition, of course, do not need, evenon an occasion such as this, to reiterate, their loyalty to the Throne, or their desire to see the war brought to a successful conclusion. The people of Australia know just exactly where the Opposition stands in this matter. And that is equally true of honorable senators opposite. No. real necessity exists for continual repetition of our loyalty to the Throne, although, perhaps, it is wise that we express such loyalty upon, certain- occasions. A portion of the Speechis' highly provocative to, not only the Opposition, but also a huge percentage of the workers of this country, upon whom alone the success of our war effort must' depend, be it - in the ' fighting forces abroad or at home, on land or sea, in the air, in the fields, factories, mines or workshops of Australia. That statement refers to the attitude of our industrial workers. Without one word in mitigation of it, or apology for it, the Speech contained the implication that the workers of  this country are prepared to he disloyal and to- withhold their maximum support of Australia's war effort. That charge is a slander on that class which the Opposition represents in this chamber. It -is a slander on the class of men who alone, so far as Australia's effort is concerned, can bring this war to a successful conclusion for  the  Empire Forces. -The particular statement to which I refer is : - </para>

                    <para>Already several meetings of this council-have taken p.ace with useful results- -.   In particular, the council has given consideration to the question of industrial stoppages during war-time, and has been able to make recommendations which my advisers hope will-: lead to a perfecting of. the machinery of industrial peace, and at the same time to a maintenance of full and uninterrupted labour and production. </para>
                    <para>The Government feels strongly that, in a country in which there is adequate and- accessible machinery for the settlement of disputes and the adjustment of grievances, there can Lie no justification for direct action. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That statement is untrue. There does not exist, and there has not existed for years, any adequate and easily accessible machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes, which would entitle the Governor-General to say that the workers of Australia can have no justification for direct action. The statement continued - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>This is particularly true in time of -war, when any cessation of work in a war industry, or in any industry which is related to the war effort, constitutes a real blow at the national security. A fortnight's work in some munitions factory, once Lost, can never be recovered. It means inevitably at least a fortnight's delayin the production of some gun, some piece of ammunition or some equipment urgently, and in some cases desperately, needed by Australians serving in a theatre of war. </para>
                </quote>
                <para> That statement is entirely unnecessary and unwarranted. It is a discredit to the Government that framed it'' and put it into the innocent mouth of - the  Governor-General.  Men do not go on strike for' fun. At the moment, no machinery is available in Australia for the immediate and easy settlement of industrial disputes. Whilst I am not suggesting that the existing machinery is not valuable, it is devised only to serve our peace-time needs. No machinery is available to cope with the altered conditions that prevail in industry in time of- war. May I say, with pardonable pride,-' that the Australian Advisory- War Council is the creation of the rank and file of the Labour party, sitting in conference first in Canberra and later in Melbourne. The delegates who attended those assemblies decided that Labour would co-operate with the Government in the establishment of such a council. I am willing, however, to give to the Government credit for,the intention to make the council operate, satisfactorily. </para>
                <para>This afternoon, Senator1 Johnston referred to what he described as the magnanimous offer made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> to the Labour: party of eight out of sixteen seats in the Cabinet, if it would agree to join with the United Australia party and the United Country party in -forming a national  government. I want it to go on record that the Prime Minister never made any such offer to the Labour party until a few weeks ago. Time after time, conferences of the Labour movement and members of the Opposition in this Parliament declared that they would not participate in a. national government. Consequently, the Prime Minister knew that he was perfectly safe in making such an offer to the Labour party. In his first proposal for the formation of a national government, he suggested that the Labour party should have four or five seats in a cabinet of sixteen. . </para>

                        <para>- Yes, in an honorary capacity, in order that the Government might not be continually ignorant about those phases of war problems -which affect the people whom we on this side of the chamber represent. I am very pleased to read in the press that a sane attitude towards industrial troubles is now being adopted by the council. "While speaking upon this subject, I propose to read a statement by the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> dealing with this very matter. He said - : </para>

                    <para>In the question of war-time industry and  machinery  to ensure production and regulation of  conditions is  involved the- very core of our economic capacity to wage war. Should abuses develop and not be checked they will impair the maximum effort of industry. It is unrealistic to expect that the burdens will be borne on a basis of inequality. Justice in industry must be the watchword.. Speed must be the characteristic in the consideration, of claims and complaints; decisions must be prompt and - not put off- by eternal circumlocution and even evasion. </para>
                    <para>May l interpolate, in reply to what has been said by honorable senators opposite on this subject, that some unions filed plaints before industrial tribunals two years ago and the cases have not yet been heard. The statement made by the Leader of the Opposition continued - </para>
                    <para>The council has declared unanimously the principles whereby the machinery in this connexion will be shaped to meet war-time problems. I have no doubt that the requisite steps will he taken and stoppages to production will not take- place. Our safety cannot afford these dislocations. The sustaining of an expanding programme of more equipment, ordnance, munitions, aeroplanes, ships and supplies is essential if we are to hold all that we have. To lose one hour of production is to make a gift of that hour and what could have been produced in it to the enemy. </para>
                    <para>Therefore, the Australian War Council, on a basis of complete political cohesion, has taken the initiative. ' It is demonstrative of thewisdom associated with the establishment of the council that on this question complete agreement was' reached. </para>
                    <para>Let us have no more talk about the efficiency of the machinery which is already in existence -for dealing with industrial disputes. I deeply regret that statements have been made to the effect that workers go on strike and do serious things in this period of national emergency merely for the sake of doing them, or holding up the war effort. The Government must realize that the war has created new conditions in industry. By way of illustration, I point out that factories to undertake the manufacture of materials required in the war effort have been erected or are in operation in districts where no such establishments stood or were in operation a year ago. Many of the men employed in these industrial undertakings are obliged to travel long distances daily to and from their homes, and their fares amount in some cases to as much as 12s 6d. a week. As the Government desired them to work in those industries," they do not intend to run the risk of being compelled to pay the 12s. 6d. a week out of their own pockets. Furthermore, they do notpropose to wait until all the  circumlocutory  processes associated with the filing and hearing of a plaint before the. Arbitration Court have been completed. Before they start work, or so soon as they discover the true situation, they demand a guarantee that they will not be called upon personally to take from the family breakfast table the means with which to defray these heavy transport charges. Admittedly, such situations are new, and Ministers could not have been expected. to anticipate them; but what the Govern-r ment can be expected to do, and what the Advisory War Council has agreed to do, is' to establish machinery for dealing more expeditiously with workers' complaints. When that is done, members of the Opposition will be prepared, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> has done, to ask the men not to strike but to avail themselves of that machinery and go on with the job, confident that their difficulties will be adequately dealt with. That i3 all that the Labour party asks. But if I were to read to thousands of workers engaged in war industries that portion of the Governor-General's Speech relating to industrial disturbances and- told them that that was the language which- the Government put into  His  Excellency's, mouth, I should be merely, trailing the Government's coat, and inflaming the passions of my people. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ernest</inline> Bevin, Minister for Labour in the British Government, stated that he was asking his  people to make sacrifices and to do thingswhich they had never previously been called upon to undertake. He added that the workers in Britain were responding, nobly to the call. Incidentally, no one can say that Australians have not' responded nobly to the call to arms and to work. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.- Bevin</inline> contended that because the workers of Great Britain had so nobly answered his appeal for cooperation he had to be sure that no person in the community would make a profit out of their sacrifices. The Commonwealth Government has to meet a similar position, and it will not succeed in doing soif it places in  His  Excellency's mouth such provocative statements as the one which I have quoted. </para>

                    when referring to the cost of living, made- certain remarks of which the Opposition entirely approves. For example, he declared that wages never catch up with rising prices. I hope that he will remember that assertion, because we shall confront him with it .  later if legislation which will not assist wages to overtake prices should be introduced. Whereas prices go up in the lift, wages walk very slowly and tediously up the stairway. But so soon as a slump occurs, the wages of the toilers, not prices, fall quickly. I ask
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline>
                    not to allow the booklet issued by Professor Copland, or any statements which emerge from the office of the Prices Commissioner, to deceive him. On such matters he should keep an open mind. In some quarters, it has been stated that the prices of food and clothing, compared with the inflated prices of similar commodities in other countries, have risen by only 1.9 per cent. Such comparisons mean nothing. Nobody knows better than the housewives of Australia, particularly the wives of the workers, that to talk about a rise of only 1.9 per cent. in the cost of living since the outbreak of war is to insult their intelligence and their knowledge of facts that daily come painfully under their notice. It is all very well to take a selected few commodities and rig figures in order to make them look convincing.

                        <para>- Does the Minister contend that lollies are not an article of consumption? If the Minister gave his children½d. to spend at the school tuck-shop at lunch time, he would quickly learn how they came crying to their mother that they received only two peppermint lollies for the money whereas previously they obtained four. The Minister interjected " What about the price of sugar?" The fact that the price of sugar, unlike that of other commodities, has not been increased, is because the price is fixed by  the Queensland Government. The Commonwealth Government, to its credit,has supported that control by renewing the sugar agreement. In that way the Commonwealth Government has assisted the Queensland sugar industry, and for that we who come from Queensland are grateful. Although the retail price of sugar has not been increased, it would be difficult to find an Australian housewife who could say that the price of almost every other household commodity has not increased. Before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> indulged in a peroration which was a eulogy of myself he congratulated the Government upon the establishment of the Australian Advisory War Council. </para>

                <para>SenatorCOLLINGS. - Yes, as a second thought. The honorable senator went on to say that he hoped that the action of the Labour party in that respect was indicative of greater co-operation by that party in Australia's war effort. There cannot be any greater co-operation in Australia's war effort by the members of the Labour party in this chamber, or in the House of Representatives, or in fact by all sections of the Australian people than has already been manifested. The Prime Minister has made that admission, and honorable senators opposite know that my statement is true. There is no disunity in Australia's war effort. In every direction there has been complete co-operation, and since the declaration of war the representatives of the people in this Parliament, and the workers of Australia, from whose ranks the fighting men and those who are working in our factories and in our mines are drawn, have shown a strong desire to assist in every way. The Prime Minister has said that the support received from the workers has been wonderful. The members of the Opposition in both branches of this legislature have honoured the promise made at the outbreak of hostilities that they would not impede the passage of war legislation or oppose the appropriation of money essential for the prosecution of the war. That statement by the representatives of the Opposition, is one with which the Australian people are well acquainted. </para>
                <para class="block">On behalf of the Opposition in this chamber and in the House of Representatives, I repeat that there will be no lack of co-operation so far as we are concerned, but we expect from the Government the same degree of co-operation, that we have extended to it. </para>

                <para>In introducing the budget for 1940-41 in the House of Representatives to-day, the Treasurer (Mr.Fadden) said that it was his unfortunate task to introduce  a  revenue budget of £150,000,000. The financing of a war-time budget of this magnitude necessitates taxation proposals which represent the heaviest financial impost ever placed upon the people of Australia. An economic review of the year shows that a somewhat adverse position following the outbreak of war resulted in some increase of unemployment and a decline of normal business activity. This situation was effectively dealt with by the Government's policy in refraining from increased taxation and. in stimulating economic activity in conjunction with the diversion of our resources from civil to war purposes. Civil employment has increased since the outbreak of war by80,000 or by about 4 per cent., despite large enlistments in the various forces. Increased prices for  our primary products and the improved position of employment has contributed to the increase of om- national income by more than 9 per cent., from £788,000,000 in 1938-39 to £863,000,000 in 1939-40. The Government's policy of low interest rates has been followed by a decrease averaging 1 per cent, of the yield »on Government securities, combined with a reduction of rates on  treasury-bills,  bank deposits and overdrafts. Price control, in which the business world has co-operated, continues to operate successfully in preventing profiteering, and has restricted the increase in the " all-items " index of retail prices to less than 5 per cent. </para>
                <para>Honorable senators will remember that the tentative budget of September, 1939, was followed by revised estimates in November, 1939. It was not surprising that actual results for- 1939-40 differed in some important respects from the revised estimates. On the revenue side, customs and excise realized £53,825,000, an increase of £8,465,000 over the November estimate. This result was mainly caused by the unexpected restoration of overseas trade, by importers placing heavy orders in anticipation of future difficulties of supply, and the fact that import restrictions did not become effective for several months. Other, items, excluding the self-balancing flour tax, resulted in. a net improvement of £2,620,000, mainly income tax £1,530,000 and sales tax £776,000. </para>
                <para>Defence and war expenditure from revenue was estimated at £13,780,000 and, in addition, Parliament appropriated for this purpose an' additional £9,000,000 later in the year. The actual charge on the budget was £24,283,000, which, with £28,S14,000 from Loan Fund and £2,017,000 from Trust Fund, brought the total, expenditure- on defence and war services to £55,114,000. Of this amount, £45,229,000 was expended in Australia and £9,885,000 overseas. The year closed with excess receipts of £2,92S,000, which Parliament will be asked shortly to appropriate for war expenditure this year. During 1939-40, two public loans were floated on the- Australian market, both of which: were fully subscribed. The first, for £18,000,000,' was issued in March, 1940, at par, with interest at 3$ per cent, for five years or 3| per cent, for ten to sixteen years. Of this sum, about £S,000,000 was for defence purposes aud the balance for public works of the Commonwealth and the States. The second, in May, 1940, of £20,000,000 issued at par, with interest at 2-J per cent, for five years or 3^ per cent, for 10-16 years, was solely, for war purposes. The Commonwealth. Bank in conjunction with the trading banks also provided a special loan- in December, 1939, of £12,000,000, of which £2,000,000 was for defence works of low priority and the balance for works and other purposes "of the Commonwealth and States. There has been, a valuable response by the public to the war savings certificate campaign, resulting in the purchase by the 30th June, 1940, of war savings certificates to the face value of- £7,636,000. This figure has since been raised to over £15,000,000. Interest-free loans by the citizens of Australia for war purposes, had reached £3,864,000 by the 30th June, 1940, and the- total' has since reached' £5,100,000. In addition, gifts for war purposes now total £585,000, and these patriotic efforts by the people  of Australia are greatly appreciated by the Government. During the year, £11,041,000  was provided by the National Debt Sinking Fund for debt redemption, of which- £4,934,000 was on account of the Commonwealth and £6,107,000 on account of the States. For the current year, a total of £13,000,000- will be available. The aggregate Australian public debt increased by £46,031,000 during 1939-40. The increase of £38,076,000 on account of the Commonwealth was practically all for war purposes, and the balance of £7,955,000 was on account of the States. </para>
                <para>Turning to the year 1940-41, we find that the estimated total revenue based on rates of taxation in force prior to May, 1940, is about £105,000,000. The increased taxes imposed in May last should produce additional revenue of approximately £14,000,000, making the estimated total for 1940-41 on rates now in force £1.19,000,000. Customs and excise revenue is estimated at £48,800,000 against receipts last year of £53,800,000. This allows for a. substantial fall compared with last year's abnormal results and for the full effect of the restrictions on imports from n'on-sterling countries. On the other hand, 'allowance has been made for the increased, duties imposed in May last.  Income tax is expected to produce £20,750,000, an increase' of £4,000j000, whilst sales tax is estimated at £17,00.0,000, an- increase of £5,000,000. For land tax, £l-,500,000 of additional receipts is- expected.- . - These increases reflect the increased' rates imposed last May.- ; The restrictions on- imports imposed up to the' 1st' October resulted in the prohibition of imports "valued iii 1938-39 at £11,000,000. Rationing of certain goods and' restrictions on imports not specifically prohibited have assisted in the decided reduction of the drain on non-sterling exchange. Notwithstanding the savings in dollars already effected, the pressure' on the ' Empire's resources may well need further relief. </para>
                <para>In reviewing the estimated expenditure for 1940-41, apart from defence and war, it should be noted that improved conditions during the past year are reflected in the- smaller increase of £641,000 in invalid and old-age pensions, which are expected to cost £17,100,000. An additional £90,000 is provided for the valuable work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, whilst £29,200 is included for the establishment of the new legation in Japan. There has not been sufficient time to provide for expenditure of the new Department of Labour and National Service, which will be included later in Supplementary Estimates. </para>
                <para>For public works of a civil character provision is made for. £5,596,000, against £4,976,000 expended in . 1939-40. These amounts include £2,000,000 and £1,883,000  respectively . for Post Office works from loan fund. Civil aviation works are expected to cost £763,000, including £175,000; from trust account. </para>
                <para>Defence ' works estimated to cost' £21,000,000,' which are included in thewar programme, are being carried out in co-operation with- the States, in  accordance  with the plan instituted by the Loan Council. - </para>
                <para>In addition to' the total works expenditure, for 1940-41, which is estimated at £30,000,000, other works have been approved, mainly connected with internal transport services which would be essential in the event of serious disturbance of our coastal trade. These works, es'timated to cost £6,600,000  during the next two years, will be shared by the Commonwealth and the States. " The Government has' adopted the recommendation of " the Commonwealth Grants Commission, under which "the special grant' to South Australia will be £1,000,000, to" Western Australia, £650,000 and to tasmania, £400,000. The total is £30,000 more than last year, representing an increase of ,£5,000- to South Australia and £55.000 to Western Australia, with a reduction of £30,000 in the case of Tasmania. </para>
                <para> It should be borne in mind that the grant to Western Australia for 1939-40 is a net figure after deducting an advance of £136,000 in 1937-3S for drought relief. The normal figure for 1939-40 was, therefore, £731,000, in comparison with which the grant this year shows a reduction of £81,000. . </para>
                <para>The budget includes the payment of £150,000 to the States for encouragement of the gold-mining industry, and provision is also made for the estimated loss of £750,000- on the Apple and Pear Acquisition Scheme, which was guaranteed by the Government. </para>
                <para>The total civil expenditure from revenue is estimated at £84,853,000, which, deducted from an estimated revenue of £13 9,000,000 based on existing rates of taxation, leaves approximately £34,000,000 available for defence and war purposes. </para>
                <para>Following on the establishment of the Australian Wheat Board and the conferences between' Commonwealth and State Ministers, the Government has now adopted a war-time plan, which will be authorized under National Security Regulations, for the stabilization of the wheat industry. Commencing with the 1941-42 harvest, the guarantee provides for 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.h. for bagged wheat, on a marketed crop not exceeding 140,000,000 bushels. Although no provision is necessary in this year's budget, there will be considerable financial responsibility in future years. </para>
                <para>Relief to rural producers for drought relief  in the mainland States has been approved by the Commonwealth Government by way of special loans to farmers for sustenance and operation advances. The States will share as follows: - New South Wales, £750,000; Victoria, £600,000; Queensland, £250,000.; South Australia, £600,000; and Western Australia, £570,000; a total of £2,770,000. Repayments by the States will he by four annual instalments commencing after three years. The Commonwealth will meet the full interest for the first year and half the interest for the next six. years. I turn now to the task of financing the enormous increase of ourwar obligations, which are estimated at £143,000,000 in Australia and £43,000,000 overseas, making a total of £186,000,000.

                        <para>. - I direct the attention of the Minister concerned to recent happenings on the wharves at Brisbane. Numbers of men have interviewed me and stated that, following the adoption of gestapo methods, they have been dismissed from the wharves at Brisbane: They- and others have been dismissed on information supplied to the authorities by spies. I recognize that in war time essential industries on our wharves and elsewhere must be safeguarded against the subversive activities of disloyal persons, but I am convinced that numbers of innocent men have been deprived, of their livelihood. Unfortunately, these victims of the existing system have no redress, and although in many instances the action taken may be justified, in other cases jealousy and other unworthy motives are the underlying causes of information being laid against them. Honorable senators will understand that a man who is thrown out of his employment in this way cannot possibly obtain further work on the wharves, and, in consequence, he may be unemployed for several months. Innocent men should not be called upon to suffer in this way; methods should be devised to safeguard them. Under existing conditions the dismissed man does-not know who has laid the information against him, and I understand that he has no right of appeal. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to know that a right of appeal exists. Men whom I know personally and believe to be loyal citizens  are among those who have been dismissed, and I have been impelled to take up their cases. Others, who are not known to me personally, have approached me to intervene on their behalf, but in such instances I have not felt that I could support their applications for reinstatement in their previous employment.- One such person saw me. recently, and although I believe that the story which he told me was true I could hot be certain that the facts were as he stated because I did not know him personally. I know however that he had been out of work, for over two months. If he was guilty of the charge that was laid against him he deserved dismissal, but if he was innocent, justice should be done to him. Some of the dismissed men have been reinstated in their employment on the wharves following, representations by men, like myself, who have known them for a number of years and have testified to their loyalty. I believe that thereshould be some means under our law whereby men against whom informationsare laid should have an opportunity to meet their accusers face- to face. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell me that means have been devised to obtain justice for these men. </para>

                        <para>. - The treatment of men employed on the. wharves throughout Australia has been under consideration by the Government recently. In the early days of the war it was consideredadvisable that any person who was likely to engage in subversive activities should be prevented from working on the waterfront, or be in any way associated with work which would allow him to engage 'in acts of sabotage. Honorable senators will agree that in the interests of public safety such action was necessary. The Government therefore decided to institute a system of permits in connexion with employment on the water front, or in, connexion with shipping in any way. The rule was that, in the event of a charge being made by a reputable person against any man working on the wharves, the  Deputy  Director of Navigation in. the State should be advised, in which case the man's permit to work would be withdrawn. In order however that no injustice should be done, dismissed men have been given the right to appeal to the Minister for the Interior. As Minister,. I have dealt with a number of these appeals; some have been upheld; somehave been, dismissed on the evidence submitted; others are -still outstanding. In a few cases I.have sought further evidence before coming to a decision. In addition, I have been interviewed on a number of occasions by the federal secretary of the Waterside Workers Union and members of the executive of that union, who have expressed dissatisfaction with the present methods of handling wharf permits. I frankly admit that they made out a good case. Accordingly, I have submitted their, representations to cabinet with a view to a more satisfactory method of dealing with these permits, being evolved. The Government recognizes that" the withdrawal of a man's permit to work on the wharf may deprive him not only of his usual employment but also of any other means of obtaining a livelihood. Ithas no desire to treat unjustly any innocent person who is legitimately employed on the water front.At this stage, I can only say that the matter is under consideration by the Government, and that a new 'scheme has been drawn up' which I believe will be satisfactory to the men engaged onthe water front. Honorable senators will agree that action must be taken to Safeguard the nation against the subversive activities of disloyal persons. </para>
