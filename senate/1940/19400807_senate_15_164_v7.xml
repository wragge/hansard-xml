                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - On the motion for the adjournment of the Senate yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> drew attention to an apparent defect in the National Security (Fair Rents) Regulations through the lapsing, in December last, of a provision that house rents were not to increase beyond those which were in operation on the 31st August,  1939.  At the Premiers Conference in September last, when price control was discussed, it was agreed that the control of rents should be undertaken by the States.Some of the States, at that time, were not in a position to take effective control and the Commonwealth gazetted the National Security (Fair Rents) Regulations empowering the State governments to establish machinery for controlling rents during the war. As some delay might have occurred in setting up the necessary machinery, the regulations included a provision similar to that embodied in the early prices regulations that rents were to be held at  the level of the 31st August. This provision expired on the 31st December, by which time it was anticipated that the full machinery of control by the States would bo in operation. The regulations were recently amended, at the request of one State, to cover the rent of factories, and, if further defects are found, the Commonwealth will gladly consider any request by the States to remedy them. To continue indefinitely a provision fixing rents at the level of the 31st August would be to take the control out of the hands of the States, and to leave no ground for adjustment of rent at the request of either landlord or tenant. The States, however, have full powers to investigate all matters relating to rents and to fix rents. </para>

                        <para>. -  We are assembled again under the mental tension of war, an intensified tension because the portents have worsened over the intervening weeks since the last meeting of the Senate. I desire to emphasize by reiteration Labour's attitude to the existing Government. It can be summarized very briefly in these words : " Full co-operation in its war effort ". I emphasize also Labour's willingness to accept the most complete responsibility for the conduct of this Commonwealth during this period of unprecedented emergency. By that I mean that we stand for an immediate appeal to the electors, while we definitely refuse to participate in a national government in which those comprising the Labour section of it would be sworn to secrecy and would be sharers of responsibility with no pretence of equality of power. I summarize that statement by saying that we do not propose touse the old pack of cards. As the Premier of Queensland said recently we ask for a new pack, a new shuffle and a new deal. I make these statements of Labour's attitude briefly and definitely with the full sense of the responsibility for what I am saying. </para>

                    <para class="block">Senate yesterday, I say that it was an uninspiring statement read in an uninspiring way. I am not Warning the Minister for that. I know that there was only one copy available and that it was thrust into the hands of the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> for delivery in the House of Representatives at the eleventh hour, and even later into the hands of the Minister who had to deliver it in this chamber. I say in passing that I hope that yesterday was the last occasion on which we shall have a ministerial statement read and ended with a motion that the paper be printed without copies of the statement being available to members of this chamber. To-day the performance has been much more satisfactory. I exonerate the Minister from blame because I know exactly what happened, but I asked him yesterday to let me have sufficient copies for my colleagues. He agreed to do that. We got them five minutes ago. We have enough staff here to do the job of the Government as it should be done, and we should have had those statements, as promised, the first thing this morning. </para>

The point I make is that some servants of this Government fell down badly on a simple job.

We should have been supplied with proofs of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the Minister's speech last night. We did not want corrected pulls.

                    <para>I am induced to make these remarks because I take exception to the manner in which the statement was prepared as well as the manner in which it was delivered. The Minister, I understand, had not had an opportunity to study it. Obviously, the Government thinks it does not matter how things are done in the Senate. The statement read yesterday by the Minister was a reflection upon the intelligence of honorable senators and an insult to the people whom we represent in this chamber. It was a valueless jumble of alleged news, practically every word of which we have either read in the press or heard in wireless broadcasts. Yet it appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> with the magniloquent title " Ministerial statement on International Affairs ". If any honorable senator can tell me or if the Minister who delivered the statement can tell rae that it added any thing whatever, one solitary item, to the information already in possession of honorable senators who read the daily press or listen to the radio news, all I can say is that I have not been able to discover it. 1 " swotted " the statement last night in an attempt to get some satisfaction from it but I could not do so. I do not intend to read much of the document because there is so very little in it, but it begins by saying- </para>

                    <para>In making these comments, I wish to be fair to myself and to every member of the Opposition, and I also desire, to be fair to the Government. I say without any reservations, mental or otherwise, that no member of the Opposition fails to understand the immensity of the task confronting the Government. We should understand the responsibility that rests upon Ministers, because the Opposition of to-day may be the government of tomorrow. The Opposition realizes that a great deal must he done during wartime which cannot he blazoned forth to the world, and it has given proof that, in the main, it has not desired to embarrass the Government. The nature of the questions addressed to Ministers during the last few months supports my statement. Therefore, there is nothing that the Government should feel obliged to withhold from members of this Parliament. The war has been in progress for a year, hut we have never been told anything more valuable about it than the uninspiring statement which we are now discussing. Surely honorable senators on both sides of the chamber have sufficient pride to demand that no information regarding the war be kept from them. The Opposition asks the Government to hold a secret session of this Parliament. If this request be refused, the only reason for the refusal would be that the Government is afraid to trust honorable senators and members of the House of Representatives. The information that could be supplied to honorable senators at a secret session would at least provide a background of knowledge, and honorable senators on both sides could be relied upon not to disclose information which should rightly be withheld. We should know the best and the worst of what has happened. If there be a senator on either side who cannot be trusted to tell his electors what it would be safe for him to say, and .to withhold what he knew could not safely be said, he should not be a member of this chamber. The Government is afraid of a secret session, because it is not willing to trust all or some of us. </para>
                    <para>I shall give an illustration of the kind of esteem in which responsible Ministers hold members of this Parliament. With what I consider to he impudence and silliness, they have issued instructions to the three arms of the Defence Forces that they must nol; enlist the services of a member of Parliament to voice their grievances, either here or in the House of Representatives. That was a rotten and disgusting thing to do, as well as an impudent assumption of authority. I stated in a letter to one Minister, and I repeat it here, that there are 583,321 male and female electors in Queensland. In October, 1937, that number of electors was on the rolls. Every one of those electors has the right to call on my services and the services of the five other senators from Queensland, if and when he or she requires them. No Minister should tell me that I cannot be trusted to do my job properly, and that my electors must not appeal to me, if they want my advice- </para>

He prefaced his statement by saying that for three months he had been a soldier, and had been unable to make such statements, but that that night he would speak as a senator. </para>

                                remarks impressed me a great deal, particularly when I read the order implying that no senator in this National Parliament could be trusted to do his duty by his electors for fear he might upset somebody in a position of temporary responsibility - a responsibility not always wisely exercised. On behalf of myself and my colleagues from Queensland, I ask the Minister to remember that we get closer to the people in regard to complaints than do Ministers and other honorable senators opposite. The people look to members of the Opposition as those who are prepared to take the responsibility of voicing their legitimate grievances. The people say " The Opposition will take our complaints up, and will try to obtain for us a square deal." I do not suggest that all of their complaints are justifiable. I suppose that, of the hundreds of grievances placed before me, I have turned down one half of them, but I am to be the judge of that matter.

                    <para>I suggest to the Leader of the Senate, and to his colleagues on the front bench - and I do so in a serious vein - that a definite Australian policy is needed in regard to the war and all that pertains to it. We need an "Australia First" policy. The time has arrived when nothing should be done in connexion with this struggle which has not for its immediate objective the saving of this country from the disaster of invasion and all that that implies. I am prepared to go to the electors on a defence policy which envisages the preservation of the safety of Australia as the job of an Australian government. We are entitled to know a number of things regarding the war, whether we have a secret session or not. We have a right to know what the Government has told the Government of the United Kingdom about Australia's needs and desires, and Australia's opinion as to the duty and obligation of the Government of the United Kingdom regarding its activities and its relations with other governments, particularly those in the 'South Pacific. Honorable senators opposite say that there are certain facts which must not be disclosed to the enemy. Of course, information which would be of advantage to the enemy must not be disclosed ; but the Government should hold a secret session of this Parliament at which we could be told exactly what has been done. We should have been informed in the statement which was delivered yesterday of the recommendations made to the United Kingdom Government with respect to the closing of the Burma-road. There could be no reason whatever why the text of the communications was not made available because the enemy knew of it and was actually a party to it. Information on that and similar subjects should be made available to this Parliament. The statements which have been made are practically valueless. We know that they are not the truth. This most recent statement from a responsible Minister was valueless. We know that it was not true. </para>

                            <para>- I did not use the word " untrue " in an offensive sense I meant that it was not all of the truth; I did not mean that it was deliberately false. Either in a secret or in an open session, we should be told all of the truth, and nothing but the truth. How can we do our duty to the nation unless we know what is actually occurring* I do not know what my colleagues think of the situation as it develops from day to day; but I can say most definitely that I refuse to read the public press on the international situation. I look at the headlines and then pass on, because it is all so much  "  hooey  ". Day after day we are told things which are an insult to one's intelligence. In every engagement reported apparently nothing of importance occurs. We read that buildings are blown up and perhaps a hoy is injured. Other reports are to the effect that everything is just as we would like it to he, and that the other fellow got it " in the neck ". 1 refuse to read that kind of rubbish. I again protest against the press reports that come under my purview. Had I had my way - perhaps I had better not say what I intended because I do not believe in dictatorships - at the outbreak of war I would have closed up every newspaper office in the country and allowed the Government to publish its own official paper in which it could tell the people just what it wished them to know. </para>

                            <para>- It would depend on the government in power. We have a right to know what the Censor is doing. I should like to know why the authorities are engaging men and women, who have no responsibility, who go about telling lies about people against whom they have a grudge. In conjunction with  the honorable member for Brisbane (Mir. George Lawson) I took up the case of a man of enemy origin who has been in Australia for 43 years, during 42 of which he has been a naturalized British su'bject. This man was deprived of his permit to work on the wharves. To a degree that was all right, because instructions had been issued by the Navigation Department that no person of enemy origin was to possess a permit to work on the wharves. But this man's permit was withdrawn because it was said that he was a menace to the community and should not be allowed to work on the wharves. I have known the man for 26 years - the honorable member for Brisbane has known him for 30 years - as a faithful and loyal Australian.  His  youngest son is serving in the Australian Imperial Force, his youngest daughter is married to a police constable in North Queensland, and the other members of his family are of the highest possible repute. The first alleged fact on which action was taken was a deliberate and wilful lie. It was said that he was interned during the last war. There is not a shadow of foundation for that statement. He is a member of the Australian Labour party and is as loyal a British subject as could be found anywhere.  His  permit was taken from him because of a statement, not by a responsible officer in government employ, but by a man who worked on the wharf, and whose objection to him was of a personal nature. If we had a secret session of Parliament, I would have an opportunity to tell all I know about the censorship and of the cruel things that are being done under the present system. I am not suggesting that we should dispense with censorship. I have taken up some cases in all sincerity and in some instances have been astounded when I have found that I was on. the wrong track. If we are to have a censorship system, it must be organized and operated by men who have some standing in the community, and to whom is attached some measure of responsibility. </para>

                    <para>We have a right to know - we should have known long ago - exactly what the Government intends to do with respect to rationing of petrol. At the hands of this shilly-shallying Government, decisions, particularly with respect to many matters of national importance, are being altered daily. As a result of the pronouncement made some time ago that -the consumption of .petrol had to be reduced by one-third, many persons jacked up their cars and, in consequence, thousands of persons have been thrown out of employment. I am not suggesting that petrol should not bo rationed. From the first day on which I entered this Parliament as a representative of Queensland, the Opposition has been asking governments to conserve supplies of liquid fuel and to increase the quantity held in storage. On one occasion an ex-Minister for Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> said that oil could not he extracted economically from coal under the hydrogenation process, although we knew that this process was being successfully applied in Germany and at BillingtononTees in England. We were told that it was not a commercial proposition in Australia. In a national emergency, we are not concerned with whether it is or is not a commercial proposition, particularly when we realize that we are spending millions in our war effort. In the circumstances confronting us, something has to be done. The Queensland Government did not wait until Australia was faced with a shortage, but encouraged the establishment of a power-alcohol factory in northern Queensland, and later passed legislation which provided that every supplier of petrol had to mix <inline font-style="italic">21/2</inline> per cent. of power spirit with the petrol sold, which proportion has since been increased to  5  per cent. For years, the Opposition has been asking various governments to increase the production of fuel oil in Australia. Nothing will be achieved by waiting. Yesterday, I asked a question as to the policy of the Government with respect to gas producer units, and I was told most politely to-day that the information is not yet to hand. A junior clerk should have been able to obtain the information which should be available on the files. </para>
                    <para>We also have a right to know what the Government is doing with respect to profiteering, and whether the scheme to control prices is functioning satisfactorily. I know that the Government's proposal is a failure. </para>

                    <para>Profiteering in overtime should not he permitted. I do not for one moment suggest that all the people who are unemployed are capable of being put into skilled occupations, but I do say that every man who is able to perform a useful task in industry should be absorbed. It cannot bc denied that many thousands of men who are capable of taking their places in defence industries are now unemployed. My Queensland colleagues and I are constantly approached by men with all kinds of credentials seeking employment, but because of red tape, circumlocution and inadequate methods, no work is available for them and, as the result, their spirits are broken and their morale destroyed.

But despicable though that activity has been, it is nothing compared to the suggestion that because an election is pending, the people of Australia should not be told what are the Government's taxation proposals. The Government has enough money to carry on during the present year, and of course it would not be good political strategy to scare the people stiff on the eve of the poll.

                    <para>Australia's big, well-established companies carry large reserves, which have been saved from the profits of previous years. They are in their leading position to-day mainly because of these reserves, amounting to 50 per cent., 75 per cent. or even 100 per cent. of the issued capital. Reserves mean strength, and consequently capacity to pay further taxation; but by a paradox, these reserves become the means for avoiding further taxation. </para>
                    <para>Members of this chamber have a right to be given all available information as to taxation proposals. I do not think there is any need for a secret session in order that that information may be imparted. It will be of no advantage to the enemy if we are told all of the truth; we have a right to be told the truth. We of the Opposition have a right to demand that the Government should tell us what plans it is making to deal with post-war problems when they arise, and they will not be long in rising. Strange though it may seem, some post-war difficulties are already confronting us, and their effect will be intensified in the years to come in a way that makes people shudder to contemplate.

                    <para class="block">Government proposes to do about these problems, and as I have already said, we have a right to know when the Government intends to declare an "Australian policy ", not for war but for peace. When is the Government going to prepare the people for the realization that the world can never go back to the condition in which it was prior to the outbreak of war last September? The people have a right to know that, because from this war - unavoidably, I admit - a legacy of hate will be inflicted upon the world. In fact, it is being inflicted now. As I have already hinted, anybody who has a grudge against somebody else may have that person interned simply by sending an anonymous and unconfirmed message over the telephone, or by indulging in whispering. The legacy of hate from this war will extend far into the years to come unless the Government is prepared now to put forward some concrete ideas with regard to the kind of peace which it believes to be desirable and the kind of post-war world conditions which it is prepared to father or support. </para>
                    <para>I think I have given some indication of the immensity of the problems of the present, as well as those of the future, as we of the Opposition see them. I do not retract one word of what I said at the outset of my remarks. The Labour party will accept its full share of responsibility. We shall fully co-operate with the Government in its war effort, but we decline to accept the view that we must not be critical, so long as our criticism is confined to proper limits and is not such as to be beneficial to the enemy, if published abroad. If there is information to which we should have access, and which can be made available only by means of a secret session, then we ask that a secret session be held. The Opposition definitely refuses to take part in a national government unless, along with responsibility, it has full power. We definitely refuse to prolong the life of this Parliament under any pretence, or in any circumstances, and we are in favour of an immediate appeal to the electors so that they may be given an opportunity to decide what kind of government they want. We shall be satisfied with whatever verdict is given by the people. The MenziesCameronThorby Government has no  mandate from the electors, and there can be no excuse for any extension of the life of this Parliament. We are ready to go to our masters and I ask the Government to facilitate that process. </para>

                        <para>.- During the recess I travelled around Victoria a great deal. I found that the Government was commended for its decision to increase the strength of a home defence army by calling up the  20-25  years classes and permitting volunteers up to the age of  45  years to join the Militia. Satisfaction was also expressed at the formation of a volunteer home defence corps from amongst ex-service men. Nevertheless, there was a very decided expression of opinion that the Government had not gone far enough in organizing Australia's man-power not engaged in defence activities. Some scheme was needed which would embody the Returned Soldiers League Volunteer Home Defence Corps or would include every citizen able and willing to do some service. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The scheme I have in mind is that drafted by one of the municipalities in Victoria. I had the opportunity to peruse the replies .by scores of municipalities throughout Australia to a circular letter outlining that scheme. The comments were favorable. In almost every reply co-operation was promised, provided the scheme had the Government's approval. Obviously no such scheme could come into operation except" as an activity under the Defence Department. I understand that the official answer was that the idea had some merit in it, but was unfavorably entertained because it would not be practicable to organize and train on a satisfactory basis the whole nation in addition to organizing, training and equipping the existing forces. Nobody disputes the gigantic task confronting the Minister for ' the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street),</inline> particularly when at the outbreak of war his responsible officers had to start from scratch, so far as war equipment was concerned. Still, that is no reason why patriotic citizens ineligible for front-line home defence service should be discouraged. The scheme, as I read it, does not contemplate training every male citizen in the use of arms: That, is unnecessary except in certain isolated areas. The proposal is to organize the citizen population, so that in time of emergency they would not be stampeded by or be confused with a dozen different instructions. </para>
                    <para>The people to whom I spoke were not cranks or alarmists, but merely average Australias citizens with little knowledge of strategy or tactics. They are intelligent men who have correctly summed up the present war as one not entirely confined to the nation's armed forces. These men will not be satisfied until they feel they are recognized and doing something. The public is in the right frame of mind for action. Why does the Government hesitate to take the opportunity now to encourage the local authorities to work out, in collaboration with the defence authorities, a second line, or third line, if you like, home defence scheme which, if not required in the present crisis, will be useful in years to come ? Australia must not be so indifferent to its defence in the future as it has been in the past. </para>
                    <para>It is the present which concerns us. The whole world is in arms. Any day, dormant national ambitions may be aroused to decisive action. Britain's lone fight for existence may cause new enemies to feel that its position gives to them the opportunity to follow the lead of Italy, and without great danger to themselves gain new possessions and so expand their own power and influence. In such a situation, no country is in greater danger than our own. The very isolation, which has in the past been our greatest source of security, now becomes our greatest danger. With all its will to protect Australia, Great Britain is no longer in such a position as would justify us depending upon the Mother Country to keep us safe from invasion. We must depend on our own resources. But those resources cannot be utilized to the fullest degree without the complete organization of the whole community. It is not sufficient to rely on the resources of the Commonwealth Government alone; the whole machinery of government - Commonwealth, State and local instrumentalities - must be utilized to the utmost capacity to build up in the shortest possible time a system of national defence wherein  every man, in a time of emergency, can play an effective part in backing to the limit the army in the field. </para>
                    <para>There must be no thought of capitulation or compromise. If invasion comes, it must be a fight to the finish.For us the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Winston</inline> Churchill: "We shall fight on the beaches, fight on the landing grounds, fight in the streets, and fight in the hills ", have an even greater significance. No man, woman or child must be allowed to fall into the hands of the enemy. Livestock, foodstuffs and petrol supplies must be removed or destroyed well in advance of the invader. Auxiliary forces must be used to delay and harass the enemy so as to leave the field armies free to choose, as far as the circumstances allow, the best ground for giving battle. Necessarily, our field armies must be based on the large centres of population; necessarily, vast areas must be left unprotected by any army concentration. With an unorganized civilian population the greater part of Australia will become the happy hunting ground for raiding parties, which could be landed at localities remote from populous centres. The mere report that enemy troops had landed in unprotected areas along our coast would cause panic out of all proportion to their numbers. </para>
                    <para>How is such a position to be met? Our army cannot dissipate its strength by detaching small garrison forces to anticipate possible landings in non-vital areas. If the Army cannot do it, what then? There is only one answer - auxiliary civil forces must be organized to detain and harass the enemy. Such auxiliary forces can readily be formed by utilizing the resources of the State and local governing bodies, co-ordinated and controlled by the Defence Department. To-day the defence of Britain includes over 1,000,000 men as auxiliary units to the fighting forces, who number about 4,000,000 men. Australia has 2,000,000 males of military age, 18 to 60 years, of whom, possibly, 1,000,000 are, or will be, in uniform or workmen's overalls. What of the remainder? Is there no niche for them in our home defence scheme? In dire need, scarcely any one could be regarded as indispensable in his ordinary occupation outside essential defence activities. Preparation should begin now for that contingency. Surely we have learnt something from the fate of Germany's victims, and shall not wait till the enemy is at our gate. </para>
                    <para>I believe that every honorable senator has been supplied with a copy of the draft scheme to which I have already referred. Under these proposals eachof the thousands of municipalities and shires throughout the Commonwealth would organize an auxiliary home defence unit, the whole scheme to be controlled and directed by the Defence Department with the co-operation of State governments. Every member of each unit need not necessarily be armed, since fighting is not the sole function in every scheme of national defence. This force would at least be organized and disciplined, and would have some knowledge of the part civilians would be required to play in supporting the field army, and depriving the enemy of foodstuffs and other essential supplies. The value of the men embraced in this scheme, in taking the place of able-bodied young soldiers in the multitudinous duties behindthe forward area, is obvious. Helpless women, the aged, the infirm and children could be withdrawn from threatened areas and taken care of by the governing bodies in safer localities, able-bodied men taking their places at the point of danger. Unless some recognized defence organization of this kind, controlled by the Defence Department, be established, oncean invader appears, whether the Government likes it or not, nothing will prevent the virile men of this country from forming themselves into guerilla bands. Such men may be liable to be shot on sight. The Government's duty to the men of this country is to do all in its power to avoid the possibility of such a condition. </para>
                    <para>Whilst we all hope to be spared the horrors of invasion, we must have the courage to face the fact that it is now more than a possibility. Whether this or any other scheme be adopted, it is imperative that the full man -power of the nation, by one means or another, be marshalled to meet whatever fate awaits us. The problems of evacuation of the civil population in areas likely to be invested by the enemy, come within the scope of such a scheme, so does the preparation of emergency landing grounds. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> doubt the military authorities have made plans as far as certain districts are concerned. It is very disconcerting, however, that these plans are kept a dark secret. One can only suppose that the intention is to keep them so until the last moment, but then, haste and unfamiliarity would make them more difficult to carry out. Surely prior knowledge of such arrangements can have no possible value to an enemy'* Foreknowledge by the people most concerned would obviate most of the panic and confusion which would ensue were an emergency suddenly sprung upon them. </para>
                    <para>There are over 1,000 local governing authorities throughout Australia with an annual revenue approaching £30,000,000, with trained staffs and intimate local knowledge; but up to the present  they  are as much in the dark as anybody else. After nearly a year of war not one communication, j am informed, has passed between the Defence Department and the municipalities. Cannot the Government realize that lack of trust begets lack of trust, that the best wa;&gt; to rally the people behind it, is to give responsible bodies work to do, commensurate with their resources and capabilities? Most people, if they think of it at all, regard evacuation as getting themselves and their families to a vague place, generally referred to as " somewhere inland ". Perhaps they give some thought to what means of transport they would use, but they leave it at that. This, of course, hardly scratches the subjectProperty must be guarded against thieves and vandals, until the last moment for possible re-occupation; petrol supplies must be destroyed if it be impossible to remove same beforehand. How man\ service station owners know how to destroy their stocks in a hurry? Byways to evacuees' destinations must bo thought out so as to leave the highways free for army use. Evacuees must have particulars of what is to be taken with them, when means of transport is limited. </para>
                    <para>People without cars, the helpless and the stupid have to be cared for; supplies of food must be taken, and what is left behind destroyed. Public utilities nol  required  for the fighting services must be dismantled, and sheep and cattle driven off or killed. Who is to supervise all this work - personnel from hastily raised units, or from the local authorities whose daily work brings them into contact with the people affected? The strength of the field army must not be frittered away on such duties. On the journey, evacuees must be shepherded and controlled, and temporary shelter of some sort provided for those who travel by road. One assumes that those who travel by train would he left in the competent and kindly hands of the railway men, who are best fitted to do the job. The most difficult problems arise when the evacuees reach their destination. Who is to provide shelter, food and occupation? The vast majority would be without financial resources, whilst people from the urban areas would be unable easily to adapt themselves to the changed conditions. Problems such as these can  best  be handled by the local authorities who are familiar with the resources of the districts and the people amongst whom the evacuees must live temporarily. </para>
                    <para>The present war has shown us that defence is more than a conflict between two armies. It is a different war altogether from, previous campaigns. Problems beyond the scope of officials in the Defence Department have to be solved. Who can best tackle those problems? The local authorities, both city and country of course. To succeed, the personnel embodied in any such auxiliary defence duties must he recognized under an official emergency organization. One is already in existence, namely, the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia Volunteers Home Defence Corps, which at present is restricted to ex-service men, organized on a military basis. The scheme to which I have been alluding envisages a far wider scope, and embraces all volunteer mala persons who are ineligible for enrolment in the front line fighting services. Scattered throughout Australia are thousands of middle-aged rifle club men. Though they were sworn in five years ago as Militia reservists, they probably are now too old for acceptance in that force. The majority possess their own rifles, and so would he a decided acquisition to any scheme. Tho merging of a'l  latent patriotic personnel in the existing volunteer corps of ex-service men would provide the ideal organization. I suggest that the Government investigate this possibility, and so swing behind it a greater public war effort. </para>

                            <para>- Tes. That indicates to me that, in the view of the Government, the war is not a major issue so far as the Senate is concerned. It indicates to me also an indirect way by which attempts are being made to discredit the Commonwealth Parliament, and so pave the way to establish in Australia a totalitarian state similar to that which, exists in Germany. If there were the interest in the proceedings of Parliament that some honorable senators would have us believe exists, we would be treated with much more consideration and be given a reasonable opportunity to consider statements made by the Ministers. Also the attendance in this chamber would be better than it is. There is a saying that there are times when we have to wait patiently for the hard school of disillusionment to act when our reasoning fails. It seems to me that that applies to the Commonwealth Parliament as well as to people outside. Possibly it may be in Australia, as it has been overseas, some disaster must occur involving the loss of thousands of valuable lives and the destruction of millions of pounds worth of property before there will he that interest taken in the war that is warranted and is necessary. It seems to me that 'both by the way in which members are treated and the statement itself has been read that the attempt is being made to convey the impression to all that everything is all right, that we really have nothing to worry about, that the Government is fully capable of doing all ti at is required in. order to develop the defences of this country to the degree necessary. For our information a document has been issued entitled: "What is Australia Doing? War Facts and Figures ". " With the compliments of C. C. Dawson, Commonwealth Publicity Officer, Canberra ". Most of its contents is mere " eyewash " ; and perhaps dangerous. The impression sought to be created is that everything is all right. In the absence of any really worth-while information from the_ Government, reports that we receive from' authentic sources indicate that in the sources connected with the manufacture of munitions everything is far from being all right. It is dangerous to try to con,vey that impression, and it is something which possibly the Government may live to regret - to regret that it did not take Parliament into its confidence and tell it those things that it could tell, with the object of provoking constructive, even if hostile, discussion, so that suggestions might be made and proposals submitted whereby the whole position might be improved. Instead of that, we have this conspiracy of silence, this conspiracy of make-believe, this conspiracy of conveying false impressions. </para>

                    <para>Now I come to the statement itself. I have not had the opportunity to study it as critically as it deserves, hut I should say, after the first reading of it, that it is a colourless document, simply a re-hash of what has appeared in the press, and couched in very general terms. The issue  of the statement itself suggests to me that the Minister responsible has said to the junior clerk, " Prepare something on the war for the Senate," and the junior clerk has said, " What shall I say, sir ? ", with the reply, " Anything you like; anything is good enough for the members of the Opposition and the Senate." That is what it appears to be. It is a carelessly framed word structure couched in general terms which may mean anything or everything. It does not give us anything that would provoke, initiate or help to initiate intelligent, constructive discussion which should take place in a chamber such as this. We have not been told all of the facts. In these circumstances we are forced to rely on our own judgment, and what I am about to say represents my judgment on the facts conveyed to me in reports which I  receive from men occupying prominent positions and well qualified to give me information. </para>
                    <para>As my leader has remarked, the Government has received every consideration from this side of the Senate. We have not asked leading questions about what it is doing. We have, in  addition,  given to it powers which are unprecedented. I questioned the wisdom of  giving  such powers, but in the opinion of the Labour movement it was considered that everything should be done to assist it. We have accepted the Government on its face value, and, in return, we are called to Canberra to discuss a perfectly innocuous statement such as this. The whole thing is a farce, a fraud. It is  misrepresenting  the whole position to the people of this nation upon whom we rely to provide the means by which this country can be defended. The Government is ignoring Parliament. It must be prepared to accept the consequences, and, in passing, I would remind it that none can escape the consequences of his acts. Although it may be considered smart politics to do this sort of thing, those who are responsible will not escape the consequences. There may be the disaster to which I referred, or there may bo justifiable resentment of the people expressed in terms which members of the Government will not forget so long as they live. In any case, that  reaction  or repercussion is bound to take place. The statement contains this declaration - </para>

                    <para>The wealthy interests in England are refraining from either lending or contributing money for the defence of that country. Established publications not identified with the radical or Communist movements, or with any alleged subversive organizations, are saying that morn must be done. Personally I do not think that more will be done, unless increased pressure is exerted by the people of England upon their government. Even what has been done would not have been achieved, had it not been for that pressure, and particularly for the disaster following the despatch of troops to th, continent of Europe. The Government of Great Britain has been forced to act, but, even to-day, action that could be taken is being avoided. I suggest that the reason for this is that there is a school of thought in England that would prefer making the best possible terms  with Hitler to facing the probable outcome of this war. That school of thought existed in France, and probably in every other country that has been conquered almost without serious resistance. lt says, in effect, " We have to make our choice between Hitlerism and a probable state of affairs arising in England similar to that prevailing in Russia ". Whilst that school of thought is afraid to express those opinions openly, it  i3  doing the next best thing which it regards as effective. It is withholding the essentials for a better and more formidable defence. </para>
                    <para>A similar school of thought is to be found in Australia. I base that opinion on the policy to which this Government is committed. Its policy is, as far as it is humanly practicable, to make this war, as was done in the last war, a payable business proposition for .the moneyed interests. I shall refer to a few figures to indicate what was done during the last war. In the publication entitled <inline font-style="italic">What is Australia Doing f</inline> the probable expenditure in connexion with the present war is set out under the heading "A £453,000,000 programme". This publication makes a comparison between the expenditure incurred during the last war and that expected during the present war, and it goes on to say - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It is interesting to compare the corresponding expenditure for the war and defence programme of the last war. For the five years of that war the corresponding expenditure was about £270,059,000. </para>

                    <para class="block">In reply to a question submitted to him on .the 8th December last, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> stated that the principal cost of the last war was £572,995,845, and that the interest paid amounted to £305,149,140. The point is that the interest cost °f *ne 'as* war exceeds considerably the cost of that war during five years, proving that it was made a gilt-edged proposition for the moneyed section, which is still drawing interest in respect of it. lit is clear, therefore, that interests in England which are holding up most effectively the defence preparations being made in Great Britain are responsible for a similar condition of affairs in Australia. This war has been in progress for nearly twelve months, and I suggest that the Government has had ample time to do a great deal more than it has done to prepare for defence.

                            <para>- That is a pertinent question. Even if that figure were reduced by one-half, the number of unemployed would be greater than it should be. According to the figures published in the press, approximately 1,500,000 persons in Great Britain are now unemployed. The paragraph published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper states that approximately £2,500,000,000 of capital is lying idle in Great Britain. Why are so many persons unemployed? It is because those who possess the capital cannot see a profitable way in which to invest it. If unemployed persons could be engaged on work which would show a profit, not one man or woman would be idle. The capitalists in England are not lending their money or giving it to the nation because they are afraid that after the war there may be repudiation of the nation's war debts and that they will not receive an adequate return of their capital. To them monetary interests are of greater importance than the welfare of the nation. A similar policy operates in this country. If this Government were not committed to a policy of private monopoly, ownership, and control of our financial resources, the capital now lying idle in Australia would </para>

                    <para class="block">Lave been used long ago and would have provided employment for those able and willing to contribute to the defence of the country. The reason why such a large number of persons in Great Britain are unemployed when the nation is at war is that it is unprofitable for " fifth columnists " to invest their capital. They would prefer Hitlerism or Fascism in Great Britain to a possible Russian form of government. Governments as well as individuals cannot escape the consequence of their acts. If an individual is careless or dishonorable in his financial transactions, he has to pay the penalty. A government which controls the affairs of the nation is in a similar position. The British Government cannot escape the consequences of its acts. If, as I suspect, negotiations are proceeding behind the back of the British Parliament to come to terms with Hitler, as was done in France, something serious is likely to happen. </para>

                            <para>- I would not be so foolish as to suggest that nothing has been done; but what has been accomplished has been under pressure from a section of the British people. I trust that similar pressure will be exerted in Australia. I admit that in England there are many thousands of capable and loyal men and women who are doing their best to direct the attention of the Government to the influence of financial interests upon the nation; but I am referring more particularly to those who are not safeguarding the interests of Britain. </para>

                    <para>The Labour party has been asked to become associated with a national government. We cannot have a national government true to name unless it gives effect to a national policy. Such a policy cannot be introduced whilst our essential services and industries are controlled by private enterprise. The Government either has to give effect to the policy of the financiers to whom it is responsible, or to one which is in the interests of the nation. If the Labour party were foolish enough to become associated with a national government it would be responsible for some of the things which are now being done. For instance, under the National Security Act, a regulation has been issued providing that an employee shall not leave his employment without the permission of his employer; but the employer can discharge the employee at any moment should he so desire. Employers are given full power over their employees and can demand most unreasonable things to be done whilst the employee has practically no redress. That is an instance of what is being done by a Government which would have us believe that it is giving effect to a national policy. Employers are masters of the situation. Employees in Australia are placed in a similar position to employees in Germany. If the Government expects to get results by such a policy it will be disillusioned. Another regulation provides that arbitration proceedings must be conducted <inline font-style="italic">in camera</inline> so that the public will not know what occurs. If proceedings were conducted in open court evidence could be adduced and the facts stated- </para>

                    </quote><para>That paragraph also reads well to the non-critical reader, and is, perhaps, impressive to the subjective reasoner. The statement, however, is superficial and its real meaning is obscure. What is meant by the destruction of " Hitlerism" ? Does it mean that we are, if possible, to put Hitler up against a wall and shoot him, or does it mean that Hitler stands for a state of society to which we are opposed? The terms used by the Minister are ambiguous, and, in the absence of other information, one has to rely upon one's own judgment in interpreting them. My opinion is that should Germany be defeated to-morrow, the policy to which this Government and the Government of the United Kingdom are committed would not include the restoration of freedom in Europe. There can be no freedom, in the real sense of the word, whilst a few men have the right to exploit their fellow men for profit; whilst a few men have the right, as they have in England and in Australia to-day, to impoverish the wage-earners, and reduce them to the bread-line. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- No ; I am merely trying to discover what is meant by the terms " Hitlerism " and " freedom ". This may all seem to be unjustifiable criticism of the Government, but in my view criticism of the Minister's statement is warranted. Unless more information is made available to honorable senators concerning the difficulties with which this country is faced and the position which we now occupy in international affairs, and as long as there is any reason to believe that our defence effort is not so effective as it might be, criticism will be voiced from this side of the chamber. At least, so far as I am concerned, the Government will not continue on its way unchallenged when we are given perfectly innocuous and misleading documents such as this. That is the reason why I have criticized the Minister's statement so fully. If it can be shown that the criticism is unjustified and not beneficial, I shall be the first to admit it; but if the present state of affairs continues, then with whatever ability I have, I shall not only repeat what I have said to-day, but I shall also say much more in elaboration of it in the interests of the people outside who are justly entitled <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> a much better deal from the Government than they have received up to the present. </para>

When members of the Commonwealth Parliament are brought together in Canberra from all parts of Australia, the Government should at least try to give them a little more information than they have received from the censored press. The Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> advocated the holding of a secret session in order to permit the freest and frankest discussion of the war .position. We, on this side of the chamber, are considerably handicapped because certain statements are made to us by outsiders and, not knowing whether they are true or not, we are reluctant to argue them because we fear that anything we may say may have a bad effect upon the public mind. </para>

                    <para>The public is constantly being told in *he press and in wireless broadcasts that they must not be pessimistic, and must not take notice of rumour-mongers. Would not the better way to combat such rumours be to tell the public the truth? That is my opinion. The Master who died 2000 years ago said, " Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free ". So far as the war is concerned it would be better to tell the people of this country the whole truth. But it  seems  to be the considered opinion of the Government that much of the truth must be kept from the people, because it is afraid of them, and does not trust them. For this reason it refuses to tell tha people the full facts in relation to the prosecution of the war. Honorable senators on this side are afraid to ask certain questions because of the effect which the answers may have upon the public mind. That is the stand taken by the majority of the members of my party. A few of my colleagues contend that it would be better, perhaps, that the whole of the truth were told to the people. If Ministers will not tell us the whole truth openly, because they are afraid to trust the people, is it not possible to hold a secret session in order that we may gain the whole truth on matters which the Government refuses to divulge in the full light of clay? If, through a secret session, the Government can re-assure us as to the effectiveness of its war effort, then such a session of this Parliament would be justified. If the Government will not consent to hold a secret session, and, at the same time, intends to maintain secrecy in regard to any of its activities, then it will be our duty, as responsible members of the legislature, to ask openly questions on which we cannot now secure the whole truth. </para>

                            <para>- We are living in critical times; we do not know what might happen within the next few weeks. We do not know how the Eastern question will be resolved. Consequently, every member of this Parliament is anxious to refrain from doing anything that would jeopardize our war effort. I  know  that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> is convinced that it is the duty of Labour members in this Parliament to become part and parcel of a national government. We are convinced that we can best do our duty to the people by remaining an effective opposition. </para>

                    <para>It has been said repeatedly by honorable senators 'opposite and in some sections of the press, that the Labour movement is not doing its duty towards the people because it refuses to accept responsibility in a national government. We accept the responsibility that has been placed upon our shoulders by the people who sent us here. As part and parcel of a democratic parliamentary system we must accept responsibility even as an opposition. In Parliament we criticize and question the Government, and debate policies. When policies have  been  resolved and put into operation, we must accept responsibility in the larger sense for such policies as part and parcel of our democratic system. At this moment of gathering darkness for Australia all of us realize what has happened in France and in the other countries which have fallen to Hitler. We know that if the conqueror of those countries should conquer Australia the Opposition in this Parliament would be " in the soup " just as surely as would honorable senators opposite. I have no illusions in this matter. If Australia falls, our parliamentary system will be eliminated, and all members of Parliament, irrespective of party, will be interned in concentration camps. Members of this chamber have responsibilities as leaders of two sections of the people. In times of peace we on this side have carried out our duty as an Opposition, and in this time of war we shall continue to discharge that duty. But should Australia be defeated, we, as responsible leaders of the people, shall suffer. We shall know what it is to be dragged from our seats, and treated as have been some members of the Government of France who to-day are on trial for their lives. Unless we get together solidly in the prosecution of our war effort it is possible that before many months pass Ave also shall be on trial far our lives. However, I agree with my leader that  we  on this side can best serve the people as a strong, forceful and intelligent Opposition until we become the Government. Surely there is nothing  wrong  with that point of view. I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> in all friendliness that members of the Opposition are as serious as he is in this matter. I say fairly and squarely to the honorable senator that the Government has an opportunity to resolve this matter of responsibility. If it is aware of an inferiority complex, or feels that it has not the men capable of carrying on the arduous task of government in war-time, it can immediately appeal to the people. Let that appeal be made. I have been among the people in many centres throughout the Commonwealth, and I know that they now say, "Let us clear the air; let the issue be made plain, and let the people be given an opportunity to say who shall govern; let us not continue the bickering that is going on among political parties at present ". Let the  people say who should govern, and when they have given their verdict let those selected to govern do their job. Let us end the pendulum politics which has been so evident during the last few months. </para>
                    <para>The people are quite sick of the manner in which this Government is playing with important issues. I do not wish to disparage personally any honorable senator opposite. I have the greatest respect for every member of this Parliament. Only to-day, when a man with whom I was talking bitterly criticized a member of this Government, who, by the way, has himself been the most bitter critic of the Labour party, I replied that during my eight years' experience in this Parliament I had found members generally, irrespective of party, as decent a collection of men as could be discovered in any other section of society. I disagree with the conception of politicians as a tribe somewhat apart from ordinary individuals. However, I emphasize that the country is sick of the pusillanimity of the Government in respect of several important issues which have arisen lately. </para>
                    <para>Petrol rationing is important, although some people are inclined to regard it merely as a side issue. Some time ago the Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> made a statement on this matter, and every one was under the impression that he expressed the considered opinion of the Government. Consequently they accepted as inevitable his statement that petrol was to be rationed. They agreed that some people would have to put their cars on the stocks, whilst others would have to rely upon fuel other than petrol. But within a few days we were told that the statement made by the Minister did not represent the considered opinion of the Government, and the proposal he outlined was cast aside. Subse quently, two additional members were appointed to the Liquid Fuel Control Board, and within a day or two we expect to have the considered opinion of that body. The result of this confusion has been that hundreds of men throughout Australia have been thrown out of employment because so many businesses have been jeopardized. We of the Opposition say that if it is necessary to ration petrol, then it must be rationed, If our fight for democracy against totalitarianism involves a course which will result in the disintegration of every business in the country, then such a course must he accepted as inevitable, if its adoption means that we shall win out against those who are trying to force upon us other ideologies. But, how utterly stupid is the spectacle of a Minister announcing publicly a scheme for the rationing of petrol, and then three days later the Government saying that it has not considered such a proposal. In this instance the Government said, in effect, " <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Stewart put that plan before you, but it is not our plan ". The people are heartily sick of such action. To-day they say : " If we knew where we stood, well and good; we should accept the Government's decision as something arising out of the war. But we have a government that does not know its own mind, and it is time that we had as leaders Ministers who do not do things off their own bat and without consulting their Prime Minister at a time when the democratic institutions of this country are in jeopardy." We need a strong leader, who will not tolerate independent action by minor Ministers. We want a man who will be a leader in the real sense of the word. </para>
                    <para>Surely our democratic system is as capable of producing leaders as is the totalitarian system. However, we have not got such a leader to-day. I have the highest personal regard for the Prime Minister, but his Cabinet includes several budding duces and  fuhrers.  These men have a conception of democracy entirely different from tha.t held by the ordinary citizen. They want to rule on their own. If the Prime Minister is not strong enough to lead, then the country must find a man capable of doing so. 1 repeat that the Government should go to the people in order to let them decide who shall govern this country in the present crisis. Then let whatever government is elected carry on its work for the next three years with all the forcefulness at its command. Let us put an end to the pusillanimity of the present Government, and the bickering which we have witnessed within the last few months. A continuance of such a state of affairs will surely destroy democracy, because until a government can make up its mind it cannot hope to secure the backing of the people. No one deplores more than I do the disagreement which has been evident within the Labour movement. The majority of honorable senators on this side wholeheartedly support the Australian Labour party. We have one or two good friends who have seen fit lately, to leave the party. There is a struggle in the Country party. If what the papers tell us is true, its members are fighting about who shall be leader. In the United Australia party, too, there is dissension. These things, intensified and enlarged upon by the press, are the things that are destroying the people's conception of democracy. </para>
                    <para>The Labour party is anxious that the best shall be done for Australia in the way of defence. A friend of mine was talking the other day to a man whose identity, for obvious reasons, I cannot disclose, though I may say that he is among the highest in the land.  His  name, if I mentioned it, would surprise honorable senators. That man, whom I also know, although I have not seen him for some time, was fearfully worried, troubled and upsetbecause of the lack of defence measures in Queensland. I shall not go any further than that, although.Icouldsayanumberof things about Queensland defences. It is all right to publish figures. That is the political game, and it is necessary, I suppose, to keep the people buoyed up. But we know that we could do far more than we are doing, and, when a. man of the high standing occupied by the man I mentioned says the things he does say, we must be very much worried indeed.

He was a well-known horticulturist and was a descendant of a family which had engaged in horticulture for. centuries in the Old World. With his people he settled in South Australia. He was a perfect soul who never told a lieor turned away from danger. I pay my tribute to his memory. He was  a  man whom it was good to know. </para>

                <para>SenatorFRASER (Western Australia) [6.16]. - Although months have passed since the Government decided  to  erect a military hospital  at  Perth and plans were prepared and sent  to  Canberra, no action has yet been taken  to  call tenders for the building,  or to do  any of the preliminary work. Many cases of illness have occurred among the troops in the State and the lack of hospital accommodation is serious; so serious that the military authorities have had to take over the recently' erected addition  to  the mental home. I should like the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> to draw the attention of the responsible Minister  to  the delay and impress upon him the urgency of the work being undertaken. </para>
