            <para>Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the  HousE  of representatives : </para>
            <para>You have been called together to deliberate upon matters of importance to the well-being of the Commonwealth. </para>
            <para>The position of the war continues to be a grave one, but recent events encourage our confidence in ultimate victory. Practically without warning, and entirely without excuse, Italy has launched an attack upon Greece which is gallantly resisting, with powerful aid from British forces. The success which has so far attended the numerically inferior Greek forces on  the &#39; Albanian frontier, whilst encouraging, must not be overstated, but, taken in conjunction with the magnificent . recent exploits of the British Mediterranean squadron and fleet air arm at Taranto and the entrance to the Adriatic, it has produced such a setback to Italian arms as to affect the balance of power in- the Mediterranean. </para>
            <para>Germany&#39;s intentions in&#39; relation to Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey, however, remain undefined, and consequently the problem of the defence of the Middle East is one which must continue to engage the attention, not only of- His Majesty&#39;s Government in the United Kingdom, but also of Australia, which has large forces in Egypt and Palestine. </para>
            <para>Speaking broadly, however, while the difficulties, and dangers confronting the British Empire are greater than at any other time in its history, there is much to support the view that the German ambition &#39; to achieve a quick victory by a sudden development of overwhelmingforce has been frustrated, that the ideasof an invasion of Great Britain have, for the time being at least, been foiled, and that we are entering what no doubt will be a. lengthy period in  which the immense resources of the British Empire, backed by the undoubtedly friendly neutrality of the United States of America^ will more and more effectively be marshalled and used for the winning of a complete victory and the establishment of a just peace. </para>
            <para>My Government is in constant communication with His Majesty&#39;s Government in Great Britain, and with His Majesty&#39;s Governments in the other dominions, ir. connexion vita the provision of armaments necessary for the carrying on of the war. </para>
            <para>Ministers are proceeding with the utmost expedition, and with remarkable success, with the Government&#39;s programme for the production of armaments in Australia, so that not only will Australian forces be adequately equipped, but all possible aid may be given as required to the-other parts of the Empire. The rapid development of munitions manufacture in Australia has made immense demands upon the skill, industry and resources of our people, and those demands are being increasingly satisfied. </para>
            <para>When I addressed you at the opening of the second session of the last Parliament, I was able to refer to the fact that, pursuant to its policy of making contribution to peace in the Pacific by establishing direct diplomatic representa-. lion of Australia in selected Pacific countries, my Government had made certain diplomatic appointment*.  These have now been added to by the appointment of a Minister Plenipotentiary to Japan, and a reciprocal appointment of a Japanese Minister to Australia is expected at an early date. </para>
            <para>Since the last session of Parliament, an Australian Advisory War Council has been set up under the authority of the National Security Act, with membership representative of all parties in Parliament, and  with  the function of advising the Government in relation to Australia&#39;s war effort and the problems which relate thereto. </para>
            <para>Already several meetings of this council have taken place with useful results. My advisers earnestly hope that the experience gained through those deliberations will enable members on both sides of Parliament to concentrate upon the urgent problems of war, and to make that joint contribution to the solution of those problems without which the fullest national effort cannot be achieved. In particular, the council has given consideration to the question of industrial stoppages during war time, and has been able to make recommendations which my advisers hope will lead to a perfecting of the machinery of industrial peace, and at the same time to a maintenance of full and uninterrupted labour and production. </para>
            <para>The Government feels strongly that, in a country in which there is adequate and accessible machinery for the settlement of disputes and the adjustment of grievances, there can be no justification for direct action. This is particularly true in time of war, when any cessation of work in a war industry, or in any industry which is related to the war  effort,  constitutes a real blow at the national security. A fortnight&#39;s work in some munitions factory, once lost, can never be recovered. It means inevitably at least a fortnight&#39;s delay in the production of some gun, some piece of ammunition or some equipment urgently, and in some cases desperately, needed by Australians serving in a theatre of war. </para>
            <para>The principal business which you will be asked to consider in the early part of this new session will be the making of financial provision for the carrying on of the war and for the ordinary civil services of government. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(-Mr. Fadden)</inline> will, within a few days, lay before you a budget which will impose&#39; upon the Australian people financial burdens heavier than they have ever before been called upon to bear. I am confident that these burdens will be cheerfully accepted and successfully borne. If we are called upon to pay a great price for victory, we must still remember that the price is great because the liberties which we have at stake are even greater. </para>
            <para>Living in this country in remoteness and quietness, we have much reason to be thankful that we have been left, ever since the war began, to develop our industries and strengthen our economy undisturbed by bomb or battle. My Government relies confidently upon the support of the people of Australia in doing, and paying for everything that is within the physical capacity of Australia for the protecting of our own integrity and the making of the greatest passible contribution to the success of the British arms. </para>
            <para>Interruptions to shipping, the disturbance of foreign markets and, in recent months, the occurrence of a disastrous drought, have all aggravated the difficult problems of the primary industries of Australia. The Government has given  a  great deal of thought to these problems, and has also discussed them with State Governments and with representatives of the industries affected. It will place before honorable senators and members details of a plan for the stabilization of the wheat industry, and will also place information before you as to steps taken, and to be taken, in connexion with other primary industries. </para>
            <para>In the earnest hope that Divine Providence may guide your deliberations and further the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth, I now leave you to the discharge of your high and important duties. </para>

There is little doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain&#39;s</inline> end was hastened by that devotion to duty whichwas the outstanding feature of a long and distinguished career of public service.

                    throughout his whole life, personified those qualities which make an English gentleman.  His  steadfastness of purpose had always endeared, him to his people. He will be&#39; remembered as one who unceasingly laboured to obtain peace in Europe and in. the world. But when it was clear that that peace was impossible in the face of dictatorial governments, he threw himselfwith equal determination into the fierce struggle of war, with the realization that war was the only means to obtain that peace. Never before had a man been Prime Minister of Great Britain in such a crisis as England faced in September of last year. The United Kingdom was confronted with the most formidable fighting machine which had ever been evolved by the hands of man - a machine operated by one who regarded it as  a&#60;  means of subjugating the whole world to his power. &#34;Whatever may be said of events in- 1938, we now know that

                    <para>. - In expressing on behalf of the Opposition our sincerest sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Chamberlain</inline> in the irreparable loss she has sustained by the passing of her distinguished husband, and with the British people in the loss of a great statesman, I may be excused if I feel a measure of pride on having paid my tribute in this chamber to the Bight Honorable Neville Chamberlain and his worthy public service while yet he lived. People generally, especially those engaged in public life, are all too prone to wait until a man is dead before acknowledging his virtues. Let us look back over all that has happened in the distressing times since September of last year. When, as Prime Minister of Great Britain, this gentle man, distinguished in the service of his country, first in municipal affairs and later in Parliament, again saw the war clouds gathering over Europe, he took his courage in both hands, and, although 70 years of age and frail in health, conquered hi3 aversion to air travel, which he had never previously undertaken, and risking his political future, flew three times to Germany in order to interview Hitler. That he was deceived does not detract in the least degree from the wonderful effort that he made. It is cruel - perhaps it is just fate - that Neville Chamberlain passes with but few left to do him honour or justice. He tried to avert from England the concentrated horrors it is now experiencing so tragically. It will surely be recorded in the Book of Time to his eternal credit that he strove manfully to prevent this second world war, and that the months of respite which his action secured for Great Britain, giving its splendid people time to. prepare to resist the invader as they have so wonderfully done, may well prove to be the basis of the final triumph of liberty and freedom over despotism and tyranny, and the victory of those who love the good and true over the forces of evil and dishonour. </para>

                    <para>- With the concurrence of my colleagues, I associate members of the Country party in the Senate with the motion. I agree with what the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has just said. I, too, feel a great deal of satisfaction that, through thick and thin, I consistently supported every action taken by that great and good man, Neville Chamberlain, to avert this disaster which has overtaken the world. At this tragic time I do not deem it proper to raise any controversial matter, but to me it is a matter of amazement that what that great statesman did, for not only England but also for the whole world, and&#39; its future, has not  been more generally recognized. He gave to England an opportunity which, at the time of Munich, it did not possess, to defend, itself against the powers of cruelty, tyranny, aggression, injustice and. greed that now threaten the world. When the history of those times as relating not merely to England, but also to the world generally, has been written, men thousands of years hence will recognize this man as one of the outstanding figures of the age - a man who, seeing the fate of civilization in the balance, took those fateful journeys to Munich in order to try to preserve peace. In to-day&#39;s press we are reminded by one more competent to speak, perhaps, than any other person, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Nevile</inline> Henderson, of the precise state of our preparedness at the time of the crisis.

                    <para>It is with deep regret that I submit this motion. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> had one of the longest parliamentary careers in Australian history, his service extending over a period of about  50  years. Having been elected to the Legislative Assembly of Victoria for the constituency of West Melbourne in  1889,  he was re-elected for the same seat in  1S92, 1S94, 1897, 1900  and  1902.  In&#39;  1904  he successfully contested the federal division of Melbourne and represented that constituency continuously until the time of his death. He was a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Party that visited England in  1911  at the invitation of the &#34; Imperial Government to attend the coronation ceremony of King George Y. From  1910  to  1917  he was a Temporary Chairman of Committees. He was a member of the Royal Commission on the Pearling Industry in  1913.  and of the Royal Commission on Electoral Laws in  1914.  From  1914  to  1917  he was a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and , in  1917  and  191S  he was a member of the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee. As a member of the Commonwealth Delegation of the Empire Parliamentary Association he visited South Africa in  1924,  and in  1937  he was a member of the Delegation which visited England for the coronation of King George VI. Outside Parliament he was for many years actively engaged in social welfare in relation to his own profession of medicine. He was affectionately known as &#34; the Little Doctor &#34; to honorable members and to his many friends in Melbourne, and he will be sadly missed by all. To his family we extend our deepest sympathy in their sad loss. </para>

                        <para>. - I first made personal contact with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> just  25  years ago and from then until the time of his death recently, he was my personal friend. I had known of him for a quarter of a century before I met him and he was my ideal of a social reformer. In the electorate which he- represented  in -the House of  Representatives for so many years, he was affectionately known by everybody as &#34; the Little Doctor &#34;. He had to his credit a long life of unselfish community service, unequalled probably  by that of any other man, and certainly not surpassed by any public man with whose life I am familiar. No pensioner in his electorate was ever allowed to have a pauper&#39;s funeral; <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> looked after that. Then there was his wonderful fight extending over some years to establish a fund to supply milk free of charge for babies of poor parents. 13 is medical services were always available, in countless cases without any payment whatsoever, and, in other cases, when the patient could, afford it, for a merely nominal payment. It is fitting that we should pay tribute to a public man of the character of our departed friend, and it is also most .fitting that we should express to his relatives how fully we share their grief. </para>

I knew <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> for 22 years and for the whole of that time and many years &#34;before, he represented the great city of Melbourne. He had a host of friends, and probably was better known as a philanthropist than as a politician because of the generous manner in which he ministered to the needs of the people in his electorate. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> . has said, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> set out to give to the children of Melbourne an opportunity to face life with the strength that is so necessary in these strenuous times. He also gave medical advice to all who sought it, in most cases merely at the cost of a bottle of medicine. Thousands of people in the electorate of Melbourne are indebted to him for his practical help, and their sympathy is extended to the bereaved family of one who did so much for the electorate, and his native country. </para>

Members of my party will recollect that at <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney&#39;s</inline> last appearance with us at the close of last session, he said in our party&#39; room that he would probably not contest another election. He added that he prayed to Cod that if Labour should come to power, it would not forget the needs of the poor. He hoped that those who died in indigent circumstances would be given decent burial, and that the needs of the women and children would always be kept in mind. That utterance was almost prophetic, for only a few weeks later <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> contracted a fatal illness. The nation, and this Parliament, are much poorer for his passing. </para>

                        <para>As other speakers have said., <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> did amazing work among the people of Melbourne. Blessed with a sound&#39; education, some share of the world&#39;s goods, and a good professional knowledge, he freely placed all at the disposal of the poor. He sought, neither office nor honours, and I believe that his like lias not graced the Federal. Parliament. He never deviated from the principles which he held, and he sought no recompense for his services, other than the gratitude of those whom he benefited. I therefore join with other speakers in paying my tribute to the memory of &#34; The Great Little Doctor &#34;. </para>

He served abroad with the regiment and was afterwards attached to the 5th Division in France in 3 9.1 7 and 191 S. He was made -a Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George in 1917. I have to express to his widow and family our sympathy in their bereavement. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to associate my colleagues of the Country party and myself with thismotion. I knew the &#39;late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott</inline> very intimately, although he was not  a  relative of mine, as might be supposed from the name. In the House of Representatives he represented the New England electorate which included the State electorate represented by me in the Parliament of New South Wales. That close association extended beyond Parliament. On his return from the war,  Colonel Abbott  took a very great interest in what many people of Australia then thought, and probably would be thinking to-day, but for the war, the urgent necessity for constitutional reform in Australia. He took a lively interest in what, at thai time, was a very live movement in New South Wales, to bring about some readjustment of the constitutional relations of Commonwealth and States. I, too, was very closely associated with that movement, and I can testify to the genuine, broad outlook of  Colonel Abbott,  his statesmanlike approach to .matters of that sort, and his earnest desire, without any sei f- &#62; aggrandisement, to bring about a necessary reform. He was a member of the royal commission which exhaustively investigated the operation of the Australian Constitution. The recommendations of that body appear to have been pigeonholed for the present, but I hope, that some day they will be dealt with, in which  event it will be found that the deceased gentleman and his fellow commissioners performed  a  great service to Australia in the investigation which they undertook. I desire, therefore, to place on record our appreciation of the public-spirited service and life of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator P.</inline> P. Abbott. </para>

                    <para>- Those of us who knew the late Honorable Albert E. Green intimately and shared his confidences find it extremely difficult to realize that he is no longer with us.  His  record of public service was more remarkable than the mere length of it, and that was considerable, for he served for ten years in the State Parliament of Western Australia and eighteen years in this National Parliament. An intensely earnest man, he took the problems of life seriously, as they should be taken, and gave of his best in every department of those activities which constituted his life. We knew him as &#34;Texas&#34; Green; it was always difficult to think of him by his proper title - the Honorable Albert E. Green. He was a big Australian with a wide international outlook; his ideals of brotherhood, fellowship, and service to his fellow men were the guiding rules of his life. To all of us who knew him intimately, he was a good companion. He could be severe in his criticisms, but &#34; Texas &#34; Green was never bitter or uncharitable. He was an omnivorous reader, gifted with a wonderful memory. He loved poetry, and could recite with eloquence and great effect the gems which most appealed to him. Among my most, treasured possessions are some of the things which I have heard him recite and which I afterwards asked him. to commit to writing so that I might preserve them. </para>

                    <para>- With the consent of my colleagues, I associate the Australian Country party with the expressions&#39; of regret that have been voiced, in connexion with the death of the Honorable Albert Ernest Green, popularly known as &#34;Texas&#39;&#34; Green. I had the privilege of the personal friendship of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Green</inline> for well over 30 years. We were associated in public affairs in Kalgoorlie before either of us entered Parliament. Both of us were elected to the Parliament of Western Australia for the first time on the 3rd October, 1911, nearly 30 years ago, and we were there together for over ten years. In 1922, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Green</inline> was elected to the Commonwealth Parliament as the member for the Division of Kalgoorlie, and he retained the confidence of the people of the goldfields until his death. For many years prior to his election to Parliament, he was an official of the post office in Kalgoorlie. From there he graduated to politics, and. his many friends both inand out of the department were delighted when, in 1931, he achieved his ambition and became Postmaster-General of the Commonwealth and. head of the department in which he had spent so many years. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Green&#39;</inline> also did excellent work for Australia as Minister for Defence in the Scullin Government. He was a man with aremarkable personality, and his cheerful and friendly disposition made firm friends for him wherever he went. He had an extraordinarily firm hold of the Kalgoorlie electorate, which comprises more than nine- tenths of the area of Western Australia, as it extends from Wyndham in the north to Esperance in the south. I travelled with him on many occasions; the energy he displayed in traversing his huge electorate will always be remembered there, as he was the friend of every one even in the most remote part of that great constituency. At the general elections, he received the wholehearted support from persons holding the most varied political opinions. Miners, prospectors, pastoralists, pearlers, farmers and other workers joined in showing their appreciation of his public service and personal qualities. He stood for a fair deal for all sections in his vast electorate.  His  death makes a void in the public life of Australia, particularly Western Australia, and I join with others in extending sympathy to his wife and family in their bereavement. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to associate myself with the motion moved. Ex-Senator Keating was a foundation member of the Federal Parliament. He entered the Senate as a comparatively young man. He possessed great attainments, was a brilliant  speaker,  and served&#39; his country faithfully. In the early days of federation he played an important part in framing gome of the legislation under which the Commonwealth is working to-day. On behalf of the Tasmanian senators, I pay tribute to the memory of this great man who did so much, not only for the State of Tasmania, also for the whole Commonwealth which he served with great distinction. </para>

                    <para>It is with regret that I submit a motion in respect of the death, of another former member of this Parliament. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey</inline> died in Melbourne on the 3.1&#39;st October. He was a member of the State Parliament of Victoria from 1904 to 1910. He was then elected to the House of Representatives as the member for Bourke, which he represented from 1910 until 1934, a period of 24 years. From 1922 to 1927 he was Assistant Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives. He was a member of a royal commission which, in 1.923, investigated the effect of the operation of the Navigation Act on Australian trade and industry; and a member of the Joint &#39; Committee of Public Accounts from February to. September, 1929. In October, 1929, hewas appointed Minister for Health and Minister for Repatriation, which office he held until March, 1931. I extend our sincere sympathy to his family in their loss. </para>

                        <para>- The late Frank Anstey was a remarkable man, because of both his gift of oratory and his power with the pen. I was about to say that some of us young fellows who knew him years ago looked up to him as a guide, philosopher -and friend ; but, actually he was only of the same age as myself. His contribution to literature, particularly with regard to financial subjects, was a great inspiration to those of us who were taking part in reform work outside Parliament, with no ideas in those earlier days of ever joining him in the National Parliament. Among the books he wrote were <inline font-style="italic">Facts and Theories of Finance, Money Power, The Kingdom of Shylock,Red Europe,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Monopoly and Democracy ,</inline> and each of these works was  a  classic of its kind. It was with great grief that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey&#39;s</inline> friends noticed in 1934 that his health was- deteriorating,  and that he was losing the fire and vigor that had &#39; characterized him in earlier years. He reached the age of 75 years, and had 30 years of parliamentary experience, six years in the Parliament of Victoria and 24 years in this National Parliament.  His  eloquence was remarkable and his sincerity intense. Those were the outstanding characteristics of a distinguished man. To those whom he has left behind the Opposition extends its sincere sympathy. </para>

He was an orator of the first water. Every body in the House knew when Frank Anstey was about to make a speech, because his demeanour made the fact evident. Whenever he addressed the House he was listened to by  a  full audience.  His  was a colourful personality. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> remarked, he wrote many books which&#39; created great interest, although probably every body did not agree with . the views advanced by him. He was a man of undoubted sincerity, as well as of great eloquence. I express my sympathy with his family at the loss of one who served his country well and with very great ability. </para>

                            <para>- As one of the oldest friends of the late Frank Anstey,. I add my meed of praise to his memory.  His  oratorical powers made him an inspiration to the majority of the young men of the Labour movement in Victoria. He was doubly blessed with the gift of eloquence, and a high literary capacity. What impressed me most was that he was a rebel against the . social conditions under which he was reared, and heused his undoubted talents in a valiant effort to improve them.  His  declining years, unfortunately, were saddened by the disappointment that, when he became a Minister of the Crown, he was unable to give effect to some of the aspirations of his party. He passed away practically as he lived, not desiring the applause of anybody. He died one night, and was buried the next morning. Even his most intimate friends did not know of his passing. In my judgment he was in the same class as an orator as Alfred Deakin, and he took his . place among men of the highest literary achievement Australia has produced.  His  death is a milestone in the history of the Labour movement in this country. I offer to his family my deepest sympathy. Australia is poorer, and the Labour movement is weaker, by reason of the loss of a man of his calibre. </para>

                    <para>- On behalf of the members of the Country party in the Senate I support the motion which expresses ourappreciation of the public service rendered by the late Honorable James MacKinnon Fowler. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler</inline> was a prominent advocate of federation when in 1900 the people of Western Australia decided by public ballot&#34; in favour of union. In 1901 he was elected to the first Commonwealth Parliament for the division of Perth, and he held that seat uninterruptedly for 22 years, during which period the policy of federation was consolidated. He was returned for the division of Perth at eight successive elections, and throughout his career in this Parliament he was a respected, capable and eloquent advocate of the interests of Western Australia, particularly in respect of tariff policy. We extend our sympathy to his widow and family. </para>

                <para class="block">It is with great regret that I have to inform the Senate of the death on Friday last of the Honorable Henry Gregory, whowas member for the division of Swan, Western Australia, in the House of Representatives. </para>
                <para>Before entering the Commonwealth Parliament, the late member had been for many years a member of the &#34;Western Australian Legislative Assembly, having been elected to that chamber in  1S97.  He was Minister for Mines from  1901  to  1904,  and Minister for Mines and Railways from  1905  to  1911.  He was acting Premier and Treasurer in  1910  to  1911.  Elected to the House of Representatives for the division of Dampier in  1913,  he represented that division till its abolition in  1922.  In  1922  he was elected for the division of Swan,, which he continued to represent until his death. </para>
                <para>He was a member of the Royal Commission on the Pearling Industry in  1913,  and chairman of the Royal Commission on Powellized Timber in  1914.  He was a member of the Joint Committee on Public Works from  1914  to  1926,  being chairman of that committee from October,  1917,  to February,  1926.  He was again a member of the same committee from February,  1929j  to November,  1931.  He was also a member of the Joint Select Committee on the Moving Picture Industry in Australia in  19-27,  and of the Royal Commission- on that industry in  1927-28.  In  19-35  he visited&#39; England as a member of the Commonwealth delegation of the Empire Parliamentary Association. He was highly respected- by all of us, and his death removes one who gave many years of his life- to public service. I extend to  hi3  widow and family our deepest sympathy. </para>

                    <para>- The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gregory</inline> was a remarkable personality. In years, he was the oldest member of this Parliament in which lie rendered outstanding service on behalf of Australia. Although for many years he did not enjoy robust health, he carried on uncomplainingly, and was always so cheerful that only those who knew him intimately realized how great was his suffering. Right up to the last, he was as keen mentally as at any period of his career, a fact which is apparent from the speeches he made during last session. In that regard he was most remarkable. Most honorable senators know his good wife quite well. All of us admire her wonderful devotion and attention to heu husband. The fullest sympathy of every one of us goes out to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Gregory.</inline></para>

                    <para>- It is with deep sorrow that I speak to this motion on behalf of members of the Country party- in this chamber. Australia has sustained&#39; a- great loss through the passing of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gregory.</inline> He had been a. member of the House of Representatives without interruption since  1913,  a period of  27  consecutive years. He.wa3 an original member of the Australian  Country party, and was its first Deputy Leader. For the last  40  years his name has been a household word in Western Australia. He entered the State Parlia-ment in  1897  as the member for Menzies on the eastern gold-fields, and held that seat, mainly because of his vigorous personality, until  1911.  As the Minister for Mines in successive governments, he placed on the statute-book of Western Australia mining, laws that are recognized as being the best of their kind in the Empire. That legislation did much to assist the State in the establishment of its gold-mining industry. He also founded the system of State batteries for the purpose of aiding prospectors.  In  the Federal Parliament for over  27  consecutive years, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gregory</inline> wa3 always a valiant fighter for the interests of Western Australia in general and primary producers in particular. He was conspicuous in his endeavours to free the primary industries from the burdens of the tariff, and on more than one occasion he refused to accept ministerial -office rather than compromise on his fixed political principles in regard to protection. The amount of detailed work that he did on behalf of the primary industries during his long and busy life-time was enormous. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gregory</inline> was a firm friend and a loyal colleague. When I was first selected as a candidate for the Senate, he gave me every assistance in his power, both before and during- that election campaign and in each succeeding campaign-. I mourn the loss of a valiant friend who was a wise adviser in time of difficulty. He was &#39; one of the most influential workers for the Country party movement in Western Australia and in- the national sphere. Since 1897, a period of 43- years, he was one of the most prominent political leaders in his State. He was also one of the leaders of the federal &#39;movement, and in 1900 was an advocate of federation. He was always a capable, fearless and courteous fighter for principles that he considered &#39; to be right. Though he fought hard, he-fought fairly.  His  death leaves a vacancy in the public life of Western Australia and of the Commonwealth that cannot easily be filled. He is mourned by a host of friends and I am sure that the sympathy of this Senate is extended to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Gregory,</inline> whom we all know so well, and to his three sons and daughter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gregory&#39;s</inline> long and useful life of public service will remain an inspiration to those who follow him. </para>
