                        <para>- There has been some delay associated with the acquisition of land in South Australia due to a variation of the areas proposed to be taken over by the Department of Supply and Munitions. However, a decision in the matter was reached last -week, and the necessary notices will appear in the next issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette.</inline> On the publication of such notices, claims may be sent in by the landholders concerned, and I promise that there will be no delay in dealing with them. In reply to the second part of the honorable senator's question, I do not think that any good purpose would be served by sending a special officer to South Australia; out should any landholder whose land will be acquired desire it, the Government will make an advance to him of up to 75 per cent. of the Government's valuation of his land. </para>

Representations have been made from time to time as to the need to allow officers of the TerritoryService the right of entry to the Commonwealth Public Service or to be transferred to Commonwealth positions in the States, instead of remaining indefinitely in the Northern 'Territory. In 1937, the Payne-Fletcher Committee, which investigated certain matters connected with the Northern Territory, supported the principle embodied in the bill.

After conducting an investigation, the board intimated that it supported the opinion that the public interest would best be served by placing the departments in the Northern Territory, with certain exceptions, under the Commonwealth Public Service Act. Subject to legal considerations, the Government has agreed in principle to the appointment of permanent officers of the Northern Territory Service to the Commonwealth Public Service, under section 42 of  the  Commonwealth Public Service Act. The exceptions referred to are the officers of the Education, Police and Prisons Branches of the Northern Territory Service, some of whom have no counterpart in the Commonwealth Public Service.

To enable the transfer to be effected, it is necessary to repeal sub-section 3 of section 4 of the Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1910, and to make provision in the Commonwealth Public Service Act for the Administrator of the Northern Territory to be given the powers of a chief officer under that act. Sub-section 3 of section 4 of the Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1910-40, which it is proposed to repeal, reads - </para>

                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para class="block">The effect of the repeal of that subsection is to transfer to the Public Service Board the power which the Minister possesses to appoint officers in the Northern Territory. As honorable senators are aware, all appointments to the Commonwealth Public Service are made by the Public Service Board. The transfer of the control of the Northern Territory Service to the Commonwealth Public Service Board will increase the efficiency of administration in the Northern Territory. With the possible exception of some of the older men now in the service, who could not readily be absorbed, officers will not be required to work indefinitely in the tropics, but will have opportunities to transfer to the south. Transferred officers will be replaced by experienced officers from the Commonwealth Service or by personnel recruited by the methods provided in the Commonwealth Public Service Act. I commend this bill to the Senate for two reasons. First, because officers in the Northern Territory, where the climate and conditions are not so congenial as they are in Canberra and other centres of administration have given many years of yeoman service to Australia. Secondly, as the officers in the Northern Territory have not been under the control of the Public Service Board, it has not been possible to transfer them. The public service of the Northern Territory will benefit materially if its officers are given privileges similar to those of their colleagues in  other parts of Australia. The growing importance of the Northern Territory and of its expanding governmental activities, make it desirable that this measure should be passed. </para>

                        <para>. -  It was not possible for honorable senators to grasp the purport of this bill until the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> delivered his second-reading speech. Having heard that speech I see no reason why the bill should not be passed promptly, provided information is forthcoming on sonic phases which are of importance to me. I am prepared to accept the Minister's assurance that the purpose of the bill is to improve the conditions of public servants in the Northern Territory, but there are several other matters which should be clarified. I should like to know from whom the request for this legislation <inline font-style="italic">came,</inline> and what, effect, if any, it will have on the conditions of employment and salaries at present being paid in the Northern Territory? Is it the intention of the Public Service Board to assume control over these employees in order that it may deprive them of some rights or advantages which they now enjoy. I should like to know also whether this  bill  will affect temporary as well as permanent employees. I dislike the term " temporary ", because frequently so-called temporary employees have been employed for periods up to twenty years. What effect will the  bill  have on examinations for entry into the Public Service. I understand that public servants in the Northern Territory have not been subject to the same rigid examination as is held for entry into the Commonwealth Public Service in other parts of Australia. Are the employees to be penalized because they entered the Public Service when no such examination was required? How have appointments been made up to date, and, have the employees in the Northern Territory asked for this legislation? If the Minister can enlighten me on those points I am sure honorable senators on this side of the chamber will offer no opposition to the bill. </para>

Obviously the Northern Territory is not yet entitled to a form of local government, but I believe that control from a distance is not the best form of government, and, so far as possible, should be eliminated by the transfer of powers to local authorities. I should like the Minister to explain whether the Administrator, whom I think he said will be the chief executive officer in the Northern Territory, will be able to make appointments, or must such appointments be subject to the decision of the Public Service Board in Canberra? </para>

I suggest to the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll),</inline> and to other Ministers that when the debate on a bill is to proceed without an adjournment of the debate they should circulate copies of their second-reading speeches  among honorable senators. It is impossible for us to memorize a speech prepared by departmental officers and read hurriedly by a Minister.

Has this legislation been suggested by men in the Northern Territory, or by departmental officers in Canberra? What classes of employees are concerned? I know that there are employees of the Postal Department in the Northern Territory working under the same conditions as apply to those in other parts of the Commonwealth. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott</inline> that the rights of residents in other parts of Australia to secure employment in the Northern Territory should be protected. Having urged for years that the railway * systems of the Commonwealth be placed under the one control so that men in tropical Queensland could be transferred, to the more salubrious climate of Victoria, I favour a provision which enables men in the Territory service to be transferred to -other parts of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        to say when replying who will be affected by this legislation. Will temporary employees in the Northern Territory administration be brought under the Public Service Board and will appointment to that administration be made as the result of public service examinations? If so, will the same standard be required as in -other parts of the Commonwealth? Will those officers  who become Commonwealth public servants under this legislation be qualified to be transferred from one part of the Commonwealth to another? Will the Northern Territory service be administered from the office of the Public Service Board at Canberra, or will there be a deputy commissioner in the Northern Territory ?

Temporary officers of the Northern Territory service will become temporary officers of the Commonwealth Public Service; their status will be unchanged. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> referred to employees of the postal department stationed in the Northern Territory.

That matter is at present under the consideration of the Public Service Board. The service may be administered from either the Adelaide or Brisbane office of the Public Service Board or it may be found better to establish a branch office at Darwin. The 150 men affected are mostly clerical or field officers or men of that description. I cannot assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> that copies of Ministers' second-reading speeches will be circulated. To do so would have disadvantages as well as advantages.

                <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to implement the recommendations contained in the seventh report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which was tabled in the Senate on the 21st November. As honorable senators are aware, legislation was passed in 1933 setting up the commission as a deliberative body to inquire into and report upon applications made by any State to the Commonwealth for the grant of financial assistance in pursuance of section 96 of the Constitution. During the last six years the commission has examined the claimsof South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania for Commonwealth grants, and on each occasion the commission's recommendations have been endorsed by this Parliament. </para>
                <para>The commission has now examined the applications of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania for financial assistance from the Commonwealth during the current financial year 1940-41. The proposed grants, compared with those paid last year, are as follows: - </para>
                <para class="block">
                    <graphic href="165332194012112_6_0.jpg" />
                </para>
                <para>As these figures show, it is proposed this year to make special grants to the States totalling £30,000 more than the amount made available last year. However, the total amount originally assessed last year by the commission was £136,000 greater than that shown above ; but a deduction of that amount was made by the commission in order to adjust a special advance to Western Australia in 1937-38. The commission's total assessment for last year was, therefore, £2,156,000, compared with which the grants now recommended, viz., £2,050,000, represent a reduction of £306,000. I shall deal with this reduction when I come to the question of the grants to the individual States. The following statement shows the grants recommended by the commission since making its first report. In each case these grants have been paid by the Commonwealth - </para>
                <para>A significant fact revealed by these figures is that, whilst the total of the grants reached a peak figure of £2,750,000 in 1935-36, they have now become more or less stabilized. This I regard as highly satisfactory from the viewpoint of both the Commonwealth and the States. So long as the present system continues, of course some fluctuations in the amounts of the grants will be unavoidable. </para>
                <para>The principles upon which the commission bases its assessments of grants have been fully discussed in the Senate in previous years. These principles, which have not been changed, are set out fully and clearly in the seventh report. It will be sufficient to remind honorable senators that the grants which the commission recommends are determined by the amount of financial help necessary to make it possible for each claimant State by reasonable effort to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States, or, in other words, to maintain <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> fair Australian standard. This involves a comparison of the budgetary results of the claimant States with those of the non-claimant States. After taking into account such factors as relative severity of taxation, expenditure on social services, costs of administration, &amp;c., in the several States, grants are assessed on a basis which places the claimant States in a position comparable with that of {he non-claimant States. In short, the policy of the commission, which the Government has accepted in the past, is to assess grants on the basis of financial needs as indicated by an examination of the finances of all States, claimant and non claimant alike. </para>
                <para>It must, however, be remembered that, in order to make such a comparison, full statistical information is necessary. For this reason the recommendations contained in the present report are based upon the financial results of 1938-39, which is the latest year for which the necessary information is available. Whilst I do not propose to deal at length with the report, I direct special attention to several points. </para>
                <para>Last year the commission felt that the claimant States were not making sufficiently strenuous efforts to improve their financial position, and, consequently, imposed the so-called "nominal penalties ", on account of current policy, of £22,000, £22,000 and £23,000 for South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania respectively. These deductions were made because the commission believed that the claimant States should be able to improve their position in time of prosperity. The commission feels that in the present circumstances this might be difficult to accomplish and, consequently, corresponding penalties have not been recommended this year. </para>
                <para>In order to make the necessary adjustments which I have mentioned earlier the commission finds it necessary, as a preliminary step, to estimate the taxable capacity of each State. This estimate is based primarily upon the amount of federal income tax assessed in each State. However, gold-mining profits are not, subject to federal income tax, and to this degree a certain amount of taxable capacity was not included in the estimates. Because gold-mining profits are, in some cases, subject to State income taxation, the commission has, this year, corrected its estimates of taxable capacity to take account of that, fact. </para>
                <para>For some time the representatives of South Australia have maintained that that State was being penalized by the way in which the commission used federal income tax assessments in its calculations of relative taxable capacity. South Australia stated that the extra taxation levied on property income, as compared with the amount levied on personal exertion income, was far greater in the case of federal income tax than in the case of the income taxes of the States ; and, consequently, the taxable capacity of the States was being estimated on the basis of a tax system which was quite unlike that which the States actually did or could apply. This year the commission has endeavoured to meet this criticism, and has made a correction to its calculations along the lines suggested by South Australia. The method of correction- is somewhat complex: the details are clearly set out in the report. </para>
                <para>I now wish to refer briefly to the grants which have been recommended for each State. One reason why the total of the grants this year is £106,000 less than that assessed for last year is that in 1938-39, the year on which the comparative calculations are based, the deficits in the non-claimant States were considerably heavier than in the previous year. Because of drought, bush fires, &amp;c, the comparable deficits of the standard States rose from ls. 6d. a head in 1937-38 to 13s. a head in 1938-39. Because the commission's assessment is based upon the relative financial position of the States, these heavy deficits in the standard States have tended to reduce the grants payable to the claimant States, but this tendency has been wholly or partially offset by other influences. </para>
                <para>In 1938-39 South Australia also suffered from drought, and the primary industries in that State received a severe shock. For the first time in four years that State had a deficit. The commission has allowed South Australia £10,000 more than last year on account of economy in administration, and the penalty for loan losses of the past has been reduced from 6 per cent, to 5 per cent, of normal taxation, thus assisting the grant by £39,000. Taxation was relatively more severe than, in the previous year, hut the benefit of this was largely offset by higher expenditure on social services. The net effect of all these factors is to give South Australia a grant of £1,000,000, which is approximately the same as the £995,000 paid last year. </para>
                <para>The net amount paid to Western Australia last year was £595,000. This figure was recommended by the commission after deducting from the £731,000 assessed the sum of £136,000 in order to cover the repayment of a special advance in 1937-38 to meet drought conditions in that year. The grant proposed this year is £650,000, which is higher than the net amount actually paid last year, but lower than the amount assessed. This reduction is due mainly to two causes: First, higher expenditure on social services in Western Australia; and, secondly, the more favorable budgetary position of Western Australia compared with the standard States. This latter fact was largely due to the continued prosperity of the gold-mining industry, which, despite the effects of a prolonged drought, allowed the economic position of Western Australia to be well maintained in 1938-39. </para>
                <para>In 193S-39 Tasmania's economic progress was well maintained despite the set-back in other States. This is the main reason for the lower grant to that State. Taxation was substantially increased in 1938-39, and this tended to offset the effects of the higher deficits in other States. The net result of all these factors is to give Tasmania a grant of £400,000 this year, compared with £430,000 last year. </para>
                <para>Considerable evidence i3 available that the work of the commission is thorough and impartial, and that all matters affecting the financial needs of the claimant States have been investigated. The Government, therefore, believes that the amounts recommended by the commission will adequately meet the needs of the claimant States, and, consequently, as in past years, it has decided to accept the recommendations of the commission. </para>

                        <para>. - This bill may be described as a hardy annual. When the subject of assistance to the claimant States is under consideration the  Senate functions as a States' House I commend to the claimant States the recognition of the fact that Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria have never  opposed these grants. I still believe that we have not yet arrived at a scientific method of deciding what disabilities the claimant States suffer as the result of federation. It is entirely wrong that those States should be placed each recurring year in the position of mendicants. Despite the remarks of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McBride)</inline> in his second-reading speech, it seems to me that the State which does its best to put its own financial house in order is penalized under the present method of arriving at the amount of compensation to which it is entitled. The most extravagant of the claimant States is able to present the strongest plea for assistance, if it has the largest deficit. I gathered from the speech of the Minister, and from the report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission itself, that an attempt is being made to investigate the system of allocating the grants. As in the case of similar bills, the Opposition will not delay the passage of this measure. </para>

                        <para>. - The claimant States have taken years to convince the Commonwealth authorities that in assessing the amounts of the grants from the Commonwealth, allowance should be made for the varying economic conditions prevailing in those States. But, even now, the method adopted in arriving at those amounts is unscientific. The Treasurers of the States are prevented from preparing their budgets until they know the amounts of the grants to be received from the Commonwealth. The largest grant is given to the State which has been most extravagant in its expenditure. If Tasmania cuts down its expenditure it is penalized accordingly. For weeks the Treasurer of Tasmania had to postpone the opening of the State Parliament this year because he could not ascertain the amount of the grant to be allotted to that State. Consideration should be given to the important fact that Tasmania does not share in the war expenditure. A good deal of friction has arisen between Victoria and New South "Wales as to the distribution of that expenditure; but, as Tasmania receives no portion of defence expenditure, it seems to me that is has the strongest reason to complain about the amount of its grant. Until a scientific method of determining the amounts of the grants to the claimant States is found I fear that they will continue to be penalized. </para>

                        <para>. If the second-reading speech of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McBride)</inline> had been circulated, we should have been in a better position to discuss the bill. I understood the Minister to say that the Commonwealth Grants Commission had been operating over a number of years, and that the conditions under which it was carrying out its work were becoming more stabilized than in the past. He stated that the principal functions of the commission had undergone no change. If the methods by which the commission works have now become stabilized, I see no necessity for this body to travel through the smaller States every year with a train-load of secretaries and attendants. </para>

                            <para>- Members of the commission, like Ministers, take their private secretaries with them. I suggest that a saving could be effected if the commission made recommendations for the next five years. It hears practically the same evidence every year. During the year before last Tasmania was considerably penalized because the standard of its social services was higher than in the other States. The Minister said that one of the reasons why higher grants were to be given to Western Australia and South Australia was that taxes in those States had increased, and that they had deficits. It was necessary to raise their taxes to improve the standard oftheir social services, but I point out that those States receive increased grants this year because they have raised the standard of their social services. In the previous year, however, the commission victimized Tasmania because the standard of those services in that State was regarded as too high. </para>

                        has remarked that it is impossible for the Treasurers of the States to prepare their budgets until they know the sum that will be granted to them by the Commonwealth. Consequently, at certain periods of the year, developmental works are brought to a standstill, until such time as the Treasurer is advised! of how much the grant will be. This year, Tasmania will suffer hardship because lack of shipping facilities will prevent the export df its products to the other States. In recent years Tasmania has benefited considerably from tourist traffic. Prior to the outbreak of war about. 50,000 passengers travelled each way annually between Tasmania and the mainland. From November to April in the 1937-38 tourist season, the number of passengers carried by overseas vessels was 5,700, and during the same period of the 1938-39 season the number was 7,700. These figures are additional to the Easter cruise passengers who numbered 950 in 1938 and 2,219 in 1939. The passenger traffic between Tasmania and the mainland is considerable, and augments by hundreds of thousands of pounds a year the revenue of Tasmania. Owing to a shortage of ships, practically the whole of that trade will be lost this year, but that fact had not been taken into consideration by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its recommendation for this year.

                            <para>-  If the Minister will study the causes of the disabilities of the States, he will find evidence to support a grant to Tasmania of not £400,000, but £1,000,000. Tasmania has stronger grounds for receiving assistance from the Commonwealth than has any other State because so many of its citizens, after receiving their education and training in&gt; the island State, migrate to the mainland in order to obtain employment. The Minister cannot deny the justice of this claim. It would be better for the grant to be made on the basis of three or five years than that the commission should undertake a trip annually to Tasmania merely in order to obtain endorsement of evidence already in its possession. </para>

                        <para>.- I am disappointed at the amount proposed to he granted to Tasmania this year, and I thought that the Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(.Senator McBride)</inline> would have given reasons why the Commonwealth Grants Commission had fined that State £30,000. Having read the report of the commission, I cannot find in it anything which would lead me to believe that this reduction is fair.

                    <para class="block">Apparently, the reduction of the grant by £30,000 was due to the position of the State railways and the absence of heavy expenditure by municipal councils. On page 53 of its sixth report, the commission stated, in paragraph 118. -  118. The position of the Tasmanian railways has been fully explained in our Fifth report. The burden of the railway deficit continues to be a crushing one in Tasmania, the total loss for 1937-38 being over £500,000. In its last report the commission pointed out that, in its opinion, the increase in personnel in recent years was not justified, and for thai: reason a nominal penalty was imposed. </para>
                    <para class="block">Last year, I pointed out that during the depression not all of the rolling-stock belonging to the Tasmanian railway was used, and, instead of being covered, was left in the open, where it depreciated. </para>

The present Labour Government of Tasmania made a determined effort, to put the railways on a sound basis by employing numbers of men to put the rolling-stock in good repair, so that it would be of use when required. Since then, the traffic on the railways has increased; but because the present Government followed that wise course, it is now to be penalized. The report continued - </para>

                        <para>The figures of the numbers of railway employees presented to. the Commission show that, notwithstanding the continued drift i" railway finances and the decrease in railway revenue in 1937-38, there was practically no change in the numbers of employees in the year under review, viz., 1037-38. The Transport Commission recently appointed has not yet had an opportunity of dealing with this question, but we feel that some notice must be taken by the  Commission  of the position existing in 1937-38, the year on which the present grants are based. </para>

                    <para>On numerous occasions, my colleagues and I have pointed out that Tasmania is the school from which the other States draw some of their most valued citizens, but the Commonwealth Grants Commission has never taken into consideration the co=t of education in Tasmania. In 1938 Tasmania's loss of population was 1,153 ; in the following year, it was 124. Between January, 1901, and June, 1939, the total natural increase of Tasmania's population was 121,449, but the State lost 57,703 by migration to the other States. The commission should recognize that the bench. of Tasmania's education system is reaped largely in the other States. I could continue in this strain, but I realize that it would be useless, because no notice is taken of the arguments put forward in support of the better treatment of Tasmania. Representatives of that State hope that in future Tasmania will receive a fixed grant for a number of years. </para>
                    <para>The recent budget proposals will impose additional hardships on Tasmania, benn use the majority of its taxpayers come within the salary range, £200 to £600. The additional levy on such incomes will reduce the purchasing power of those taxpayers, and will be reflected in decreased business. The State Treasurer has asked that these matters be taken into consideration, but nothing has been done. As I have said, it seems useless to present to the Commonwealth Government any evidence to support Tasmania's claim for a larger grant. </para>

                        <para>. -  Honorable senators will recollect that, for a number of years, the subject of grants to the necessitous States has been discussed in this Parliament, and that the conditions governing such grants were left to the judgment of the Parliament, which is the final arbiter in the matter. Each year the question has arisen as to whether the larger States should make these contributions to the less fortunate States, which, through no fault of their own, have been unable to balance their budgets. Honorable senators recognize that "Western Australia and Tasmania have suffered special disabilities under federation. The terms of reference to the Commonwealth Grants Commission provide that inquiries may be conducted into the disabilities suffered  by  any  of  the Australian States, and that recommendations shall be ?r&gt;ade to the Government with respect to the grants to be paid.  Obviously,  it  is  very difficult for the commission to determine the actual disabilities suffered  by  a State such as Western Australia, which has a large undeveloped area, and to decide what financial assistance should be rendered. Honorable senators representing Tasmania have spoken, with some justification, regarding the disabilities experienced by that State, and I am sure that the suggestions brought forward today have some substance. When inquiry was being made into Tasmania's finances the Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dwyer-Gray,</inline> and many other witnesses were examined, and round-table conferences were held in order to reach a just conclusion. Obviously, it would be impracticable to adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett's</inline> suggestion that the commission should be disbanded and grants to the claimant States be fixed by the Government for the next five or ten years. Should that be done, South Australia, for instance, which might experience a successful year, would receive a fixed grant, even though some of the States which indirectly provided, the money, had experienced adverse conditions. Obviously, a. policy under which a State which was showing a deficit would be obliged to contribute to the revenue of another State which showed a surplus on the year's activities, could not be tolerated. We should have confidence in the commission, because it desires to deal justly with the claimant States. The commission is beyond the realm of party politics, and I am prepared to accept its recommendations. In effect the commission is an umpire, the decision of which we should accept without complaining. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> seemed somewhat perturbed concerning the position this year. It is not for us to anticipate the findings of the commission, but rather to expect that they will be reached without bias, and with due regard to the circumstances of each claimant State. Obviously, the commission must determine whether a. State has controlled its financial activities in a business-like way, particularly in regard to expenditure. When the commission was constituted, the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> gave an undertaking that its recommendations would he honoured. There is no reason why the undertaking then given should be departed from. Even when a grant to a claimant State has been reduced, we should accept the decision of the commission unless we can point to a definite injustice. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> referred to the movement of young people from Tas mania to the mainland States. To what degree the commission should take that factor into consideration is a matter for its determination. I do not know whether corrective measures can- be taken; but it must be evident that with the huge defence expenditure now being undertaken, the less-populous States cannot offer the same facilities for employment as are provided in other States. I am afraid that the movement of young people to highly industrialized States will continue. This is not a new problem; it has been raised in this chamber on several occasions. There may be some aspects which have not been taken into account by the commission, but I am sure that all the points raised here to-day have been brought under its notice by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> and now that a decision has been given, it should be adhered to. Some honorable senators have expressed fears that Tasmania will suffer, but I submit that it is not our responsibility te anticipate what the commission will do; rather should we believe that justice will be done. </para>

                            <para>- I am not so much concerned with whether annual trips are made as I am with the necessity to conserve revenue to the greatest possible degree. I do not know the annual cost of the commission, but I do know that its members are paid fees and travelling expenses, and no doubt the total annual cost is considerable. Surely, after such a long period, the Commonwealth Government should have acquired sufficient knowledge of the disabilities suffered by the claimant States to fix the average annual amount to be payable to each State. I am sure that the States would agree if the Commonwealth Government said, " In view of all the information that we have accumulated, we consider that, say,  £500,000  annually is a fair amount to be paid during the next five or ten years ". Why is it necessary for members of the commission to make long trips, and why should heavy expense be incurred each, year in printing voluminous reports? Admittedly, economic changes may take place from time to time, but surely it should be possible to reach an understanding with the claimant States, and to fix .a flat rate for a definite period. Perhaps the Commonwealth Government could offer a lump sum and so end its liability for all time. </para>

                    <para>Unlike many other commissions, such as the petrol commission and the banking commission, which have cost this country hundreds of thousands of pounds, the Commonwealth Grants Commission has earned its money, because it has brought in reports which have been acted upon by the Government. This perennial discussion on grants to Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia provides this moral: Many difficulties would be overcome if the States were abolished. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> pointed out that Tasmania expended huge sums on education and that its young men and women were forced to go to the mainland for work. The Labour party has advocated among other matters that education should be under the control of the Commonwealth. That would lessen Tasmania's difficulties. </para>
                    <para> During the war all the States, with the exception of Victoria and New South Wales, will suffer a disability to the degree that, although the people in those States will be taxed heavily, relatively little of the millions of pounds that will be raised for war purposes will be spent outside Melbourne and Sydney. Queensland is neither a mendicant nor an indigent State. On the contrary, intelligently governed by a Labour administration, it is prosperous. It is the queen State of the Commonwealth and is making rapid progress. Nevertheless, it could be retarded in its development by unwise government in the federal arena. Queensland will not share greatly in the war expenditure. Honorable senators opposite may say that we should take a national point of view; we do so, but, if the people of a State be taxed heavily for national defence purposes and the money raised be expended elsewhere, those people cannot be employed fully and the State revenue will have to carry an extra burden. Years ago the Premier of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forgan</inline> Smith, showed clearly the disabilities under which Queensland labours. He showed that Queensland gave to the Commonwealth much more than was returned to it by the federal authorities. Tasmania suffers similarly and its sufferings will be added to while the war is in progress. It is to be hoped that the Commonwealth Grants Commission will take cognizance of that fact in assessing the grant to the State next year. Rather than have the commission continue its peregrinations through the countryside, I support the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> that the commission should be disbanded and that the claimant States should be given a fixed grant over a number of years. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - The Government appreciates the solid support given by Parliament each year to the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The support given by this chamber shows that the Senate is capable of functioning as a States' House in the way in which it was expected to function when federation was adopted. The commission has not attempted for some years to assess disabilities. It has made its recommendations for assistance on the basis of actual financial needs of the claimant States. Whilst in a particular year aclaimant State may feel that, owing to internal conditions, it is entitled to a greater grant than in the previous year, I call attention to the fact that ali financial assistance is based on the relative position of the claimant States as compared with the standard States, namely, New South Wales and Victoria. </para>

                    <para>I concede the truth of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett's</inline> submission that it is difficult without notice to deliver a reasoned speech on this or any other subject, but honorable senators do not strengthen their case by making extravagant and inaccurate statements. For example <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> inaccurately alleged that members of the Commonwealth Grants Commission travel with  a trainload of private secretaries. If the honorable gentleman had any interest in the commission he would ascertain the facts before making such a flagrantly inaccurate charge. None of the members of the commission has a private secretary. There is a secretary to the commission. The commission is one of the most economically conducted commissions that we have ever had ; its cost, including that of the secretary and the permanent staff, would not exceed £5,000 per annum, which is a trivial amount compared with the valuable services given in dealing with the expenditure of millions of pounds. </para>

                        glibly said that there should be a fixed grant to the claimant States for a period of five years. The honorable senator may be sincere in his advocacy of that suggestion, hut I doubt whether the Tasmanian Government would agree to the proposition. Indeed it is likely that Tasmania would be severely handicapped if that were done.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline>
                        tried to make the Senate believe that the grants to Tasmania had decreased continuously over the years whereas in 1934-35 Tasmania received exactly the same amount as it is to receive this year and in the intervening period the grants to that. State have widely fluctuated. A good point was made by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline>
                        Hays when he pointed out that it was likely that the claimant States next year would be entitled to larger grants than this year, because of the increased prosperity which will result in Victoria and New South Wales from war expenditure. As I pointed out earlier, the grants are computed on a relative basis, and vary according to the conditions in the claimant States.

                    <para>The Commonwealth Grants Commission has not been unmindful of the disability caused to State Treasurers through being unable to budget for the year until its report is published. On this occasion the States were perfectly well aware of the recommendations of the commission because they were released for publication on the 2nd October. </para>

                            <para>It has been urged in responsible quarters that a formula should be evolved so that special grants may be automatically fixed for a term of  years.  This question has engaged <inline font-style="italic">our</inline> close attention, but we are convinced that neither a constitutional amendment nor an automatic formula can solve the problem. Our conclusion is that the relative financial positions of the States fluctuate so considerably from year to year that any constitutional change or the use of a fixed formula may speedily become inapplicable and unjust, lt is clear that a fixed formula could not take full account of the relative effects of changes in prices, in wages, in fluctuations of trade, in unemployment, in the effects of droughts, floods and bushfires, in movements of population, as well as in the effects of external influences on the economy of the nation. We are of opinion that no specific formula can he devised which will provide automatically for these and other changes. Another factor to be borne in mind is the changing position caused by the uneven growth of Federal and State responsibilities in relation to their financial resources. We believe that financial adjustments in the form of special grants cannot be fairly assessed without a searching annual review of the finances and economic conditions of all the States. If Parliament is to be informed adequately concerning the basis of special grants to the States, all the economic movements we have mentioned, and their effects on the finances of the States, must be kept under constant observation and a year-to-year assessment made. An essential feature of this task is the building up of principles and methods of measurement which can be applied to fluctuating financial and economic conditions. </para>

                    <para>Three bills are to be submitted. The first is the Wheat Industry (War-Time) Control Bill 1940 which amends an act passed last year, keeps it operative for the period of the war, and makes amendments necessitated by the wheat stabilization scheme. The second is' a bill to tax wheat. This is to ensure that in years of good prices the excess price above the guaranteed price will be shared between the growers and the fund from which the guarantee is paid. The third is a  machinery  measure for assessment and collection of the tax. </para>
                    <para>The purpose of the Wheat Tax (War Time) Bill 1940 is to impose a tax on wheat as part of the wheat industry stabilization plan which will operate from the commencement of the 1941-42 season. Under that plan, the price of 3s. lOd. a bushel will be guaranteed to growers on all wheat, harvested after the 1st October, 1941, and acquired by the Government. The bill provides that, when the declared f.o.b. price of wheat exceeds the guaranteed price, there will be a tax of 50 per cent, of the amount of that excess. The tax will operate in the following way: In addition to the guaranteed price, 50 per cent, only of the total amount by which the f.o.b. value exceeds the guaranteed price will be paid to wheat-growers. The remaining 50 per "'nt. will be paid into the Wheat In dustry (War-Time) Stabilization Fund. When the f.o.b. value is below the guaranteed price, the Commonwealth is bound to pay wheat-growers the difference. For this purpose the Commonwealth will use the moneys in the stabilization fund resulting from tax collections before it is called upon to provide the required finance by other means. Honorable, senators will appreciate that wheat-growers will be protected in adverse seasons and will share the benefits in seasons when prices are high. I commend the measure to the Senate. </para>

                        <para>. - This legislation is of the utmost importance because it deals with one of our basic primary industries. It can at least be said that this measure and those to be dealt with in association with it represent an attempt to stabilize the wheat industry. In my opinion, the only thorough w.ay to do that .would be to adopt a stabilization scheme similar to that in operation in Queensland in connexion with the sugar industry. This measure contains a number of important details which should be watched closely by honorable senators who represent the chief wheat-growing States. Queensland does not export wheat, and, until last season, it was placed in the position of having to import supplies to meet its home requirements. Either the Government's proposals have been hurriedly prepared, or the wheat-growers have not been taken into the full confidence of Ministers. </para>

                            <para>- My remarks will apply to the whole scheme. The area in which wheat is to he grown is to be restricted. Although sugar production has been restricted in Queensland, the position with regard to wheat is different. It is not certain, from season to season, whether the wheat crop will be good, bad or indifferent. Rainfall and other factors have to be taken into consideration. Therefore, I contend that any stabilization scheme needs careful investigation. I doubt whether the problem can be dealt with satisfactorily in the piecemeal way  in which it has been approached. The only way in which to rehabilitate a large section of the growers would be to repatriate them and wipe out their debts. "Wealthy farmers occupying huge areas should not be permitted to benefit from the special measures designed to relieve necessitous growers on small holdings. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not agree to the proposals of the Government, but I shall not oppose these bills. If we take the price of wheat for any seven year period over the last 70 years, we find that the average return to the grower has been 3s. lOd. a bushel, which is the price the Government is now offering. Therefore, the present scheme amounts merely to a compulsory saving scheme imposed on the growers. Why should the wheat-farmers be singled out and forced to accept a price which imposes a compulsory saving upon them ? If the farmer experienced a favorable year, and the price of wheat rose to 4s. or 4s. 4d. a bushel, under the Government's proposals 50 per cent, of the increase above 3s. lOd. a , bushel would be deducted from his receipts to be handed back to him in a lean year. This season the harvest will be very light throughout Australia. With the flour tax, the return to the grower will be 4s. 4d. a bushel ; but next year, if this legislation be passed, a portion of that price will be taken from him. The proposals submitted by the Government should at least be on the lines suggested by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings),</inline> who advocated a stabilization scheme similar to the sugar stabilization plan. Sugar, dried fruits and butter production is now controlled by means of home-consumption prices, and a home consumption price which would return 4s. 4d. a bushel to the wheat-growers this year would be au improvement on the scheme submitted by the Government. If every wheat-farmer is to be licensed, and his production is to be restricted, the Government should also accept responsibility for his debts, .in the event of his failure. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I oppose any restriction of production. Nature takes a hand now and_again, and has done so effectively this year, but the Government should not try to restrict it. The quantity of wheat available in </para>
                    <para class="block">Australia to-day is not much more than is required in this country. Last season the production amounted to 220,000,000 bushels. The Government proposes to apply its scheme to 140,000,000 bushels, and the farmers will be compelled to cut a certain number of acres of their crop for hay. If the balance of the crop is to be cut for hay tie difference between 140,000,000 bushels and roughly 200,000,000 bushels will mean that the farmers will have to cut 6,000,000 tons of hay; but the total requirements of hay in Australia are only 3,000,000 tons a year. It is intended to ruin every grower of hay in districts where wheat cannot be grown for grain ? A scheme for the conservation of fodder is embodied in these proposals, but how could stocks of hay in the Wimmera be transported over railways of three different gauges to the interior of Queensland for use by pastoralists there? It cannot be done economically. Fodder must be conserved on the property, or as near as .possible to the place where it will be consumed. If costly freight charges have to be paid on fodder, it is more economical that the stock should be left to die. That is what happens now. I believe in the conservation of fodder, and each year conserve as much as I think necessary; but I repeat that it must be stored in close proximity to the stock which may need it. I do not propose to vote against the bill, but I submit that the only proper scheme to adopt is one which will guarantee to the farmer a certain price for his" first 1,000 bags of wheat, and require him to accept the world's market price for any balance in excess of that quantity. That would put him in a similar position to the Queensland sugar-grower. </para>

                            <para>- That applies also to sugar and butter. When the Paterson butter scheme was first established, the export of butter was small compared with the home consumption, and naturally the scheme gave a profitable return to the producer; but when the export of butter increased until it exceeded the local consumption, the scheme almost broke down. Now, the dairy-farmers receive a home consumption price for the butter consumed locally and world market price for the balance. I foresee great difficulties in operating the Government's scheme. I want to assist the wheat-growers, and therefore, I think that the Government has acted wisely in making a grant this year to necessitous farmers. I have travelled fairly extensively in New South Wales and Victoria recently and have seen the deplorable condition of some of our wheat areas. Many farmers will not grow their own seed this year, and a guaranteed price of 3s.10d. a bushel is useless to them. I do not know why this bill has been introduced at this stage, because it will not affect this year's har vest; it will apply only to next year's crop. </para>

I congratulate the Government upon making a sincere attempt to deal with this problem. There is such a diversity of opinion as to the best remedy for the problems confronting the wheat industry that if we continue to wrangle over them the growers may not receive any benefit at all. Pending the return of better conditions, I shall support these measures. </para>

                            <para>- I agree. I know of some localities in New South Wales  where, even under present conditions, wheat-farming can be carried on successfully. The wheat-growers in that district may not thank me for saying so, but numbers of wheat-growers in a big way have admitted that they can grow wheat profitably at 2s. a bushel, because they are farming excellent wheat lands which invariably experience a satisfactory rainfall. The principle of guaranteeing a certain price for the first 3,000 bushels, and that for any production in excess of that quantity the world market price should be accepted, is sound. I think that the Minister will agree that that would probably cover 75 per cent. of the wheatgrowers of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Many men can engage in pursuits other than the growing of wheat. Already many wool-growers have their own dairy farms and grow considerable quantities of wheat. It is not necessary, and it is scarcely wise, for us to legislate for the big growers, who should be able to take care of themselves, but we should ensure to the large mass of wheat-growers a reasonable chance of a fair return over a number of years. </para>

                    <para>I am not altogether in agreement with the principle of restriction of production. My objection is based on several grounds. I do not think that it is an exaggeration to say that, within a year or two, Australia may be called upon to feed millions of people who now are threatened with starvation. In those circumstances, I should not like our wheatgrowers to be bound and restricted unduly. It almost appears to be wicked to suggest a restriction of food supplies in view of the present state of the world. I shall support the bill, but I register my disapproval of the principle of restriction of food supplies at the present time. </para>

                    <para>I  agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> that the quantity grown in Australia is not too great. The time may come when we shall have to grow even more wheat for export purposes. At present drought conditions prevail, and the wheat yield has been reduced ; but that will not occur every year. I have always been opposed to a restriction of our wheat acreage. If too much wheat is produced, the crops can be cut for hay. I intend to support the bill because I believe that the wheal industry should be stabilized. I understand that this legislation was agreed to by the Ministers of Agriculture in  all  States concerned, but it is unfortunate that they did not take into consideration the cost of kerosene, crude oil, and many other commodities which will be used in the production of next year's crop. The sales tax on those items will increase the cost of production, and the result will probably be that instead of receiving 3s.10d. a bushel, the farmers will get only 2s. 9d. or 2s.10d. </para>

                            <para>- Farmers should be allowed to grow as much wheat as they desire, because, in adverse seasons, crops will be poor. The remedy for overproduction in good seasons is to cut the crops for hay. Anyone who has made the trip by rail from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie will have seen the large number of hay stacks along the route, some of which are new, whilst others have been standing for years. Unlike sugar-cane, which must be disposed of each season, wheat may be cut for hay and stored to offset over-production. </para>

                            <para>- I trust that that will be done. I understand that when a way out of the recent political crisis was being sought a strong section of the Labour movement was opposed to any further advance on wheat, but was not opposed to assistance being given to wheat-farmers whose holdings are not large enough or are unsuitable for wheat-growing, or whose plight had been made desperate by drought conditions. It is the policy of the Labour party to assist needy farmers as much as is possible, but if assistance is to be in the form of an increase of the price of wheat, many farmers who do not require assistance at this stage will benefit. More money should be provided for helping men on marginal lands who have been affected by the drought. By giving assistance to them the Government will be doing what is right. </para>

                        <para>-  I am heartily in accord with the principle of stabilized wheat prices, but I agree with what was said by Senators Gibson and Abbott concerning the limitation of the home-consumption price to 3,000 bushels or 1,000 bags. That will benefit the small farmer who cannot grow wheat as cheaply as do the large graziers employing mass-production methods. A fundamental disability of the wheat-growers is their debt burden. A price of 3s.10d. a bushel is insufficient to enable them to meet their interest commitments and other charges and at the same time make a profit. After handling charges have been deducted from the price of 3s.10d. f.o.r. the price at country sidings is about 3s. </para>

                            <para>- I am opposed to restriction of production especially at a time like this when it is essential for us to produce foodstuffs. The farmers will not appreciate being licenced in a way similar to that in which wharf labourers are 'licenced. This legislation contains a direction as to the quantity of hay that has to be cut. I favour fodder conservation, but I object to the wheat industry being singled out in the manner proposed. If fodder conservation is to be enforced it should be applicable to all primary producers. As a rule farm properties near railway sidings have better productive capacity than the more distant farms. Many of the farms far distant from the railway lines are in the marginal areas. I contend, therefore, that the home consumption price should be fixed on a f.o.r. basis railway sidings, instead of the f.o.b. basis proposed in the legislation, because costs of production and cartage rise in proportion to the distance which separates farms from the railway  sidings.  I believe that an f.o.r. price would eliminate the differentiation as between farmers which is inherent in an f.o.b. price. As the price of wheat is stabilized so should the price of bread be stabilized. When wheat was as low as1s.6d. a bushel the price of bread in New South Wales was 6d. a 2 lb. loaf. In the transition stage from wheat to bread there is an illogical rise of costs which results in the consumer of bread paying £28 a ton of flour more than the grower receives for the wheat from which that flour is produced. The producer is being robbed at one end and the consumer at the other. That calls for the stabilization of bread prices at a lower level. </para>

I do not appreciate any proposals which I have not had the opportunity to study. We have heard the Minister's second reading speech, but have not been supplied with a copy, and none but the Minister and his collaborators know precisely what is intended. Nobody who tries to understand what is meant can appreciate anything that is incompletely and inadequately presented. What are the Government's proposals. There are three bills which provide us with very little information, and apart from press reports and regulations, which have been issued from time to time, we have had no opportunity to learn exactly what is intended. I do not suggest that a book should be written, but it should  be possible to reduce to simple sentences in three or four pages what is intended. </para>

                    <para>The- " skids " are being put under the wheat industry assiduously, ingeniously and periodically in order to make the industry a private bank monopoly. It simply means the elimination of the small growers. At the same time the Government extends its blessing to the farmers in the. plight to which they have been reduced. The small growers will slowly but surely be eliminated,, until, eventually, the wheat industry, like the sugar industry, is placed on a monopolistic basis. </para>

                            <para>- I believe in the payment of legitimate- debts, but not loaded debts. I shall1 not be misled by all the economic  artificialism  about which we hear so much to-day. I commend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> for his outspoken opposition to- the principle of restriction of production. The honorable senator's remarks on this subject indicate the tendency among members of the Country party to agree with Labour's way of thinking. Gradually, they are realizing exactly where policies of the kind embodied in this measure are leading us. Restriction of production is advocated mainly in order to keep up prices. It is a feature of all industries which are controlled by monopolies. Restriction of the production of wheat is wrong, when so many of our people are in. need of wheat and its by-products. The Government and its supporters can justify this principle only on the ground that, it increases prices. The same principle is applied! in the sugar, tobacco and other industries controlled by monopolistic interests.. That is precisely the essence of. the proposals embodied in this measure. Noattempt is to be made under this scheme to compensate the wheat farmers who will be starved off their holdings. The Government, of course, does not admit, that that is part of its purpose. In the light of past experience, however, I can only come to the conclusion that the object of this scheme is to reduce great numbers of wheat-farmers to the level of labourers working for sustenance or for the basic wage. That policy is being adopted not only in Australia but also all over the: world. It is the inevitable outcome of the economic policy of this and similar governments. .When the wheat industry is thus organized on- a basis similar to that of the. sugar industry, only the few will be privileged to draw dividends from it. But such conditions will be a menace- to the great bulk of the community who will not be able to procure wheat, and its byproducts, at reasonable prices, just as- to-day they are unable to obtain sugar, or products, made from sugar, at reasonable prices- </para>

                    <para>I now propose to discuss Labour's aims in regard to wheat and to contrast its policy with that to which the Government asks, us to give our blessing by supporting this measure. Labour has three essential aims: The first is to stabilize the wheat industry as a whole and to place it on a sound economic basis ; and secondly, to protect the small growers. The Government, on the other hand, intends that the small growers shall either be driven out of the industry altogether, or be reduced to the level of the dole, condemned, with their dependants, to exist for- the rest of their lives upon the very least that those in control are prepared to award them through the medium of unemployment councils, arbitration courts- and similar tribunals. Labour's third aim is to ensure that this vital primary industry, which is of such economic value to Australia, maintains a reasonable productive capacity. The Government proposes to eliminate from the industry altogether all of the growers who are now working land " which is claimed to be unsuitable for wheat. To accomplish Labour's aims, several guarantees and safeguards are necessary. Palliatives are not sufficient. I emphasize that the Government's scheme is nothing more than a palliative; it will merely prolong the agony of the wheatgrowers, who, in the meantime, will be gradually starved off their holdings. Labour proposes that plans must be made for the future, and that, in this time of stress, we must not only consider the position as it is affected by the war, but also take into consideration the probable world position after the war. That represents Labour's argument against the restriction of production. Labour says that, so far as is humanly possible, we should increase production, and, at the same time, increase our storage facilities. We cannot have too much of the things we need, but the danger always exists that we may not have sufficient of those commodities. </para>

I do not suggest that he is trying to mislead us, but he has simply made <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> bald statement without attempting to supply any evidence in support of it. Labour will safeguard the small farmer, and prevent the production of wheat from falling into the ownership and control of a few. That is a vital point. All of the schemes, palliatives, bonuses and expedients which have been adopted by this Government in the past have been designed solely to centralize control of wheat production in the hands of a few. I repeat that the object of this scheme is to drive out of the industry the small grower, or to allow him to remain in the industry only on a basis on which he will work for a small commission, or wage, in the interests of the private banks. Labour's policy can be summed up as follows : - </para>

                        <para>. - I support the bill. The stabilization of the wheat industry has been discussed in this chamber many times, and during the last ten years various conferences  between Commonwealth and State governments and representatives of the wheat-growers have been held with a view to arriving at the most effective means to stabilize the wheat industry. I do not agree with the remarks of Senators "Gibson and Abbott and some honorable senators opposite regarding men engaged in wheat-farming in a small way. This is a war-time measure, and it is our duty not to interfere unduly with the industry as that might cause its disorganization. Big farms which are suitable for. growing wheat are not always suitable for other purposes, because of lack of adequate water supplies, or for other reasons. The difficulties of the man farming in a big way may be just as great as those of the small wheat-grower. Indeed, I predict that many small growers will come through the present crisis better than those who are farming on a much bigger scale. I warn those who have opposed the bill against interfering unduly with the industry at the present time. As I have said, this is a war-time measure, and many alterations may have to be made after the war is over. For several years the price of wheat has caused concern, chiefly because many European countries which formerly imported wheat endeavoured to become more self-contained and increased their local production of wheat. Some even became exporters of wheat. At the same time the main wheat-farming countries - Canada, the United States of America, Australia and Argentina - continued to produce as much as before ; they even increased their production in the expectation of new markets being found after the war. </para>

                            <para>- That is true also of parts of Australia. That is why I suggest that we should be careful not to "interfere unduly with the present organization of the industry. This bill conforms largely to what is known as the Wilson-Uppill plan, which I have expounded in this chamber previously. That plan, I believe, has the approval of the people generally; it has been accepted by the Labour party, various associations of wheat-growers throughout the Commonwealth, and practically every section of business and trade; it has also received the endorsement of the South Australian legislature. In the circumstances, the scheme now before us, which is almost identical with the Wilson-Uppill plan, cannot but have my approval. Reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will show that about two and a half years ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> introduced into this chamber a bill which embodied the main principles contained in this proposal, with the exception that it was to operate in peace-time and did not interfere with the then existing trading conditions. As I have said, merchants and farmers and other sections of traders accepted the proposal, which provided for a stabilized price of 3s. 3d. a bushel f.o.r. at shipping ports. The proposal now before us provides for a stabilized price of 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.b. shipping ports, which is practically the same price. Under the Wilson-Uppill plan it was proposed that farmers should pay into a fund  to be established 50 per cent, of . any price in excess of 3s. 8d. a bushel, and be entitled to draw from the fund when the price of wheat fell below 3s. 8d. a bushel. A similar provision is embodied in this measure. It was confidently expected that the Wilson-Uppill plan would be self-supporting over a number of years, but the Commonwealth Government was to be asked to contribute 3d. a bushel to compensate for tariff disabilities. That proposal was in accordance with a recommendation of the Royal Commission on Wheat. This measure provides for a guaranteed price of 3s. 10d. a bushel, and for the money derived from the flour tax, together with an amount to be obtained from other sources, if required, to be paid into a fund in order to stabilize the price at 3s. lOd. a bushel. With the exception that the plan now before us will operate under war-time conditions, it does not differ greatly from the plan to which I have referred. The Government's proposal involves a restriction of production in that it is proposed to peg production at 140,000,000 bushels a year, which is the average crop for the last five years. Notwithstanding what has been said by some honorable senators opposite I hold that the granting of a guaranteed price necessitates some measure of restriction. Even though wheat prices have been low for several years, the world stock of wheat on the 1st July, 1940, was greater than at any time since 1927. The following table shows the world stock of wheat in each year since 1927 : - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">Those figures show that, although wheat prices have been abnormally low during those years, the world stocks of wheat have increased gradually. They emphasize the need for restriction if a guaranteed price is to be offered. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> that unless care is taken difficulties may arise in the administration of this scheme. Its administration should be in the bands of a competent person who understands his job; otherwise it will be easy to disorganize the work of many farms. It may be that over a number of years a wheat-grower has sown an average of 400 acres a year, but his holding may be so sub-divided that in one year he sows 380 acres and in the following year 420 acres. Any attempt to force him to sow 400 acres every year might involve heavy costs in alterations of fencing, &amp;c, and give to his stock less satisfactory access to water supplies. In the control of acreage every care should be taken not to interfere with the economic working of farms. </para>

I realize that the Government must have this power and I do not oppose it, but I emphasize that the success of this provision will depend largely on the administration of the scheme. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> referred to land values. Generally the price paid for land is determined by its quality, its distance from the railway, and similar considerations. I know that mistakes have been made in the past, but, in the main, these factors have been taken into consideration in the price paid. It is not worth while tinkering at matters of this kind. It is not necessary to delay the passage of the bill because its purport has been thoroughly discussed by me, and by other honorable senators, on many occasions.  I emphasize, however, that the fall of the price of wheat, together with bad seasons, war difficulties, and the handling of the crop by the Government, have been serious setbacks to the farmers. Things have reached such a stage that bankers will not advance money to primary producers, and it is necessary for the Government to come to their rescue. Associated with the fate of the wheat industry is not only the welfare of the farmers, but also of the manufacturers and distributors, machi nery and other farming requisites. The farmers should be encouraged to give some attention to sidelines. The cutting of hay in good seasons is desirable, but it i3 a matter which must be handled very carefully. The farmers do not expect to make huge profits ; their main objective is to keep -in business .as are other sections of the community to-day. I am sure that farmers are quite willing to play their part in Australia's war effort so long as the returns for their labour enables them to carry on. I commend the bill to the Senate. </para>

                        <para>.- The consensus of opinion expressed in the course of debate on this measure is that the stabilization of the wheat industry is advisable, but that production should not be limited. I agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> said, and I know that the figures that he quoted in regard to Canada are correct. This year, Canadian wheat farmers have produced an enormous crop, in addition to a carry-over of 850,000,000 bushels, but production is not being restricted. Restrictions are being placed on the sale of wheat by allowing farmers to sell only one bag in four. Apparently the Canadian farmers believe, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott,</inline> that when the war is over millions of people will be on the verge of starvation, and will have to be given bread. For that reason it is good policy for us to continue to produce wheat some of which can be stored in silos. I once read that when an Egyptian tomb was opened, wheat thousands of years old was discovered, and, that when it was planted, the seed germinated showing that grain will keep indefinitely. It will be recalled that the Royal Commission on the Wheat Industry of which Professor Wadham was a member, stated that at that time mortgages on wheat lands in Australia totalled £161,000,000, yet the government of the day was issuing postage stamps bearing the inscription " Grow more wheat ". The farmers took the advice offered and grew more wheat, with the result that the price dropped to 2s. a bushel. The royal commission found that of that 2s. received, ls. lOd. was absorbed in meeting interest charges. Interest charges constitute the greatest burden which primary producers, business people and governments have to bear. There is an axiom in economics to the effect that price levels are governed by the amount of money in circulation. It is ridiculous to say that there is an overproduction of wheat when millions of people are only half fed, or are practically starving. If there be a surplus of wheat, it should be given to the people because bread is the staff of life. Feed the .hungry and there will be no need to build silos. The Commonwealth Government has decided to assist Australian wheat-farmers, but it is not obtaining the necessary money from the right source. It is merely piling up more interest charges, and when the price of wheat is stabilized, where will the money go? Not to the farmers, but to the bankers. I know of primary producers in Tasmania who have not seen a wool cheque or a wheat cheque for years. We live in a money economy, and all problems are related to money. A nation cannot carry on without money or bank credit. Why not employ the workless on building wheat silos because all the wheat grown may soon be required. Over-production of wheat started many years ago when a war seemed imminent. Italy produced wheat at a cost of 9s. a bushel as also did France, where surplus wheat was coloured green so that it would not be consumed. Limited production commenced after the last war, when farmers in England were fined for growing too many potatoes, despite the fact that millions of people were inadequately fed. The <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Orr commission on nutrition reported that 4,500,000 people in England had only 4s. a week to spend on food, while 6,000,000 had 6s. a week, and 9,000,000 had 9s. a week for the same purpose. Therefore, 19,'500,000 people had an average of only 6s. 4d. a week with which to buy food at a time when food was being destroyed, milk poured down the sewers, and production was being limited. That is what occurs under orthodox systems of managing a nation's economy. Orthodox systems will have to be discarded because, after the war, conditions will have changed. In listening to a debate in the House of Representatives I heard interesting statements made by competent wheat-growers who stated that this year's wheat crop has been barely sufficient to provide seed for next year. Restriction of production at a time when people are starving cannot be justified, and is contrary to the principles of economics. I support this bill because the wheat-growers should be assisted. In Western Australia last year I met a man whose family had occupied a holding of 1,000 acres for twenty years, but conditions were so bad that he walked off in desperation. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Uppill</inline> knows, a resolution was passed in the South Australian Parliament by seventeen votes to thirteen asking that the Commonwealth Bank be used not only to finance the war, but also to rehabilitate the primary producers. That is the only logical thing to do. While this Government is taking a step in the right direction, it is not doing sufficient to save the industry. The royal commission which inquired into our monetary and banking systems reported that the Commonwealth Bank could advance interest-free money to the Government, or to others, which includes the wheat-growers. </para>

                        <para>. - These bills are necessarily restricted to the period of the war because the constitutional power required to enable the Government to do what it intends to do is wanting in ordinary times. Perhaps it is just as well that that should be so, because we shall be able to see the effect on the great wheat industry of what is proposed by the Government. It is of considerable importance to the country that this industry should be protected and the growers enabled to carry on. The industry is one of the fundamental economic foundations of this country. When it crashed in company with the wool industry in 1929, the whole economy of this country tumbled a'bout our ears, a fact which is not recognized by a number of our people even now. Let these great primary industries on ordinary occasions suffer and the manufacturing industries in the great cities will suffer in direct proportion to their suffering. I, in common with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson,</inline> have a horror of restriction of production. To my mind it is wrong and the only justification that this Government or any other government has to interfere with the production of wheat is the fact that politicians are largely responsible for the unhappy plight of the wheat industry to-day. </para>

                    <para>That is what happened to the wheat industry. Government after government, hunting for the popular vote and following the theory now held by the Labour party, advocated sub-dividing, for wheat production, large pastoral areas in South Australia outside the Goyder line of rainfall. The same thing happened in Victoria andNew South Wales. I can speak authoritatively only of those three States, but I have no doubt that in Western Australia there are areas which are used for growing wheat on which wheat should never have been grown. Those areas may be suitable for the wheat in the years of plenty, but not in the average year, because the rainfall is insufficient. </para>
                    <para>Although I deplore restriction of production I do not think that the policy of the Government differs materially from the policy enunciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> who, if I understood him clearly, advocated limitation of the quantity of the wheat on which a home consumption price should be paid. That policy would have precisely the same effect of limiting production as would result from the Government's licensing scheme. Under that scheme, no person who is not at present engaged in the pro- duction of wheat may be licensed, but the scheme does not interfere with those persons who are established in the industry, although in the fullness of time the scheme will eliminate those who cannot produce wheat economically. </para>
                    <para class="block">I congratulate my South Australian colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Uppill,</inline> although I do not agree with some of his views, upon the Commonwealth having decided to give effect in principle to the plan which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> from time to time put forward as being acceptable to wheatgrowers. We do not want a full-dress debate on the wheat industry now, but there is a great deal more in the trouble which besets the industry than meets the eye. The decline of the wheat industry dates back to 1929. For a period of years, prior to 1929, the industry had been reasonably prosperous and profitable to the growers, but at that time the three great European importing countries, Germany, Italy and France, decided to limit their imports of wheat. </para>

"When the sons or daughters of farmers marry they are apt to buy neighbouring farms at inflated prices in order to remain in the same neighbourhood. Money for the purchase is obtained by mortgaging the formerly free property of the parent. When prices slump the farmer who has done that faces almost insuperable difficulties. The prices paid for farm lands are far too high. </para>

                    <para>Another great difficulty confronting this country is the production of wheat on unsuitable land. The sowing of marginal areas resulted from the political clamour in South Australia for the cutting up of pastoral estates. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan took any part in that clamour when he was a member of the South Australian Parliament, but I heard the politicians preaching land settlement at Pinnaroo. I saw representatives of the banks offering to finance people who would take up blocks. I was importuned to take up I do not know how many thousand acres. My friends Laurence O'Laughlin  and R. W. Foster, the latter a former member of this Parliament, were in the thick of the campaign. When I last visited South Australia on the hustings I went to a town neighbouring Pinnaroo and saw the grievous difficulties under which the farmers there are labouring. They went into wheat-growing after the land had been taken up, paying excessive prices for land which, although it may be suitable for sheepraising, is absolutely unsuitable for wheat. </para>

                            <para>- It was a measure to rectify what had happened as the result of the activities of the " talking machines " that advocated the farming of unsuitable land. Our moral duty is to assist the people who were beguiled by that talk. Even at the cost of another £12,000,000 we must get the wheat industry on to its feet. Then it must be left to work out its own salvation. Those primary industries which have been left alone and have formed co-operative organizations are doing well and if left to manage its own affairs the wheat industry will, in the long run, rise above its troubles. Experience has always shown that governmental control of the wheat industry does not pay. We must give them a chance to rid themselves, of their burden of debt. When we have done that, we shall be entitled in the future to say to any one about to engage in the industry that they do so at their own risk, and cannot expect the Government to accept any responsibility in the event of their failure. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. In view of our recent experience, I cannot imagine any future  government preaching to people to rush into any industry. Henceforth, I think, governments will prefer to leave the further development of established industries to those who know something about them. At all events, future governments would be well advised to guard against a recurrence of the difficulties which now exist in the wheat industry. Through this scheme, the Commonwealth will be enabled to say to the wheat industry: "We were partly responsible in encouraging you to saddle yourselves with a burden of debt; but now that we have discharged our responsibility in that respect, the industry must stand on its own feet". This bill, and cognate measures which will be introduced later, are designed to operate only for the duration of the war. I support the bill. </para>

                        <para>. -  I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.J.</inline> McLachlan that the wheat industry is vital to our economy, but I disagree with him on several points. It is the duty of the national government to stabilize our primary industries, and to do all in its power to place them on a sound business basis. The honorable senator suggested that we should tend to leave our primary industries to themselves, but has it not been largely due to a policy of that kind that the wheat industry is in its present difficulty? The time has gone when the national government could afford to neglect any industry of the importance of the wheat industry. We must recognize that primary industries are being encouraged in other countries in accordance with the principles of economic nationalism, and that we in Australia are not immune from the incidence of the agricultural policies of those countries. </para>

                    <para>I believe in the control of production. I do not like the term " restriction ". It has been wrongly applied in this instance. It is useless to produce any commodity for which no market exists. We cannot ignore the fact that the lack of markets has been the most serious problem confronting the wheat industry during recent years. It has been stated in this debate that the Scullin Government was responsible for encouraging production to a dangerous degree. I point out that at that time a definite market for wheat existed overseas, and as we were in a position to increase production, the Commonwealth Government acted wisely in encouraging the expansion of the industry. Most of our present difficulties are not of our own making; they are due principally to the incidence of agricultural policies of other countries. The bill is reasonable. Whilst I do not suggest that it will solve all of the industry's problems, it will, at least, assure to the grower a reasonable price for his commodity. In dealing with the problems of our primary industries, the Commonwealth should collaborate more closely with the State Governments. </para>
                    <para>Whilst it is proposed to restrict areas for wheat-growing, no indication has been given as to what use will be made of the lands which are given up. Steps should be taken to provide against the recurrence of excessive production through intensifying production on a reduced acreage. The primary producer is entitled to a price for his commodity which will return to him his costs of production plus a reasonable remuneration for his labour. That is a reasonable basis on which to deal with his problems. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> in the course of his remarks, gave us some very valuable information. I compliment him on his diagnosis of the problems confronting our primary industries. However, I remind him that in this instance, we must go a step farther ; we must solve the problem before us. I thought that he was a little astray when dealing with the wheat industry, but he was certainly at sea in his references to the sugar industry. He stated that the policy of restriction of production in that industry had proved of great benefit to monopolies. As a matter of fact, during the last three or four years, the production of sugar has been increased by 100 per cent., whilst the price to the grower has decreased by 30 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- In a country like Australia, we should not be talking about restriction of production. Rather should we be discussing the organization  of production. It is useless to expend our energies in producing a commodity over the price of which we have no control. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> said that if everybody received their quota of wheat and bread, the problems of the industry would disappear. The trouble is that our impoverished wheat-growers cannot wait for a solution of their problems until everybody is enabled to receive their quota of bread. I hope that that day will soon arrive. It is the duty of a national government to enable primary producers to receive a fair return for their labour. I admit, of course, that it is very difficult to organize production on that basis. In the sugar industry, we can control production to some degree through the mills; but not nearly to the degree which some people think. The capacity of the mills during the last four or five years has been increased by nearly 100 per cent., and the efficiency of the industry has been so intensified that to-day sugar can be produced at much lower cost than was the case even five years ago. At the same time, the consumers of sugar are receiving the benefits of that greater efficiency. However difficult the problem may be, the national Government, nevertheless, must do its best to ensure to primary producers a fair return for their labour. I believe that the general attitude of the Government towards the wheat industry is reasonable. I support the bill. I accept it as the outcome of discussions between the Commonwealth and the various State Governments. In guaranteeing to the grower a reasonable price, the scheme will greatly assist the wheat industry. </para>

                        <para>.- The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> requested honorable senators to debate this measure fully. I think that the discussion has come up to his expectations. It is proposed to restrict the production of wheat to 140,000,000 bushels, in respect of which quantity a price of 3s. lOd. a bushel, f.o.b., will be guaranteed. Should higher prices be realized, half of the surplus will be placed in a trust fund to offset losses in bad times, and the other half will be paid to the producers. Growers are to be licensed, and the scheme will operate for the duration of the war and six months afterwards. Farmers  may be compelled in certain cases to cut their crops for hay, and they will also be obliged to furnish certain returns. I welcome the bill for the reason that it will lay a sound basis on which to build for the future. Of course, it will not meet with the approval of every one. Many people complain, for instance, of the principle of restrictions embodied in the measure. Every reasonable person realizes, however, that when the Government accepts responsibility for the stabilization of an industry, it has a right to control production in that industry. All legislation bears heavily on some sections of the people, and the Government's proposal for a restriction of the acreage under wheat production will prove one of the most troublesome features of the scheme. The quantity of wheat produced depends, not so much upon the acreage sown with wheat as upon the season in which it is grown. Last harvest yielded 220,000,000 bushels, but the present harvest, sown over the same area of land, will produce only about 80,000,000 bushels. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Much has been said as to who is responsible for the present serious plight of the industry. This is due largely to the fact that efforts have been made to grow wheat on land unsuitable for that purpose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan pointed out that, in South Australia, men had been induced to become wheat-growers in conntry where they had very little hope of success. After the introduction of superphosphates, wheat-growing was regarded as a most remunerative occupation, and many people imagined that they only needed a certain area of land on which to grow wheat to enable them to become wealthy. They urged the State Government to make land available to them, and the failure of many to make good was not the fault of the Government from whom they acquired their land. In South Australia, some farmers plant a few acres of wheat every year, but do not obtain a payable crop more than once every three or four years. They have other means of obtaining a livelihood; wheat-growing being merely a side line. Last season suited such growers, and they produced a considerable quantity of wheat. </para>
                    <para>Reference has been made to the proposals submitted in the House of Representatives by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> In my opinion, his policy is not without merit. It has been supported by Senators Gibson and Abbott, both of whom are practical men, who consider that the scheme outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> is preferable to that now propounded by the Government. I point out, however, that even if the sale to the Government by one farmer were limited to 1,000 bags or 3,000 bushels the scheme would require as much policing as that submitted by the Government. If it were stipulated that a grower could not dispose of more than 1,000 bags of wheat, various members of his family would soon have 1,000 bags each. It will be seen, therefore, that the licensing of the growers is essential. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin's</inline> idea was that the Government should pay 3s.10d. a bushel for 1,000 bags from each grower, who would then have to market the balance of his crop and take the world's price for it. The number of wheat-farmers in Australia is 53,000. If the Government limited the bounty on each farm to the production of 1,000 bags of wheat, the result would be a production of 159,066,000 bushels. Australia requires only 33,000,000 bushels for home consumption, and, therefore, having bought 1,000 bags from each farmer, would have on its hands 126,000,000 bushels. Would the farmer then have prior right to market the balance of his crop, or would the Government take the first cargo vessels available? If, instead of purchasing 1,000 bags from each farmer, only 500 bags were bought, the Government would still have on its hands 45,000,000 bushels after providing for home-consumption needs. The scheme propounded by the Government provides a basis for the stabilization of wheat prices in Australia. No doubt the good judgment of this Government or any other ministry that may succeed it would ensure that mistakes discovered in the operation of the scheme would be rectified. I commend the Government upon the introduction of this legislation. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - I appreciate the sympathetic consideration that the bill has received from honorable senators. Some years have elapsed since the predecessor of this Government brought forward a scheme for the stabilization of the wheat industry. Honorable senators will realize that the war-time powers of the Government alone have enabled it to bring forward such a proposal as that embodied in this legislation. When the States were last asked for their co-operation, certain States stood out and wrecked the scheme then proposed. The present proposals have been thoroughly discussed by representatives of all of the States and also by representatives of the wheat-growers, and have been accepted without hesitation. Whilst we as individuals may have our own ideas about the details of the scheme, the Government has the satisfaction of knowing that those most intimately concerned have accepted these proposals completely. </para>

                            <para>- The position in that regard will be the same as in the sugar industry. The area devoted to wheat-growing will be licensed, and, of course, the land could be sold to a person who might not already be a wheat-grower. There will be no limit to the use of that land, but there will be a definite limitation of the area that can be placed under wheat. Some honorable senators have criticized and objected to the limitations to be imposed under the scheme. The figure of 140,000,000 bushels, plus the wheat kept on the farm for seed and stock feed, covers the average production over the last six years, and, in my opinion, no hardship would be caused if for the present the production were limited to that quantity. The scheme will be subject to annual review, and, if the market prospects improve, there will be nothing to prevent an increase of the acreage under production. In this manner the Government will limit the extent of its liability under the scheme. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice</inline> that, whilst the excess production of commodities could be indulged in in time of peace, our war effort would be impaired if commodities for which we had no sale were produced. I believe that the most that we can expect in the immediate future is that we shall market 140,000,000 bushels of wheat each year. Reference has been made to the quantity of wheat which has been sold out of the rather large crop reaped last year. On the 30th November last, 41,000,000 bushels remained unsold in Australia and, in addition, we had 36,000,000 bushels which had been sold, but not shipped. That is to say, there was stored in Australia on that date 77,000,000 bushels of last year's crop. </para>

The honorable senator's dissertation on wheat to-night was similar to a speech which he delivered some time ago in a wheat-growing district of Victoria. Having heard the honorable senator to-night, I am not astonished that the farmers who heard him took very little notice of his statements, because they were wide of the mark. I appreciate the sympathetic approach to this bill by honorable senators generally, and confidently expect its speedy passage through the Senate. </para>

                <para>This is a machinery measure which is necessary for the successful functioning of the war-time wheat marketing scheme.

At the same time, some necessary amendments have been made because of the Government's stabilizing scheme. </para>
                <para>The Wheat Industry Assistance Act 1938 provided that all moneys collected under the Flour Tax Assessment Act 1938 shall be paid into the wheat industry stabilization fund. After providing for the special refund to Tasmania, for general tax refunds, and for payments approved by the Minister in connexion with the removal of wheat-growers from marginal areas, the amount of money in the wheat industry stabilization fund was payable to the States in proportion to their wheat production, and the States paid out the sums received by them to the wheat-growers. </para>

The advances to wheat-growers are made by the </para>

                <para>The bill also provides for the creation of a new trust fund - the Wheat Industry (War-time) Stabilization Fund - into which will be paid the moneys received from the tax of 50 per cent. on the free on board price of wheat in excess of 3s.10d. a bushel.

                <para>The purpose of this bill is to authorize the raising of moneys to be loaned to certain States, and the payment of moneys to those States for drought relief purposes. As the result of prolonged drought conditions throughout Australia it was found by September last that immediate action was necessary in order to avoid excessive losses of live-stock and extreme hardship in the areas affected. There was still a possibility that the position with respect to live-stock in a number of districts would be improved by favorable rains, but over a. large area the position with respect to feed and crops was regarded as hopeless, and that, should unfavorable conditions continue for another two months, heavy stock losses appeared unavoidable unless special provisions were made. On the 27th September last, a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers was held to discuss the subject of drought relief, and the problem received further consideration at two subsequent conferences of representatives of the Commonwealth and the States. At the request of the Commonwealth the State governments prepared and presented outlines of the proposals which it desired should operate in the respective States. Those proposals were considered by the Commonwealth to be reasonable and sound, and a drought relief plan acceptable to the Commonwealth Government and the governments of the States was agreed upon. </para>
                <para>The main points of the plan included the provision of finance for drought relief purposes, and the assurance that any moneys so provided would be used in the best interests of drought-stricken farmers. The amounts totalling £2,770,000 required by the individual States concerned to put their proposals into effect are shown in clause 3 (2) of the bill. Of this sum the Commonwealth has already made £950,000 available to enable the States to meet cases of immediate urgency. </para>
                <para>With the approval of the Loan Council, the Government decided that the necessary money should be raised through a Commonwealth loan, and that the Commonwealth should then make the sum of £2,770,000 available to the States by way of loans to be repaid on an instalment basis over a period not exceeding seven years. Interest would be payable by the States on moneys so loaned to them by the Commonwealth at the rate payable by the Commonwealth on moneys borrowed for this purpose. The bill embodies an arrangement by which the Commonwealth will meet portion of the interest which would normally be due by the States on the principal of the moneys loaned to them. This interest contribution, the administrative costs of raising the Commonwealth loan, and a straightout grant to drought-affected wheatgrowers, which is the subject of a further bill, may be regarded as the Commonwealth Government's contribution to the cause of drought relief in Australia. Honorable senators will notice that the States are being allowed a period of four years in which to make their first repayments of principal. In fairness to the States they must be given an opportunity to recover some of the moneys which they in turn will loan to the drought-stricken farmers. It will be appreciated that when a farmer has suffered a year of severe drought, it will be at least three or four years before he is in the position to repay money advanced to him during or following the drought to enable him to carry on. The bill also provides for the appropriation from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of moneys necessary to meet the Commonwealth's contribution to the States by way of interest payments to which I have previously referred. </para>

                        <para>. -  This measure involves an important principle to which our attention should be given. I commend the Government for its action in introducing the bill, and T am sure that every member of the farming community will welcome it. This afternoon reference was made by an honorable senator to the cost of various royal commissions, and I take this opportunity to remind the Government of the existence of two reports by royal commissions which have been completely overlooked. When discussing legislation passed through this chamber, the Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McBride)</inline> referred to constitutional limitations, and for that reason I think it opportune that I should remind him that it is time that the Government gave some attention to the findings of the Royal Commission on Constitutional Reform. I make that suggestion in all sincerity, because I am confident that the time will come when, by war exigencies, we shall be forced to exercise the greatest possible economy in Commonwealth and State spheres. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> will agree with my remarks about the other royal commission to which I shall refer. A great deal has been said in this chamber from time to time concerning the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems. The action which the Government is now taking could have been taken by implementing portion of that commission's report. I refer to the recommendation for the establishment of a long-term mortgage department of the Commonwealth Bank. Such a department would be one of the greatest benefits, to the farming community. Instead of this money being loaned to the States, and payments to individual farmers becoming, as they do, a matter of political patronage, the farmers could go to the Commonwealth Bank and obtain a long-term mortgage to meet expenses caused by the present disastrous drought. I know of farmers in my own electorate who, month after month, have to send to the Riverina,  400  miles away, for wheaten hay or oaten hay in order to keep alive their cattle in the Hunter district. Those persons have managed without any income whatsoever, and have been forced to draw upon their own resources, and to mortagage their properties to the private banks. </para>

                        <para>.-This bill provides for payment of  £2,800,000  to the States, which in turn will make the advance to farmers who have suffered owing to the drought conditions. The States are being allowed a period of four years in which to make their first repayment of principal. The bill is good. Nevertheless, I object to one section of the community being given special consideration year after year. I should like the Government to indicate that it has a proposal to set aside  £2,800,000  or more for the purpose of assuring men who lose their employment in secondary industry of assistance until such time as they are re-employed, the money so advanced to be repaid after four years on terms similar to those provided for the repayment of the money to be advanced under this legislation. That would be a fine gesture, and it is time that it was made. We have seen one depression and we shall see another. When it comes there should be some provision to enable those who will lose their employment to be given something more than the dole. Loans on the basis of the loans provided for in this measure would be practicable. At present the industrial worker who loses his job has only one straw at which to grasp - the Mont de Piété or some other money lending concern, which charges exorbitant rates of interest. The farmer needs assistance and I, therefore, welcome this measure, but he is no more entitled to assistance than is any other member of the community. </para>

                        <para>. - I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott</inline> called attention to the failure of the Government to give effect to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Monetary and Banking Systems. Notwithstanding that a bill introduced by a former Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> for the establishment of a mortgage bank passed the first reading in the House of Representatives, nothing further has been done towards solving the mortgage difficulties of the farmers. The proposal contained in that measure was for the sale of £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 worth of  inscribed  stock and even more debentures in order to find the money on which the bank would operate, in spite of the fact that the Commonwealth Bank had assets to the value of more than £90,000,000. If that bill had become law the result would have been disastrous. I am afraid we would have seen the last of the Commonwealth Bank. Honorable senators opposite laugh, but it is the laugh of ignorance. </para>

                        <para>. - I emphasize the point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett,</inline> namely, that the drought-stricken farmers should be helped with a grant direct from consolidated revenue. By that means, those in the best position to pay would do so. That would be equitable, because, when seasons are prolific and profits are large, the people who will be asked to lend this money to the Government reap most of the profits. It is a perfectly legitimate request that in times of distress the sources from which profits are drawn should be the sources from which relief is provided. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> rightly said, the lending of this money to the farmers will add to their burdens, and tighten their chains of economic servitude. This is not a proposition for relief; it is a proposition to prolong the agony, to bleed the farmers white and to reduce them to the lowest level possible. Probably when that level is reached, as it was reached in the United States of America, there will be repudiation, and the people who will make this loan will hold up their hands in holy horror  and point  to the poor starved farmers as being recreant to their trust. If <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Government were sincere  and  intended to give the farmers relief, it would give the money to them and not lend it. All that the farmers ask is that they get hack from the pool a little of the money that  theyput  into it. I should not be doing my duty to the people who need help if I did notpoint that out. </para>

That conference agreed upon the manner in which these funds should be allocated. I understand that the Premier of Tasmania did not desire to share in the allocation. The sum of £2,770,000 will be accepted by the States as a loan from the Commonwealth, and the manner in which the funds will be disbursed will be decided by the States. They can distribute the money as they think fit, either by way of loans, or as straight-out gifts. </para>

                        <para>. -  I support the measure because it will be the means of assisting many of our citizens who are faced with destitution. However, the Government has been dealing with this problem in piece-meal fashion for the last ten years. During that period the man on the land has been making superhuman efforts to overcome his difficulties. Surely the time has now arrived when the Government should endeavour to provide a permanent solution of this problem. If it is not studied from a national viewpoint, it will constantly recur. In this time of stress, when the Government possesses extraordinary powers, and the people are prepared to accept drastic legislation in the national interest, the Government should take this opportunity to handle it on a permanent basis. </para>

Most of the trouble is due to the fact that the people now in difficulty either paid too high a price for their properties, or because most of the holdings are not sufficiently large to yield a reasonable return. Unless this problem be dealt with on a permanent and nation-wide basis with the object of arriving at a definite solution, the day will come when our internal debt, like our war debt, will reach overwhelming proportions. </para>

                    <para>The purpose of this bill is to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund a sum of £1,000,000 which will be made available to the States as grants for the purpose of drought relief to wheat-growers. Provision for this amount to be paid to wheat-growers, whom the drought has seriously affected,  was included in the amended budget proposals. Allocations to the individual States will be determined by the Governor-General in Council after the Minister has conferred with Ministers representing the six States. The methods to be adopted by any State to alleviate hardship suffered by wheat-growers within its boundaries in consequence of drought must be approved by the Commonwealth before a grant will be made to that State. </para>

I am in hearty accord with the main purpose of the clause, but careful classification of the growers is desirable. Well-to-do wheat-farmers would suffer no great hardship if they experienced an unfavorable season. </para>

                    <para>The purpose of this bill is to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund a sum of £750,000 for the repayment to the Commonwealth Bank of advances made by the bank for the purposes of the National Security (Apple and Pear Acquisition) Regulations. By October, 1939, it was apparent that, owing to war conditions, the normal channels of marketing apples and pears would not be available for the 1940 crop. Those fruits did not appear in the priority lists of the Government of the United Kingdom, and it appeared extremely doubtful whether any of our. apples and pears would be exported to the United Kingdom. </para>
                    <para>The Government was forced to consider new methods of disposal and marketing, and it was decided that acquisition by the Commonwealth of the 1940 crop of apples and pears, as from the 1st March, 1940, was the only means to avert chaotic conditions in the industry. Provision for an acquisition scheme was made by regulations which were promulgated under the National Security Act in November, 1939. </para>
                    <para>It was necessary that finance should be provided for the Marketing Committee of the Australian Apple and Pear Board, which was the body charged with the administration of the 1940 acquisition scheme. Under normal marketing conditions, apple and pear growers receive assistance from outside persons or firms in the form of cash advances, fertilizer supplies and orchard requisites, for the production and harvesting of the coming crop. It was necessary that the Commonwealth, having decided to acquire the 1940 crop, should come to the assistance of growers to enable customary practices in regard to the production and harvesting of that crop to proceed. </para>
                    <para>It was decided that advances should be made to growers, and that such advances would be offset against realizations from sales of fruit acquired. As a first advance, the Government agreed to make payments to individual growers at the rates of 2s. a bushel on apples and 3s. a bushel on pears, payable in two instalments, on 75 per cent. of the assessed crops of apples and pears. Crop assessments were made in January, 1940. As an inducement to growers to pick their fruit in its best condition, and expedite delivery to the marketing committee's agents the Government later agreed to pay growers a further advance of1s. a bushel on both apples and pears of prescribed quality delivered to the marketing committee. Funds were also required by that committee to provide for costs involved in the packing, transport and marketing of the fruit and for administrative and publicity expenses. </para>
                    <para>In accordance with regulation 25 of the National Security (Apple and Pear Acquisition) Regulations, arrangements were made with the Commonwealth Bank to advance sums totalling £3,078,125 for the above-mentioned purposes, subject to the following conditions: - </para>

                    <para>Although the marketing of the 1940 apple and pear crop has not been completed, it is apparent at this stage that the operations of the marketing committee in respect of that crop will result in a substantial loss. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators are asked to approve the appropriation from consolidated revenue of the sum of £750,000, which will enable the Government to honour its guarantee to the Commonwealth Bank in respect of the deficiency between realizations from sales by the marketing committee of fruit which the Government acquired, and the total amount expended by the marketing committee in the administration of the acquisition scheme from moneys advanced by the Commonwealth Bank. </para>
                    <para>It is not anticipated that the sum which the Government will he asked to pay the Commonwealth Bank by the 31st December, 1940, by reason of this deficiency will reach the figure of £750,000 which is now before honorable senators. It is desired, however, to avoid the necessity for a further request to Parliament, in the possible event of the amount for which approval is sought at this stage having been understated. </para>
                    <para>A number of factors have operated to prevent the 1940 acquisition scheme from being a financial success. Honorable senators will remember the unprecedented weather experienced in all States in late March and early April this year. Not only was the estimated crop reduced by about 3,000,000 bushels, thereby upsetting the earlier assessments on which advances had been paid, but the abnormal conditions also had a detrimental effect on the size and quality of the fruit. The keeping properties under cool storage conditions were affected to such an extent that considerable repacking was necessary later in the season and costs were thereby greatly increased. Further quantities of fruit on which advances had been paid were lost at that stage. Moreover, the weak condition of many varieties, after removal from store, depressed prices, resulting in a fall in the anticipated proceeds from sales. Increased freights and insurance costs further inflated the marketing costs. </para>
                    <para>Fortunately the Government was able to arrange for the shipment to the United Kingdom this year of about 2,000,000 cases of apples and pears at very satisfactory prices.Whilst this figure is much less than 50 per cent. of normal pre-war exports to United Kingdom and continental markets, the realizations from such shipments were an important addition to those from sales of the balance of the crops. </para>

                        <para>. - I protest against the action of the Government in asking the Senate to consider this measure, unless further information is supplied regarding it. The bill has become necessary as a result of bungling administration. The matter has been investigated by the Auditor-General, and senators are entitled to be notified beforehand  of the  introduction of the bill  so that they may  be able to investigate  the position and  view the proposal  in  proper perspective. I understand that the bungling occurred, in the first instance, over the assessment of the crop. The Government proposes to pay to the growers 2s. a case in respect of 75 per cent. of the assessed crop. Probably because of seasonal conditions, the crop did not prove to be as bountiful as was expected. The fruit in many orchards was not picked at all. The  Government  paid at the rate of 2s. a case for large quantities of fruit which it did not receive; instead of paying for, say, 75 cases which it actually received, it paid for 100 cases. There is something wrong when such things occur, and this Parliament should cause an investigation to be made. I protest strongly against the. introduction of this measure at this stage. I ask that consideration of the bill be postponed until to-morrow, so that  we  may obtain further information concerning it. The Minister informed us that 2,000,000 cases of apples and pears had been shipped to the United Kingdom, but he did not indicate the proportion of apples to pears. I understand that the. apples realized 10s. a case, f.o.b. I submit that this Parliament should be given further information before it is asked to agree to the expenditure of this huge sum of money. </para>

                        <para>.- In accordance with the policy of the. Labour party, I support the granting of assistance to whatever section of primary producers needs it, but I was amazed to hear the Minister say that the anticipated loss this year on this scheme will be about £750,000. Not many weeks ago the Minister told us that shipping space for fresh fruit would' not be obtainable. If that be so, it is probable that a similar position will arise next year. With  war  expenditure amounting ' to £186,000,000 this financial year, I suggest that this policy needs examination. I speak as a consumer. In the city where I live, apples and pears  cannot  be bought under 6d. or 8d. a lb., notwithstanding that the quantity of  fruit  produced is so great that it  cannot  be disposed of. Why is there a loss of £750,000 on this  scheme at a time when the people of Australia cannot obtain fresh apples and pears? I am credibly informed that large quantities of fruit have been destroyed. If the loss last year, when shipping was available, amounted to £750,000, I shudder to think what future losses will be. I ask the Minister to inform us how many growers are concerned, what shipping space is available, and what proposals the Government has in mind for dealing with next year's crop? </para>

                        <para>We, the growers in the Melbourne metropolitan districts of Vermont and Wantirna, wish to bring before your notice the reasons why we are opposed to the acquisition of apples and pears. </para>
                        <para>At the outset we wish to state that, in common with most fruit-growers, we fully realize that although we are willing to carry on without financial help, some assistance will be necessary to certain apple and pear-growers in Australia if they ave to carry on until the end of the war. </para>
                        <para>We contend, however, that such assistance can bo given more cheaply and to better advantage to all by means other than acquisition. </para>
                        <para>We wish to state emphatically that we are not grower speculators. We have for many years disposed of the fruit we have grown by the most economical form of marketing, that is by direct sales to consumers and retailers. It is from knowledge so gained that we have reached the conclusion that any acquisition scheme must be unfair and uneconomical. </para>

In the first place there are multitudes of values. When the fruit has been reduced to varieties, grades and sizes, there are also values within those varieties, grades and sizes. Some packs have that little bit extra in appearance and quality which renders them more attractive to the best buyers, who are prepared to pay considerably more for these packs. </para>

If I were an experienced grower and could speak from experience, I could say whether I could support the statements, but when a communication is sent by an influential section of the community, it is my duty as a representative of the people to bring the communication before the Government for its consideration. These are the views of men directly connected with the subject-matter of the bill now before the Senate, although they may not be the views of the Government. Had the Government given more consideration to the views of those directly concerned, a great deal of dissatisfaction would have been avoided. </para>

                        <para>. -  I had no intention of taking part in the debate on this bill. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have given a ruling, which we must accept; hut I ask what will happen if this practice be continued? The bill has nothing to do with the legislation under which a board was appointed to handle the Australian apple and pear crop. We are now told that this discussion is in order. Whilst I have no desire to delay proceedings at this late hour, and in spite of the fact that I wish to deal with a very important matter upon the motion for the adjournment, I feel impelled to say that this ruling opens up the whole question of govern mental control of commodities. One of the most important planks in the Labour party's policy is that additional governmental control should be exercised, not only in primary production, but also in secondary industries. Because of that, we, in Queensland, are very proud of the fact that the Government of that State takes control of the whole of the sugar produced in that State. </para>

                            <para>- I am not speaking of sugar; I am merely stating that an important plank of the Labour party's policy is that a greater volume of Australia's primary production should be brought under governmental control. The people whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> has been quoting are scabbing on that policy, and would have wrecked the whole acquisition scheme. Under your ruling, sir, the whole question of the acquisition of primary products is thrown into the arena, and any honorable senator who believes in acquisition schemes has a right to be heard. As Leader of the Opposition in this chamber I wish to make my position quite clear. I do not propose to allow, without protest, remarks to be made by any member of my party in opposition to government control. </para>

I am merely drawing attention to the fact that a certain matter which has nothing to do with the bill  has  been brought before the Senate. The Commonwealth Bank made certain advances which it is proposed to repay. The losses which occurred were due to unprecedented seasonal conditions, which not only prevented the anticipated quantity of fruit being marketed, but also seriously affected the quality of the fruit. I repeat that I am not trying to lecture any one. If we are to continue to have extraneous matters introduced into our discussions it will be very difficult to carry on the business of this Parliament. </para>

I only say that they were made on a bill to which they had no application. I do not want either of my colleagues to feel that I am referring to them. My reference was to the letter which was read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron.</inline> The writers of that letter desire to break down the apple and pear acquisition scheme. My protest now is not against this matter being raised; it is against such matters being discussed at an inappropriate time. The motion for the adjournment or an appropriate bill provides an opportunity for honorable senators to bring grievances before the chamber. It would sometimes appear that too much kindly lenience is shown by the Chair. - </para>

                        <para>.- I sincerely hope that the Government will not take any notice of the letter read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron.</inline> The apple and pear acquisition scheme must be studied from an Australian basis and not from a State or city basis. For years the apple and pear industry of Tasmania has not only supplied the Sydney market, but also developed an export trade to Great Britain which has been of great value to Australia's economy. Under war conditions that export trade has ceased. Tasmanian fruit-growers have as much right to participate in the Melbourne and Sydney markets as they have a liability to pay taxes which are expended in those cities. </para>

                        <para>. - Probably some of the passages in the letter read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> are true. There were many anomalies in the original apple and pear acquisition scheme; but the Government learned a lot from its operation. The loss of £750,000 that was incurred on the apple and pear crop resulted from bad administration. One instance of bad tac dcs was the removal of apples from cold storage in Melbourne and their shipment to Sydney where they sold at about ls. a case, which was insufficient to meet the freight. Another instance was transporting apples and pears to a ship that was fully loaded and tipping of the fruit into the water when it was found that it could not be shipped. That occurred when children were starving. In Tasmania, owing to the marketing restrictions, fewer apples were consumed last year than in previous years, in spite of the fact that more were available owing to the interruption to the export trade. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> wishes to destroy the acquisition scheme. </para>

                            <para>- The people who prepared the statement, which was read by the honorable senator, waited until mines in Bass Strait prevented Tasmanian growers from reaching the mainland market before they showed their hand. The growers in Victoria and in New South Wales should know that if sufficient ships were available to take the Tasmanian crop to the mainland, where it could be sold in open competition, Tasmanian growers would sweep the market. Especially in this crisis,  we must have orderly marketing, not only of apples and pears, hut also of all commodities. The need for orderly marketing will be demonstrated more than ever in the coming season because a quantity equal to the 2,000,000 cases of apples and pears, which were shipped to the United Kingdom last year, will in all probability remain in Australia this year. The Apple and Pear Marketing Board, therefore, will have to dispose of at least 2,000,000 more bushels this year than last year. No doubt there will be a loss on the fruit, but with proper administration it ought to be kept down to a minimum. The prices for the ensuing year will not be so bad when cost of cases, packing, &amp;c, are added. </para>

                    <para>The object of the bill is to restore the payment of a bounty on the production of wire netting in Australia. Prior to the 3rd May, 1940, bounty was payable at the rate of 9s. 7d. a ton, but owing to the definition of "duty of customs" in section 3 of the principal act passed in 1939, the imposition of a special war duty under the customs tariff (special war duty proposals), which came into operation on that date, had the effect of cancelling the bounty previously payable. </para>
                    <para>In section 8 of the principal act the rate of bounty is prescribed at 9s. 7d. a ton, but it is provided that if the rate of duty be increased such reduction shall be made in the rate of bounty as is equivalent to that increase. The rate of duty under the intermediate and general tariffs prior to the 3rd May, 1940, was £5 a ton, and the special war duty proposals imposed an additional duty of 10s. a ton. As the increased duty was more than the rate of bounty the payment of bounty ceased. Wire netting is free of duty under the British preferential tariff, and the special war duty would not apply to any importations coming under that tariff. Actually wire netting is not being imported into Australia, and, consequently, no special war duty is being collected. Thus the increase of duty is only theoretical and does not give any advantage to Australian manufacturers. </para>
                    <para>The Tariff Board's report of the 30th May, 1939, expressed the opinion that the bounty could be withdrawn without detriment to the wire netting industry, but the Government decided to continue the bounty in order to afford the Western Australian Netting and Wire Company Limited, Western Australia, a reasonable opportunity to establish its operations on a firm footing. That company suffers the disadvantage of having to pay full freight on wire rods procured from the eastern States and to sell the finished product at the common c.i.f. price which applies to all main cities in the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>Without the bounty the position of this company would be gravely affected. Moreover, the Government is of opinion that it is sound and expedient for national reasons to encourage manufacture, wherever possible, in more than one State, especially if the State concerned be far distant from other sources of Australian supply, and is a substantial user of the product being manufactured. </para>
                    <para>Clause 2 of the bill makes provision for the amendment to operate as from the 3rd May, 1940, the date on which the special war duty proposals came into operation. Clause 3 amends the definition of " duty of customs " by excluding any duty expressed by a customs tariff or customs tariff proposal to be imposed as a special war duty of customs. The definition, as amended, reads - " Duty of customs " means the duty of customs chargeable in pursuance of any customs tariff or of any customs tariff proposal introduced into the House of Representatives, but does notinclude any duty expressed by the customs tariff or customs tariff proposal to be imposed as a special war duty of customs. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the measure principally because it seeks to encourage an industry which is being firmly established in Western Australia. Indeed, the manufacture of wire netting is one of the few secondary industries established in that State. The State Government is giving every support to that industry. It has been said that the Netting and Wire Company of Western Australia is linked financially with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. Actually, there is no connexion between the two firms. I also point out that under this legislation profits are limited to 6 per cent. </para>

                    <para>I take this opportunity to emphasize the need, from a defence point, to decentralize industries.

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to validate the agreement of the 20th November between the Commonwealth and the Commissioner of Waterworks for the State of South Australia for the purchase of water under what is known as the MorganWhyalla water scheme. This scheme provides for the building of a pipe line, with the necessary pumping stations and reservoirs, from Morgan, on the River Murray, to Whyalla, on the western side of Spencer's Gulf, and is designed to provide a water supply to the districts as. far north as Port Augusta, and to new industries at Whyalla which can only be established at that centre provided an adequate supply of water is made available. </para>
                    <para>The agreement is for a period of twenty years, and provides for the purchase of water for Commonwealth railways purposes at Port Augusta at the rate of 2s. 4d. for each 1,000 gallons. The Commonwealth has agreed that, regardless of the quantity of water used by the Railways Department, it will make minimum payments to the State, during each year of the currency of the agreement, equivalent to one-half of any loss that the State may incur during the year in Working the undertaking, but not exceeding the sum of £37,500 in any year. Should the loss in any year not exceed £25,000 the Commonwealth will not be called upon to make any payment under the minimum payment clause of the agreement, but will be required to pay only for water actually used. </para>

I draw the attention of the Senate to a state of affairs developing in Australia which is entirely inimical to the best interests of this country. I shall preface my remarks by quoting the following statement made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> : - </para>

                        <para>When it is realized that on the war hypothesis I have stated (that is, a three years' war) we will have behind us three years of intense experience of financial control, of trade control, of price control, of bulk selling and of bulk buying, it will be at once seen that nobody can foretell what changes of a permanent kind in the relations between government and business may be produced by the present struggle. </para>

                    <para>I do not know whether honorable senators are aware that there exists in the two principal States of Australia an active organization whose objective is to overthrow that form of government to which we who belong to the British Empire are accustomed.

                    <para>Men are being drilled and armed for no other purpose than to interfere with the orderly forms of government at a time considered in certain quarters to be appropriate. If honorable senators desire confirmation of my statement, I suggest that they confer with some of the men concerned in the movement to which I refer with whom they are acquainted. If they get in touch with the heads of some of the big firms in Sydney and Melbourne, it will be found that they have key men who are known only by numbers, and are drilled in the use of arms, so that when, in the opinion of their employers and of those who have made these subversive statements, their business is threatened by a government which would not be pliable to their demands, action could be taken. A definite demand is being made to arm the branch of our defence forces which is willing to undertake home defence duties. Members of rifle clubs are being specially detailed for their ordinary practice and are to be given a distinguishing mark, so that in time of trouble they will be available. The kind of trouble referred to is similar to that which may be expected from the governments overseas which are responsible for the present war. Ths Investigation Branch of the Attorney-General's Department has an elaborate organization which is doing very effective work, and it should be asked to inquire whether what I have stated is correct. </para>

            <para>A further development occurred yesterday, when I asked a question in the Senate and did not get a satisfactory answer. The New South Wales branch of the Australian Journalists Association is interested in this matter, because one of its comrades who wrote the report to which I have referred, and others who wrote similar reports for other newspapers by whom they are employed, were summoned as witnesses at an inquiry now being held <inline font-style="italic">in camera.</inline> These men, whose jobs are at stake, and whose veracity is being impugned, asked to be represented by counsel. That request was peremptorily refused, although their accusers, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robb</inline> himself, were present with counsel conducting their case for them. In my opinion, this is all part of a plan. Certain forms of government are distasteful to these people. The implication of the remarks made at the conference was that if senators on this side do not join a national government, the returned soldiers would see that we do. The suggestion, was that if, when the soldiers returned from the war, a government of a character not acceptable to them was in office, they would see that they had the right kind of government, and every returned man would be behind them. </para>

It was obviously an attempt to burke further publicity on the matter The Assistant Minister seems to doubt the statements that I have read from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> but they are all quotations, and the reporters are being put through the "third degree" regarding them.

Yet these reporters are being pilloried before the inquiry, and treated as having been convicted, before they have had a chance to state their case, whilst they are not allowed the advantage of legal representation. </para>

                            made that statement in Canberra at the federal congress of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, which was assembled at the Seat of the National Capital. There is no doubt that a faked photograph was taken of the Parliament in session, and that the figures of members were eliminated from the picture in order to justify a statement that the House was empty, and that members were not carrying out their duties.

There are people in this country who are definitely determined that the forecast of the Prime Minister shall not come true. I am confident that the Prime Minister has no sympathy with the proposals to which I have referred, but he did say, and we all believe, that we shall never return to the conditions that existed before the war, but that there will be in the future a different and, we hope, a better order of society. It may be a modified form of socialism or it may be - although I hope that it will not be - some form of communism. But if these interests are not checked it will definitely be a Fascist organization. There are men in this Parliament, particularly in the other branch of the legislature, who are not behind encouraging the Fascist idea that is already abroad in the community. I should not be half so demonstrative if honorable senators opposite did not sit in their places, with smug looks of satisfaction and indifference on their faces, and, by interjection, suggest that there is nothing in what I say. There is not a man connected with big business in New South "Wales or Victoria who does not know that the organization referred to in this paragraph is definitely at work trying to put into operation what is said here. </para>

Honorable senators opposite would resent such a statement if said in their hearing. But they dismiss this newspaper report without protest because they know by whom it was said and to whom it referred ; it referred not to them, but to us. The paragraph continues : - </para>

The delegates represented the league, and spoke in the name of the league when they said, " Unless they do it, we ourselves will take over the Government". There is no doubt as to what that statement meant. Let me continue to read from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald -</inline></para>

                <para class="block">Do we not now take the oath separately? I myself do not take the oath, and for that reason am always left to the last; but when I make an affirmation, I mean every word that I repeat. Although members are sworn in in batches, as they were recently in the House of Representatives - each of them is handed a Bible on which to declare his allegiance upon his solemn oath. In the name of all that is just and decent I ask what right these men have to question the loyalty of any member of this Parliament? Is it to be suggested that men who take a solemn oath do not mean it? When I was a younger man, a person who said what Mr.Robb is reported to have said on this occasion would not have got away with it in my hearing. I am not a pugilist, but there is enough resentment in me to take exception to a statement of that kind. </para>

                <para class="block">Will they stand at their side with their hands folded and empty? That statement contains a definite threat of force. All honorable senators remember the sad day in this chamber when the news came that France had collapsed. They remember other sad days when we were informed that one after another European country had also collapsed. A new word has recently been added to our language; every one knows what it is to be described as a " Quisling " or a " Fifth columnist ". There may have been other reasons for the collapse of France, but I say definitely that one of the reasons for that collapse was the existence of numbers  of " Fifth columnists " who had been at work to undermine the French nation. If we allow such things to happen in Australia, and the people in our midst can make statements of that nature in order to gain publicity, the Government will have to get its investigation officers on the job quickly, or we shall have in Australia an army of " Quislings " and " Fifth columnists " who will endanger the nation. I ask the Leader of the Government to ensure that the gentlemen who, through no fault of their own, are on trial are permitted to be represented by counsel. There should be a public inquiry, as only by that means will the uneasiness that exists in the minds of the people be removed. Had this man Robb been an ordinary member of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, and not the private secretary to the Governor of New South Wales, there would not have been this whitewashing inquiry, which is merely designed to protect a man who is quite capable of protecting himself. I hope that the Commonwealth Investigation Branch will be instructed to inquire into the whole of the circumstances, and, if necessary, I can give officers of that branch some useful information. I trust that the Prime Minister will instruct the Public Service Board to give these young fellows a chance. The New South Wales branch of the Australian Journalists Association is prepared to brief counsel to defend them, knowing that they are honorable men, and that their employment is at stake. At least let justice be done. </para>

That denial was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 25th November, and at the end of the article in which they were denied the editor of that newspaper added the words, " We are satisfied that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robb</inline> was not misreported in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald ".</inline> He at least stood by the men responsible for the report. The unfortunate feature of the matter is that the statements complained of were made at a returned soldiers' congress. I do not know whether the returned soldiers were having a merry party, but the fact remains that pro-Fascist statements were made and the pressmen who reported the proceedings have been arraigned before a court, and gestapo methods are being employed. In Germany the Gestapo would adopt tactics similar to those being adopted in this case. </para>

It is interesting to note that about the time the statements were made <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Citrine, general secretary of the British Trade Union Congress, speaking at the annual convention of the American Federation of Labour, which he attended as a delegate, said: "I want you to make the American workshop democracy's first line of defence. Britain will fight until the dictatorships in Europe are abolished." While that appeal was being made to the workers of the United States of America to assist Great Britain in its war effort, persons like Robb, Sharland and Thackaberry were telling a conference of returned soldiers in Canberra that the Prime Minister of this country should be set up as a dictator. A precedent for subversive activities was established some time ago when members of the New Guard, led by  Colonel Eric  Campbell, drove in motor cars to Banks town and battered people with iron bars. </para>

De Groot is now an officer in the military forces. The New Guard is not a defunct organization. It is still in existence, and people such as Robb and his associates, are endeavoring to stir up public opinion. Gestapo methods have undoubtedly been employed in connexion with the inquiry now being held into the statements attributed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robb,</inline> and the " third degree " is being used. Gestapo methods have even been introduced into this Parliament because, knowing that it was my intention to pursue this matter further, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein,</inline> acting on behalf of the Government, attempted to stifle discussion by moving " That the question be now put ". The Government does not like the spotlight to be focused on this subject, but I assure honorable senators opposite that there are forces in Australia which will drive out of this country all Fascists and others such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robb,</inline> guilty of subversive utterances. There are many who profess patriotism, but who have no hesitation in letting their country down. In other countries traitors have been found in all classes of society. We must banish the Leopolds and Quislings in our midst. I am confident that unless the Prime Minister gives an assurance to-morrow that some action is to be taken against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robb,</inline> the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> and members of his party, will soon have an opportunity to control the business of this country. People engaged in subversive activities should he placed in an internment camp - where they belong. </para>

                        <para>- At the moment, I shall not discuss that aspect of the matter. The inquiry was ordered by the Government, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robb</inline> is an officer. If he has made unwise or subversive statements, I am certain that he will be punished. I have known <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robb</inline> for 25 years, and I have a deep knowledge of the extraordinarily fine work that he has done for his fellow-members of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, and I refuse to listen to any statement on the subject until the result of the inquiry is known. "Why, then, should he be condemned as he has been by some honorable senators opposite merely for the sake of political kudos? I was not at the conference at which the statements alleged to have been made were uttered. I, like every other honorable senator, have had to depend on what I have read in the newspapers. It is a breach of privilege for honorable senators to try to prejudice <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robb's</inline> case. Whatever be the result of the inquiry, nothing can alter the fact that he has given enduringservice to his fellow returned soldiers in the highest position which the New South Wales Branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia can offer. As a man, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robb</inline> has earned and gained the respect of the community. Until the case is determined, he should be given a semblance of British justice and not be treated as guilty before the decision of the tribunal is known. </para>
