From the 12lh October, 1934, to the 11th March, 3937, he was again a member of the Lyons Ministry, being a Minister without portfolio directing negotiations for trade treaties.

          <para>- We meet this afternoon in a shadow of a great tragedy, assembled as we are for the express purpose of honouring the memory of those who, but a few hours ago, were with us, but now .are no more. We are more than a gathering of senators; we are a community of friends united in a common grief. We submerge our differences, and in deepest sympathy, with profound respect and great reverence, we bow our heads and say, &#34; We are sorry &#34;. On occasions such as this one realizes the utter inadequacy of words. I desire, however, to say that just as it gives one pleasure to share in the joy of others, so we hope that our sharing in their great grief may bring some meed of comfort to those who to-day mourn the death of their loved ones. Their suffering is very great indeed, and to them our  hearts  go out in fellowship. The loss to each of ns here assembled is also great, for we have been bereft of those whom  we  respected because of the signal service which they had given to the nation, in the course of which service, they made the supreme sacrifice. Australia will mourn them too. Each of those ten men so tragically removed from our midst had been called to a position of great responsibility in this tragic national crisis of war. To this duty, as he saw it. each man gave of his best. For every member of the party which I lead in this chamber I say, with a full heart, &#34;We are sorry &#34;. </para>

          <para>- It is with very great regret that I rise to associate members of the Country party in this chamber with the motions submitted by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay).</inline> This is truly a sad day for this Parliament and for the people cf Australia. The district to which I belong is clouded with gloom and sorrow, for in this tragic national disaster it has lost three of its leading citizens, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Street, Mr. Fairbairn</inline> and Lieutenant-Colonel Thomthwaite, all of whom were neighbours and close friends. They all played a prominent part in the public life of the Western District of Victoria and will be greatly missed in the district. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Gullett, who was a colleague of mine in the Bruce-Page Government, was a seasoned parliamentarian, but suffered a good deal from ill health.  His  inclusion in so many ministerial offices was evidence of his ability. We deeply regret his passing. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Street</inline> was elected to represent the Division of Corangamite, from which I retired in 1934, and his ability and close attention to duty soon won him high ministerial office.  His  was a big job, and in this difficult time he was rendering a great national service. For many years he was a municipal councillor in the district in which I live, and two days before his death was returned unopposed to that position. For several years he was a Justice of the Peace, and in the Lismore district was an honoured, respected and worthy citizen. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fairbairn,</inline> who lived near the late&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Street,</inline> was also a member of the same council for some years, and in that capacity he rendered remarkable service. In 1932 lie was elected to represent Warrnambool - a difficult seat to win - in the Victorian Parliament. In the following year he contested successfully the Flinders seat in the Federal Parliament.  His  ability and industry were soon recognized, with the result that he, too, was entrusted with one of the most important portfolios in the Ministry. He was a popular and generous citizen in the district in which he lived. We deeply deplore the loss of these men who died in the prime of life, and with a full knowledge of the task ahead of them. The late General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brudenell</inline> White waa one of Australia&#39;s most distinguished soldiers. He was, indeed, one of Australia&#39;s greatest sons, an experienced businessman, and a gentleman in every sense of the word.  His  position will be extremely hard to fill. We also deeply regret the death of those who accompanied these gentlemen in the ill-fated journey from Melbourne to Canberra. The nation has lost good men who were rendering valuable national service. The nation mourns with the widows and families of the bereaved, and we offer them our sincere sympathy. We know not what a day may bring forth. </para>

          <para>- I associate myself with the motion submitted by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay).</inline> The Commonwealth Parliament is to-day writing one of the saddest pages in its history. In the most tragic air disaster that this nation has suffered, three Ministers of State, the Chief of the General Staff., who is hoad of the Army, and six other Australians have been tragically taken from us at one blow. On behalf of the party which 1 represent in this chamber I extend sincere sympathy to those who have been left to mourn the loss of those who were near and dear to them. They may take solace iu the knowledge that those whose death we lament carried out their respective duties faithfully, and died in the- service of the country which we all love so dearly, and desire so earnestly to protect. </para>

        <para>All of us are aware of the great demands that these perilous days make upon members of Governments. The day is not long enough to enable them to see Jill whom they wish to see, and to read and deal with all the problems so vital to the welfare of our country in this great crisis. In order to utilize to the full the time available for the discharge of their ministerial duties, and, no doubt, to give just a little of their society to their wives mid families, these men, as they often had to do, chose air travel as a means of speedy transport. They therefore, gave their lives in the service of the Government, a service demanding every ounce of their energy, in order to guard us from the terrors and destructive forces which are over-powering Europe to-day. </para>
        <para>Not every man possesses in equal measure the gifts of friendliness and personal regard for others. Nature endows men in different ways. The final determination of these factors is judged according to our own personal reactions. I mention this because it is remarkable that one should find all of these qualities in the three Ministers linked so tragically and so suddenly in &#39;death. On every occasion when I had to consult them I found them courteous and obliging and ready always to listen to my representations. They worked hard and long, and they faced the harassing problems of this strange new world, with the courage of their convictions and in accordance with the dictates of their judgment. </para>
        <para>To all who a re left to mourn their loss, their sorrowing widows and children, my party extends its profound sympathy. May the memory of their many acts of kindness, and the high esteem in which they were held, be a source of consolation to their relatives in their darkest hour. I join with their families in the thought that these men have passed &#169;n to a brighter and better sphere, where the sufferings, turmoil and anxieties of this much disturbed and troubled world are unknown. </para>

          <para>- As a Victorian senator I should like to add my sincere tribute to the memory of the deceased Ministers and officers whose deaths we lament to-day. I knew each nf the three Ministers, intimately, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Gullett, when I was a member of the House of Representatives. I was associated with all of them, nor. only as a member of this Parliament, but also as a political opponent in several election campaigns. They were the elect of the people. Two of them were in charge of the fighting services of this nation, having been given the task of placing Australia on a war footing in an unprecedently short time. All of us agree that the three Ministers were at all times courteous and conscientious in the execution of their duty. Their loss is aserious blow to Australia. I pay my tribute also to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brudenell</inline> White and the late Lieutenant-Colonel Thornthwaite who rendered outstanding military service to this nation. In the presence of death all political hostility is forgotten. The grief-stricken relatives of all whose end was so tragic and sudden, have the sympathy of everyman and woman in the Australian Labour movement. My fervent prayer is that the Almighty will comfort them in their great grief. </para>
