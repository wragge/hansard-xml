        <para>SenatorKEANE (Victoria) &#91;8.1&#93;.- I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> the inadequacy of the arrangements made for the transport of members of Parliament this morning from the Canberra railway station. One bus was provided for over 40 members, each of whom had considerable luggage. At the same time, I noticed twelve limousines standing by at the station. I do not know for whom they were provided. Following a similar occurrence about eight or ten weeks ago, I complained to the House Committee, of which I am a member. No excuse exists for such a condition of affairs. The officer who attends to the transport of members should ascertain beforehand how many members will be arriving in Canberra, and arrange for any extra buses which might be required. Members of Parliament do not enjoy very many privileges, but they are at least entitled to expect a fairly comfortable seat in a bus on their way from the station at Canberra. The one bus employed on this job this morning was dangerously overloaded. In fact, the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stacey),</inline> who, I should think, would weigh about 18 stone, was obliged to travel on the running board. </para>

          <para>. - I have a suggestion to make to the Government with regard to the rationing of petrol. In a country town the other day I was approached by a gentleman who discussed with me the scheme of petrol rationing which operated during the last war in the United States of America, where he was then residing. This scheme, which he said had proved most successful, would, I believe, cause very much less inconvenience than the proposal which the Government now has under consideration for the rationing of petrol on a basis of so many gallons for each car according to its horse-power. In the United States of America one day of the week was known as a &#34;no-car day&#34;. We could set apart one, or two, or even three days, each week as &#34; no-car days&#34;. Medical doctors, whose cars would be distinguished by the usual badge of a snake on a stick and clergymen, whose cars would carry a white cross on a dark background, would be exempt from these restrictions. Under the American scheme, no compulsion was exerted, but the effect of it was that private persons who used their cars on a &#34;no-car day&#34; aroused so much public resentment that they were almost hooted for refusing to co-operate in the national effort to conserve petrol. In addition, a farmer or other resident in a remote area, who drove his car to town on a &#34; no-car day &#34; was obliged to report immediately to the local police and to give a valid reason for using his car on such a day. My informant told me that the scheme was a wonderful success, and that as the result of it the petrol saved throughout the United States of America would have been sufficient to meet the weekly fuel requirements of the British navy. That is how he put it. It appears to me that such a scheme would cause much less inconvenience than the proposal which, according to newspaper reports, the Government has now under consideration. In addition, it would cause less dislocation and less unemployment in the garage business and the motor car industry generally. The Government would be well advised to inquire into this matter in order to see what really was done in the United States of America during the last war in order to conserve petrol, and, should the American scheme be found to be better than the proposal now under consideration, it should be adopted. </para>

        <para>I take this opportunity to bring under the notice of the Government certain facts in relation to the Government Printing Office in Canberra. When Parliament is sitting the staff of the Government Printer is not only fully worked, but also overworked. Honorable senators will agree that these employees give highly efficient service. I have in my hand an application form for use by men desirous of joining the Royal Australian Air Force. It is a stereotyped form, similar to thousands which are printed each year in relation to Government activities. Yet I find on it the imprint - &#34; T. Rider, Government Printer, Melbourne &#34;. I have repeatedly protested against the continuance of this policy of sabotaging the National Capital. It is time that we put a stop to it. Not the slightest excuse exists for it. When we know that a large number of Government Printing Office employees in Canberra are unemployed when Parliament is in recess we should not have our printing done in Melbourne. If this were an isolated case it could probably be excused. However, it is not an isolated case. I have repeatedly raised matters of this kind in this chamber. When shall we put a stop to this practice? I also protest against the holding of Cabinet meetings, and the receiving of deputations by Ministers, in Melbourne. If we hope to justify Canberra - and I believe that the building of this city is one of the finest experiments yet undertaken by any nation - all of the Government&#39;s activities should be carried on in the National Capital. It is ridiculous to say that Ministers cannot remain here and at the same time confer with officers who are stationed in Melbourne. Why cannot such officers be brought to Canberra when Ministers wish to confer with them? Such an arrangement would be no more expensive than the travelling of Ministers  to Melbourne each week-end, taking with them an army of under-secretaries, typists and secretaries. Because of the seriousness of the international situation the Opposition is loath to raise points which have no immediate relation to the greatest crisis with which we have yet been confronted, but I feel obliged to raise a matter of this kind. Later on perhaps I shall have something more to say about the necessity for Ministers to carry out their ministerial activities in Canberra. The Government is aware of our opposition to the closing of Parliament, although probably it will be better able to appreciate our views on this subject to-morrow, when we are discussing the important measure for which we are now waiting. We shall then renew our protests on this matter. All the talk about Ministers not being able to do their jobs properly if they are obliged to attend to parliamentary matters, or must confer with officers situated in Melbourne or Sydney, is unconvincing. Such officers should be obliged to come to Canberra and do their job here, just as it is the duty of Ministers to do their job in Canberra. The matter which I have just raised is only one of many of its kind. </para>

          <para>. I am pleased to hear that the Senate will meet to-morrow an hour earlier than is usual on a Friday. Like other honorable senators, I realize that the measure which will come before us to-morrow is of great importance, and, particularly in view of the fact that it has been &#34;guillotined&#34; in the House of Representatives and, in consequence, debates in that chamber will be considerably curtailed, the extra hour to be afforded to us will be most welcome. </para>

        <para>I protest against the manner in which a. question asked by me from the Minister representing the Minister for the Army has been answered. Honorable senators will remember that on the 22nd April, and later on the 14th May, I asked the </para>
        <para class="block">Minister if he would supply to me &#163; statement of the cost to the Commonwealth of land and building: that had been vacated by the military authorities or which the military authorities proposed to vacate. Sub sequently representations were made to me that the cost of obtaining such information in respect of the States would be considerable and would take some time to collect. Consequently, I compromised and informed the Minister that I would be satisfied if I were given this information in respect of Victoria. On the 7th June, I received the following letter from the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline> : - </para>

        <para>With reference to your questions in the Senate on the 22nd April and the 14th May, in regard to lands and buildings temporarily occupied for military purposes and the costs involved, I desire to confirm the reply given on the first occasion, which was to the effect that the question was of too general a nature to be answered without special and lengthy investigation,but that particulars would more readily be furnished in respect of any particular locality. </para>
        <para>I have accordingly had prepared the attached list of properties occupied in Victoria on various dates, but for the reasons indicated, have been vacated during the three months - March to May. </para>
        <para class="block">I did not ask for this information in respect of three months from March to May. The list furnished by the Minister showed that the total cost involved was &#163;497. Included in the list was the military camp at Torquay. It is well known to honorable senators that the cost to the Commonwealth of the occupation and eventual abandonment of Torquay as a military encampment has run into thousands of pounds. The reply that I received indicated that at Torquay the sum of &#163;29 was involved in respect of the occupation of the drilling and manoeuvring area, that &#163;127 was the cost involved in the occupation of a portion of the drilling and camp site, and that a further portion of the camp site had cost &#163;210s. a week until vacated. I was not informed as to when the land was vacated, nor as to the reasons for vacating it. I submit that a Minister should at least see that replies to questions contain the information sought. This particular reply was a ridiculous one in view of the known facts. I further request the Minister representing the Minister for the Army to go into the matter fully, and to furnish me, at least, with a statement of the cost that has been involved in Victoria since September, 1939. </para>
        <para>In view of the possibility of an early adjournment of the Parliament for some weeks, I draw attention to a motor car hire contract entered into in Melbourne by the Commonwealth Government. I have taken up this matter with the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll),</inline> who has informed me that his department is not responsible for the conditions of the new contract. I do not desire to criticize the Minister or his department, but the conditions arc such that they should be reviewed. When the time arrived for the renewal of the contract, tenders were invited, and, after investigation of them, a tender was accepted from the Astoria Private Hire Service. I have been approached regarding this matter by the Motor Transport and Chauffeurs Association of Australia. It appears that the contract does not provide that the successful tenderer shall observe award rates and conditions. </para>

              <para>- A contract of this nature should never have been entered into by the Government. These owner-drivers are not protected by insurance against accidents. If a member of this Parliament, or a member of the Commonwealth Public Service, met with a serious accident while travelling in one of these motor vehicles, what protection would the Government have? I understand that an effort is being made to effect accident insurance, and, that each owner will need to take out an insurance policy. </para>

              <para>- The Crown Law authorities in Victoria have informed me that, although insurance against accidents is compulsory in respect of taxi-cabs in Melbourne, in the case of the cars used under this contract such insurance is not compulsory. Even if the seven owner-drivers concerned in this contract took out accident insurance policies, it might be necessary on some occasions for more than seven motor cars to be employed. In the event of an additional car being required at short notice for Commonwealth purposes in Melbourne, a vehicle not covered by insurance might be called into service. If the Government dealt with a reputable firm, which was adequately covered by insurance, members of the public service would beprotected, and the Government would not run the risk of being involved in large claims for damages. The whole matter should be thoroughly investigated. At a time when a strong appeal is being made to the industrial movement to render every possible assistance to the Government, a contract involving a violation of award rates and conditions should not be entertained. This matter is regarded in trade union circles as being so serious that it is to be discussed by the Melbourne Trades and Labour Council. </para>

            <para>. - I bring under the notice of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> the drastic action taken in New South Wales in regard to the Truth Newspaper Company Limited, which recently sought a licence to publish an afternoon journal to be known as the <inline font-style="italic">Mirror.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ezra</inline> Norton, the owner of the company, received a letter intimating that a licence would be granted to enable this newspaper to appear on the streets of Sydney. Of course, it would have been in competition with the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun.</inline> It is understood that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hugh</inline> Denison and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Graham</inline> Waddell came to Canberra and brought pressure to bear upon the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and other members of the Government, as a result of which the promised licence to import newsprint for the new journal was withdrawn. The sad feature is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norton</inline> induced a number of people to accept positions on the staff of the proposed new journal, and entered into contracts with some of them for two years and more. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norton</inline> now finds himself unable to fulfill those contracts; he has had to tell the men to whom he has offered employment - most of them are members of the Australian Journalists Association - that there are no jobs for them. It is considered by that association, by the printing trade union, and by a very large majority of the people of New South Wales that the Government should not have suppressed the new paper. It is thought that the vast population of New South Wales warrants the publication of two evening papers in its capital city, I do not know whether or not action to suppress the journal was taken because criticism of the Government was feared. Very few papers do criticize the Government to-day. In fact, the Government refuses to allow the publication of criticism. I believe that the <inline font-style="italic">Mirror</inline> would have supported the Government, because, under the threat of censorship, it, like most other newspapers, would not have the temerity to oppose it. I urge the Government to withdraw its opposition to the establishment of the new paper, and grant the requisite licence. If that were done the people to whom employment has been offered would then be given their jobs, the people of New South Wales would have a new evening paper, and public opinion would not be so much under the influence of the existing evening journal. </para>

            <para>.- The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has asked that the Senate should meet at 9.30 a.m. to-morrow in order to discuss the very important business which is now before the House of Representatives, and the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has compromised by agreeing to 10 a.m. as the hour of meeting. In that arrangement I concur. The Leader of the Opposition has on many occasions reprimanded the powers that be for not keeping Parliament in session longer than is now the practice, and to some extent I support his protests. So long as there is business worthy of discussion, Parliament should be kept in session. </para>

            <para>. - I have something to say with regard to the complaint voiced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan about honorable senators not being in their places when certain legislation was passed in the dying hours of the first period of this session. I draw attention to the fact that on the Thursday evening, I was speaking on the financial statement when the sitting was suspended for dinner. Immediately on resuming, I was asked by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> to obtain leave to continue my speech at a later hour. I did so. Government business was then introduced, and was continued until after 10 o&#39;clock on the Friday night. I was not given an opportunity to resume my speech. </para>

          <para>I shall read to honorable senators a letter which I intended to bring under the notice of this chamber had I been permitted to continue my speech on the 30th May. In connexion with the search for oil in Australia at present, there is a search for something besides oil. Recently a friend of mine, a shorthand writer, was standing at the corner of Castlereagh-street and Martin-place, Sydney, when a man standing beside him opened a letter and commenced to read it. My friend took some notes from the letter, and he saw the name Steinbuchel - that gentleman who was so ignobly refused the right to stay in this country. Honorable senators know well my connexion with this matter, and realize that my association with it will stand the light of day. </para>

        <para class="block">Further investigation revealed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brooksbank</inline> is a journalist, and is the editor of the Air Raids Precaution magazine. He is also a warden under the national emergency scheme, and carries on some kind of a business in that building. I bring this matter under the notice of the Senate because the discovery of flow oil in Australia is most important - in fact, so important that, in the past, certain people have been assaulted. As I have said before, one man was brutally assaulted and bashed at the top of William-street, Sydney, and another was hit over the head and left for dead in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies&#39;s</inline> electorate of Kooyong. Also ?35,000 was paid to a driller&#39;s wife in connexion with drilling operations at Mount Gambier, in South Australia. I care not whether these people will try to knock me in the same way,but while I have breath in my body I shall continue to fight against their methods, regardless of the consequences. This is a matter in connexion with which we have received no assistance from the Government. In fact we have had most misleading statements from the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Toll).</inline> For instance, on the 7th December last, the Minister told us that, because of the decline in known world resources of flow oil, it was essential that we should discover oil in this country. On another occasion the Minister took me to task for alleging that certain people who were placing obstacles in the way of Australian companies that had been formed to search for oil in this country were emissaries of the major oil companies; yet, almost in the same breath, he said that a large concern like the Shell Oil Company of Australia Limited, which has a concession of 87,000,000 acres in Queensland, worth to-day on the New York Stock Exchange at least &#163;10,000,000, was the most likely to be successful. In this connexion, I impress on the Senate the need to check any attempted sabotage in this Parliament of proposals to locate oil in this country. To-day I inquired whether the well-known publication, <inline font-style="italic">World Petroleum,</inline> which is published in New York and London, was available in the Parliamentary Library. That journal is rightly regarded as the highest world authority on the petroleum industry. Yet, so I was informed, it is not filed in our Parliamentary Library. Consequently those who are interested in this subject have not an opportunity to inform their minds of the most modern methods employed in the search for petroleum. In order to place the facts before the Senate and to counter the misleading statements of SenatorFoll made, I presume, on the advice of the gentlemen constituting the Commonwealth Oil Advisory Committee, I take the following from <inline font-style="italic">World Petroleum</inline> for February last :  - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Rapidly mounting motor fuel stocks in the United States are the subject of widespread discussion and concern throughout the trade. The concern deepens as weekly reports make it evident that the volume of gasoline in storage will exceed all previous records before the seasonal increase in con sumption that begins with the approachof summer makes possible a change in the cur rent upward trend. </para>
          <para>This situation is regarded, rightly enough as a most serious threat to market stability during the coming year. <inline font-style="italic">As</inline> stocks approach more and more closely to the limit of avail able storage capacity, the none too secure gasoline price structure will be further undermined, bringing nearer the possibilityof market disintegration at the time when it is most damaging, that is, at the very commence ment of this season of heavy demand. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The trade in America is of such a character that, at the moment, there is an over-production of petroleum, <inline font-style="italic">World Petroleum</inline> also publishes a chart indicating world areas where there has been an increase of production in recent years and giving the production figures for last year. Other areas showing a decrease of production are included in the chart, which gives world production for  1939  at  2,076,852,000  barrels, representing an increase of  110,265,000  barrels over the production for  1938.  These figuresare so arresting that those who have anyknowledge of the position must take strong exception to the misleading statements made by the Minister for the Interior, who, I presume, obtained his information from the Commonwealth Oil Advisory Committee. </para>
        <para>I also remind the Senate that on a previous occasion when I mentioned the work being done in Australia by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Max</inline> Steinbuchel, I produced a photostat of a report relating to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Steinbuchel&#39;s</inline> activities in the United States of America. On that occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> sneeringly asked if I had the original. I have it now. I also have another photostat of a report relating to wells that have been discovered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Steinbuchel,</inline> and which are now operating. The speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> on that occasion was misleading, and will not be accepted except, perhaps, by those who are uninformed and sceptical of the system for locating oil employed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Steinbuchel.</inline> I understand that certain Australian companies had concessions granted to them as far back as  1915.  Those concessions had a currency of  25  years, and therefore would expire this year ; but about fifteen months ago the companies concerned got busy when the company with which I have been associated commenced its activities  for &#163;3,500 or &#163;1 15s. an acre, and we know that the plaintiff&#39;s share of the plunder was between &#163;0,000 and &#163;7,000. </para>
        <para class="block">On the following day in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> admitted that while he was at sea on his way to England, he had accepted a seat on the board of directors, but he led the Senate to believe that he knew nothing about the company&#39;s operations. I have given the facts to the Senate. I have brought this matter up because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> unjustifiably maligned certain people who were associated with some New South Wales companies that were interested in the search for oil, and I suggest that the investigation of the company with which he was associated disclosed a sordid and disgraceful state of affairs. While on this subject I have in mind another concern. The Minister for the Interior in December last read a part of a letter on a secret departmental file from a well-known firm of Melbourne solicitors, Russell, Bona and Russell, which challenged Steinbuchel&#39;s ability as an oil producer, and belittled his activities in the United States of America. I am informed that one Russell never practised his profession, that the other Russell is dead, and that Bona carries on the firm&#39;s business. Bona, I understand, works in conjunction with Connelly, better known as &#34; Race-course Harry &#34; and George Alexander Macdonald in promoting &#34; crook &#34; companies. Macdonald is the man who floated a company in Sydney and robbed the shareholders. He escaped to Western Australia, where he floated the Lady Miller mine and the North Norseman mine and robbed the shareholders of those concerns of &#163;35,000. At one stage the people were so incensed that they threatened to lynch him, but he got away to Adelaide.  His  method of working was to ascertain when a rich man died, then to rush to the home of the widow to offer condolences, and attend the funeral - on one occasion, he dropped clods of dirt on the coffin. Afterwards he would go home to the widow and remain friendly with her until the probate of the will was granted. Then he would tell her what a fine fellow her late husband was and how anxious he had been to assist in the flotation of companies for the promotion of the search for oil in </para>
        <para class="block">Australia. Honorable senators opposite, particularly those representing South Australia, should ascertain whether there are not at least five or six persons in that. State willing to give &#163;100 if that individual, who is a fugitive from justice, would set foot in South Australia, because of the fact that some persons in that State have been robbed of thousands of pounds. In one case a widow was robbed of &#163;5,000 and to-day is a ward of the State. lt is people of that type who say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Steinbuchel</inline> should not remain in Australia. A Minister in this chamber has said that we are doing everything possible to obtain supplies of oil in Australia; but what efforts have been made in that direction! What is to happen to our mechanized units used for defence purposes if we cannot obtain adequate supplies of liquid fuel in this country? If we have not sufficient for the use of our mechanized units we are down and out. Notwithstanding that fact, all kinds of obstacles are placed in the way of those desiring to discover oil, and a determined attempt has been made to frustrate the efforts of the only company that has tried to secure supplies locally. Shortly we shall again be asked to cooperate with the Government and to display a spirit of unity. We shall be told of the way in which the Government proposes to defend this country. Last Monday week I was privileged to visit the annexes being used for the manufacture of munitions to aid Australia&#39;s war effort, and I was astounded, so much so that I could hardly speak, at the inactivity of this Government in respect of its bounden duty to provide for the defence of Australia. The Government says that it needs the assistance and cooperationnf the trade unionist.?, and the workers generally ; but behind that there seems to be a very sinister move to introduce conscription. In one of the annexes visited, the paint had not worn off the machines, and the floor was as clean as it was on the day on which it was laid down. A few men were working and a few bars of iron were lying about. We were told that within three days the men would be workins: two shifts, but; in that time the employees engaged had been paid off. At Pyrmont the work in the annexe had just commenced, and although there were  in this country. The representatives of these vested interest companies en?  deavoured  to persuade the people of Australia that the geological structure in this country is such that only concerns with an enormous amount of capital are likely to be successful in the search for oil. In his tirade against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Steinbuchel</inline> some time ago the Minister for the Interior admitted- that he had made some inquiries concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Steinbuchel&#39;s</inline> activities in the United States of America, and that there was nothing against his personal character, but the Minister said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Steinbuchel</inline> had never discovered oil in America. Again I presume that the Minister was speaking on information furnished by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade, Dr. Woolnough</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ward,</inline> and again the Minister misled the Senate. The following is a copy of a cablegram that was sent to <inline font-style="italic">World Petroleum,</inline> Hoboken,  New Jersey, on the 29th March, 1940:- </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Cable if Max Steinbuchel discovered Raymond Martin  siliea  pools. (Sgd.) Mackay. </para>

        <para class="block">To that cablegram the following reply was received from <inline font-style="italic">World Petroleum : -</inline></para>

        <para class="block">That information refutes absolutely the statement of the Minister, based on information supplied by his expert advisers, who, I contend, are not working in the best interests of Australia. It is known that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade</inline> was for many years a company man. It is known that since 1923 or 1924 he was travelling in various countries on behalf of several companies and was so employed until he was brought to Australia in 1936. </para>

        <para class="block">All this information proves conclusively that the Minister&#39;s statement in the Senate was absolutely misleading, and its effect will be most damaging because the speech has been reprinted and sent out by the Minister and the Prime Minister as a reply to letters which were received asking for an extension of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Steinbuchel&#39;s</inline> permit to remain in Australia. I therefore protest most strongly against the action of the Minister in this matter. The honorable gentleman, it will be recalled, went on to say that several Australian companies - he was referring to concerns in which shareholders had lost their money - originated in New South Wales. As regards the companies with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Steinbuchel</inline> has been associated, there has been nothing to hide, and I emphatically protest against the Minister&#39;s unfair allegations. There is, of course, one company whose position is being investigated. As that matter is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice</inline> it is not desirable that I should say anything about it, but I could mention other companies whose record i3 not above suspicion. There was, for instance, the National Tobacco Corporation of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> was a promoter and director. That company&#39;s record was the subject of examination in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 1935 and this is what Chief Justice Jordan said about it, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 5th December, 1935 - </para>

I can assure the honorable senator that the members of the Opposition will always be in their places when there is business to transact, despite the long distances which some of them have to travel in order to attend the sittings of this Parliament. Within a day or two the Senate will again be going into recess, and we shall be expected to dispose of, within a few hours, the most important legislation that has ever been brought before this Parliament. During the last day on which the Senate sat, more bills were passed in this chamber than during the whole of the session. Such unnecessary haste prevents honorable senators from devoting their time to the legislation which the Government introduces. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan should remember that some honorable senators have to travel 2,000 miles toreach Canberra, and owing to transport difficulties, some have been prevented from attending to-day. The bill which the Senate will shortly be asked to debate - the Prime Minister said that it was the most important ever introduced into this Parliament - has been &#34; guillotined &#34; in the House of Representatives, and doubtless a time limit will be imposed upon the measure in this chamber. The Opposition believes that Parliament should remain in session throughout the present crisis. </para>
