                    <para>. - Even with the amount of time which has been at. the disposal of honorable senators since the budget papers were presented to the chamber, the task of absorbing their contents and implications <inline font-style="italic">has</inline> been enormousIsuggest to the Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McBride)</inline> that before the debate proceeds much further, he should have explanatory notes prepared to assist honorable senators to approach the subject with all the seriousness that it warrants. Australia's task, admittedly,is tremendous, and honorable senators representing the Labour party have never failed to recognize the great responsibility that the international situation has placed upon the Government. In acknowledging that fact, we realize that there is need for dispatch in dealing with the budget, which is the most important that this Parliament has ever been called upon to consider. That statement, however, does not imply that proper consideration should not be given to every essential detail. The Minister should understand that every honorable senator on this side of the chamber desires and asks for the opportunity fully to debate the subject. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Tlie budget, by which the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> proposes to raise the tremendous sum of £270,000,000, is the biggest in the history of the Commonwealth. On a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis, it represents an. annual expenditure of £29, or over . lOS. a week. Clearly, then, it merits the most serious consideration, particularly as the Commonwealth Government is not the only taxing authority in Australia. On top of 'the colossal amount which is to be raised, the States also superimpose their taxation. We are accustomed to the oft-repeated gibe that any  form  of taxation, however modest it  may  be. is unpopular, and I am sure that honorable senators will hear many references to the magnitude of the Treasurer's task. In point of fact, however, it is not the Treasurer who prepares the budget speech. As in numerous matters of administration, departmental officials do the real work. Although Ministers look wise in the chamber, they play a very minor part. What actually happens is that departmental officials confer and collaborate; the Commonwealth Bank Board and the associated private, profit-making banks also collaborate. </para>

                        <para>- I used a kinder word. The Loan Council also collaborates or conspires, according to the point of view,_and dien internal and external interests also collaborate. For example, a. member of the British Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> Lyttleton, and the High Commissioner for the United Kingdom in Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Geoffrey</inline> Whiskard,  have made inspired suggestions and utterances calculated to influence taxpayers of the Commonwealth, to whom they are in no way responsible, as to the necessity for the adoption of a deflationary policy. In my opinion, such a policy is as out-of-date as we our Victorian grandfathers. After this complicated process, the Treasurer gets to work, the Estimates are drawn up, and the budget speech is prepared and, in due course, presented to Parliament. I submit emphatically that the policy of spending less is an  exploded  fallacy. We cannot win through to victory, either in time of war or in time of peace, by endeavouring to starve ourselves into a successful effort, nor can we abolish unemployment by creating more of it. The Treasurer is either incapable of regarding the matter from that point of view, or is not allowed to do so. There i3 only one pool from which all the taxes necessary for the war effort and for domestic requirements can be obtained. We cannot get any more from it than is put into it. The content of the pool is expressed in' figures representing the total sum expended upon production. If we expend less there will be less production, industries will languish, unemployment will increase, and the national income will contract. In clipping into the pool by means of loans, taxation and the use of national credit, we should not take out more than can be replaced. </para>

Will the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> state whether the Government has considered  the fact that, after this budget becomes operative, there will be no further possibility of selling wai* savings certificates, that nobody will offer free loans to the Government in order to carry on the war and that nobody will offerloans even atinterest?

                <para>In planningthe budget, it is essential that three ideasshould be kept in view. Theobjectshouldbetosecure the utmost speed in allformsof defence production, a minimumofeconomic, personal and social lossand a maximum of defence expansion, withsound economic development. . The view of the Opposition is that the war must be accepted as the supreme challenge, but notas the only one. The Opposition willhot in any way seek to impede the Government in its effort to secure every penny required for carrying on the defenceofthis country. To win the war and to leave the nation disrupted, as thisbudget would do, and planless at the close of the war, would, in my opinion, be a national catastrophe second onlyin its injurious effects to the war itself.' The war cannot go on for ever. When it ends, the task of this nation will be primarily the absorption into peacetime industry of themen returning from the fighting zone. But the budget contains not a line showing that the Government is aware of this responsibility, or, being aware of it, is prepared to plan now for future needs. If any failure has been experiencedin the acceleration of our contribution to the Empire's defence effort, it is due to the fact that this Government has not foreseen the need to employ every man who now desires employment.Not only must employment be provided for every available unit in thecommunitywho is able and willing to work, but also all of our national resources must be exploited to the full, orto the extent to whichmanpower is available. If we fail in that regard, Australia will not make its maximum contribution to the Empire's war effort. Until we do that it is useless to seekto impose upon the people a maximum -financial contribution. </para>
                <para>I have no desire to detract from the remarkable war effort now being made by Australia, nor am I attempting to take any credit from the Government for the work that it has already done ; but the Opposition has repeatedly declared that the effort of the Government is a belated one. At least twelve months of valuable time; in which the necessary acceleration could have been achieved,has been lost. In support of my contention that we must plan for post-war needs I shall read what was said by. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Brown, Commonwealth Co-ordinator-General of Works, at the beginning of this month - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>There was, he said, need for a " changed system of living " in order to obtain the maximum war effort, to abolish unemployment, and to give the people the sort of living they were entitled to. Great adjustments would obviously have to be made in our 'social life, and these would probably concern finance. Relief works were merely palliatives, and poor ones, for unemployment and were no real substitute for long-range planning. The problems of the Commonwealth, if they were to be solved, he said; would have to be solved by an allin effort, and not by any single authority. </para>

                <para>SenatorCOLLINGS - If there is one thing that justifies all that members of this Opposition have said about its determination not to join a national government, it is this budget. If one of my responsibilities as a member of a national cabinet would be to go into the homes of the working classes of this country, and tell the people that I was party to reducing the wages of the poorer sections, I am extremely glad that I was not a member of such a government. I am, in fact, glad that I refused to have anything to do with that proposal. I should be a traitor to the class that sent me to fight for it in this Parliament, if I were prepared to do anything of that kind. Because I am not prepared to do it, I shall make suggestions this afternoon which I hope the Government will consider, even at this late hour. I ask it to take the incidence of the proposed taxation from the backs of those who are least able to bear it. It should not be applied in the dastardly cruel way proposed by the Government, but should be placed upon the shoulders of the Government's wealthy friends. In the past six years, at least £36,000,000 of tax re- missions has been presented to those who provide the Government's election funds and instruct it as to the policy to be followed in this Parliament. The Government could have raised that money and placed it in reserve for defence purposes, if ithad not been short-sighted and politically biased. </para>

We need one taxing authority, and that should be the national Parliament.

                <para>SenatorCOLLINGS.- The national balance-sheet should not be produced on a commercial accountancy basis. Private businessesare entirely different from government undertakings. Of course, those who  produced this budget know exactlywhat the people need. It is usual to budget for a surplus, but we should not take out of the common pool an amount so large that the refilling of it will be impossible. Whatever happens, the man in charge of a privately owned concern must see that it shows a profit, whereas the chief aim of the Government should be the rendering of service to the community. There is no need for a national budget to follow the same lines as a balance-sheet prepared by the ordinary business accountant. I see in this budget the hand of the professional accountant. A nation's budget should provide for the needs of the nation and the requirements of its citizens. Sound government has regard to the finances of the nation, the government of the nation, and the welfare of the . people of the nation. Honorable senators opposite will probably agree with the first two of thoseobjectives, but not the third. </para>

                <para>SenatorCOLLINGS. - The welfare of the people cannot be served by a budget such as the one before us: The underlying principle of taxation should be equality of sacrifice. Before a government imposes taxes, it should be sure that those taxes will not press unfairly on any section of the community. It seems to me that that should be a fairly easy task. Before the tax-gatherer is sent out to collect taxes, the Government should decide on a point in the scale of incomes below which no tax should be imposed in any circumstances whatever. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister cannot escape his personal responsibility for the plight of these unfortunate pensioners. Honorable senators who approve the Government's policy probably salve their consciences by saying that, although the field of taxation is being extended, the load on the wealthy section of the community is being made much heavier. If honorable senators can sleep peacefully in their beds, regardless of the consternation which the presentation of this budget has caused, in countless homes in this country, I can only say that their consciences are easily satisfied. 1 repeat whatIhave said on other occasions, that it is not what is taken from a man that matters but what he has left when the tax-gatherer passes on. I have some figures here relating to the effect of the most recent budget introduced into the United Kingdom. It is difficult to obtain corresponding figures for Australia. In his book, <inline font-style="italic">Unser Kampf,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Acland, a member of the British House of Commons,states that11/2 per cent, of the people of the United Kingdom draw 25 per cent, of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> national income, 81/2 per cent, of the people draw 25 per cent, of that income whilst the remaining 90 per cent, of the people appropriate the other half of the national income. That is to say, for every three persons who receive £8 6s.8d. aday and. every seventeen persons who receive £1 9s. 3d. a day there are180 persons each receiving only 5s. 63/4d. a day. </para>

                    <para>Some say that the rich are going to pay for the war. With income tax up to 17s.6d. in the £1 there's no more need to talk about inequality - there won't be any rich men at the end of this war. Will there not? </para>
                    <para>Already all our pundits of national finance are tentatively preparing the ground for the news that there must be a reduction in working class standards of living. No doubt the most essential skilled workers in arms industries will be able to keep their wage rates more or less abreast of rising prices. But it it quite certain that the average workers and the pensioners will not. </para>
                    <para>It is uncertain whether the sacrifices demanded of these people will be as great on the basis of a mathematical proportion of their income as the sacrifices of the rich, but it is not quite good enough to work out sacrifices on the basis of a mathematical proportion. The rich man whose income tax increases so as to reduce his income by 25 per cent, is sacrificing far less than the poor man whose purchasing power is reduced by 10 per cent. Sacrifice is a physical, not a financial affair. There is no physical pain connected with the writing of a cheque to the Chancellor for the very largest amount. The sacrifice only begins when a man cannot purchase what he could have purchased if he had not paid the tax. From this point of view a man whose income before the war was £100.000 would sacrifice almost nothing if his taxation rose to £95,000, or 19s. in the £1. In every human essential one can live just as good a life on £5,000 as on £10,000. One's house may be smaller, but every one sleeps in a separate room. One's staff may be smaller, but there is still some one else tolight the fire. One's car may be smaller, but it still goes. One's sons may not go- to a public school - but why should they if they cannot win the open scholarships? In comparison with this,' a mere 5 per cent, reduction in the purchasing power of a working family 13 immediately reflected in the most definite physical  priva-tion  and pain. This is the more true since the considerable number of charges such as rent and insurance are fixed and a <inline font-style="italic">5</inline> per cent, reduction in the total income means therefore perhaps a 15 per cent, reduction in the sum available for food. </para>

                <para class="block">That illustration stands for Australia as well as Great Britain. I believe in income taxation, and in the principle that the higher incomes should be taxed heavily. But. I believe also that the lower incomes should not be taxed at all and that the middle incomes should be taxed only moderately. I may think that the levy on my income is excessive, but I shall pay my instalments willingly. I believe in the income tax, and if I have income I am willing to pay the tax. I shall not be obliged to discharge anybody because I do not employ anybody,, but the average man on £1,000 a year, who is spending his entire income, or very nearly all of it, will be obliged to retrench. He will have to say to his wife, " We cannot employ a gardener any longer"; or " We cannot keep two maids in the future; one will have to be dismissed". If he has only one maid, then possibly he will be forced to dispense with her services. He may have to say, " We must withdraw Mary from college because we cannot continue to keep her at that expensive establishment; she must return home to help you with the house ". Things of that kind will happen right down the scale of incomes, and surely honorable senators opposite can see what will be the repercussions. There will be a substantial reduction of spending power, and it is spending power alone that matters - spending power in the hands of the poorer sections of the community, not the surplus in the hands of the rich. The people on the lower incomes, not the wealthy nor well-to-do, keep the wheels of industry moving. Our industries rely on the purchasing power of the men on £5, £7 and £10 a week, who spend, every penny of their salaries because they must do so <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> keep their household going. Those are the people who keep the shops, factories, and emporiums busy, and the effect of this budget will be to reduce their spending power. The result will be that shop assistants will be sacked, factory hands retrenched, and so on. The Government should realize that the war cannot be effectively fought in that way, and that a proper contribution to the national war effort cannot be secured ,by harshmeasures of this character. </para>

                <para class="block">No good Australian will attempt to escape, but surely, in travelling down the scale of incomes, a point must be readied when common decency demands that an individual shall be left alone. In all the years I have worked in and out of Parliament, I have met representative crosssections of Australians, and I am sure: that not one would complain, or be unwilling to accept his share of the burden in- this time of national need, provided we can convince him that the allocation is fair and just in its incidence, and that it observes the cardinal principle of equality of sacrifice. Because this budget proposes to do neither of these things, I am not prepared to defend it either outside Parliament or in this chamber. All we are asking is that the well-to-do sections of the community be made to contribute from their superfluity of this world's goods, whereas, apparently,, the Government's intention is to- ask the poorer classes to contribute to the nation's needs out of their insufficiency. That is a simple  proposition  which we can all understand, and it does not need any further elucidation or explanation. </para>
                <para>A notable figure at Sydney University, Professor H. D. Black, said recently, " This war is no emergency for some people, .but a golden opportunity - a matter of business a little better than usual ". That is quite true, and the Government is taking no effective steps to prevent it, as I intend to show directly. </para>
                <para>As I said in the course of my opening remarks, despite the protests of the Opposition, this Government and its predecessors have been guilty of making large remissions of taxes to the wealthy sections: of the community on every possible occasion. Now, in order to make up the; leeway caused, by those unnecessary remissions and for other reasons, this injustice is being perpetrated. The reduction of the general exemption to £150 per annum will press most unfairly on the ' lower incomes. It is difficult to obtain relevant Australian figures, &lt;but let us examine the taxation proposals in order to find out exactly how they will 'work out. Under the old income tax scale, a man with a wife and two children, in receipt of £400 per annum, paid nothing, because his taxable income was' nil; but under the new proposals, his taxable income will be £200 and he will pay £10, provided I am right in estimating his liability at about ls. in the £1. The man with a wife and two children, on. a salary of £350 per annum, will have a taxable income of £100, and will contribute £5. If his income be £300 he will be exempt, as he should be. I repeat that these people live in mean streets, in mean houses, and have to resort to every mean device under .the sun in order to live. </para>

                <para>Under the old income tax scale, a man with a wife and one child, in receipt of £350 per annum, had no taxable income and paid nothing, but under the new proposals, his taxable income will be £150 and he will contribute £7 10s. For the same man on an income of £300, the taxable income will be £50, and his contribution will be £2 10s.; should his income he only £250 he .will pay nothing. Under the old scale, a man with a wife and no child in receipt of £300 paid no tax, but under the new proposals he will pay £5. For the man with a wife and no children an income of £250 a year will be subject to to tax of £2 10s., and an income of £200 or les3 will ! be exempt altogether. That exemption of incomes of £4 a week or less is no doubt considered to be a charitable gesture. Had I the power, my reprisals to these taxation proposals would be drastic. By act of Parliament I would provide that, for the duration of the war and twelve months thereafter, anyone who attempted to justify the existence of this budget should be paid only what the arbitration court prescribed as the basic wage. In a vain attempt to justify its iniquitous proposals, the Government claims magnanimity because it has decided to let the man in receipt of only £4 a week, with a wife and no children, off without paying income tax, paying no regard whatever to the possible existence of other family responsibilities. It is obvious that were the exemption higher the imposts would be much less severe, on the men with the lowest incomes, particularly married men. </para>
                <para>The Bight Honorable W. M. Hughes is reputed to have coined the slogan - I do not know how much effect it has had - " Populate or Perish ". I ask honorable senators how many men will be willing to marry and help to populate this country when they are .burdened with a .budget of this kind. It only needs a glance at the Government's proposals to see that all they accomplish is ,a blow at the poorer section of the community, who will become still poorer, while, at the same time, people on the top of the scale will be let off as lightly as the Government thinks it can get away with. All honorable senators know that that is true. </para>
                <para>I strongly urge that the exemption be raised. If the Government is not prepared to do that, I have another proposition : If the proposed graduated reduction of the exemption were not enforced until a higher income level were reached, say £400, or if £1 reduction for £2 of excess income were imposed at the point where the exemption ceased to apply, I have no doubt that the Government would find that the burden would be considerably eased. However, I understand the Government's attitude on this matter, is "the budget or nothing; take it or leave it ". Apparently the Prime Minister is not prepared to accept any suggestion or compromise. </para>

                <para>In the financial year 1936-7, there were 232,000 personal exertion income taxpayers, 26,000 property income taxpayers, and 43,000 payers of both property income tax and personal exertion income tax. The 1933 census revealed that there were 346,000 breadwinners on £260 per annum and over. Those figures are very interesting; only 60,906 people paid tax on income from personal exertion, and their payments were equivalent to that of a single man on a salary range of £250-£2S4 per annum; 41,917 persons paid tax on incomes equivalent to that of a single man on £2S4-£317 per annum ; 46,551 persons paid tax on incomes equivalent to that of a single man on £317-£384 per annum, and the remaining 73,000 people paid tax on incomes of over £384. In an endeavour to obtain statistics that would compare with similar figures in the United Kingdom, I obtained the following information: - On incomes of £1 to £500, 84 per cent, of the total number of taxpayers, received 62 per cent, of the national income; on incomes of £501 to £1,000, 11 per cent, of the total number of taxpayers received 16 per cent, of the national income; on incomes of £1,000 and over, 5 per cent, of the total taxpayers received 22 per cent, of the national income. That means that 95 per cent, of the people receive 78 per cent, of the national income, while 5 per cent, of the people receive 22 per cent, of the national income. On a basis of equality the 5 per cent, of taxpayers should receive only 4 per cent, of the national income. "We have to consider not only the direct taxation with which I am now dealing, but also the various other devices, such as the sales tax and customs and excise duties, which are employed to extract money from the pockets of the people. What section of the community will be most affected by the increase of the sales tax to 10 per cent, or 15 per cent.? </para>

                        <para>- Of bourse they are. What I want to know isi do honorable senators not know that in business every item of expenditure and overhead cost is taken into consideration? Do they not know that sales tax is taken into consideration, and that very often profit is added to the sales tax as well as to the original cost? In the last analysis, all taxation filters down to , the people who have the least to spend, because they are obliged to spend all of their income. I am not suggesting that the Government should exempt the individual who  wishes to buy a wireless set, although 1 see no reason why any persons should be denied the pleasure of wireless sets if I and other honorable senators are able to have them. Of course a radio is not a necessity, and people can live without it. So far as honorable senators opposite are concerned, these people should be satisfied with corduroy pants instead of tweed, and flannelette underclothing instead of silk. If that is the Government's policy, let it proceed with it. But, provided the people do not revolt in the meantime, it will not be long before they . are reduced to the standard of the loincloth and a few grains of rice. Honorable senators opposite should not sneer when I plead for a fair deal for the people who will have to pay the bulk of these increases of tax. Every woman would like to have an electrolux in her home. I leave aside for the moment the fact that, due to the exorbitant sales tax on this article, every woman who desires to do so cannot afford to purchase an electrolux. However, it is obvious that every married worker will resent a state of affairs which compels his wife to slave about the house with a millet broom, while the wives of welltodo gentlemen supply their servants with an electrolux. When honorable senators opposite realize the implication of that statement they will be better able to  appreciate my attitude on this matter. </para>

I do not want honorable senators opposite toagree that the remedy we propose is correct. Nor do I want them to admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey, Senator Collings</inline> or the Opposition is right. But they must admit that, obviously, conventional methods of finance have failed, and that the time has arrived when we should take the risk of trying unconventionalmethods. The trouble with honorable senators opposite is that they are bound by the fetish of the <inline font-style="italic">status quo;</inline> their minds are ossified by convention. Their attitude reminds me of the story told of a convention of negroes at which, after one of the delegates had so much to say about the necessity for maintaining the <inline font-style="italic">status quo,</inline> a brotherdelegate who had listened to him aghast, arose and said, " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> what are de <inline font-style="italic">status quo?"</inline> And the  president  replied, " Don't you know what <inline font-style="italic">statusquo</inline> am? Dat is the mess we am all in ". Honorable senators oppositeare in amess, and they will never extricate themselves from it because their minds are not receptive to new ideas. The Government says that itcan finance our war effort in three ways: First, by raising public loans.In this way it expects to obtain £50,000,000. Secondly, by taxation; and by this means it hopes to obtain £31,000,000 of which £21,000,000 will represent direct taxation, and the balance indirect taxation. And, thirdly, the Government says that it will utilize credit expansion. At long last the Government has become converted to the idea of credit expansion ; but now, of course, it says that we cannot go very far in that direction. </para>

                <para>SenatorCOLLINGS- The honorable senator is prepared to make that admission now. The reason is obvious; I need only ask how the Governmentis financing the wheat industry. In December, 1938, eight months before war was declared, Australian trading banks held £38,000,000 of government paper. On the 30th April of this year the same banks held £84,000,000 of government paper, half of which was in treasury bills. Four months later, onthe 31st August, after loans and revenue had been brought in, thetrading banks held £78,000.000 ofgovernment paper. If that money were held by the Commonwealth Bank, and was not traded off to the associated banks and used by them for the purpose of building up a damning superstructure of credit, as a means of extracting from the people of this country millions of pounds annually in interest, we should not have reached our present position in which it becomes apparent that after we repay our original debt, we shall still owe in interest an amount equal to the principal. How has that national credit been raised? In whose hands is it to-day? We on this side know, of course, that, after all, the Commonwealth Bank, in obedience to its masters, is simply issuing national credit in a way which enables the private banks to build up this tremendous superstructure of credit, in respect of which they will take interest toll of the community from now until doomsday. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.'}</inline></para>
                <para>When I made a reference earlier in my remarks to the price-fixing fraud perpetrated by this Government, I was met by an indignant interjection from an honorable senator opposite. I do not retract one thing that is implied in that statement. Every honorable senator opposite is responsible for this budget, because he is a member of the party which framed it. He knows perfectly well that the cost of every article of human consumption has increased since the declaration of war. </para>

                        <para>- Only the other day when I purchased a confection in a chemist's shop, the shopkeeper said to me, " <inline font-weight="bold">Senator, 1</inline> am sorry to say that the price has gone up from 3s. to 3s. 4d." I paid the extra 4d., because I can afford to do so. Honorable senators opposite  cannot say that prices of all commodities used for human consumption have not increased. It is not their fault that the retail price of sugar has not gone  up, because this Government has done nothing to control the- price of retail sugar. Nobody has asked that the price be increased. However, the prices of sugar products have increased, and (honorable senators opposite are aware pf that fact. Let us consider the price of tea. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> asked a question on th,is subject, but his inquiry was side-stepped. 1,  myself, do not purchase household goo-la, but I know of many people who make such purchases. I know that many people can afford to pay the increases of prices. I can certainly do so while -I am in. receipt of my present salary of £1,0C0 a year as a senator. But do not let us try to deceive our-  selves, or attempt to bluff the taxpayers  that the cost of living has not increased. I have no criticism to offer of the Prices Commissioner personally.  His  job has been created as a cunning device to enable the Government to come forth with the silly statement that the cost of living has increased by only 1.9 per cent. Such a statement is childish. I do not drink beer, nor do I smoke; but I know of tens of thousands of working men who regard a glass of beer, or a pipe, as an essential in their daily life. The Government now proposes to increase still further the cost of such commodities. The Prices Commissioner, with a great display of heroism, says to the licensed victuallers and tobacco vendors, " Do not raise your prices until Tuesday next, because I am going to get you together, and have a talk with you." But what do we find ? A conference is held, and we read in the press next morning that the prices of beer and tobacco have been increased. It is useless to say that such increases do not add to the cost of living of the worker. Only the other day I read in the journal of the Clothing Trades Employees Association that the prices of clothing and' garments, and such articles as socks, pyjamas, sheets, blankets and pillow slips, &amp;c, have risen by 12£ per cent. Recently, I also read a moving appeal made on behalf of authorities controlling public hospitals in Sydney. Honorable senators opposite must have read that appeal. All of these people cannot be telling untruths. Surely I am not the only person who is incapable of absorbing the facts. In that appeal it was stated that the cost of every' item required ' by the hospitals had increased. It was said  that -sheeting and -blankets needed by the  hospitals now cost more than before the war. Honorable senators opposite ' know the reason for this state of affairs. ;The price of woollen  yarns has increased by 20 -per cent. The Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser,</inline> of the  16th  of this month, reported -that the prices pf these articles had increased, - and commenting upon this fact the Minister for -Trade -and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> said that an inquiry into the costs and prices of woollen yarns .had disclosed increased costs of spinning. "Whilst I am not denying increased costs of production, I contend that honorable senators opposite cannot truthfully declare that the cost of living has not risen during recent months. The Government cannot have it both ways. Either costs have not increased, in which case there is no excuse for the rise of prices, or costs have increased and there is -an excuse for the- rise. But do not attempt to hoodwink me by asserting that no increase has occurred. All the efforts Of the Prices Commissioner have resulted merely in the stabilization of profits. "The Labour party has already exposed that. The Government approaches manufacturers 'engaged on defence - contracts and asks them for a list showing the  costs of the raw materials required, and detailed accounts of 'their overhead expenses. When the Government is  satisfied  with the' statements tendered, it  adds  up the costs and allows the Contractors a profit of 5 per cent. The thing is as plain as it could be. Although prices are mounting rapidly, the Government contends that the poor have no reason to complain, and stoutly affirms that the welltodo are being penalized. </para>

Tooth and Company Limited, brewers, recently declared a gross profit of nearly £2,000,000, and a net profit of £870,299, which is £14,590 greater than last year's return. After placing £15,000 into reserve, allowing £75,000 for depreciation of its properties, and carrying forward £73,863, the company paid a dividend of 12 per cent.

                        <para>- To what extent does the Government propose to tax them? I venture to prophesy that it will impose a modest tax upon a" portion of their profits; Of course, I do not blame the Ministry for adopting such a policy, because it has to obey the dictates of its masters. Ministers are being squeezed by those who control this Government's policy, and who, furthermore, will attempt to control the policy of a Labour government if they are given an opportunity to do so. But the Labour party, when it assumes office, will ensure that the expression "equality of sacrifice " is given a practical application. I am not criticizing unduly these  wealthy companies, because I -.realize that -many of them render a national service.  My contention is that they constitute an inadequately exploited field of profit, from which the Government could derive  substantial revenues. </para>

"Washington H. Soul Pattinson and Company Limited, " chain " chemists in New South Wales, for the year ended the 31st July, 1940, made a profit of £69,000. Last year its profit amounted to £70,047. Last March, it issued bonus shares to the amount of £126,000, allotting two shares for every five held.- -It paid -a dividend of -22.3 per cent, compared with 15 per cent, on its old capital ; the "final- distribution of 13.3 per cent, on the -new capital was equal to 18.6 per cent, on the old capital. If I were to read a list of the shareholders in these .companies, nearly every honorable senator opposite would hang his head in shame, because these enterprises are closely linked with this Parliament. Many honorable senators and members of the House of Representatives are their delegates in this legislature. They know that perfectly well: Last night, I listened to an outburst by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> concerning the journal published by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Did any honorable senator imagine that he was speaking " off his own bat " ? They would be childishly innocent if they did not know that he was merely singing the tune that "vested newspaper interests demand shall be' sung in this Senate. </para>

                        <para>- No. But while the Government refuses to exempt the lower-paid workers I shall .do my utmost to ensure that wealthy .companies bear their fair share of the burden. Wealthy concerns-, that a-re making, substantial profits include-: Electrolytic Zinc Company ' of Australasia Limited,. Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, Howard Smith Limited,  Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, Carlton - and United Breweries Limited, Elder Smith and Company Limited, -Woolworths Limited,  Pennys,  G. J. Coles and Company Limited, Engineering Company of Australia, Hume Pipe Company (Australia) Limited, Mick Simmons Limited, General Motors-Holden's Limited, David Jones Limited, Horderns, Farmer and Company Limited, Sydney Snow Proprietary Limited, and great insurance companies. As I stated previously, I am not criticizing these companies. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, for example, has served Australia well, and no honorable senator -has ever heard me -decry monopolies, merely because they were monopolies, if -they were rendering a national service. But they should not render that service in return for exorbitant profits, as they. «re doing. With its taxation bucket, ,the Government should dip to the depths lOt this financial well. Unfortunately;  the  ' budget makes no provision for that.--  I do not assert that it is not necessary to raise £270,000,000 in order to meet Commonwealth expenditure during the current financial year ;* but 1 contend that the burden should be fairly distributed. The companies which I mentioned are the pillars of the Government's temple. They send honorable senators opposite here to represent them and to defend them against the attacks of the Opposition. </para>

                <para>Lest I should be accused of offering only destructive criticism, I propose to make several constructive suggestions for raising revenue. First, the Government might consider the imposition of a fiat rate of 20s. in the £1, on all profits exceeding, say, 5 per cent. Regulations issued under the National Security Act already allow that percentage to firms working on defence contracts. In my opinion, every penny profit over and above that percentage should be seized by the Government. No hardship would be caused to the wealthy companies. . The big shareholders would still be able to run their -motor cars. </para>

If Ave had the necessary power in this chamber, I .should suggest  that the Government be given an opportunity to re-plan it, keeping always in mind the fact that the Opposition, both in this chamber and in the House of Representatives, is .just as strong numerically as the Ministry and its supporters. It is &gt; impossible for the Government to continue  in its own sweet way, . always demanding the right to call the tune. If -it does not yield something to the classes -that will suffer under this budget even more in the future than in the past, it must take full responsibility for what will happen in this' country when the people fully appreciate the implications of the present financial proposals. </para>

                    <para>. - Much has been said by honorable senators on various occasions about the difficulty experienced by them in obtaining information from Ministers. I am now anxious to know why I cannot gel the information that I have sought regarding the development of industries in Australia. My question regarding the establishment of the magnesium industry has been completely evaded by the responsible Minister. I asked how much magnesium is required in this- country, and he refused to give me that information. I also inquired as to the price the Government is paying for magnesium imported from abroad, and the Minister- also refused to answer. He evaded  my question as to the source from - which magnesium is being obtained by saying merely that it is produced in  the British Empire. The people of Tasmania are interested in the development of the magnesium industry, since magnesium is a commodity of which Australia is much in need at the present time. It appears that this metal is also urgently required in Great Britain. The ex-Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> received advice" from Great Britain that the authorities there would consider taking the whole of Australia's surplus production of magnesium. I want to know why the Government has, from time to time, definitely refused to give the information sought regarding this matter, and why the local industry has not been encouraged. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The Government should have given the company which proposes to establish the industry in Tasmania the assistance to which it is justly entitled. At one  stage, the Ministry questioned the advice tendered by the experts of the company, but Ipoint out that the Government has its own experts who could have been called upon to check the advice tendered. The Government also claimed that it asked the company to make a definite offer as to the quality and quantity of magnesium that it could supply, and the date when production would commence. It was stated, in reply to my question, that that offer was not made. As a matter of fact, an offer wasmade to the Government regarding the quality and quantity of the commodity that could be produced and the approximate price that would be required. The Government was asked to accept that information as a basis of negotiation. Several conferences have taken place between representatives of the Government and of the company, but on each occasion the Government has shelved the matter. Apparently, it does not wish to establish this industry in Tasmania. The company has offered to produce magnesium atabout ls. 3d. per lb., whereas the price in Great Britain to-day is about ls.11d. perlb. sterling or about 2s. 41/2d. Australian. Reports show that Great Britain offers an ample market for all magnesium that could be produced in Australia. The production of this commodity in our own country would help "Australia to preserve its overseas credit, and such an opportunity should be eagerly availed of by the Government. The company, despite the rebuffs received from the Government, is still endeavouring to establish the industry, with the assistance of the Government of Tasmania. I hope that the Commonwealth Government will change its attitude to the company. Magnesium is used extensively in the manufacture of armaments, and its production in Australia would not only assist in our finance programme, but would also help to preserve our overseas credits. At the same time, it would assist in absorbing some of the unskilled labourers whom the Government claims to be unable to place in its war industries. The encouragement of this company would also stimulate industry in Tasmania, which, up to the present time, has obtained no benefit from the defence programme. Perhaps the Government would prefer to see the industry established at Newcastle. </para>
