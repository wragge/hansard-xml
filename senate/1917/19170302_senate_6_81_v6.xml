Seeing that the intimation states that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Earle has been elected a member of the Senate, that the intimation was received by the Governor-General by wire from the Governor of Tasmania, and that it has been obviously impossible for the Governor's signature to have been attached to such a document and received here, I ask your ruling, sir, as to whether it is in accordance with the Constitution that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Earle should be allowed to take his seat until the written signature of the Governor of Tasmania has been received ? </para>

                            <para>- Order ! The honorable senator should not interject while the  President  is on his feet. The point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is abundantly provided for in the legislation of this Parliament, fully assented to by the Senate itself. In the Act which deals with the electoral representation of the country in the Senate, it is distinctly provided that everything which may be done by letter may also be done- by telegram. In Acts passed by this Legislature, there are similar provisions dealing with all matters of public utility. Therefore, as the point has been provided for by the Parliament itself, with the full knowledge and consent of the Senate, and as it is provided in the Electoral Act that everything which may be done by letter may be done by telegram, I have no option but to recognise the certificate of the Governor-General, whether the signature of the Governor of Tasmania was received by letter or by telegram. This Senate itself has already consented- </para>

                    <para>-Ide- sire to make a personal explanation in connexion with the vote which I unwittingly gave last night. I am put down in the division list as having given a vote against the party on this side, which was objecting to the adjournment of the Senate. It is not the first time that such an incident has happened, although that fact does not excuse me for' having been a little slow. I went to the table to write a telegram immediately after the announcement was made to the Senate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> had resigned. As one who had taken a great part with him in the Labour organization of Tasmania, I thought it only right to acquaint the central executive by telegram with the fact that he had resigned. The chair on the left-hand side of the table was occupied, and so I went to the other side. I was absorbed in writing the telegram; in fact, sir, I had written a message, and was re-wording it, when it suddenly dawned upon me that a division was being taken. I got up to walk across the floor, as you, sir, know, but under the Standing Orders I was too late. You said that you had already appointed the tellers, and that I must stay where I was. Had I insisted upon crossing the floor, under the Standing Orders my vote would still have been claimed for the "Ayes." This is not the first time that such a thing has occurred here. I know that on many occasions during the four years I occupied the chair at the table I did not see the senator crossing the floor when I knew which side he wanted to vote on, if he was moving to his place at the last second. I wish to explain, sir, that had I not been prevented by you from crossing the floor, my vote would have been given on this side with my party, because it is going to be recorded with my party on every occasion during this crisis; there need be no mistake about it. </para>

                        <para>- In view of the statement made by the  President  yesterday concerning the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> I feel impelled to make a statement to this honorable House and to the country concerning certain conversations that I have had with the  President  of the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> I should have certainly regarded these matters as purely confidential and of a private character, but for the suspicion that has been created in my mind that an act of political treachery has been perpetrated for the purpose of allowing the present Government to continue in office and. to defeat the people in their determination to prevent the conscription of manhood for compulsory military service abroad. About three weeks ago I was asked by the messenger to meet the  President  of the Senate in his room, and I complied with the request. He began a conversation by asking me what I thought of my chances at the coming Senate election. I said that I did not know what was likely to occur. He said, " I do not think that you have a hope of getting back here with Bowling and Rae as your colleagues." I said, " Well, we will have to take our chances." He said, " Now, I do nob want to influence you by asking you to vote for the Government, but I think, in your own interests, you would be well advised to vote for an extension of the life of Parliament. It would not be very nice for you to go back to the mines again." I said, " No; but you could not ask me to do anything like that, Tom." However, I said, " I would not determine on my own responsibility a matter which affected the whole of the party to which I belong." He said, " You think this matter over, and let me know what you think of it later on." I told him that "whatever I did I certainly would consult the wishes of the men with whom I was associated." A day or two after that we met again, and he asked' me what I thought of the proposal. I said, " Sink or swim, I will go with my mates, for you must know that if I were to act derogatively to the party's interest I would deserve to be kicked out of the district of Newcastle." On 15th February, just prior to my departure for Newcastle, I interviewed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in the Senate in connexion with some correspondence on military matters which had just come to hand, after which we entered into a conversation. During our talk, he asked me a similar question to that asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> in regard to the next Senate elections. In the course of the conversation, he told me I had not a million to one chance of winning with Bowling and Rae as my associates; to which I made no reply, as I had to'leave in order to catch my train. Upon my arrival home the following day, a telegram awaited me, which read as follows : - </para>

                    <para class="block">Two hours later, I received another wire over the telephone sent by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> stating that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> visit to Sydney had been cancelled, thus annulling the previous telegram. The following Wednesday, when I returned to the Senate, I met <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and he smilingly said, "I suppose you were a bit confused with the wires I sent you." I said "No; I took in the situation, and did not think it necessary to reply." He made no further comment at that time. Shortly afterwards, I had occasion to consult him concerning correspondence I had received' on military matters, when the question of the wires was again mentioned. I asked him what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> wished to see me about. He said "He wishes to see you on important business." I stated that I was at his disposal now if it were convenient for him. He then rang up <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and stated that I was available if he wished to see me. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> requested that I should come over straight away, which I did. I met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in his Ministerial room at the Treasury. He began a conversation by stating that he knew the difficulties surrounding my position, as we had both come out of the one mould, referring of course to our long connexion -with the Labour movement. He then asked me what stood in the way of my coming over with them. I replied, " The Labour movement." He said, "Why m'ore you than myself, Chris. Watson, George Pearce, and others who are equally attached to the Labour movement?" I said I could not discriminate in that way, as it was within their rights to act as they thought fit. They had been resting for many years in the lap of the Labour movement, and had seen many years of public service ; whilst I stood at the threshhold of my public career. He asked me did money stand in my way, as I would lose nothing by coming over to them, and stated that he had never deserted any man who had stood to him. I replied that I had too much regard for the movement to act in any way in opposition to its interests, or betray its confidence.- I said, " What would the men of Newcastle think of me were I to do anything contrary to the wishes of the party to which I belong?" He said, "If you don't like to live in Newcastle, we can find you another place." I knew then that Givens had told Hughes what I said. I replied, " Oh, I could not think of that." He then suggested that I should resign my seat and allow the vacancy to be filled, promising that a position would be found for me. I stated that I could not think of deserting the movement, and leave my mates in such a crisis, as I had always tried to act straightforwardly, and be able to look my associates in the face. He then referred to the qualities of the men who were leading the movement whose principles were not akin to mine. I said, "Whatever the ideas of these men were who were leading the movement, they were no different to what they were when he was the Leader of the party." He replied by saying . that he thought I was acting foolishly, and that I would live to regret it, I replied by saying that I would not act in any other way, as my conscience would condemn me. This ended our interview ; and I left the room feeling stronger in my devotion to the movement with which I have been associated during the whole course of my life; and that no offer that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> or any one else, would make could tempt me from the path of duty, or lead me to betray the interests of my party.. </para>

                            <para>- The statement read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> makes pointed reference to myself. I therefore claim the right to make a passing allusion to it. He has recounted an alleged conversation which occurred between himself and myself in my room. I was always under the impression - an impression which I hope will remain with me until I die - that everything said to me in my room by anybody was confidential and sacred, and that anything I said in the privacy of my home or room was sacred also. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> has not chosen to take a similar view of any conversation which occurred between him and me. The only comment I desire to make on his statement is that it is not a complete statement of the conversation, nor is it an accurate one. I cannot speak further on the matter, because the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> does not recognise that there was any obligation on him to regard the conversation as sacred or private, does not free me from the obligation to so regard it. Everything <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> said to me in that room is sacred, and will remain sacred. I have nothing further to say on the matter. </para>

                                have always held the opinion expressed by you, sir, in regard to personal conversations between senators, but perhaps in view of the fact that the interview that took place between

                                action in making the statement he has made to-day releases me from the pledge he then asked me to give that I would not reveal what he had said to me. . Speaking of myself, and not of anything that happened with the Prime Minister - a conversation of which I have no knowledge -

                                account of the events leading up to the interview he had with the Prime Minister, and as to the telegrams, is perfectly accurate, except in one significant detail. That bears on what

                                said to me in the Senate, to which I will refer later. When

I told him that I felt sure from previous conversations that I had had with him that his heart was not with the party with which he was now associated. I told him that when the announcement of policy was made, and the Coalition Government was formed, it would give him an opportunity to put himself right with his own conscience, and I advised him to seize that opportunity. I said that when he saw the programme and policy of the Government announced he would find it to be one that any Labour man could support in the present circumstances of war, and that he should seize the opportunity of breaking from the party with which he was now associated, and follow the dictates of his conscience by supporting a Government that was bringing in that policy. The part that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> has left out of his story is his reply, which was that he would like to be with us ; that he knew that he ought to be with us- </para>

                            <para>- Arising out of the answer, may I ask if it is possible for the public to get a correct reason for the prohibition placed upon that meeting? First the Prime Minister says that neither he nor any one in his Department forbade it. The Lord Mayor of Melbourne has publicly stated that he received a telephonic communication from the Prime Minister's office prohibiting the holding of that meeting for reasons of State. </para>

                            <para>- It is impossible for me or any other Minister to give an affirmative reply to the honorable senator's question. The answer given previously shows that under a misapprehension some telephonic communication was made to the Lord Mayor. What action he took as the result of that communication I cannot say. I have endeavoured to satisfy the honorable senator's laudable curiosity on this question, but it is impossible for me to do so. </para>

I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> that a new Government has been formed since then. The matter has not been under the consideration of that Government, but within the next few days I will endeavour to get the matter finalized, and to place myself in a position to give the honorable senator a definite statement. </para>

                        <para>As the senator who moved the adjournment of this debate last night, I feel that the present is rather an inopportune time to proceed with a serious discussion of the policy of the Government in view of the statements that have been made this morning in regard to certain incidents which are alleged to have taken place. I have no desire to offer an opinion upon those statements; 1 prefer to hold my judgment in suspense until I have had a further opportunity of gauging their merits. lt is most regrettable that such charges should have been made on the floor of this Chamber. Honorable senators who make them incur a very great responsibility - the responsibility of justifying them. </para>

                        <para>- As a member of the Senate, I very much regret that such statements should have been made in this Chamber. I shall await with anxiety an explanation of the whole of the circumstances, so that we may be able to judge clearly as to what- is the position. I have been anxious to hear what honorable senators opposite had to say in regard to the policy of the Government, and to carefully weigh any suggestions which they might make for the more vigorous prosecution of the war in which we are now engaged. Great Britain and her Allies are fighting for their liberty, and, at the same time, for the maintenance of our liberties, rights, and privileges. There has been plenty of criticism of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes, Sir William</inline> Irvine, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, but I have listened in vain for one suggestion from honorable senators opposite to improve the policy announced in the Ministerial statement. If they have any suggestions of the kind, honorable senators should certainly make them known at this juncture; Parliament is not now sitting under normal conditions, dealing with domestic policy. Our business at this time transcends all questions of party politics, and it is the duty of members of all parties to devote their energies conscientiously to assisting the Government of the country in the present great emergency. This is not a time for the criticism of individuals, but a time when members of all parties should be equally concerned to see that Australia does "her t&gt;art in the great struggle  in which the Empire is engaged. "In these circumstances it was thought right that the country should be asked to approve of a system of compulsory military service. The country did not approve of it at the referendum, and .the Government have accepted its decision on that great question for the time being. But that by no means concludes the matter. Circumstances might arise which would tend to convert the majority against conscription into a minority. I quite recognise, however, that before the question is again submitted to the people we should be prepared to advance reasons which will justify a change in the attitude they have taken up. I do not cast any aspersions upon those who voted against conscription at the referendum. I think they were mistaken in the vote they gave, because they had leader's who led them into an unfortunate position. One of the leaders of the anti-conscription campaign is a member of the Senate who has told us that, although he is within the fighting age, he is not prepared to offer his services to the country, and is not, therefore; prepared to ask others to do so. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> has said that he will not go to the front of his own volition, no matter what the emergency of the country may be. Let me say now that any man who attempts to compare the Boer war .with the struggle which is now going on in Europe must be bereft of his senses. There is no comparison between the two. At present the Empire is struggling for its very life. Does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> realize what would be the result if Great Britain had to go down, and Germany were to be supreme, in the present war ? Does he not realize that many of his cherished ambitions and all the liberties he now enjoys would be entirely swept away? If we have to look to men like the honorable senator for a lead in this matter, we shall have to rely upon a broken reed. A man may conscientiously object to conscription, and believe in voluntarism, and yet be prepared to do what is best in the interests of the community, and I ask honorable senators opposite to say whether they are prepared to accept their share of responsibility at the present juncture. An opportunity was afforded them recently to assist in the formation of a truly National Government, representing all parties in this Parliament, in the hope of securing the best advice possible in the carrying on of the war. If they had taken advantage of that opportunity, neither the Hughes party nor the . Liberal party would have had supreme power in the Cabinet. In common with the party represented by honorable senators opposite they would each have had only their proportionate share of representation in the National Government. There could then have been no question of a party propaganda to the detriment of any particular section of the community. It would have been absolutely impossible for such a National Government to have dealt with any matter other than the great purpose for which it would have been formed. I say that it will redound to the discredit of honorable senators who separated themselves from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> that when they were asked to assist in the formation of a National Government for the prosecution of a war policy they declined to have anything to do with it. Many excuses have been given for their refusal. It has been said that they were accused of being unpatriotic, of being supporters of the German policy, -and other things of that sort.  But these accusations could have had no bearing upon the position put before them when they were invited to assist in the formation of a National Government. It would have been well for this country, and the position it occupies in the face of the world', if it could have been said that honorable senators opposite were prepared to set aside party passion and prejudice and join with others to secure the liberties of the nation to the fullest possible extent. It is said that any help that Australia can give to the Empire in the present emergency is a mere nothing. On the contrary, it would be, as it has been hitherto', something very considerable. Australians have won renown for their conduct on the field of battle, and we desire that the honorable name which they have won for this Commonwealth shall be maintained. Th« men who have gone to the front say to us, " We want help. We are overburdened with duties, and desire relief from time to time, but when we ask you for assistance you decline to give it." These men have a claim upon the country. They voluntarily accepted their responsibility for the defence of the country, and if there are men here who are not prepared to follow their example it is right that they should be called upon to realize the position they occupy. It is often claimed that there are many unionists amongst the men at the front, and I ask honorable senators opposite whether those men are not worthy of consideration and assistance. If the possibilities of the voluntary system have not yet been exhausted, let us do what we can to forward it. But we may do many things in connexion with the prosecution of the war besides the work of actual fighting, and I should have liked to have seen some proposal put forward by the Government for the introduction of some form of national service that would utilize the energies of every man and woman in the. Commonwealth. If we look to Great .Britain we shall find that while she never set herself up to be a great military power before this war, she has become such a power in the course of the last two years. I suppose that prior to the war her force of professional soldiers under arms was less than 300,000, hut now she has an army of between 5,000,000 and 6,000,000. We find also that in Great Britain millions of women have been mobilized, and are doing their share in connexion with the great struggle in which the Empire is engaged. We know also that there are many men in Great Britain who, though unconnected with the armed forces of the country, are doing their share to assist. It would be a good thing if the present Government were to devise some scheme of national service for the Commonwealth. We might say to the people that we need their help; that we regard it as their duty to assist, and that while we shall gladly hail all who are prepared to go to the front, we shall not compel any one to do so, but we expect that those who do not go to the front will be prepared to give what assistance they can in the development of the country and its industries, to provide food, munitions of war, or anything else that may be useful to the Empire and her Allies. In the great cities of Sydney and Melbourne we see scores of thousands of young men and women who are not raising a finger to assist the nation in its present difficulty. Why should they not be called upon, instead of idling about the streets as too many of them do, to take an active part in connexion with the war ? It may be that many of them are only waiting for a lead, as they do not themselves know how the services they are prepared to render can be best utilized. The Government should see that the services of every person are utilized, and should devise means ito this end. We could provide foodstuffs, clothing, and many other things to assist the Allied nations in carrying on the war. Under such a scheme of , national service there should be no such thing as strikes, lockouts or difficulties of that kind. I see no reason why the unskilled labour that is  today idle in our great cities should npt be taken to the broad acres of the Commonwealth to assist in developing the country. It might be said that this is a Utopian idea, in view of the large number of strikes and lockouts, that have been reported in Australia during the last few years; but if every individual is determined that there shall be nothing of that kind in the future, and fair and reasonable treatment is meted out all round, no serious trouble need occur. If the matter is placed before the unions, and they are asked to help us in this crisis, surely we can come to some reasonable understanding. Let us cease all quarrelling that can be avoided, and by that means enable Australia to render great and loyal help to the Empire, for by so doing we shall also be strengthening the foundations of our own future greatness. If only we can get men to go on to our broad acres, they will experience the charm of country life, they will enjoy a good livelihood, and all this will redound to the benefit of our country. It is a mission that may well be taken in hand, not only by the Government, but by individuals in the community. Let us also inculcate in our people the desirability of doing without many of those luxuries which they enjoy at present. Instead of spending unduly, let them save so that they may be the better able to help the country to stand up in the great emergency to the difficulties that will confront us in the future. Great Britain, a nation in arms, is doing all that is possible in this crisis, and still she has to rely upon assistance from outside Dominions to a great extent. In the Mother Country the importation of articles of luxury is now prohibited in order that the whole nation may bend its energies to the accomplishment of the great task before its people; We were told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> in his quotation from the speech made by General Haig that Great Britain was winning, and was bound to win the war. But the honorable senator omitted to mention that General Haig had laid it down as a condition that the man power of the nation would be available to achieve this victory which we all hope will be reported in the not distant future. There is a great responsibility upon every country interested in this war to do everything possible to provide the maximum strength in man power during the next twelve months, for we must not forget what has been said on the other side. Reports of speeches made in Germany show that they are of practically the same nature as statements delivered on our side; and we know that, so far, Germany remains in possession of country which  she seized in the early stages of the war, and before the Allies were in a position to stand upon the defensive. Since then the Allies have made certain gains from time to time, but they have been small  as compared with what we hope to gain. Our enemies are exercising every power they possess to make an Allied victory impossible, and in order that they' may prepare for another great war in the near future. We must prevent this if we can. One of the greatest disasters that could overtake us would be an inconclusive peace, which must come about if the war is not pushed to a victorious end. Unless we do this, we might possibly get Belgium and the northern part of France restored, but our enemies would at once lay their plans for a future war of revenge against our people. We want this war to place us in such a position that we shall be able to preserve the peace of the world and the rights and liberties of smaller nations. But let us remember that we shall be burdened with heavy taxation for many years to come because we have had to borrow in untold millions to carry on this great conflict. Our people must be prepared to suffer many privations in the future to keep faith with those who have assisted us in finding the sinews of war in the way of money. Of course, we shall have some sort of indemnity. We are looking for indemnities for the ruthless destruction of life and property, both on land and sea. It is our bounden duty as a nation to protect those who have lost so heavily on land and sea; but even if we get indemnities, we shall have a heavy millstone of taxation around our necks fora great number of years. Our delegates are going to England to take counsel with delegates from the other Dominions, and with the representatives of the Mother Country, in relation to matters connected with this war. Probably one of the subjects for discussion will be the best means to adopt for the future conduct of the war, and also the terms upon which it may be possible eventually to assent to peace. Whatever views our delegates may hold with regard to the future of this country I can sympathize with them in the task that lies before them. I believe any mail, whether he belongs to this side of the chamber or the other side, would go to the Conference with an honest desire to do what was right. We must remember, however, that the Ministry of the day are responsible for the appointment of the delegates; and, whether they have a majority in both Houses or not, I feel sure that they will take good care that the interests of the Commonwealth are safeguarded at the forthcoming Conference. When we talk about a White Australia policy, I ask honorable senators where is that policy to be settled! Is it to be settled on the floor of our Parliaments here, irrespective of the conditions which may then prevail, not alone in Great Britain, but in the countries of our Allies ? Let us not forget that, although we, as an integral portion of the Empire, are more deeply interested in the policy of a White Australia than any other part of the Empire, other interests will have to be considered; and our views must be placed before that Conference in order that we may, if possible, have our aspirations fulfilled. Of late years we have had a menace to the north of Australia through the occupation by Germany of portion of New Guinea. That menace would not have existed had there not been at the Head of affairs in Great Britain men who realized what was likely to happen in the future through enemy occupation of that territory. I say that Australia and New Zealand, as sister Dominions, should be the dominant power over the whole of the southern Pacific Ocean. . Our interests lie here. We are on the spot, and we are the people who are best able to administer affairs in this part of the world. The interests of Australia arc paramount in the Southern . Pacific, and they must be safeguarded. Do honorable senators think for a moment that any one of the three gentlemen about to proceed to London will be recreant to his trust? Their public lives and public utterances give a lie to any suggestion of that kind. </para>

                        <para>.- Yes, of course, there is too, much at stake to allow them to be recreant to their trust. And is it not a good thing that Australia has been invited to this Conference? Is it not a good thing to know that the Dominions are going to take their part in the Conference, and that, perchance, some argument which may. be adduced by one of our representatives may have an important bearing on the peace negotiations at the end of the war ? In any case, I would urge honorable senators to bear in mind that if, for party political purposes, we attempt to belittle the reputation of the delegates, we shall probably be doing something to impair the influence that ought to be exercised by them at this important Conference. It would be immaterial to me who were at the head of affairs in Australia so long as I believed that they were true and staunch to the great principles of right and justice. We may be divided as to the laws dealing with labour and the settlement of industrial disputes. We may have strong differences of opinion, but what are those differences compared with the great issues which are at stake I Suppose that we were all in a great building which was burning. Would we stop opposite to one another and say, " I will not assist to put out the fire, because somebody else is going to assist. I do not believe that he is any good in putting out a fire, and, therefore, I will not help? " We are told by the old proverb that a house divided against itself must fall. That would be the position in regard to Australia. I want our people to realize that fact. T desire the Government to recognise that they have to bring forward a great constructive policy. I want the Government to realize that they have to utilize, as far as possible, the services of every individual in the community, and to legislate in such a way that the people generally will recognise that the legislation is the voice of their own Parliament - the only body which can deal with any matter efficiently at the present moment. If the Parliament determines that certain things shall be done, let the members of the nation say, "We will do what we can to carry out these determinations. If disinclination or the pressure of family or other ties render it impossible for us to go to the front, we will give proper attention to our special duties." In that way these men could assist in bringing the great war to an end. Are wo determined to do these things? Are we a loyal people? Are we a true people ? If we are loyal, if we are true to the Empire, to our country, to ourselves even, we can make no. mistake. We must realize our duty - the duty which should be paramount with' every individual. I hold strong views as to the duties of the members of a community. I believe that every man who accepts the benefits, the advantages, and the protection of a great community, owes much to it. I consider that every unit owes a duty to his fellowmen and to his country, and that duty is to place his life at the service of the community if that be necessary to preserve the national existence. A community, like an individual, has a soul, and that soul will speak to the community whether it is going to take the upward course of a free and righteous nation, or the downward course of associating itself with ignoble and wretched ideals, and by that means falling into a state of degradation. With . an individual and with a nation it is much the same in that respect. Take one man and send him into the world with noble ideals and great aspirations, and he will probably make good. But take another man, fill him up with ignoble, degrading ideas, with miserable ambitions, or with no ambitions, put him in surroundings of a similar character, and what good can you expect? He will fall amongst the dregs of the population. He will be no good to himself, to his fellow-citizens, to anybody on the face of God's earth. So it is, too, with a nation. We want to build up this young nation, and make it realize that it has a soul, and that its soul is shown by its outward actions. If that course is not adopted, then God help the nation! It must go down into the very dregs. History has taught us that ancient civilizations attained great prosperity, but went down gradually and gradually through the innovation of weakness, the luxurious habits of the people, and a disinclination to serve the country. Finally, in each instance the country went down, and so it ought. Such will be the future of our nation if its individual citizens do not realize the great duty which is cast upon them in this very grave emergency. </para>

                        <para>. - The other day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, addressing himself to this motion, and referring to honorable senators sitting on this side, made the somewhat sweeping assertion that they had crawled into the Labour movement. I do not know whether he meant that remark for any or all of the honorable senators on this side, but if he referred to me, I wish to say here and now that the statement is inaccurate in every detail. I could use stronger language, but if I did I would be in conflict with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and you, sir. I was practically born in the Labour movement: I was a half -member of the Durham Miners Association when I was twelve years of age, so that if the honorable senator included me in his  sweeping assertion I hurl the insult back in his teeth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has just been referring to the Imperial Conference and our delegation. I have said here repeatedly that it is imperative that Australia should be represented at the War Conference in London. I have also said that this Parliament should know what subjects are going to be discussed there, and that the delegates who have been appointed should have instructions from this Parliament before they go. So far I have had no definite statement on the subject, and I can only gather from recent events that the delegates will go to London, and do as they please without this Parliament having been consulted or considered good, bad, or indifferent. I regret the position very much, and if there was any possible constitutional means " to prevent these gentlemen from leaving our shores without instructions from this Parliament, I would be one to resort to such procedure. These gentlemen will not go to London representing Australian opinion. Not one of the three delegates to-day has the confidence of the people of Australia. But seeing that it is imperative that Australia should be represented at the Conference, and admitting that the Government of the day can appoint the delegates which they have done, I submit that in consideration to the people of this country their representatives should have something to say before the delegation leaves these shores. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> come now to events which occurred about two months ago, and when the great betrayal took place - when the Hughes party coalesced with the Cook party. It is the greatest betrayal that the people of Australia have ever had, and I believe that . it will be the last one. Let us examine the company in which honorable senators on that side, who were recently my party colleagues, find themselves today. I will start with the right honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. If ever there was a man in Australian politics who was condemned from Dan to Beersheba by Senators Pearce and de Largie on every opportunity they had on the platforms of Western Australia, and within this Parliament itself, it was <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. Yet to-day we find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> sitting in the same Cabinet with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, whose vote may be the casting vote, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie following the right honorable gentleman as Treasurer. During the recent campaign on the question of compulsory military service overseas, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> gave a solemn assurance in the Town Hall at Kalgoorlie that the taxation proposals of the Government would be gone on with and carried out to the letter. Where are those taxation proposals now? </para>

We have heard the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> indicating the policy of the present hybrid Government. It is, he says, neither a rich man's Government nor a poor man's Government. It will not introduce domestic legislation, and it will not be reactionary; consequently, it is going to stand still. Following that statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> at Kalgoorlie, we find him now in the same Cabinet with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, as Treasurer, who, during the recent agitation, was responsible, along with two others, for a circular being sent amongst the people of the Western State, which I intend to read, and then we will find out in what company these honorable gentlemen are now when they are going to carry out the taxation proposals of the Government of that day with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, who is the Treasurer, and one of the three delegates to represent Australia at the most momentous period of her history. The history of this circular falling into the hands of a Labour member of the Western Australian Parliament is rather unique. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hudson,</inline> the honorable member for Yilgarn, happened to receive the circular. . It was simply addressed to " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hudson,"</inline> at Claremont, where he lives.

The leading article in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> this morning indicated that any time will do for it; and in the same journal prominence was given on Monday last to a letter by J.

As the member for Bunbury <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thomas)</inline> has indicated, the Labour party passed a resolution in April last, as follows : - " That this Council urges the Federal Government to exercise its powers, contained in the War Precautions Act, to conscribe  all wealth for war purposes, seeing that money for the efficient equipping of troops is of greater importance to the Commonwealth than the welfare of the interests of owners of wealth." </para>

                                Forrest did not offer £100 a year for three years to help to repatriate our sick and wounded men who were coming back from the front. That is loyalty of a kind that might not appeal to him, but still we hear from the benches over yonder cries of loyalty, patriotism, save the Empire, and win the war. The circular I have read indicates that they were bothering not about winning the war, but saving their own banking accounts, and conserving the few shillings they had in their pockets.

It has not been published in any newspaper that I know of that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, or W. T. Loton, or Septimus Burt promised £100 per year for three years to help the sick and wounded men coming back after fighting the Empire's battles on the fields of France. That circular seeking financial assistance to defeat the taxation proposals of the Labour party was signed by the present Treasurer of the Commonwealth in order to save his own pocket, and now we find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce, Senator Russell, Mr. Hughes,</inline> and two others who were in the late Government, in the same Cabinet with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, who has control of the purse strings, and can direct the taxation proposals of the Government in regard to winning the war. A public debt of £130,000,000 stares us in the face. Where are we to get the money from? Notwithstanding the magnificent conditions of the loan, with 4j per cent, interest, and freedom from income taxation, the response has not been at all surprising. Because the old Labour party suggested a wealth tax <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, Burt, and others of that calibre made the appeal I have read. They say, " Tax the worker all the time. Tax the poor man, but do not touch our wealth." <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, during the last appeal to the people on the question of compulsory service overseas, recommended compulsion of men for service abroad, but when we proposed to touch his banking account he said, " Hands off ! I will give £100 a year for three years to defeat the taxation proposals of the Labour party." Yet that gentleman is to-day the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. Such is the history, such is the result of events. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps the honorable senator has not listened to some of the speeches made during the last few days in this chamber. Members and supporters of the Government have said it. Let me compare their spineless proposals with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law's straight-out declaration as Chancellor of the Exchequer in London a little while ago. When the last loan, which has been such a tremendous success, was proposed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law made this very significant statement : " If this loan is not a success, the next time we try to get money 5J per cent, interest will not be paid on it. There are other measures that we can adopt, and no interest will be payable." This meant in effect that the British Government would conscript all wealth, and give anything that was left after the war was over to those who had owned it. We have in the Commonwealth to-day a Government without a policy of any class or description. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so, but I do not think it will improve the temper of the debate if those matters are referred to. To-day's exhibition was sufficient indication to me that there is something going on. We on this side are told by the Government on every occasion that we are not anxious to win the war, but are hampering its conduct, that we have been associated with the Industrial Workers of the World, that we are Huns and pro-Germans, and that our hands are soiled with German gold. Notwithstanding those statements, they asked us to join them in the formation of a so-called National Administration. If they believed that our hands were soiled with. German gold ; if they believed that we were traitors to our country; why did they invite us to join them? Either their statements were true, or they were false. If true, why did they ask us to join them, and, if false, why were they uttered ? But when were we asked to join them ? Five weeks had elapsed in negotiations between the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and the Leader of the Liberal party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook.</inline> Between these two gentlemen and the parties which they represent an earnest endeavour had been made to form a Coalition Government independently of the Australian Labour party. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator has not been listening to my speech, otherwise he would not make that statement. I repeat that at least five weeks passed in negotiations between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> in their endeavour to form a Coalition Governmentwithout my own party being considered in the matter at all. Is that right? </para>

                            <para>- It is. The first intimation which the Australian Labour party received in relation to this matter took the form of an invitation to discuss the establishment of a National Administration. That invitation came not from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> but from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook. I was present when our Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor,</inline> received the letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook.</inline></para>

Ever since I have known him he has been logical, but there was no statement made by him yesterday which could be called an argument, and very often his statements were not statements of fact. </para>

I was asked my- opinion of this proposed combination - this triple alliance, this Government comprised of the representatives of three parties - and I replied by asking the question, " Have you ever read the fable of the spider and the fly?" The answer given was " Yes." " Very good," I said, " then I will not be the fly, because I know the spider too well." I refused to be a party to any such triangular alliance. Under no consideration would I be a party to it. The only importance which really attached to the question was whether or not the present Prime Minister would retain the Prime Ministership, and who would be given the different portfolios. </para>

                            <para>- The cry just now is "Economy, and Win the war." A day or two ago the people of Australia were under the impression that they would shortly be faced with an election for the Senate, in view of the fact that eighteen of the present members of the Senate must retire on the 30th June. The present Government brought forward a proposal in both Houses to extend the life of this Parliament until six months after the declaration of peace or until the 18th October, 1918, whichever should be the earlier date. If . that proposal were approved by both branches of this Legislature, the Imperial Parliament would be asked to extend the life of this Parliament for the period mentioned. It was known that in the Senate there was a majority of two against such a proposal. Within the last twenty-four hours developments have occurred which have temporarily transferred the majority in the Senate from this side to the Government side. When the Leader of the Senate again brings forward the motion which disappeared from our business-paper yesterday, as a result of a trial of strength between parties in this chamber, it will be carried by the temporary majority behind the Government, and the Imperial Parliament will be asked to interfere with our Constitution. The development to which I refer was extremely sudden, since whilst one member of the Senate resigned his seat at one minute past 6 o'clock yesterday evening, another senator from the State of Tasmania has taken the oath and his seat here to-day. </para>

Had it not been for this sudden development, eighteen members of the Senate would have had to go to the country to secure the decision of the people. If as the result of the Senate election the majority had been wrested from this side, the Government would have gone on with their proposal for the extension of the life of the Parliament. Under existing circumstances this course will not be followed, as I understand that pairs are not to be given for Senators Long and Guy, who are absent through illness. </para>

Had the situation to which I have referred been created, the cry of economy would have gone by the board, because the Government would have proceeded to stake £100,000 of the people's money in a political gamble to wrest the majority from honorable senators on this side by a vote of the people. They have a majority temporarily to-day, but if pairs are granted in the usual way, when the motion of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> gave notice to-day is brought forward next week, it will be rejected. If, on the contrary, the Government will not grant pairs to the sick senators who are absent from this side, they will carry the motion by their temporary majority, and will then invoke the assistance of the Imperial Parliament to prolong the life of this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion, the cry for economy is not genuine. There is only one constitutional way in which the present political position can be settled, and that is by leaving it to the decision of the people at the ballot-box. Now that they have a temporary majority in both Houses of this Parliament, I wonder what the Government will do with the Tariff. Will they bring down a revision of the Tariff ? Are the anomalies of the present Tariff to be removed ? Will the true incidence of Protection be provided for, or will the Government merely bring down a measure ratifying the collection of Customs duties at the rates now imposed ? Important as is the question of winning the war, I say that, so far as we are concerned in Australia, it is imperative that the Tariff should be revised at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                            <para>- That is because the outside world and the people of Australia have no confidence in the present hybrid Government, and not because of the protective incidence of the present Tariff. I am wondering whether the Government intend to appoint a Committee to investigate Defence administration, Naval and Military. I believe such an investigation has been promised, and the sooner it takes place the better. We have  had instances of leakages in certain directions which justify a strict inquiry into our Defence administration. As the cases of some men who have been charged with offences are still <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> I shall make no more detailed reference to the leakages that are said to have taken place, but without reflecting upon any Minister, I may say that honorable members on both sides in this Parliament are agreed that it is imperative that there should be a close investigation into the financial side of the Defence Department. I was very glad to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie some time age refer to the action of the InterState shipping companies in refusing to issue return tickets to people travelling by the Inter-State boats. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> was in charge of the matter when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie directed attention to it, and still has control of freights and rates. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie brought up the matter he pointed out that passengers by InterState boats were being charged much more by having to pay for single tickets, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> admitted that it was practically highway robbery, and agreed to investigate the complaint. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie will not lose sight of the fact that the travelling public are still suffering from this imposition by the Inter-State shipping companies, and will see that the present Government do not remain inactive in the matter. I have no more to say on the motion. I have expressed my opinion upon various matters that are confronting us at the present time. I very much regret the developments that have taken place and which have resulted in the transfer of the majority from this to the other side of the Senate. If the Government desire a fair and just trial of strength between the parties to determine whether there should be an election for the Senate or for both Houses they have only to give pairs to our sick, senators, Senators Long and Guy, and so enable the people of Australia to deal with the present situation. </para>

                            <para>- A stranger to this chamber might assume that the honorable senators opposite are really a vitriolic and violent body of men, but if a stranger should entertain that opinion I should like to disabuse his mind at once. The pose of honorable senators opposite will not deceive anybody. They are really the mildest-mannered and most pleasant body of men we have ever met, and their appearance of ferocity, whilst it might prove useful for outside purposes, has no effect in this chamber at all. Now, I want to give the reasons for asking the Senate <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> take this somewhat unusual course. It is not at all usual for the Senate, save towards the end of the session, to meet on a Monday, and when it does so act it is because of the pressure of public business. Honorable senators know that it is contemplated to send from these shores a delegation to take part in the Imperial Conference. </para>

                            <para>- Judging from the difficulty I have in giving expression to my views, it does not. seem that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> desires that the people shall have the opportunity he speaks of. There is before the Senate a proposition for the specific purpose of enabling the Senate to take whatever action it thinks fit with regard to the delegation. Members of the delegation are in this 'position : Time is a very important factor. The Conference is pressing. The circumstances are such as to brook of no delay. It is due, therefore, that Parliament should finalize this business at the earliest possible moment.. To my mind, it is inconceivable that any gentlemen appointed as the  delegation would consent to proceed England until they knew that, having started on an important mission, they will be permitted to carry it through without any interruption by any adverse parliamentary action during their absence. In these circumstances, and time being an important factor, I am asking members of , the Senate to meet, possibly at great inconvenience to themselves, on Monday next for the purpose of dealing with the motion to provide for the prolongation of the life of Parliament. If this motion is adopted, it will leave the road perfectly clear for the delegation to proceed to England, but I am bound to say also - I want to put the facts frankly and clearly before honorable senators - that the Government and members of the delegation take the view that, until Parliament has pronounced itself upon this matter, it is not possible for them to proceed to that Conference. I have reason to hope, when the Government seek co operation of members in this matter that, in view of the big issues involved, such co-operation will be given. But if Parliament is unable to indorse the proposal of the Government, the only alternative is to remit the issue to the electors themselves. I have endeavoured to state the position as frankly as possible. The Government, through me, tell members of this Chamber that the delegates will not feel justified in going until they are assured that the road is absolutely clear. They cannot proceed upon that mission if there is any prospect of humiliation being heaped upon them in the middle of their deliberations. </para>

                            <para>- We want an assurance that they shall not be humiliated by any parliamentary action during their absence. The Government, in putting the proposal before the Senate, invite support. If that support is not forthcoming, there is, as I have said, only one alternative which any self-respecting Government could take in the circumstances, namely, to remit the issue to the people themselves. I admit at once that much inconvenience will be caused to honorable senators. I have been too long in Parliament not to know that, from force of habit, members who live in distant cities are accustomed to make certain week-end engagements which this motion will interfere with; but, in the circumstances which I have outlined, I appeal to them to submit to the inconvenience in order that the greater public convenience may be served. </para>

The only assurance I give is that the proposal will meet my utmost hostility. The Government are asking the Senate to do on Monday  morning  what we proposed to do  yesterday,  hut which the action of the Leader of the Government prevented us from doing. The proposal was on the notice-paper in the proper way, and it should have been submitted to the Senate, but the Leader of the Government refused to do that. He now asks us to meet at 11 o'clock on Monday morning. </para>

No official statement has been made in this chamber that any delegation has been invited to proceed to England. Some days ago I asked the Leader of the Government if it were a fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had received an invitation, and if it were a fact that others were included, and the Minister replied that, so far as the first part of the question was concerned, an invitation had been received, but that he was nob in a position to answer the second part of my question. If the Leader of the Government did not know the purport of that invitation, is it a fair thing to ask us to act, as it were, blindfolded in the Senate, by discussing something of which we know nothing officially? </para>

                            <para>- It is quite true that there was no go-slow policy with the Government in this matter, but I venture to say that there lias been nothing so degrading in the history of the Industrial Workers of the World. This action by the Government is the most disgraceful that the public of Australia has ever seen. It is the most discreditable thing that has ever been brought before the Australian Parliament. Let us look at the ' facts : The papers this morning informed us that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> - now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> - had placed his resignation in the hands, T presume, of the  Speaker  in Tasmania. I would like to know from him when he handed his resignation to the  Speaker. </para>

                            <para>- This is a time for impatience. Can one sit quietly by when everything points to a plot, planned in the cellars and in darkness, to handle the business of the Senate as if it was the property of a clique, of a junta, of the governing party that send a mysterious telegram to the Premier of another State to meet them? Yesterday I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> if he knew whether the visit of the Premier of Tasmania to Sydney was made on public or private business, and although he is the Leader of the Senate he did not know. I venture to say that we all know pretty well what that business was. </para>

                            <para>- It appeared in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> on Monday morning. What is a fair surmise of the business which was to be considered? It is that in' their anxiety to win the war the Government were arranging for the retirement of an honorable senator who would not consent to a prolongation of the life of Parliament or to the departure of, shall I say, secret junta delegates - delegates not representing in Parliament the people, but representing the secret conclaves of two parties brought together by - what? The most desperate and despicable means ever attempted in the public life of this country. The arrangements were complete. A member of the Tasmanian Parliament handed in his resignation and came here, waiting on the doormat for the Senate to meet so that he might take his seat to play his discreditable part in this discreditable proceeding. I do not think that the Government will be able to persuade the people of the Commonwealth that all these things were coincidences. It resembles too much the undermining of the people's liberties for them to stand much more of such proceedings. </para>

                            <para>- The interjection from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is on a par with all his interjections. He said once in the Senate, by way of interjection, that I had refused a pair to him. A little while ago he did ask me for a pair, and I informed him that two members of our party, Senators Long and Guy, were ill, and that he could be paired with either of them. He thought that I was childish enough to say that while his party were allowing our members who were ill to go without pairs, I would give him a pair. </para>

                            <para>- I do not care whether the honorable senator calls it a dead pair or a live pair. If the business of our public life, even now, is to be lifted, particularly in the Senate, to a state of decency, I appeal to the new senator for Tasmania to give a pair to a colleague who is ill and unable to attend. If there is any justice in giving "pairs at all it lies in giving pairs to men who are physically unable to attend. </para>

                            <para>- As soon as we are so informed we shall be prepared to change the pairs. There need be no haggling or quibbling on this matter. As soon as the absent senators say that they have changed their opinions they will no longer be members of our party, and no longer shall we seek pairs for them. But whilst they are members of the Labour party I am determined that if the Coalition party will not grant pairs, at any rate the public shall know the means by which that party have got a majority to carry out what they are trying to carry out behind the backs of the people. This fact must be made known and driven home. Here is a Government confronted to-day with a statement which, I venture to say, would lead any decent Government to immediately close Parliament so that it might be sifted. </para>

                            <para>- I again appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> to withdraw the expression which he, from his long and varied parliamentary experience, must know is unparliamentary. It is in the interests of every honorable senator, no matter which side of the Senate he sits on, that the proceedings of the Senate shall be conducted in an orderly and proper way, and in accordance with established custom and precedent. Even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> is convinced that the statement he made is right, his method of describing the matter was couched in unparliamentary language. There are other ways in which all these things can be described in parliamentary language. I appeal to the honorable senator again, for the sake of the good name of the Senate and the orderly conduct of its business, not to persist in his present attitude, by which he forces' the Leader of the Government and myself to take steps which we should much regret having to take. </para>

                        <para>- I was endeavouring to voice my complaint against the unseemly conduct of the Government in refusing to move a motion yesterday, and now asking us to meet at 11 o'clock on Monday morning to do what they were not prepared . to do yesterday. I know why they were not prepared to do it then. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> yesterday how much money was in the secret service fund of the Government, and he said, "Less than when I was there." I venture to say considerably less. For the last week they have conducted the business of the country in a way that would be a disgrace to a thimble-rigger on a race-course. They are anxious for the work to proceed hurriedly, 30 that no time may be allowed for these serious charges to reach the outside public. If they did, there would be indignation from one end of Australia to the other. When the Government get the vote through on Monday morning, they will have scored their victory by discontinuing a courtesy that has been extended in all Parliaments from time immemorial. They will show on the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> of the Senate that they have a majority, but the public will know that that majority is due to the fact that they would not give their colleagues, who are unable through illness to attend, the pairs that have always been extended to sick men. Although the Government and their supporters are filled with a burning desire to get the business through, and are desperately in earnest in wishing to send their delegates to represent Australia, the voice of the Australian people will rise in still louder condemnation because of the means the Government are adopting to send those delegates Home. If ever there was an occasion on which Australia should have been represented by a representative Australian, it is this. Before what happened to-day took place, I did not care if it was William Morris Hughes that went. If one Australian delegate was invited, let one man go, but when only one man is invited, why are the Government sending three without telling Parliament and the country the contents or conditions of the invitation ? In view of what has just occurred, we shall have to be mighty civil now, or we shall not be suspended for one day only. We shall be under the tyranny of a junta who are looking for salvation to the moneybags of Australia, and thinking that if they can purchase the Senate they can purchase Australia. I tell them they cannot. There is not money enough in Australia to buy up the free people of Australia. The people outside will remain unpurchased and unpurchasable. Whatever secret methods are adopted to rush the business of this Parliament through, they will hear of it, and the long arm of justice will reach out and seize these men one by one, no matter where they may be. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to transgress the Standing Orders, and, as a matter of fact, I had forgotten that we were not discussing the usual motion for adjournment. If the Government really intend to get this particular business transacted they might just as well meet the Senate at 2.30 o'clock on Monday afternoon as at 11 o'clock on Monday morning. I ask the Leader of the Government to alter his motion in such a way as not to compel representatives from distant States to remain in Melbourne over the week end. If the Government are not prepared to do that, if they must have their pound of flesh, we will take care that they get it. But they will get no blood with it. They will get an even deal right through. But there is another reason why we should not meet on Monday. That is to be found in the circumstance that, to-day in this Chamber, the gravest charge ever laid against a Prime Minister was laidby <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson.</inline> Surely the Governmentought to make some announcement as to what they intend to do in respect of that charge. I ask Ministers not to hurry through the proposal relating to the prolongation of the life of this Parliament, but to treat it as ordinary business, and to bring it on for consideration when the Senate reassembles at the ordinary hour of meeting. </para>

Is that proposal put forward because there is a possibility that an honorable senator who is known to be on a sick bed, may, at the risk of his life, manage to put in an appearance here by the middle of next week, and thus frustrate the political plot which has been hatched for the purpose of enabling certain gentlemen who do not represent the Democracy of Australia to proceed to England as our delegates to the forthcoming Imperial War Conference ? If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> is able to get here next week - and I am satisfied that he will get here at the risk of his life if he can - this plot will fail, because the numbers in this Senate will then be equal, and the proposal of the Government to prolong the life of this Parliament for the purpose of enabling <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes, Sir William</inline> Irvine, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest to represent Australia at that gathering will fall to the ground, as the question will then be resolved in the negative.

                            <para>- Many another honorable senator has been caught napping, and the presiding officer has conveniently forgotten to see him when he knew on which side of the Chamber he was going to record his vote. Last night when the division took place I was engaged in writing a telegram to the organization that was responsible for sending ex-Senator Ready here. I knew that its members would feel keenly the step that he had taken. I admit that I was not quite as sharp as men ought to be in these particular times. It will be a warning to every honorable senator not to incur any risks of that kind in the future, because we now see that the gloves are off. </para>

I wish to record my protest against the proposal that the Senate shall meet on Monday morning, because, palpably, it is submitted for only one purpose, namely, to hurry through this Chamber a motion which might fail to be carried if a certain senator from Tasmania were given the opportunity of getting here. If the division on this important proposal were deferred till towards the end of next week it is just possible that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> might be able to be present. But as a senator of sixteen years' standing I say that I have never refused to give a pair to any member of an Opposition party in case of illness, and I protest against the action of honorable senators opposite in declining to provide a pair for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy.</inline> They know perfectly well that it will not be very long before he will be able to be present. </para>

                            <para>- But the Vice-President of the Executive Council desires to rush this proposal through before he can get here, fearing that otherwise it will not be carried. We know very well that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> has recently undergone a couple of operations, that, though he has been at death's door, he is now recovering, and has every chance of being here within a week or so. Yet the party opposite refuse to give him a pair. If they will grant him a pair I shall be very pleased, because we shall then get the full voting strength of the Senate recorded on this question, as it would have been recorded a few weeks ago, and as it would be recorded a few weeks hence. If our friends opposite refuse to extend to a senator who is absent through illness the ordinary courtesies of political life, I can only come to the conclusion that they are prepared to adopt any course to carry their proposal. </para>

The Vice-President of the Executive Council has pointed out that the. business with which he desires us to deal is particularly urgent, owing to the fact that our delegates to the Imperial War Conference must leave our shores almost immediately. </para>

                        immediately replied that there was something else said besides those words. I then asked the honorable senator whether, if those words were the only words uttered, the Government would remit the fine. I was asked to give notice of the question, and did so. The reply given to the question on notice shows that a member of one of the State Parliaments of Australia was fined £10, with £5 5s. costs, and that the Crown Solicitor of the Commonwealth had advised that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coombe</inline>
                        should be taken before a Court for using the words I have just quoted. In' answering my question,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                        quoted the advice given by the Crown Solicitor in the following terms: -

                            <para>- I am prepared to say it outside, and I invite the Government to catch me. Have we reached such a stage in the public life of this country that a public man can be fined £10 for criticising a procedure that was most distasteful to many people in the community] I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> whether he thinks we would have had any chance of putting the War Precautions Act on the statute-book if, when we were dealing with it here, we had told the people that a public  speaker  criticising a political arrangement might be dragged before a magistrate and fined. I venture to say that there is no member of the Senate who would knowingly have been prepared to give powers of that kind to the Government. I go further, and say that when the War Precautions Act was passed, promises were made that it was to protect the people of Australia, and not to tyrannize over them. </para>

                                may desire to cloud the issue in that way, but it is my contention that there is nothing in the words that were used to cause disaffection amongst the people.

In answering my question, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made it plain that the Government did not propose to intervene when the matter was brought under their notice. I say that the War Precautions Act has been used for a purpose for which it was never intended. As one who is as much responsible for the passing of the Act as is any member of the Senate, I say that I would never have supported it if I had thought for a moment that a public man, discussing a public question, and in a very moderate way, might be brought before a magistrate and fined. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> told me that some words other than those which I have quoted were said, but there was no evidence to back up the other charge. </para>
