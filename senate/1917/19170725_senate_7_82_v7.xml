                        <para>With reference to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> on Friday last, that the Censor had forbidden the <inline font-style="italic">Tribune</inline> to publish certain correspondence between the Department of Defence and the Catholic Federation relative to the question of the censorship of matter published by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Critchley</inline> Parker, I hare inquired into the matter, and find that the rule is that official correspondence cannot be published without the. consent of the Department. The <inline font-style="italic">Tribune</inline> did not ask for such consent, but announced its intention to publish, and in the proof submitted, it proposed only to publish the letters of the Catholic Federation to me, and to omit the Department's reply of the 27th March, 1917- Permission has now been given for the publication of this correspondence, provided it is all published, including the Department's letter of 27th March, 1917. </para>

                    <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators are aware of the existence . of the Act which deals, with the organization known . as the Industrial Workers of the World, and' similar organizations which may be in existence. Associated with the name of that body there has been quite a series of crimes which have arrested public attention and called for general public condemnation. It was consequent upon those crimes- that the Bill of 1916 was introduced and. approved by Parliament; but, in spite of that legislative action, there are increasing signs of activity on the part of this organization, and experience has demonstrated that the powers granted by the original Act are insufficient to enable the authorities to cope effectively with this growing menace. That body still issues its pernicious literature, is still finding funds - from what source is not definitely known - and still, in many ways, is defying authority. It is quite clear, from its actions, that it is issuing a challenge to the public life, . as well as the private security, of the country. Australia has, probably more than any other country, adopted the soundly democratic principle that it will be governed in a constitutional way, and that the laws made by the majority of its citizens shall stand and be respected. This. organization practically declares that it will obey no law that does not suit it, and, indeed, will obey no law of any kind. In ' other words, it stands for anarchy, and thereby becomes a distinct menace to the public life of this country and to the private security of individual citizens. It advocates the destruction of property, and, so far from stopping at the mere advocacy, it has committed crimes in the State which I represent ranging from arson to murder. There can be no doubt that it was members of that organization, or men led away . by its teachings, who were responsible for the crime at Tottenham. The Bill introduces no new principle, but is designed to stop the gaps which experience has shown to exist in the parent measure. That measure dealt with the organization itself. This Bill proposes rather to deal with the individuals who are members, or who may remain members after it becomes law. It is not necessary for me to do more than briefly point out the alteration which the Bill introduces. It proposes that, not only shall the existence of any such organization be an offence, but that the Governor-General shall have power to declare any association which adopts the practices hitherto confined, so far as we know, to the Industrial Workers of the World', an unlawful association for the purposes of the measure. It is not merely the Industrial Workers of the World that will be aimed at, because that body might possibly avoid the provisions of the Bill by merely changing its name, or dissolving as an Industrial- Workers of the World organization and reforming as another. Power is, therefore, taken, merely by gazettal, to declare an association to be unlawful within the meaning of the provisions above referred to. There is a further proposal to make it an offence for a person to become a member of such an association, or for any one who is a member at the commencement of the Act to remain so for more than one month after it becomes law. There is another alteration in the matter of deportation. The power of deportation was exercisable under the parent Act only with regard to persons who were not natural-born British subjects. It is proposed to go a step further, and attach the penalty to anybody not being an Australian-born citizen; and with regard to the Australian-born the onus of proof will rest upon the accused person. It is also made a punishable offence to contribute or solicit contributions for the associations dealt with in the Bill, or to print or publish, or sell, any literature in the interests of such an association. There is a prohibition against -transmitting through the post any newspapers devoted to the interests of this body, and another clause preventing the employment or the continued employment of members of unlawful associations in the Public Service. I do not think anything more than the mere announcement of that provision is necessary to insure the whole-hearted support of members of this Chamber. The Bill also provides for the seizure of property, and entry into premises of an unlawful association for the purpose of seizing documents, and so on. If a discussion is desired on the various features of the Bill, the Committee is obviously the place in which we can more closely get to grips with them. </para>

                        <para>- Those words hardly seem to me to meet completely what I have in view. I am tempted to raise some form of opposition to this measure, because today the Senate appears to be like an afternoon tea party from the way in which it has received a measure which is supposed to be highly contentious. Instructions have been issued to a big political party that is supposed to be represented here. Sealed orders have been issued in connexion with this proposal, and as our honorable friends have not risen to the occasion, I have been compelled to take upon myself the <inline font-style="italic">rôle</inline> of finding fault with the measure. There was a time when instructions issued, referring to measures going through this Chamber, were obeyed to the letter. I do not know what can be coming over certain people nowadays. Instructions are issued and entirely ignored. I object to that kind of thing. I find that the proposed new section 7d apparently meets the object that I had in view. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> appears to be anxious that some honorable senator on this side should oppose this measure. I am not going to do that. It is too late, because all the powers which will be conferred by the passing of this Bill are already in the possession of the Government. This measure is only a make believe. Only last week, in Sydney, the War Precautions) Act was enforced to carry out exactly what this clause is intended to give the Government power to do. I think that the Bill has been introduced merely in order to induce some one on this side to defend the Industrial Workers of the World. I am not going to do that. I am opposed to that association on principle, and have been all the time. I cannot explain why at this stage, but I may do so later on, when the Standing Orders will permit. To show that this clause is unnecessary, I have only to remind honorable senators that in Sydney the police raided the rooms of these people one night' last week and carried out all the powers conferred under this clause by virtue of a proclamation issued under the War Precautions Act in the following terms : - </para>

In the circumstances, I do not know why the honorable senator should now seek to throw muck on honorable senators on this side because they will not oppose this Bill. The powers proposed to be given to the Government under this Bill have already been given to them under the War Precautions Act, and I therefore see no necessity for this measure at all. </para>

                        has informed the Committee that it is too late to pass this measure now. That statement obviously refers to time, and Ipresumethat the honorable senator believes that it is too late, since the 5th May. Dealing with his objection that we have these powers under the War Precautions Act. I would remind
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline>
                        of two things. First of all, the War Precautions Act will cease to operate a few months after the termination of the war, and it is necessary for the Government to have these powers in time of peace as well as in time of war. Further, the powers given under the War Precautions Act are operative only so far as they apply to military and defence operations, but the members of the Industrial Workers of . the World have not limited their offences to that. They have committed offences against individuals and against property.

There is another view that we take of the matter. Whilst it is true that the War Precautions Act confers upon the Government the widest powers, yet the Government do not believe that they ought to use those powers to supplant legislation. Where it is possible to secure legislative authority for a particular course of action legislative authority ought to be secured. The War Precautions Act is not to be taken as a blank cheque by the Government to supersede the activities of Parliament. It is an emergency measure, to be used on an emergency, and for emergency purposes. I make no apology for presenting this Bill to the Chamber, believing that honorable senators will recognise we are pursuing a proper and constitutional course. </para>

But so far he has not told us whether proposed new section 7d will apply to casual labour employed by the Commonwealth, or to labour employed by any contractor to the Commonwealth. At the present time we are letting some of our public works to contractors who may perhaps employ persons belonging to unlawful associations. I am anxious to know what power the Government can exercise in that event. In reply to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> I merely wish to say that I did not throw " muck " at honorable senators on the other side, as suggested by him. All I desired to know was why the instructions which have been issued by his party - by his bosses in New South Wales - have not been obeyed. Those instructions have been flouted. </para>

It speaks of "temporary and permanent em ployment," and temporary employment is casual employment. I have not any doubt of that. As to whether it will cover the cases of persons employed by Commonwealth contractors I entertain some doubt. At the same time I would remind the honorable senator that it would be extremely difficult for the Commonwealth to undertake the supervision of the lists of workmen employed by every contractor. Certain stipulations are already made in our contracts, as, for instance, that preference should be granted to unionists. Am I to suppose from his suggestion that unionists are members of the Industrial Workers of the World? </para>

                        <para>- It would be extremely difficult to provide by law that the Commonwealth should prohibit the employment of any of these men by a contractor. I will direct the attention of my colleagues who have to deal with contracts to the point raised by the honorable senator with a view to ascertaining whether it is feasible to adopt in contracts some provision of the kind indicated. Personally I do not think that any contractor would knowingly employ any members of the Industrial Workers of the World.  His  own sense of self-preservation would forbid him doing so.. </para>

                        <para>- It might be repetition; but I think it would be wise to continue the use of the word " unlawful " before the word " association." It will be noticed that in every other proposed new section the word " unlawful " occurs before the word " association." If this provision were allowed to go through as it is it might defeat sub-clause c of clause 2, wherein certain organizations and associations are exempted from the operation of the Bill. Unless an amendment of this kind be made, any association might be roped in whether it was unlawful or otherwise. It would certainly make the provision more definite. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to say a few words in reply to some remarks made at the previous stage. I stated then that I was opposed to the Industrial Workers of the World when those who are behind this Bill to-day were associated with that body. I am opposed to the Industrial Workers of the World because of their one-big-union principle. I am a craft unionist pure and simple, and that, I take it, is the only unionism which does any good for the working' classes in the community. One big union I would always oppose. These men believe in the dilution of labour, and making all men equal, but I do not. I believe that when a man has served an apprenticeship to a trade he has a right to be protected by the laws of his  country. The Government of the Commonwealth have given this big union an advertisement. Whereas a short time ago it was only a very small body - just a few men meeting together - it numbers now some 10,000 or 20,000 in the city of Sydney. This Bill, I take it, is not going to interfere with the men at all, but they will go on merrily as they have done, under the one-big-union scheme - the O.B.U. It is" not only the Industrial Workers of the World who are trying to follow the one-big-union scheme. We have the farmers, the agriculturists, and the squatters moving for one big union, a united employers' union, to fight the arbitration laws of this country. That is what the Industrial Workers of the World believe. They believe in the method of the strike which craft unionism put out of sight many years ago. I wished to make it clear that I was nob here to oppose this Bill. The men who are framing this measure for the purpose of extinguishing the Industrial Workers of the World were sitting' with them cheek by jowl in their union not very long ago when I was opposed to them. </para>

                    <para>- Order! The honorable senator is not entitled to bring up a Committee matter in that way. Of course, I do not know what took place in Committee; but if any honorable senator made a speech of that kind there, undoubtedly and obviously it was the right, place to reply to the speech. On the motion for the third reading the only thing which is permissible to an honorable senator is to advance reasons as to why the Bill should or should not be read a third time. I cannot allow the honorable senator to bring up any matters which transpired in Committee, or reply to speeches which were made there. </para>

Obviously if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> made any such statement in Committee, that was the time to speak, and ample opportunity was afforded to any honorable senator to reply to the speech then. It is not conducive to the orderly despatch of business that any matters of dispute or quarrel between honorable senators in Committee should be brought up in the Senate on the third reading of the Bill. They should always be dealt with at the time. </para>

                        <para>- Again I am likely to come into conflict with the Chair. Regarding the powers contained in the Bill, and referring to the remarks made by the Leader of the Senate, I venture to say that everything which it gives power to the Government to do could have been done under the provisions of the War Precautions Act. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has intimated, a raid under that Act took place in Sydney the other day in connexion with the Industrial Workers of the World. Personally, I should' like to see that organization wiped completely off the face of the earth; and whether I remain a member of the Senate, or go back to civil life, any action I can take to prevent the growth of such a body in Australia will be cheerfully taken. I considered this Bill unnecessary, because the original Act, amplified by the War Precautions Act, provided all the powers. No new principle has been introduced. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> himself said that the Bill introduced no new principle, and that the War Precautions Act lasted only for the term of the war and a certain period afterwards. We could easily have waited for the expiration of the war. and for . the few months thereafter during which the War Precautions Act operates, before which time the necessity for legislation of this kind cannot arise. Parliament is always assembled, or can be called together. However, in order to take time by the forelock, the party on this side in this and the other branch of the Legislature has assisted the Government in order to cope with any dangerous organization that may be abroad. Even if there were no War Precautions Act, and no "Unlawful Associations Act on the statute-book of the Commonwealth, there are in existence State laws which, if the States like to use them, can deal with any organization classed as unlawful under this Bill. There is any amount of legislation on the statute-book of every State Parliament to cope with any man, or body of men, who conspire to blow up property, burn it, or damage it in any other way. provided that the State Governments themselves will take action. </para>

                    <para>. - I heartily support the remarks of the honorable senator who has just sat down. I welcome the Bill, and, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> am pleased that an opportunity has arisen . to deal in a more thorough fashion with a problem which is of more than passing importance. I most firmly hold the opinion that there is a sad necessity for the Bill. We live in the freest Democracy that ever existed, a Democracy the equal of which has not been recorded in ancient or modern times, a Democracy that allows the meanest unit that composes it to utter any opinion that he holds for the good of that Democracy without let or hindrance; and when this agency arose, with all the sinister signs of an evil agency, the fact that it did not receive condemnation was a sad feature of our industrial development. I can recall when a member of that organization in Queensland obtained a majority when standing against one of the staunchest exponents and truest friends that Labour unionism ever had. At the time I referred to, an Industrial Workers of the World man stood against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> G.. Spence for the presidency of the Australian Workers Union in Queensland and the northern portion of New South' Wales, and actually beat him. Trade unionists flocked to the standard of the Industrial Workers of the World on that occasion, and put the Industrial Workers of the World champion at the head of the poll. The records of the Australian Workers Union show that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>

                <para>Naughton, a self -avowed and self acknowledged mouth-piece and champion of the Industrial Workers of the World, obtained a majority amongst the Queensland and northern New South Wales members of that body. </para>
                <para>When such a false sentiment is abroad that champions, mouth-pieces, and adherents of this evil organization get such strong support, it is about time the common sense of the community asserted itself. We have been all too slow in asserting ourselves. </para>
                <para>I have a certain amount of sympathy for the Industrial Workers of the World in this way, that those who were covertly associated with it in the past, and who never condemned it, are now tumbling over one another to leave it high and dry. I am not, and have never been, friendly towards it, because I have too bitter a recollection of what it sought to do with me and mine. Its leading mouth-piece threatened to burn down our farm in the West. If he had only come along and paid the debts on the farm, it could have started the blaze next day. However, that plot was bowled out in time. I am entitled to find fault with the fact that those nien .who have given their covert sympathy to the organization in the past are now only too ready to leave the organization to defend itself. I have been against it from the start; but those false friends of the Industrial Workers of the World, when they saw public sympathy veering against it, did not come out into the open in their true colours and' publicly confess that they had been wrong in the past. They could see that an overwhelming public opinion was repudiating and banning the organization; and so, after being, if not hand-in - glove -with it, at least moral supporters of it, they are leaving it to fish for itself. </para>

                        <para>- Against it from the start! It is about time we had a clean up, and about time we had some plain speaking. The object of my few previous remarks on the Bill was strictly utilitarian. My motive was to harmonize the difference between those who were giving instructions and those who ought to obey. We are living in a war-like age, and when instructions are given I do not see 'why they should not be obeyed. They were obeyed in the past by certain honorable members of this Parliament. Instructions of a very stern character were issued from Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland on the question of the referendum, one of the leading planks in our platform, and those instructions were obeyed to the last letter. </para>

                        <para>- It is the noble exceptions that prove the golden rule. That incident showed where true manhood lay, where independence of character lay, and where something more than the mere craven hypocritical samples that we see abroad to-day in public life were to be found. Instructions were actually issued on that occasion not to vote for one of the leading planks and principles of the Labour platform. Those instructions were not to dare to vote for the Conscription Referendum Bill under pain of expulsion. Instructions have just been issued once more, and my anxiety and curiosity is to know why, seeing that the former instructions about the referendum were obeyed absolutely and subserviently by certain members, these later instructions are not being obeyed now. There must be something rotten in the State of Denmark. Here is a high authority in Sydney issuing in- 'structions about this Bill, and yet they are flouted! I object to that altogether. The War Precautions Act ought to be put into operation to make these people obey. I find, on reading this morning's paper, that it was decided - </para>

                        <para>- I am much concerned about this outside influence that is sought to be exercised over members of Parliament. That influence has been at work all too successfully in the past. Instructions were issued, and members came to heel. Poor old dog Tray was only a circumstance compared with so-called independent members of Parliament when instructions were issued regarding measures passing through this Chamber. I rose on this occasion with the object of reconciling the differences between those! who issue instructions and those who refuse to obey them, I do not like to see any men get into trouble, or the harmony of the home disturbed in the least, and I do nob wish to see the mouthpieces in this chamber of those who give instructions rushing madly to their doom by not obeying those demands. It was for the purpose of saving them from this fate - from the wrath to come - that I referred to the matter at all. It is almost beyond my comprehension that they should now flagrantly ignore these instructions, which were to the effect that they should leave no- stone unturned to oppose the passage of this Bill - this, a measure which glided through the Senate with the utmost celerity . Surely there is something wrong. </para>

                <para>This Bill touches the very vitals of our. industrial and social life, and unless it had been passed I do nob know what would have happened to this country, for we had reached the stage when men who pretended to rely on constitutional means for the redress of their grievances were trying to overturn our normal state of society. From the constitutional aspect alone, the position so lately created was sufficient to warrant the introduction and the passage of a measure even more drastic than this. But there is a difference of opinion. Honorable gentlemen on this side of the chamber believe that every word and line of the Bill were justified, while the power outside - represented by the honorable gentlemen on the other side of the chamber - is of the opinion that it is not required, and this power issued instructions that the Bill must and should be opposed. Honorable senators opposite, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> included, were required to both speak and vote against the Bill, but to-day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> is shirking his duty. </para>

At the same time, I took occasion to refer to the commands thai were issued to an important section of members of the party, opposite. They were, told to- oppose the Bill, and to leave no stone unturned - to use the official words - to prevent its passage through this Parliament, and I want to know now why they do not oppose it. I want to know why they are shirking their duty. If they fail to do their duty direct action will be taken in their case. I can only say that as they have not obeyed those instructions I am unable to suggest what will be form of wrath which will overtake them in the future, but probably they will be obliged to face their masters, and perhaps lose their heads. It is, however, pleasing to know that at last there is some evidence of manliness on their part, since, on their own showing, they intend to ignore instructions issued to them by their bosses in Sydney. </para>

We have just received copies of these amendments, and it. is not possible to ascertain how they affect the measure itself. As this is one of the most important matters that we have been called upon to deal with in this Parliament for many years, I hope further time will be given to consider the effect of the amendments. </para>

                    <para>. - I recognise the force of the suggestion made by the honorable senator. I certainly had no idea of pressing on with a Bill of this character, containing, as it does, entirely novel provisions, until honorable senators were fairly in a position to discuss the proposals. At the same time, I have a very strong desire to get on with the Bill, and to have it placed on the statute-book, in some form or other, at the earliest possible moment. In expressing that opinion, I feel I am voicing the wish of every honorable senator, but whilst we are anxious to get on with the Bill, I recognise it is desirable, even at the expense of a few extra days, to make it as perfect as possible. If honorable senators feel that they would be in a better position to deal with it tomorrow, I am prepared to meet their wishes, bub I would like to ascertain their views. May I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> if he is speaking individually, or for honorable senators on his side of the chamber? </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to get some statement on behalf of the Minister dealing with the issue of passports concerning the way in which the regulations are applied to different people. I have a letter from a lady whose home is in London, and whose husband is fighting at the Front. She came out to the Commonwealth twelve months ago, with a passport from the British Government, in order to visit her sister in Australia.  Her  passport was taken from her, and she cannot now get it returned.  Her  house in London is let for twelve months, and she cannot be there to look after her affairs. I am not taking any exception to the regulation preventing travelling by women, because of the danger from submarines, which, I believe, is the reason given for the regulation. But I do say that if some ladies are permitted to visit the Old. Country for pleasure, and as a matter of fact that has occurred, a lady desiring to return to the Old Country on business should not be refused a passport for the purpose. The wife of the Premier of New South Wales and her sister have been permitted to leave the Commonwealth, and, according to the newspapers, they are now in England. </para>

I believe they received a passport only to visit Colombo, but the <inline font-style="italic">modus operandi</inline> followed was that they secured at Colombo, from the British authorities, permission to travel to Egypt, and subsequently from the French authorities permission to travel from Alexandria to Marseilles.- If the regulation is to be set aside to enable one or two ladies to visit England on pleasure, it is very unfair that the lady, whose case I am referring to, should not be permitted to use the British passport which was issued to her. It should be returned to her, and she should be given an opportunity to travel to her home in the Old  Country.  I have said that the husband of this lady is fighting at the Front.

I hope that the Prime Minister's Department, which deals with the issue of passports, will take this case into consideration.

                        <para>Dear Senator Grant,</para>
                        <para>For. some reason or other, not explained,  a  most vicious censorship has been instituted over my mails.  I  learn confidentially from friends in the Postal Department that orders have been issued  to  the censor  to  most carefully watch the mails  of  about fifteen persons in New South Wales, my own name being included in this list. This has been in force since the anti-conscription campaign, and seems to be growing worse than ever. </para>
                        <para>As you know, besides my work on the <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> I am representing in Australia several of the American Labour Socialist newspapers - including the Vancouver <inline font-style="italic">Federationist,</inline> New York <inline font-style="italic">Labor Call,</inline> Milwaukee <inline font-style="italic">Leader,</inline> and one or two smaller papers. I keep them fully informed of the political happenings here, which matter is reprinted largely in the English papers, and, consequently, show our political opponents up in bad form at Home. This seems to be resented on the part of the powers that be, with the consequence that <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> mails are searched and overhauled as if I were some person in the pay of the enemy. </para>
                        <para>I would find no objection with the censorship if everybody was treated the same way. But, alas, this is not so. As a case in point, there are other people here who get the same papers as I do from America. What appears strange to me is the fact that they can get their papers within a day or two after the arrival of the American mail, free of all censorship, while my copies of the same papers have to go before the censor, be opened, examined, cut about, and refused delivery if necessary, and I have to wait perhaps a full fortnight before the papers are delivered to me. I have at times made complaints to the censor here, but every reply I get is a denial of the facts that I, fortunately, can prove only too well. </para>
                        <para>Then there are several papers banned altogether from the mails, and while these are taken out of my mail and destroyed, it is somewhat annoying to find that others can get the same papers, without any evident interference on the part of the censor. </para>
                        <para>My news and letters from America deal with political matters only, and, while I do not deny the censor the right to examine to his own sweet will, I do not think it fair that I should be singled out for special treatment in this manner. I object, too, to the cunning manner in which it is done. Letters are steamed open and gummed down again, to make it appear that they have not been opened - instead of the regulation slip being gummed along them to show that they have been " opened by censor." </para>
                        <para>Another thing I object to is the fact that while my mails are being searched in this manner, other people in this city - business houses - can get through their uncensored mails information of the highest military value. For instance, business firms here in Sydney were allowed to receive the information that Marshal Joffre, speaking before the United States Congress while in America, said that, whereas the- Allies had reached' their maximum in strength, Germany was 1,000,000 men better off than when the war first began. Then, again, another statement allowed to pass into this country was that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> Hoover, late Food Commissioner for Belgium, to the effect that, unless the Allies could get 00,000,000 bushels of wheat,' in addition to millions of tons of pork, beans, and secondary foods, within the next four. months, they would lose the war. </para>

                        <para>These statements may be true, or they may not be; but the fact remains that they have been allowed to come into this country through business and financial letters uncensored, while the poor censor is looking most carefully through my mails to find out that nothing is said to me.

This surely seems the height of absurdity, and I think it is a matter that might well be ventilated. In Sydney the censor seems to take it for granted that the very fact of submitting matter to him is enough proof that it should not be allowed publication. Seemingly, he takes the line of least resistance. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not doubt that there are a' good many people in this community who would like to know what are the arrangements made regarding the censorship of newspapers and letters coming from outside Australia. I do not propose to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ahern</inline> or any one else to know what they are. I do not propose to say whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ahern's</inline> correspondence is or is not censored. If honorable senators will consider the matter for a moment they will easily recognise why this should be so. With respect to the newspapers, certain newspapers are prohibited from entering the Commonwealth. The same papers are prohibited from entering other parts of the Empire and India. We know that certain people in this community do attempt to smuggle these newspapers into the Commonwealth, and that at times they are successful. It is because they are successful that we do not propose to let <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ahern</inline> or any one else know what action is taken by the censors. </para>

                            <para>- We certainly should do so. There are substantial reasons why these newspapers should be prohibited from entering any part of the Empire. They are written in the interests of Germany and Austria. With regard to the differential treatment complained of to the effect that some statements, prohibited from publication in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> have been allowed publication in' journals in other States, I must say that that is a general statement, and it is possible therefore for me to give only a general reply. The instructions issued to the various censors in each of the States are the same. I would not contend for a moment that six people receiving the same instructions in six different cities will each read them in the same way. I am well aware that men's minds are nob all alike. It is therefore possible that the same matter submitted to the censors in the different States may have different interpretations placed upon it. We meet that difficulty so far as we can by providing that the instructions to the censors shall be the same. It is obvious that different censors may take a different view of the same instructions.. As I have said, the statement made in the letter quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> is a general one, and there is no particular instance given, so that I am unable to say whether it is correct. If a specific instance is given of an article submitted to the censor in Sydney, and refused publication in the <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> and the same article submitted to a censor in another State, and allowed publication in that State, I shall undertake to find out which censor overstrained the instructional or did not carry them out. In the absence of specific instances in support of the complaint? I can only say that the general instructions to the censors are the same. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Grant</inline> will supply me with specific instances, I shall have inquiries made into them. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has brought under notice a question bearing upon the issue of passports. The honorable senator will understand that I have no personal knowledge of what takes place in connexion with the issue of these documents. I shall see that the remarks he has made are brought under the notice of the Minister in whose Department the matter is dealt with. , I shall endeavour to place myself in a position , to give the honorable senator an answer to his inquiries before the week is out. There is a . matter to which I think attention ought to be directed, arising out of a portion of the letter which has just been read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant.</inline> It struck me as throwing a rather serious light upon what is going on in some of the public Departments of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> quoted from the letter he received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ahern</inline> to the effect, " I learn confidentially from friends in the Post Office that a most vicious censorship prevails." I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> should help the Government to find out what officers in the Post Office have been so false to their trust as officers of the Department as to make communications of . that kind to people outside. It is known that there are leakages of the meet confidential information from different public Departments. As SenatorGrant has given us this information, I think he should go further and ascertain from his correspondent from what officials private and. confidential information is conveyed to people outside. </para>
