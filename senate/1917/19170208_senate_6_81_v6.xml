                        <para>- I wish, sir, to draw attention to an alteration of the practice of the Senate in the presentation of messages from  His Excellency  the Governor-General as to assent to Bills. I do not know whether it was done by your instruction, but the usual procedure Baa been that such messages should be handed to you by the Minister leading the Senate. I ask whether the procedure to-day was an alteration of the practice, or whether it arose from Mr. Duffy, who is now filling the position of  Clerk,  following the procedure adopted in another place ? </para>

Personally, I do not think that there is much importance in the matter. The important point is that these messages should be received and read to the Senate. However, as it was only an inadvertence this time, the practice which has hitherto been carried on in the Senate will be maintained in the future. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to occupy the time of the Senate, but I do think distinctly that any message from the Governor-General to the Senate should came through somebody who is responsible to the Senate, responsible to the country, and responsible to the people. It has been the invariable practice that any communication from the Governor-General, as representing the Crown, should come to the Senate through a Minister responsible to the Senate and to the country. I certainly hope that the practice which has been adopted this afternoon, and which I myself noted with some regret, will not be construed into a precedent. </para>

                                <para>- Order! Honorable senators are entitled to say what their views on this matter are. I am entitled to say what my view is, and it is that the whole importance lies in the fact that the messages should be communicated to the Senate by  His  Excellency the Governor-General in some way. When they are sent to the  Clerk,  it is a very moot point to me whether it is the duty of the  Clerk  to hand them to the Leader of the Senate or to the  President  for presentation to the Senate, because it has been contended, and rightly so, that there should be somebody responsible for the thing. Will honorable senators say that the Presiding Officer of the Senate is not equally responsible as a Minister of the Crown - is not an equally fit channel through whom the messages should be presented to the Senate? The matter does not seem to me to be worth a debate, because the import: ant condition, and it is a condition which has been complied with, is that the messages should be presented to the Senate through a proper and official channel. </para>

                                <para>- If I mistake not, sir, our practice used to be, at any rate at the close of the session, for the Governor-General himself to signify his assent to Bills. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> withregard to Bills originating in the other House, and the  President  with regard to Bills originating in the&#39; Senate, is the proper person to present them to the Governor-General for the Royal assent, and, technically, the assent should be given there and then, and handed to the officer who presented the documents to  His Excellency.  But when a measure has been introduced into the other House and presented by the  Speaker,  I think that the practice invariably has been that the message should come to the Senate through a responsible Minister. </para>

                        <para>- In reply to the honorable senator, I have to say that the work concerned is, for the present, under the general control of the Minister for Home and Territories, and myself. That decision has been arrived at pending the report of a Commission that is now sitting and inquiring into certain works in the Federal Territory. With respect to the particular work concerning which the honorable senator has inquired, the position is that the construction of the railway is proposed, but for the present no work is being carried out on it, nor is it intended to continue it until the matter is further considered. In other words, with respect to the railway referred to, things are at a standstill. </para>

Can the Minister inform the Senate whether the  Chairman  of the Royal Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackett,</inline> K.C., is still getting &#163;17 17s. per day during the cross-examination of the witnesses by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster?</inline></para>

Of course, difficulties are sometimes experienced in discovering the correct addresses of soldiers, and the names of some 10 or 15 per cent. consequently get off the rolls in spite of the vigilance exercised by officers. In regard to the other questions put by the honorable senator, I must ask&#39; him to give notice of them. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that any official representations were made on this matter through the High Commissioner. They may have been. But I do know that individual members of this Parliament wrote to me making certain representations. No action was taken then, other than the publication of a general statement in the press to the effect that unnecessary sea travelling by women and children was undesirable. Recently, however, action was taken to prevent them passing through any danger area except for specially urgent purposes, and all passports which had been issued were withdrawn. No fresh passports will be granted unless specially urgent circumstances for their issue can be demonstrated. </para>

What I wanted to convey was that there seemed to be simultaneous action on the part of these public bodies in closing down public works. I do not know whether they were working in concert or not, but I notice that works controlled by the Harbor Trust, municipal councils, and State and Federal Governments were all closed down at the same time. </para>

                                <para>- This question has been exercising my mind very considerably of late. There is no doubt extraordinary delay, but I have made inquiries, and find that it does not take place here. A soldier, on going away, takes with him his pay-book. Sometimes deductions for fines, or for amounts drawn, have to be made, and the accounts are, kept oversea. We cannot pay the deferred pay here until we ascertain from the other side what amount is actually due to the man. There have been delays of months in sending those accounts to us from overseas. This is very aggravating, particularly to the relatives of the deceased man, and we have made very strong representations to the people overseas as to the irritation, and in some cases suffering, caused here. We have also insisted that an inquiry be held there to find out the cause, and have the matter rectified. I realize that what the honorable senator points out is a bad feature in connexion with the pay question, and anything I can do to rectify things will be done. </para>

There is, however, a limitation, and, as the result  af  legislation passed by this Parliament, the Minister is empowered to take certain action upon good cause being shown that a soldier has made no provision for relatives who may be dependent upon him. In such circumstances, the Minister may allot portion of the pay to dependants without the consent of the soldier, but representation should be made to the Minister so that he may judge as to whether action is warranted. </para>

                    <para>- In putting this motion to the Senate, I desire to make an announcement. At the close of the last meeting of the Senate I had occasion to refer regretfully to the fact that arrangements were being made with regard to the retirement, owing to failing health, of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell,</inline> who had been so long and so honorably connected with the Senate in his official capacity as  Clerk  of this Chamber. Honorable senators will remember that towards the close of the sitting most of the senators had to leave to catch their trains, and, therefore, they did not have an opportunity to express their feelings. I only bring the matter forward again in order to announce to the Senate the action taken consequent on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell&#39;s</inline> retirement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline> had a long and honorable career in the Public Service. He. was in the Public Service for a period of forty-three years. Some years ago he was laid up with a very severe illness - so severe that most senators were labouring under the apprehension that he would be unable to resume his post. Fortunately an extended rest enabled <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline> to come back and fulfil his duties very creditably for a considerable time longer. Quite recently he had a recrudescence of that old complaint, which absolutely necessitated a complete rest; and, &#39;as he had reached the retiring age, he decided to retire. I was reluctantly compelled to make the necessary arrangements to enable him to retire, and on my recommendation the Governor-General granted him six months&#39; leave of absence on full pay. Following his retirement there were several applications for the position of  Clerk,  and, after full and mature consideration, I recommended that the position should be given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> Gavan Duffy, C.M.G., who, honorable senators are aware, has had a long and honorable career as  Clerk  in another place. He was the senior officer of Parliament, and undoubtedly he possessed the necessary experience and qualifications. I believe that, much as honorable senators will miss <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell,</inline> his retirement will be fully made up for by the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy.</inline> I hope that the arrangement I have made will meet with the concurrence of honorable senators. While all honorable senators will regret parting with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell,</inline> who, I think, had the friendship, goodwill, and esteem of every member of the Chamber, I hope that the new appointment will meet with their approval, and that the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy</inline> will give them the same satisfaction as they derived from the services of Mir. Boydell. I have nothing to add beyond expressing the hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell&#39;s</inline> retirement will enable him to recover his health to a considerable extent, and that he will live for many years to enjoy the pension which he has so justly earned, and is entitled to. </para>

I think I shall meet the wishes of the Senate if I intimate that, though like other honorable senators I was then pushed for time, and therefore was not in a position to place on record, as I think the Senate would like to do, its sense of the services which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline> has rendered, that I shall take the earliest opportunity of inviting the Senate to give, by means of a definite motion, an expression of its opinion regarding the services of this retiring officer. And, -with regard to the new occupant of the office, I feel certain that every member of the. Senate, who has had an ample opportunity of watching, even from a distance, the very fine service which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy</inline> rendered elsewhere, will feel every confidence that he brings to the performance of his new duties a full capacity and a ripe experience. We can with every confidence, therefore, assume that we shall receive from, him assistance  on those very many occasions on which honorable senators are bound to look for guidance and advice to the officers of the Senate. </para>

Beyond that I -did not go, and when I had finished two honorable senators rose simultaneously. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> for the time being at any rate, is the Leader of the Opposition in this Chamber, and since the inception of this Parliament he has been so recognised. Apart from every other consideration,, the practice of the Senate is to give the Leader of the Senate priority when he rises, and next to him to  give priority to the Leader of the Opposition. .Therefore, in calling on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> I followed the practice, I may add that it is the privilege of the presiding officer for the time being to say which honorable senator he thinks lias a prior right to speak, and&#39; the exercise of his privilege in that respect should not be questioned or cavilled at by any honorable senator! While I remain in the chair that will be my position, and if any honorable senators are dissatisfied they, have an easy remedy. I will not allow any honorable senator to criticise my fairness in this- matter, or to say or insinuate that I intended to put a slight on any honorable senator, because I never intended to do so, and I have not done so. What I have done has been to follow the practice and to call on the Leader of the Opposition, and if any honorable senators are dissatisfied with that course of action on my part a remedy lies in their own hands. </para>

                        <para>- I am asking for. no privileges here, I am simply asking for my rights, not as the leader of a party, but as a member of the Senate. On those rights I will always, insist, and if you, sir, or any one  else should trespass upon them, I will, without fear or hesitation, complain. Speaking now to the adjournment, I am surprised that the Leader of the Government here has not made a statement to the Senate. One of the functions of Parliament, I take it, is to keep the public informed of what the Government are doing. I venture to say that since the adjournment, which commenced at Christmas time, the most momentous questions have been discussed by the Government. Attempts at the formation of fusions or coalitions to conduct the business of this country have been made. The Government have called the Houses together, and evidently intend to adjourn the Senate without imparting any information. I hope that the Leader of the Government here will not allow the Senate to adjourn without letting honorable senators and the public know one word of the secret negotiations, or the actual negotiations, which have taken place. Surely the Senate and the country are entitled to know whether what appeared in the press this morning has any foundation. I venture to say, although honorable senators supporting the Government may smile, that there was never a time in thai history of this country when the public were more entitled to be taken into the confidence of the Government than they are to-day. Never before was there an occasion when it was more essential in the interests of the good government of this country for Ministers to come down at the first opportunity and let the public know, not a part, but the whole truth, of what has happened during the last six weeks. It appears to me that a representative of a newspaper can get more information as to what is going on than can a representative of the people. </para>

                        <para>- The lying report in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of this morning is the most incorrect report I have read. It is because the reports in the press cannot bo relied upon; it is because for the past month certain negotiations have been going on between the Government and the Liberal party, with the view to forming a new Ministry, that I venture to say this Parliament and this country are entitled to. know what has taken place. I thank the Prime Minister for bringing into use the phrase &#34; secret junta.&#34; Here sit a secret junta, whose members have worn a path between their offices and those of the Leader of the Opposition. The messengers passing to and fro have actually worn a beaten track. Yet the Government meet the Senate to-day, and say not one word about these serious negotiations, which should be the property of the people of this country. </para>

                        <para>- I am not speaking of your party meetings, and do not want to know of your party negotiations, but I contend that as regards the formation of a new Government, step by step, as this Parliament meets, it should be informed. This  is  no &#34; secret junta.&#34; If all these reports of advances by one party, of refusals by another party, of coalitions almost formed, and then disappearing, are unfounded, let the people know the exact position of affairs. This is not a country run in the interests of any party. &#34;We have heard lately a great deal about a &#34; Win-the-War party.&#39; A party should put national government before party interests. So far as our party is concerned, there have been no secret negotiations with the Government. Our. answers to their questions have been definite&#39; and clear, and the public are aware of our position. I hope that, in his reply, the Minister will put the Senate and the country in possession of the information which he possesses. </para>

There have been statements to the effect that the Prime Minister has been invited to an Imperial Conference in Great Britain.

                        <para>- As regards an invitation to the Prime Minister to visit England as a representative of Australia, is not that statement of sufficient importance for the Australian Parliament to know whether it is true or not. Are we always to depend on newspaper reports? I am not speaking now in the interests of party, but in the interests of this Parliament, which, I contend, is entitled to know all the business that can be fairly placed before it. Has an invitation been given to the Prime Minister to visit England, and, if so, by whom? Will the Minister lay a copy of the invitation on the table? </para>

                        <para>- The absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts</inline> is due to the condition of his health, and no gentleman would refer in an insinuating way to the absence of a member of Parliament who has found it necessary to make a trip abroad because of a break-down due to hard work done in the interests of the country. During the time Parliament has not been sitting, some of the most important events in our history have occurred. I do not think we should permit this sitting to close without some information being furnished as to those events. I left any reference to the matter until the Leader of the Government moved the adjournment of the Senate, because &#163; was in hopes that he would follow the usual practice and inform this Chamber as to the position of the Government and their intentions. It is now evident that the honorable senator does not propose to do so, and I enter my protest against a, Government such as the present continuing in office without disclosing its intentions to Parliament and the country. It must be remembered that the Government have not a quorum in either House of this Parliament. They have not a majority in the House or in the country. We have never had such a Government in this country before. I am speaking, not of the individual members of the Government, but of the position which they occupy from a constitutional point of view. I repeat that we have never had such a Government before, and I hope that we shall never again have such a Government in Australia. They represent a party which is not sufficiently strong in either House of this Parliament to form a Government. </para>

                        <para>- We took advantage of an opportunity afforded in another place to try to turn them out. One element of seriousness in connexion with the negotiations which have recently been going on is that the bait of office has been dangled before members of the Liberal party. It is not right that the government of this country should be carried on. by a Ministry depending for support upon members of Parliament whose assistance can only be secured by the prospect of portfolios. We took steps in another place to turn &#39; the Government out, and they were saved only by the votes of the Liberal party. I appeal to the Leader of the Senate, in the interests of the proper conduct of business, to realize that, apart altogether from party views, this Parliament is entitled to know the intentions of the Government and how the business of the country is to be conducted. We should be able to secure the information from the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and I feel sure that I have the support of the Senate and of the country in demanding it. </para>

                    (Tasmania) I am not in the habit of delaying the decision upon the motion for the adjournment of the Senate, but I crave the attention of honorable senators to bring under their notice a matter of wide-reaching importance. I hope that I am not in the habit at any time of making statements about serious errors of administration unless I am fairly sure of my facts. In this case I am, humanly speaking, certain of my facts. I am certain that they disclose a condition of things which honorable senators, irrespective of party, will, without exception, condemn. A most important phase of the matter to which I desire to direct attention is that it is likely to seriously check the recruiting movement which members of all parties in the Senate hope will be productive of good results. The errors or acts of mismanagement to which I intend to refer are indicative of a grave condition of things in connexion with our war administration. I am not attacking the Australian Defence Department, or the Australian Postal Department, because I am not sure for the moment at whose door these improper acts should properly be laid.  It  may be that they are due to the fault or neglect of a branch of the Imperial War Administration, but I none the less reprobate the condition of things  to  which I am about to direct attention. The matter which I shall place before honorable senators indicates utter incompetence,  or  utter wilful and wicked neglect in connexion with the sending and delivering of soldiers&#39; letters and letters from their relatives to them. We all know how the relatives of  our  soldiers, and particularly their female relatives, wait with longing for the receipt of communications from them. Many a woman in Australia  is  waiting for a letter which may perhaps express the last wish of some loved one to whom her soul belongs. I received the following communication from Scottsdale,  in  the north-eastern division of Tasmania. It is from a gentleman who is a member of the magistracy, and is widely known and respected in north-eastern Tasmania.

                        <para>- I do not think there has been any allegation that the British Army has been compelled to indulge in any <inline font-style="italic">sauve qui peut</inline> kind of action. It would appear that these neglected heaps of letters were some distance  from the firing line, and not at the immediate front. The disclosure of such a -condition of things is calculated to have a depressing effect upon the recruiting movement. I venture to say that if this sort of thing took place under the supervision of the German Military postal officials, some one would be summarily punished, and perhaps mercilessly shot. </para>

                            <para>- We have often seen in the press quotations from the letters of Germans found in dugouts. We know that Australian soldiers, for news of -whom Australian relatives are waiting, write letters to those relatives. It would appear from this correspondence that they are absolutely unheeded. I cannot believe that they were thrown away for the reason suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> that some military operation by the Germans necessitated the abandonment of certain positions. That does not appear to me to be a satisfactory explanation of the matter. Without condemning the Defence administration or the Military Postal administration of the Commonwealth for negligence, and without charging the Imperial administration at the front with neglect in this matter, I ask the Minister for Defence to go into it seriously, and if he finds evidence of neglect on the part of Australian officials, civil or military, I trust he will -visit that neglect with summary and condign punishment. There is one other matter which I should like briefly to refer to. In the closing hours of the sittings of this Parliament, which took place before Christmas, the Prime Minister, in another place, said that the results -of the recent referendum in connexion with the votes of the soldiers at the front disclosed a substantial affirmative majority. With many others I had all along hoped that that would be the case. But before that statement was made it was alleged that the result&#39; of the voting at the front was the other way about. I want to have the facts. I ask the Minister for Defence to request the Prime Minister, if necessary, to urge upon the Imperial Government, in his turn, the advisability of relaxing their prohibition against the publication of the actual results of the voting at the front. I really believe that the situation is that, while the affirmative majority was not as great as those who like myself advocated conscription hoped that it would be, it showed that a fairly substantial majority of the soldiers at the front desired that conscription should be brought into force in Australia. The very word referendum involves the &#39;most meticulous publicity, so that the whole people may know the results of the appeal to them without any &#34; hugger mugger.&#34; I do not blame Ministers - I do not blame the Prim&#169; &#39; Minister. But the Imperial authorities are not always perspicacious, and I venture to say that no good purpose is being served 1 by withholding the details of the result&#174; of the referendum, so far as the soldiers&#39; vote is concerned. </para>

                            <para>- That is not the proper way  to  treat the results of an important referendum. I know that very early it was stated that there was an Imperial prohibition against the publication of the results of the soldiers&#39; vote. But the Prime Minister has since been able to ascertain that amongst our oversea Forces there was a substantial majority in favour of conscription. By all means let us have the details of the soldiers&#39; vote, and if the Imperial Government still entertains an objection to these details being published, I venture to say that it is not a very sound objection, and that ari application on the part of the Prime Minister will remove it, and thus enable us to see the referendum results in the ordinary sensible light of political day. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;4.22&#93;.- I desire to say a few words in reference to the late  Clerk  of. the Senate. It was my privilege to be closely associated with him during the time that I occupied the position of  President  of this Chamber, and I wish to place on record my sense of the great assistance which
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline>
                        rendered to me in the discharge of my duties, as well as to all honorable senators in the discharge of their duties. With you, sir, I deplore that, in consequence of ill-health, he has been obliged to retire from the position which he has occupied for so many years, and I hope he will long be spared to enjoy the pension which he has so worthily earned. When a motion is submitted by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                        - as I understand it will next week - dealing with this matter, it will afford me great pleasure to support it. I now wish to extend a hearty welcome to the gentleman who has succeeded him. He is not altogether a stranger in this chamber. He was here in the early days of the Commonwealth, and then quitted it for another place. I am satisfied that he is possessed of very great ability, and that he will render valuable service, not only to the occupant of the chair, but to all other members of this Chamber. In regard to the matter alluded to by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline>
                        we all realize the difficulty of approaching the Imperial authorities upon Imperial matters. I believe, however, it is desirable that we should have a record of the way in which the soldiers voted at the recent referendum. We have a right to know the way in which their vote was cast. Whether there was a majority in favour of conscription, or whether there was a majority against it, is quite beside the question. The real question is whether the voting of any portion of the community should be suppressed. I say that it should not be.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>
                        spoke so strongly of the sins of omission and commission on the part of the present Government that one might really imagine that he was in earnest.

If, in, this chamber, we were to traverse the opinions expressed in the Labour Caucus, or in the meetings of the Ministerial or Liberal parties, I do not think that we would have much time for other work.

                            Long, Secretary of State for the Colonies, was reported in the British Hansard to have declared in the House of Commons that the Imperial Government had no objection whatever to the details being published of the soldiers&#39; vote on the 28th October last. But prior to that statement being made, our own Prime Minister had affirmed that he could not make that vote public because the Commonwealth authorities were under instructions from the Imperial  Government not to divulge the information, lest it might be of some use to (the enemy.

                        <para>-. - Some months ago I brought before the Senate a request that the sentences of some twenty-seven men who were serving long terms of imprisonment for offences committed abroad should be reviewed, and later I dealt with the matter in some detail. So far, however, no information has reached me that my request has been complied with. But I have learned from other sources that at least, nine of these men have been released, and that they are due to leave for the front in the course of a few days. I have also been informed that a further number has been released, but nothing of an official character has reached me. I would like to know from the Minister exactly what has been done in this matter. I* wish also to protest against the arbitrary action of the Defence Department in omitting to supply these men, whilst they were undergoing detention, with the dental service to which they were entitled. One of their number had been struck by a piece of shrapnel, which had passed through his upper lip, destroying some 6f his teeth, and lodging in his gums. He received no attention during the period of his incarceration, and since his release has been informed that it is not possible for the dental experts in the employ of the Department to provide him with the necessary new teeth. This appears to be absolutely unfair, and is calculated to have a very prejudicial effect upon recruiting. Injustices, of this character are bound to become public sooner or later. I urge the Minister to go into the complaints of the men, and see that justice is meted out to them. They enlisted voluntarily, and were prepared to sacrifice their lives, if necessary, for their country. If they committed some offence for which they were punished, that is no reason why the additional cruelty of refusing to give them the dental attention to which they are entitled should be inflicted on them. I hope also we shall be given the information to which we are entitled as to what has taken place regarding the release of the men on whose behalf I have complained. </para>

We are engaged, in alliance with Great Britain and other . countries in a war against Germany and Austria, and have been told in the newspapers that a communication has been received by the Government asking that a representative of Australia be sent to the Old Country to attend a Conference regarding the problems of the war, and events likely to happen on its conclusion. It was the duty of the Government to tell Parliament distinctly and definitely whether any communication of that kind had been received. We have had no intimation from them on that point. </para>

                            <para>- It does not matter two straws whether it has been done before or not. I can remember the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie scoffed at precedent. He has now, I suppose, become a slave to it. Fortunately for myself, I have not yet arrived at that condition, whatever may be in store for me in the  future. We have a distinct right to be informed by the Government whether an invitation has been received, and what its terms are. The invitation, or a copy of it, ought to be laid on the table of both Houses, because it is an invitation, not to the Government, or any particular member of it, but to the people of Australia, through their representative, to take part in a particular conference. In withholding the information from Parliament the Government is flouting Parliament, and flouting the people of the Commonwealth. If the Senate did its duty it would refuse to go a single step further with any business until the Government made it clear whether any such communication had been received, and laid it on the table of both Houses. The terms of the invitation ought to be public property, yet the Government meet Parliament, and are &#34; mum.&#34; I have heard a great deal about juntas during the last few months, but here is a cabal of men who have control for the present of the destinies of Australia, and do everything  in secret. We are her&#169; to transact public business. The public business of Australia will not be conducted in a cellar, if I know anything about it. We want everything to be done fairly and aboveboard. We must have everything clear and distinct and evident. Has an invitation been received? If it has, it ought to be here. If the invitation has been received, and if there is to be a Conference, no doubt the subjects to be discussed are mentioned in the invitation. That information should be the property of the people. Any number of questions of great consequence, probably affecting the future welfare of the people of Australia, will be discussed there, and are we to know nothing about them? Are we to send a man Home with a blank cheque, and let him do what he pleases, and come to any arrangement he thinks fit or desirable in the interests of the Australian people? I say no. That kind of thing-has been done too often in the past, and will not be done again in the future if I can stop it. We read about the evils of secret diplomacy, which I believe is responsible for a great deal of the trouble that has arisen all over the world. Confidential arrangements are made in private by individuals, responsible individuals no doubt, placed in position by the people of various countries, without consulting the people of those countries at all. All our efforts here ought to be directed towards breaking down such a system. I can suggest several questions of vital importance to Australia which will inevitably be discussed at the Conference, if there is to be one. On those questions the people of this country ought to be called upon to give instructions to their representative, whoever he may be. Take, for example, the .question of a White Australia. Attempts will assuredly be made . to break down that policy. The Indians are fighting side. by side with the Australians in France, and on that account a claim will doubtless be made on their behalf for free entry to Australia. Are the people of Australia prepared to let the Indians come here? If they are, or if they &#39;are not, they should be given an opportunity of instructing their representative accordingly. I am not going to say now whether we should agree or disagree with that idea. The matter will come up for decision, I hope, before any representative is sent to the Old Country. Another matter is the Tariff. If the ideas mooted at the Paris Conference are carried out, the people of Australia may bid farewell to any / prospect of having a protective Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- In any case, Australia, if she sends a representative at all, should be given an opportunity instructing him on that point. Australia&#39;s policy is Protection, for the purpose of developing her own resources, training her people in industries, and giving her young folks the best opportunity of carving out careers for themselves. But if the policy of the Allies with regard to trade is to be that indicated at the Paris Convention, Australia may well abandon all prospect of carrying out her Protectionist ideas. A number of other equally important questions will inevitably .be discussed at the Conference, when it takes place, and the people of this country should have an opportunity of telling their representative what course he is to take when he gets there. But apparently the intention of the Government is to keep, not only Parliament, but the people, in complete ignorance on the subject until the representative is, not only appointed, but well on his way to Great Britain. Conduct of that character is treason against the Commonwealth, and men who do that kind of thing ought not to be trusted with power for an instant. I emphatically protest against it. The Senate has a distinct duty before it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> the Leader of the Labour party, has referred to the matter already this afternoon, but the Senate ought to take some definite action. It should refuse Supply until it has a definite statement from the Government as to whether an invitation has been received, and of its exact terms. </para>

I also desire to join in extending a welcome to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy,</inline> who, I feel sure, from his wide experience and knowledge in connexion with Parliament, will be equally valuable to the Senate. I trust that his work here may be mutually pleasant. Coming now to the various statements that have been made during the course of the debate, I want to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> - taking the last  speaker  first- that if he would calmly consider the subjects that are likely to be discussed at the Imperial Conference, he will see how impossible it is to have a public debate on hypothetical questions which may or may not arise. </para>

                            <para>- And so it will be at the proper time. The fact that an invitation has been received is nothing. That has already been announced to the people of Australia, and senators are only humbugging themselves when they say they do not know anything about it. They do know that an invitation has been received, and what action the Government propose to take in regard to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> knows that certain proposals, which may or may not have an important effect on the question which he raised, are being discussed, and that until they have been dealt with the other question cannot be cleared up. Parliament and the country will want to know what are the results, and not the means by which the results are obtained, and when these have been formulated, Parliament will be informed; but nothing that will benefit our enemies will be made public. No nation would rejoice more than Germany if at this stage we entered upon a public discussion of our attitude towards peace. Have the Germans done this ? Of course they have not. We have not had one syllable of the discussion upon the speech made by the German Chancellor at the secret session of the Reichstag. That being the case, are all our cards to be laid on the table? I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> does not mean that. The Government must have time to formulate their plans, and decide as to representation, before Parliament and the country are informed. I trust that other honorable senators who referred to this matter will take my remarks as a reply to their statements. I come now to the question of the suggested publication of details of the soldiers&#39; vote at the front. The statement has been made by the Prime Minister that the vote gave a majority for conscription. The Prime Minister also said that at the request of the Imperial military authorities the details of that vote could not be made public for military  reasons. </para>

If honorable senators will only think what those military reasons are they will agree as to the wisdom of this course. Let them remember that our soldiers are fighting alongside the conscript soldiers of France. Let them, remember, also, that, owing to the secrecy of the ballot, our soldiers themselves do not know how their comrades voted. </para>

                            <para>- In some cases that was done, but I am bound to say that a civil tribunal, far away from the scene of war, would probably take a different view from a military tribunal on the battlefield and in face of the enemy. In the latter circumstances, the enormity of an offence would undoubtedly appear greater than to a civil&#39; tribunal reviewing lie sentence at a later date, and in the calm arena of peace. It must be remembered 0that, in many instances, these men were actually engaged at the front; that their offences were committed in the face of the enemy, and their sentences imposed by a tribunal at the time. Long before the papers arrived in Australia, I had appointed a Committee consisting of a police magistrate, with a large military experience, and a returned officer, to go through them as they came to hand, and decide whether, in view of all the circumstances, and the fact that the men had been returned to Australia, any remission of sentences could be made. Those cases which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> and other senators dealt with were referred to that Committee, and, in some cases, a remission of sentences was ordered, while in others it was recommended that the sentences should stand. I mention this to show honorable senators that some care should be exercised before accepting <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statements on such matters, and I want to assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> that, as the Commonwealth possesses no gaols, prisoners are handed over to the State prison authorities to be confined under the State regulations. Therefore, any criticism concerning their treatment in gaol must be directed against the administration of the State prison authorities. One &#39;of the boasts of New South Wales, I understand is that prison administration has been reformed to a greater extent than in any other .State, and I believe that it is a correct claim. I think that New South Wales has the most up-to-date penal system in Australia, and, therefore, I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> that if he thinks * that the State prison administration is not yet perfect, he should indicate any alterations which could be made. At any rate, these men have been in New South Wales prisons under what is said to be the most humanitarian system in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Gardiner</inline> told me that he had to leave the chamber owing to some cause over which he had no control. I do not consider that a Government is under any obligation to make a statement to Parliament in respect to any political negotiation, as regards either its structure or its party organization, which may be going on outside. I have not heard of a Government coming down and intimating beforehand political enterprises which it might be embarking upon, or political changes which might be taking place in its organization. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that we can now quite clearly designate the honorable gentlemen with whom we recently severed our political partnership as the Official Labour party. There was some honorable gentleman here so kind as to suggest that there was a letter missing in the word &#34; official,&#34; but I leave my honorable friends to consider whether the  name could not be still further altered in order to more correctly designate the party. Anyhow, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is the official mouthpiece of the party in this Chamber. He made a statement of a most interesting character to the public in Western Australia. He told them that the&#39; Official Labour party was going to hold up the business of this country until certain political changes had occurred. He was here to-day ; the question of passing a Supply Bill was discussed, and certain arrangements were suggested for dealing with that measure, but he did  not take us- into his confidence and tell us what was in his mind when he informed the people of Australia that the Official Labour party, were going to refuse Supply until a certain change had taken place in the Government of this country. I am not complaining of the honorable senator -not taking us into his confidence to-day, but I am pointing out that he is living in a glass house when he throws stones at us because we did not tell the people of this country today about certain negotiations which he says are proceeding.  </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> statement was more than a reference to negotiations. It was a public announcement of policy, but to-day he did not take the public or the Parliament into his confidence. For all he knows to the contrary, that statement has only reached the little audience that he addressed in Western Australia. Here to-day he had the people of Australia waiting with bated breath for an official announcement, but he has not taken us into his confidence. There has been another important announcement through the medium of the press, and that is the statement of Mr. Anstey. Surely that is a statement which is worthy of an explanation to the country, if we are to adopt the procedure suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner. Mr. Anstey</inline> has publicly told the people of this country that unless the Official Labour party join in a National Government they are going to destruction. </para>

                            <para>- I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey</inline> is very largely the creature of en0vironment. Whilst he was in Victoria he did not talk of political destruction or extinction. He talked of, bringing certain recalcitrant men to their knees, and of what he would do with them, but afterwards he went into a different environment. He went as a missionary to Western Australia to bring its people back to the true fold, and after he had spent a couple of weeks in that rare atmosphere of political intelligence he came back to Victoria and said to the people of Australia, &#34; Look here, if you do not go into this National Government, there is another Sedan in front of you. Political destruction is in front of you.&#34; To-day, however, we had his leader standing up in the&#39; Senate and saying that the people of this country have a right to know the political developments which are occurring - know everything which has occurred between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes-</inline> but he was absolutely silent as to what occurred between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey</inline> and the Official Labour party within the last two or three days. </para>

                            <para>- No. Once the letters are handed to the military authorities the postal control ceases. &#39; The military authorities at the front are the British military authorities, under whom all our Forces at the front are placed. The organization of those Forces is, of course, under the Australian Government. I presume that the best people to deal with postal matters are trained men. The men who are dealing with our postal matters at the front are men who were trained in our Postal Department. We have done everything possible, We have represented the individual&#39; cases which have occurred from time to time. We have communicated a number of complaints which have been made. </para>

                            <para>- He does; and the fault seems to me to be due to the abnormal circumstances&#39; existing at the front. Everybody knows that abnormal circumstances do exist there. When we read the accounts of visits to the front trenches, especially in the winter months; when we read of the difficulties encountered in getting through to the trenches; when we realize that the letters are sent into the trenches and there passed from hand to hand; when we remember that, a man may have been wounded and sent to a clearing hospital, or elsewhere, and that a letter has to follow him from place to place, we must recognise the possibility of letters going astray. This matter was represented some time ago, in very strong terms, to General Anderson, who is our representative at the War Office, and in a recent despatch he dealt with the matter. Through the medium of the press, I gave his reply to the public. There is no army in the world that has the same number of letters to deal with as has the Australian Army. Thanks to our very fine educational system, the Australian is the greatest letter-writer in the world. The figures given by General Anderson of the number of letters and postal articles handled and safely delivered were simply stupendous. When we reflect that that huge mass of material has to be delivered, sorted and then given out under actual service conditions on the battlefield,&#39; it is a marvel that more letters do not go astray. Time after time, and continuously, we have impressed on our own officers, on the War Office, and on persons in charge of  the Postal Corps, how essential it is that every care should be taken to insure proper and regular delivery of letters addressed to soldiers and sent by them to their friends. I shall heartily welcome any suggestions that can be made which will tend to improve the condition of things. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that these cases are due to the conditions to which I have referred, and not to the negligence of those who are responsible for the delivery of the letters. I believe that they are very frequently -due to conditions over which they have no control. I can only say that I will bring the representations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> under the notice of those at the front, and see whether the cause of the complaints can be discovered. </para>
