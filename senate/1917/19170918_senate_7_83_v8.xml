                <para>That this Senate desires to record its profound regret at the loss which the Commonwealth suffers in the death of the Honorable Charles Carty Salmon, who was at one time  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, and was one of its members at the inauguration of the Parliament and also for many years afterwards, and who was at one time a member of the Victorian Ministry, and expresses its sincere condolence with his widow and the members of his family in their bereavement. </para>
                <para>I remind honorable senators that, although the deceased gentleman was not a member of the Senate, he was well known to at least the majority who are present to-day, and not only known, but, I venture to say, held both in respect and with a considerable degree of affection. He had distinguished himself by a long, meritorious public career, in the course of which he revealed that highest type of citizenship which expresses itself with singleness of purpose in association with all things making for the public weal. Therefore, although he was not a member of the Senate, it is fitting, I think, that we should place on record a tribute to his memory, and a sense of the loss which the community suffers by his death and which we personally feel from his companionship being withdrawn from us. </para>
                <para>There are, sir, others who are more deeply concerned in the loss of the late honorable gentlemen than ourselves, and that is those who are to-day inmates of a  home stricken with grief. I may, in submitting the motion, express the hope that, as it contains a genuine expression of our feelings regarding the deceased gentleman, it may, in some measure, be. accepted as tempering a little the blow which has fallen upon them. </para>

                    <para>.- On behalf of honorable . senators sitting on this side, I second the motion which has been moved so feelingly by the Leader of the Senate. I think that most of the honorable senators assembled here knew the honorable gentleman who has paid the last debt of Nature, and whose funeral service we attended to-day. I knew <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon well, and I found him at all times to be a man amongst men, high spirited and single-minded, as the Leader of the Senate has said. I believe that his death is another proof that devotion to duty puts an end to life at a much earlier period than would otherwise be the case. </para>

                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline>
                    Salmon was a good man, no matter what duty he was performing. He was prominent in Church and State matters, and in all he was respected. I agree with the Leader of the Senate in the statement that the Commonwealth has lost a very valuable citizen but more so the home that is now bereft.  His  wife has lost, indeed, a good husband, and his children a good father, and the Commonwealth mourns the loss of a devoted and high-minded public servant.

                    <para>- I desire to inform the Senate that this morning I received a lettergram from Launceston, Tasmania, purporting to convey to me certain resolutions and protests passed at a public meeting in Launceston with regard to the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill now before this J Chamber, and asking me to read the lettergram to the Senate. I do not propose to do anything of the 'kind, because it is most improper for any body to try and exercise influence over the Senate, or to try and get the Presiding Officer to exercise any such influence. The proper method to approach Parliament is by petition, and as that course has not been pursued, I have decided to take no action in the matter. </para>

Of that sum, £400 is to bear interest after the war is over, and £150 after two years. In addition, one person has given a £10 bond and all interest coupons as a gift, while four persons have handed in coupons valued at £18 8s. for payment to revenue. Further sums, totalling £79,627, have been received as gifts. The number of contributors is not known, as in many cases the amounts have been received through newspaper offices. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause provides for reciprocity with other parts of the Empire. If the Imperial Government tax any British company on so much of its war-time profits as are made in Australia, the Commonwealth Treasurer will be able under the clause to make an arrangement with them to adjust the tax as between Australia and Great Britain. The British tax is now 80 per cent, of the profits, and I am glad to see a reciprocity clause of this sort, because I hope it will mean no double  taxation  There has been a great deal of duplication and even triplication of taxation as between England and Australia in the past. I have given notice of an amendment for a later part of the Bill to limit the total taxation in Australia to two-thirds of a man's income. I do not know whether the Government has any sympathy with that proposal, but it will .probably again raise the question of reciprocity. </para>

                    <para>.- Although I recognise the kind of case <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has in mind, it is not possible to accept his amendment. The clause, which is iu the direction of reciprocity, merely authorizes the Treasurer to endeavour to obtain it. Unless the Imperial Chancellor responds, the effect of the amendment mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> will be to bar the Australian Government from levying taxation on some  of its own people. The Imperial tax represents 80 per cent., and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> 's amendment will limit our total .taxation to two-thirds. Obviously, as 80 per cent, is more than two-thirds, the Commonwealth would not be able to levy a penny of taxation upon certain people making money in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I am assured that the amendment would not afford any relief to any one who is merely an Australian taxpayer; but, if it were carried, the Imperial Government would point out to us that there was no need for reciprocity, because they had already taken 80 per cent, of the excess profits, and we had boun'd ourselves not to take more than two-thirds, so that there would be nothing left for us to tax. We would, therefore, put ourselves out of court. The object of the clause is to allow the Treasurer to represent to the Imperial Government that we are entitled to a share of the excess profits tax paid by certain taxpayers, and to ask' them to share with us in some fair proportion the 80 per cent, tax levied by them. The Imperial Government got in first, and we want a lever to approach them with, as a sound argument for asking them to remit some portion of their tax, we also remitting some portion of ours. We must not tie our hands in the matter. </para>

That is, that the excess profits will not be taxed to the maximum under this Act, and, also, to the maximum under the British Act. Is that so? </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable senator will not be prejudiced by the fact that he did not move his amendment when clause 11 was called on, because its object was really to substitute the plural for the singular with regard to the Board of Referees. He can do that later on, and I would remind him that, under our Acts Interpretation Act, where the circumstances suggest it, singular and plural are alternative terms. I am happy, therefore, to be able to meet him in this matter by substituting the word "Boards" for "Board." </para>

The object of these amendments is to remove from the Commissioner a great deal of the discretionary power which, under a number of clauses, has been vested in him. Acting on the strong representations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> I have had a consultation with the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir John Forrest)</inline> and with the income tax officials with a view to dividing into two classes those cases in which discretion rested with the Commissioner. Some of these are obviously of a simple, routine character, and that officer may safely be left to deal with them. But others involved questions of fact, in which the interests of the taxpayer and of the Government may clash, and I therefore propose to submit certain amendments with a view to doing away with the discretionary power which the Bill now gives to the Commissioner.

                    <para>. - I desire to offer special encouragement to any person or persons who contemplate starting new industries in Australia immediately. It must be quite apparent to honorable senators that, owing to the increased cost of machinery and plant during this war period, any person or persons wishing to establish a new industry may be disposed to postpone its inauguration until the war has terminated. That is manifestly not in the best interests of Australia, and, consequently, it would be wise to give such persons special consideration by allowing them to set off the additional cost of their plant and machinery against the amount of their taxable profits. There are companies in Australia whch have had to incur a very considerable additional cos in order to get their industries going immediately. That increase has, in some instances, amounted to 100 per cent. I know that, since the war started, the Hydro-Electric Department in the State of Tasmania has had to pay in freight upon its plant from New York £5 10s. per ton as against £2 per ton, the freight in normal times. The cost of machinery has been proportionately high. In such circumstances, it would be only equitable to allow this additional expenditure as a set-off against the levy made upon their profits during the period over which this measure will operate. Consequently, I move - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>That the following new sub-clause be inserted: - " (7) In the case of a new industry, the plant and machinery for which has been purchased and installed during the war, and when it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, that the cost of such plant and machinery has been increased owing to the war, the Commissioner shall allow the amount of such increased cost to be deducted from the profits. </para>
                <para>Provided, however, that no deduction shall be allowed under this sub-clause unless the' increased cost exceeds by at least 10 per cent. the amount which the plant and machinery would have cost prior to the war." </para>
                <para>The equity of this proposal will appeal to all honorable senators. We first recognise the grave importance to Australia of getting new industries started at once. We realize that it is necessary that the Commonwealth shall become self-contained. For years we have been pursuing the foolish policy of sending our raw materials abroad to be converted into the manufactured article, thus assisting to build up the very nation with which we are at war to-day. </para>

                        <para>- But many of the arguments addressed to the Committee by the honorable senator might with equal force have, been urged in regard to any other tax. No impost which is levied upon any industry can be regarded as other than a handicap upon that industry. But we have to consider the purpose of this Bill, and the peculiar circumstances of the new industries which will be taxed if this clause be retained in its present form. It is quite true that almost all new industries in Australia will have to pay an excess price for their machinery and plant. But the amendment is limited to industries which have started since the war broke out. </para>

                        <para>- The people to whom, the amendment specifically refers are those who have started industries since the outbreak of the war. These individuals, therefore, were not caught " on the hop." They knew what they were doing, and if they have paid an increased price for their machinery and plant because of war conditions, they have done so because, as the result of those conditions, they anticipated making larger profits! I could have recognised greater force in the honorable senator's  arguments  if his amendment had been limited to those persons who purchased machinery and plant just prior to the outbreak of the war. " But it is a fair assumption that the individuals who started new industries after the war broke out did so because they believed that, as the result of the war, they would make in creased profits. It does not appear to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has made out any case for those persons whose special interests would be advanced by the adoption of his amendment. Incidentally, I would remind him that the inflated values to which' he has alluded will figure in the capital accounts of these new industries, which will to that extent receive consideration. I ask the Committee to stand by the measure in its present form. . Although I admit at once the desirableness of establishing new industries, I would point out that the arguments which have been advanced by the honorable senator might, with equal justification, be urged in regard to the expansion of existing industries. It is necessary, to levy a certain amount of taxation. This Bill proposes to collect taxation upon excess profits, and I am unable to see why people who enter into a business with their eyes open, tempted, it may be, by the prospect of higher profits because of war conditions, should be exempt from the taxation which those engaged in other industries will have to bear under this Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> amendment appeals to one's sympathy, and also to one's judgment. But I have been impressed rather by the delightful way in which the honorable senator has seized upon the spirit of the BiTT, to submit an amendment which will ada to the confusion, to the list of officials, and to the cost of collection of the tax, which are inevitable under this Bill. I am not so inquisitive as to ask the honorable senator if he had his amendment drafted by the official draftsman, but there is no doubt that it is in keeping with the whole of this Bill. I was startled to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> say that there is going to be more taxation. </para>

                        <para>- When I was speaking on the subject the other day it was suggested that I desired to revel in  taxation  but I should like now to say that, in my opinion, it would be better to tell the people in a straightforward way \\'hat the taxation necessary is likely to be, than to adopt the course followed by the Government of saying with one breath that they intend tq make the taxation as light as possible, and with the next uttering a vague threat that there will be more taxation. The uncertainty as to what businesses will be taxed, the difficulty of ascertaining the increased cost of machinery upon pre-war prices, the fact that allowance is to be made only in the case of an increased cost of not less than 10 per cent., and that where the increased cost has been only9½ per cent., there will be no exemption, makes it difficult for me to support the amendment, because in all these complexities it is so much in keeping with thia Bill. After the way in which my amendment upon clause 8 was received, I am inclined to believe that the more people who are relieved from the operation of this measure the better. All this talk about the starting of new industries, and the development of existing industries, is calculated only to hamper this passing of legislation of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- I am at present concerned about the inroads which such considerations make upon our legislation, especially when dealing with ' a taxation measure. A person well disposed towards a new industry may see a way by which he can help it by the insertion of a certain provision in a Bill, and while the objection and intention might be excellent, what would happen to our legislation generally if we all followed a similar course? I suppose that no Bill could be introduced in connexion with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> could not suggest some amendment which might be of advantage to an industry in Tasmania. </para>

We should not mix up a taxation measure with a measure for the assistance of industries. I realize that we should be careful that our taxation proposals shall not injure industries. I have nob yet made up my mind how I shall vote upon the amendment; but, as I have said, in view of the defeat of my amendment to put all industries on the same footing, I am now disposed to assist in the exemption of industries from the operation of this Bill. </para>

That is to say, no definite standard will be quoted by the people providing freight. As an illustration in point, I may say that a newspaper proprietor told me the, other day that he had great difficulty in getting paper for printing purposes. He had secured the filling of an order which he had given to one of the agents of paper mills in the West British Columbia district, and he had to . pay more for freight from the paper mills down to San Francisco than he had been in the habit of paying prior to the war, from San Francisco to Australia. He had been charged on a previous shipment more than four or five times the pre-war freight, but when he asked what he would have to pay in freight on the last order, he was told that he could not be provided with freight unless he left the cost entirely in the discretion of the company filling the order'. </para>

                        <para>- We can have no assurance that the prices of the products will be increased in the same proportion. If an enterprise is established, and because of war conditions it is necessary in the purchase of machinery to add, say 50 per cent., to pre-war prices, I am assured by business men and accountants that the very first step necessary in producing a balance-sheet of the business is to write off from the war profits the extra amount which the machinery has cost because of war conditions. If a plant which ordinarily would cost. £50,000 under prewar conditions, costs £75,000 because of war conditions, and assuming that the business earns £50,000 during a year of the war period, from the accountancy stand-point it is essential that the increase of £25,000 on the normal cost of the plant shall be chargeable against the war profit earned. That is perfectly sound, because after the war period comes to an end the enterprise will in all probability have to compete against industries established in the pre-war period with -machinery secured at pre-war prices. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> alluded to a company formed to establish the carbide industry in Tasmania. I do not think that that company has any prospect of profit for a year or two to come. </para>

                        <para>- I had the other company in mind, and as the honorable senator is aware, it is contingent upon the State , enterprise referred to, and was originally responsible for that enterprise. The company may not! earn profits at once, but they have paid for a great deal of machinery enhanced prices due to war conditions. If they earn profits, as I hope they will, on a sound ' accountancy basis, the increased price of the plant attributable to war conditions must be charged against those profits, because directly after the war is over, the company must compete against others' established with machinery on a pre-war basis of cost. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly . There is much soundness in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> contention as to the desirability of establishing new industries. What about the eloquence with which some members of Parliament,  and the persistency with which all candidates at the last election, alluded to the necessity for developing Australian industries during the war period? I venture to say that candidates generally, irrespective of party, made allusion to that necessary phase of our national activities. Despite the strictures of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> I say that no more rational thing could be attempted by the Parliament of a country like this than the establishment of new industries, if war conditions will permit of it. </para>

                        <para>- And what  greater  deterrent £o their establishment could there be than the element of indefiniteness in regard to the cost of plant? After the initial steps have been taken in the establishment of an industry, the necessary plant may cost, before the enterprise is consolidated, 300 per cent, or 400 per cent, more than it would have cost during the pre-war period. Is that increased cost not to be considered? Is it not sane to anticipate that those managing such an industry will write off from its profits that increased cost of machinery? It is a very sound proposal on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> to ask the Committee ito consent to the setting of the increased cost of plant attributable to war conditions against profits made during the war. Having regard to all the features of the situation, it gives me much pleasure to support! <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> very rational amendment. </para>

                <para>SenatorNEWLAND. - I should recommend the honorable senator to put his modesty on one side and attempt to do what he wishes to do without offering an apology in this way. There is no justification for providing that no relief shall  be granted to a man who establishes a new industry or imports new machinery unless the extra cost of the machinery is 10 per cent. There is as much virtue in 2' per cent, as there is in 10 per cent. 1 believe that all the new machinery imported into Australia during the war, and for a considerable time afterwards, will cost at least 10 per cent. more than it did in pre-war times. The proviso to this amendment might interfere with a manufacturer. It might, for instance, restrain a man who was intending to import machinery. Suppose that a man is thinking of starting a new industry, or, perhaps, a new branch of an existing industry. If he is unable to finance the scheme he must lay his proposal before his bank, or some other financial institution, and state how much money he needs, for what purpose it is wanted, and what his profits are likely to be. The institution would agree to assist the manufacturer if he could show that he would make certain profits and could contribute a certain percentage of the profits every year for amortization or depreciation or renewal of plant. Unless he could show the banker a fair prospect of getting the money back he would not be likely to get the advance he desired. Last week <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> instanced an Adelaide manufacturer who is importing a machine at a cost of £20,000. It would be useless for any purpose except the one for which it is being imported. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> to consent to the omission of the proviso, so as to make the subclause more acceptable to the Committee and to the men who are going to engage in new industries. It would be unfortunate if the Senate were to pass any legislation which would hamper any person who desired to establish a new industry during war time, because when the war is over industries in England, America, and elsewhere will turn their plant from the manufacture of munitions of war to the manufacture of various articles required in Australia. I hope that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> will agree to the amendment, but if he disagrees, I trust that the mover will insist upon going to a vote. </para>

                    <para>.- All taxes are objectionable. The proprietors of old industries may desire to introduce new plant to make their businesses more efficient, and be prepared to spend ever so much more money than a man who wished to establish a new industry. It is proposed to tax one man and to allow the other to come under this provision. Take, for instance, the boot industry. There is machinery which will save labour almost infinitely, and new machines are being constructed almost every year. In fact, it is the same with nearly every industry. According to the terms of this amendment, an industry which is already established, although it might want to increase its effectiveness by installing new machinery, would not get the benefit of the provision, but a new industry would. </para>

                    <para>.- E must confess that I did not submit this amendment with the object of making any great display of mercy to the taxpayers. My first object is to promote the interests of Australia, and that, of course, depends upon the establishment of new businesses. There may be instances in which an old business would suffer. The expressions used- by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> concerning old industries' might be applied to any other taxpayers. We want to induce persons to manufacture those things which hitherto we have imported. I brought forward this proposal to achieve that object, and not to relieve any person from taxation. In deference to the criticism of honorable senators, I ask permission to amend my amendment by deleting the proviso. I realize on maturer consideration that, after all, very few industries would be affected by such a provision. We all know that the cases will be very rare where the machinery does not cost 10 per cent, more than the pre-war standard, and perhaps, , after all, the benefit is more imaginary than real. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am sure all honorable, senators sympathize with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> in the object he has in view; but we must remember that his amendment strikes at the root of the Bill. At the last election, all members of the National- party were pledged x up to the hilt to support a war-time profits tax. I know I was. I made that announcement on every platform from which I spoke, and no statement was received with 'greater applause. It is surprising, however, that nobody said a word about this matter until the Bill was about half-way through. I feel compelled, therefore, much as I dislike the measure, to support it, because if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> amendment is carried, it will open the flood-gates for similar amendments, and strike at the roots of the Bill. My view is that new industries will get a 10 per cent, exemption, and if at the end of the war it is found that any are in a precarious position, I am sure that, after the expression of opinion we have had from both sides of the Senate, the manufacturers concerned will get ample protection through the Tariff, for surely there is not now one single Free Trader in the Senate. </para>

If during the war they get 10 per cent, exemption, and if after the war have sufficient Tariff protection to enable them to make 40 or 50' per cent. , they will be doing very well. </para>

I disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn's</inline> contention that this amendment will strike at the roots of the Bill. At present there is no encouragement to establish new industries, but if, in the initial stages of new industries they are treated as enterprises not able to bear the burden of old industries, they will be encouraged much to the advantage of the Commonwealth as a whole. </para>

                        <para>- I named several on Friday last, and I may mention the difficulty at present experienced in obtaining potash salts for farm use. Prior to the war we imported this article from Germany, but the source of supply is now cut off, nor do we desire it to be available to us. Then there is difficulty in obtaining sulphuric acid for the treatment of ordinary phosphates. If such an industry could be established it would be a very important one. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but the price charged is prohibitive for our low-grade phosphates. At present imported phosphates are being treated, but if we could lessen the cost of sulphuric acid we would then be able to use our own phosphates. Quite a number of other new industries could be established if the proper encouragement were given; but if we say that directly a business commences to show a profit it shall be treated on the same dead-level as any other business that may have been in existence for ten or twenty years, we shall certainly be discouraging enterprise in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Wire drawing has been established, and adjustable pulleys and bag mounts are being made here. There have been many important developments in the direction of making woollen and woollen and cotton mixtures of underclothing; in fact, one may now dress one's self, and live on all Australian products without having recourse to any importations whatever. I appeal to the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> to give us a bonus for these industrial war babies. I do-not care how he does it, or where, or when, whether by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> amendment or otherwise, but before the Bill is through Committee, I will ask him to consider seriously the necessity to put the war babies, so far as the industrial arena is concerned, upon a better basis than any other. I have read a list of some of the industries that have been started, and there is plenty of room for further development. All sorts of schemes are in the air. There is not only the making of our own copper, zinc, and lead utensils, but there are many other activities going on. It only wants the Government to carry out the public policy they announced at the elections to stimulate Australian industries, to give us a help in a direction that I hope will be a very big sheet anchor and safeguard for our financial future. </para>

                <para>I also ask the Government to take into consideration . the question of the depreciation of machinery. That matter is dealt with in a previous clause, and the whole of the Bill outside of these provisions is going to be dealt with on the basis of the present income tax administration. One of the detriments to new industries will be the question of depreciation. Machinery now costs, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> pointed out, from 20 per cent, to 100 per cent. more than in pre-war days, and if the Bill is administered on an income tax basis, an enterprising manufacturer who has created an industrial war baby will be able to deduct only 5 per cent. depreciation per year on that machinery. I should like an assurance that these youthful struggling industries will be treated in a special way, and nob penalized because enterprising and progressive men have dared to start them in Australia owing to the depressing circumstances of the day. </para>

                    <para>. - I admire <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> eloquence, which reached a pitch ait which it nearly brought tears to the eyes of men like myself. When I listen to the story of these poor, unsophisticated manufacturers, I am forming quite a new conception of the tlype. I always regarded them as hard-headed, shrewd men, ' but, apparently, they are a lot of financial innocents', rambling round not knowing exactly where they are, and plunging their money in anywhere without inquiry. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; patriots with a strong " £ s. d." side. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> mentioned a man going into an industry which in normal times would mean an expenditure of £50,000 for plant and machinery, but which because of abnormal war conditions is going to cost him £75,000. That is very probable, but I cannot conceive of a man who had sense enough to acquire £50,000 buying £75,000 worth of machinery with it unless he could see that it was going to return him, not only the 50 per cent, increased cost of his plant, but at least 50 per cent, more in the products of that plant. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> stood on this party's platform. I do not want to remind him of the old American saying about platforms being good to get in on but not to stand on. The honorable senator also said, quite rightly, that much of the increased cost of plant was due to the factor of freight, and that freight was an uncertain quantity, the only element of certainty about it being that it has been going up all the time. He said that, therefore, a person about to start a new industry would, in ordering his plant, know that the freight might be a little higher by the time his goods were shipped on the other side. But he would also know that the higher freights went the higher would be the price that he would get for the article that his machinery turned out here, because he was making an article which it would cost more to 'bring out here. This business man, as I still conceive him to be, in spite of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> attempt to describe him otherwise - this hard-headed, shrewd business man - would know when he paid the extra price for his machinery that he would be able to recoup himself by getting a more than correspondingly big increase in the price of the thing which his machinery would make. A good deal of this sympathy is altogether ill-bestowed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> raised the very pertinent point that there is as much sympathy due to the man engaged in a business of a certain magnitude who decides to extend it as there is to the man who goes into a new industry altogether. But not a word is said here, for him, except by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy,</inline> although he is equally enterprising and equally advantageous to this country. Apparently, we are to leave him to look after himself. </para>

                        <para>- They have been doing it for years. I owned an Australianbuilt body five years ago. There are as many Ford chassis running in this city with Australian bodies as with imported ones. The same applies to all cities of any size, and many big country towns. Therefore, while a new business may start in Adelaide, it is not a new industry. The honorable senator mentioned the man tempted to start by the high price that he can command for the product of his industry. People like that went in knowing that, although they would pay more for their plant, they would be more than compensated bv the increased price of the article they turned oUt. In the circumstances, I cannot see that any special case can be made out for them as against any other man who puts additional capital into any other business. </para>

                    <para>. - I fail to follow the Minister in assuming that the reasons he has given justify him in taking up an attitude of hostility to the amendment. Indeed, he should have encouraged the submission and passage of the amendment and other provisions similar to it which would stimulate Australian enterprises in various directions. He quoted the case given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> of a man embarking in a new industry paying £75,000 for machinery which in normal times would have cost him £50,000, and said that that man knew he would be more than compensated by the increased profits he would make under the same abnormal conditions as increased the price of his machinery. But that is an isolated case. There are numbers of industries awaiting establishment in Australia, and now is the time to establish them ; but so long as we handicap new industries in the way we are doing in this Bill, especially in comparison with old-established industries, we can expect the establishment of only a tithe, or one-hundredth of those which would come into existence under present conditions. I was somewhat surprised at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> 's reasoning towards the close of his remarks. He said that if a new industry, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> amendment contemplates, has to pay a much increased price for its machinery, at the end of the war period, when conditions are becoming normal again, we shall, by .the imposition of a Protective Tariff, secure to that industry a market somewhat comparable with the market which it had during the boom conditions of the war. What is the position? We are handicapping every Australian industry, and we are promoting the exploitation of our market by outsiders. </para>

                <para>I propose to give one or two instances of the way in which outsiders realize that we are committing industrial suicide for their benefit.

She does not contemplate that we will maintain a Protective Tariff with a view to fostering new1 industries, and preserving for ever industries that have been established in our midst during the abnormal conditions .of the war period. On the contrary, she says that she will send us goods of first quality which will be able to secure a market here for ever. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain</inline> asked, by way of interjection, a little while ago, what new industries have been' established here. The circular which I have read, shows the particular goods which are being largely exported to the Australian market. I have another circular that has gone the rounds of a number of merchants in the various cities of Australia, which confirms the position taken up by the previous writer as to the excellent opportunity which Australia now has of allowing Japan to supply her with goods hitherto supplied by America, Germany and Great Britain, and laying a firm foundation for continued trade of that kind in the future - a foundation so firm indeed that, after the war, Australian enterprise will be stifled.

                <para>I have read only two of a number of circulars of a similar character which I could produce, and which serve to show that close outside our borders we have an enterprising industrial competitor which sees that there is a market here that is not being supplied as hitherto by the Allied Powers or by the other belligerents. These neighbours seem to think that we are not going to take occasion by the hand. Even in the absence of this Bill, they would be endeavouring to wrest from us our own market for our own productions. If that be the case in the green leaf, what must it be. in the dry ? We are undoubtedly imposing heavy handicaps upon new industries, and I do hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> will yet see his way to accept this small measure of justice to enterprises which have not yet come into existence, but which will do so, and which, in the absence of the amendment, will be heavily penalized under this Bill.

But the honorable senator, when he was a Minister in a Protectionist Cabinet, knew  very well that we then had within a few days' sail of this island continent this same industrial competitor.  Yet he was a Minister in that Cabinet which- </para>

                        <para>- After the war we may have a flood, after the flood we may have a bushfire, and after the bushfire we may have a drought. Honorable senators opposite always want action to be postponed till after something has happened. In listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> began to think that his remarks were something in the nature of a prostitution of his fiscal faith. To my mind, there is no name which will adequately describe the dastard measure which' we are now considering. I was very much interested in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> remarks. I listened carefully also to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> who desires to protect and foster new industries, and to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior,</inline> who spoke on the same subject last week. I have only to say in reply that this is not the Bill or the time in which to protect new industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has referred to the Win-the-War Government, and I remind him that everything is in their hands. What  we have to consider is whether there are new industries in Australia, or will new industries be established here. </para>

                        <para>- Then the point I wish to make is that we should give a greater protective incidence to our Tariff. If Senators  Bakhap,  Earle, and others supporting the present Win-the-War Government think that there are new industries in Australia which are not receiving justice, and which are in danger of being strangled at their birth, they should use their influence to induce the Government they are supporting to bring down an amendment of the Tariff. There is any amount of time to provide by an amendment of the Tariff all the Protection that is necessary for the fostering and development of new industries. I am prepared by voice and vote to give all the support I can to the fostering and development of new industries, but I cannot, and will not, do it under this Bill. The responsibility is upon Senators Keating, Bakhap, Earle, and Pratten, who are supporting the Government, to see that an amendment of the Tariff is proposed. If they can persuade the Government to introduce an amendment of the Tariff increasing its protective incidence, they will have my support in every division. This is" not the time, and £. War-time Profits Bill is not the Bill, in which to- give this protection. If we supported all the amendments proposed in connexion with this measure there would be nothing of the Bill left but the paper it is written on, and even the miserable £500,000 revenue which the Treasurer expects to receive from the first year of its operation would disappear as if by magic, and we should have no revenue at all from a war-time profits tax. </para>

I remarked on Friday that I could not conceive of the Japanese Government being so witless as to introduce a measure of this kind, notwithstanding the fact that Japan is a belligerent, and has incurred extensive war expenditure which it must meet, in addition to a heavy war debt consequent upon a previous struggle. Some Japanese enterprises have returned dividends of 175 per cent, during the war period. I am aware that in Japan there i3 a pretty heavy income tax, but I should like to remind the Committee that the very enterprises which in that country are earning 175 per cent.- are subsidized by the Japanese Government. </para>

                        <para>- I submit it as an illustration to elucidate the  argument traversed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> Interjections have' been made in respect to the new industries established, or likely to be established, since the war began. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has been fairly particular in his statement of new industries, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> contributed to the list, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> mentioned that he is aware of several new industries which it is desirable to establish. The other day I was in a very extensive warehouse, where practically all the samples exhibited were of Japanese manufactured goods, and manufactured in such a way, I am bound to admit  that they were scarcely distinguishable from goods of the same class which  we  have hitherto imported from other countries, or have to some extent manufactured ourselves. Surely in this continent we have ample deposits of clay which would enable us to manufacture porcelain or crockery. I have in my possession, made out of Tasmanian clay, several cups and saucers manufactured in one of the pottery counties of the Old Country. Samples of clay from the east coast of Tasmania were sent to Staffordshire, and there made into ' cups and saucers still in the .possession of my wife and daughters. We are importing crockery at the present time from Japanese factories subsidized by the Japanese Government. More power to the Japanese people if they have the wit to seize the opportunities which the war is presenting to them. </para>

I suggested the case of a company which would, in prewar times, have had to expend £50,000 upon a plant, but which, owing ito the establishment of its enterprise during the war period', incurred an additional expenditure for plant of £25,000, making a cash outlay  of £75,000. In order to show that I desire to give plenty of margin for profit earning in an enterprise of this kind, I suggested, for the sake of the illustration, that it earned £50,000 in one year on a capital of £75,000. I do not venture to say that there is any industry of the kind in Australia at the present time earning such a profit. There are industries which have been established in Australia since the war broke out, but which are not yet in active production. They are building up their plant and endeavouring. to put their line of production on the actual output level, but have not yet earned profits, </para>

                        <para>- That is so; but is the war going to end to-morrow? Does the honorable senator not see that such a company as I have suggested may be) faced with this position: It may earn profits only in one year of the war period, and if it should earn £50,000 in that year it will have an allowance of 10 per cent, on the cash capital expenditure of £75,000, or £7,500, and of the £42,500 profits remaining, the company would Joe allowed £10,635, making a total allowance to the company of £18,135, whilst the Government would take through taxation, under this Bill, £31,835. The increased cost of plant due to war conditions at the time of its purchase which .the company would have to write off would be £25,000, and against that amount the company would receive in one year of the war period £18,135. leaving a net loss of £6,875, and then, if the war came  to  an end, it would, with its costly machinery, have to compete against enterprises which would have the benefit of  the  conditions which would inevitably follow the declaration of peace, and the additional advantage of having purchased their machinery in a pre-war period. lb is easy to see that the company I have suggested would, in competition with these enterprises, be placed at' a material disadvantage. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has challenged the pertinence of mv illustration. Very early in the war period I saw, in Martin-place. Sydney, an exhibition of dye stuffs. Honorable senators know the difficulty there was in securing a proper khaki dye.- An enterprising chemist in Sydney got together samples of brown dye stuffs approximating to khak  which he had extracted from the barks of Australian trees, from grasses, and so forth. </para>

                        <para>- I wish it would die a natural death, because it is one of the most pernicious measures it has been my lot to peruse in either the Tasmanian or Federal Parliament's. I hope that the Committee will recognise the dangerous path which we as legislators of a young nation are treading. We have quite wrongly assumed that a similar condition of things exists here as in the manufacturing companies of the Old World or the United States of America. Industries in those countries are well established. I venture to say that the War-time Excess Profits Act on the Imperial statute-book is affecting only long-established industries, such as the shipping and banking industries and industries whose machinery and plant it has been necessary only to adapt for the manufacture of munitions of war. </para>

                        <para>- I say that the operation of the measure similar to this in the Old Country obtains the larger portion of the revenue derived by  the  Treasury from the taxation of the profits of old-established industries. In this new country we should observe the principle of not allowing any taxation measure to operate in its incidence in deathly fashion on industries which have just been established, or which we hope to see established. I think that we, as one of the units of the King's overseas Dominions, are going in the opposite direction to that favoured by one of our Allies in the present war. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been confused by th6 arguments of different speakers on this proposal. It was particularly difficult for me to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> He wants a very high duty. But of what use will a high duty be if 50 per cent, of the profits of a business are to be taken in the first year, and 75 per cent, in the second year ? How high must the duty be which would enable these industries to prosper? The idea of improving industries by a duty means the improvement of some industries at the cost of others. Nearly all the industries which have been improved bv the Tariff have found their raw materials taxed by another growing industry to such an extent that they would have been better placed without the duty. Then we have the great competitor to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> referred. He suggested that we should start to develop new industries to supply this great competitor with raw material. If we did, I venture to say that we should be going the right way to work to establish new industries. The difficulty I felt when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> proposed the insertion of this new sub-clause was to discover what industries would be affected by its enactment. The onus is now upon the honorable senator to give us ah idea as to whether there are some industries which- it is specially designed to assist; protect, and benefit, br whether he has a vague notion that there may be such industries, and desires to be on the safe side. . </para>

I am not going to make an imputation against the commercial community, but if we allow a private arrangement over which no one has any control to be made, we shall be opening the door to all sorts of doubtful possibilities. We must consider the revenue, or, at all events, we must not open the door in such a way as to tempt people, by any private arrangement, to defraud the revenue. </para>

When a man assigns his estate, the assignee appointed is usually a reputable firm of accountants. This is a well-known method of compromising with creditors, and the object of my amendment is to bring the Bill into conformity with this practice. </para>

A little earlier in the evening, I intimated that, in consequence of a series of amendments moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> to remove certain matters from the discretion of the Commissioner, I had gone through the Bill with the officials and the Treasurer, and had divided into two classes those clauses containing references to the discretion of the Commissioner. In one class . we placed all those routine matters which the Commissioner might be very well asked to decide, but we resolved that all matters which might seriously affect the interests of the taxpayers should be removed from the discretion of the Commissioner, and if the taxpayer were dissatisfied, he would have legal redress. </para>

                    <para>.- My object was to extend the right of appeal by the taxpayer, not only in clauses 4, 5, and 6, but in clauses 3, 7, and 8 as well, and I would point out to the Leader of the Senate that his amendment takes away that elasticity so necessary with regard to the amount that may be set down as deductions for wear and tear, and makes the clause absolutely rigid along the lines of the present Income Tax administration. I have before drawn the attention of the Committee to the fact that the present Income Tax Commissioner allows only 5 per cent. per annum- for depreciation of, perhaps, intricate machinery, which will wear out in ten years. Under the income tax schedule the Commissioner is debarred from making any allowance for the amortization of leaseholds, or money spent on leases for business purposes. I would most respectfully submit to the Minister in charge- </para>

                        <para>- This sub-clause refers to the Commonwealth income tax. Personally I do not consider the omission of. the words necessary at all, seeing that in another clause of the Bill the taxpayer has the right of appeal against any decision of the Commissioner to the Board of Referees.I would point out to the Committee that depreciation on the plant and machinery is limited under this proposal, and that will be another handicap on new industries - those war babies that we ought to protect. I would rather that the sub-clause stand as it is, than that it should be contracted within the narrow, rigid lines of Income Tax administration. </para>

                        <para>-It is not a case of two wrongs. If ' a business  man with £10,000 invested in capital spends in the war period £1,000 in additions, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> says he ought to take £1,000 off. I say " certainly not " ; but what we ought to do to ascertain the proportionate prewar standard is to assume that that £1,000 was invested before the war, and add 10 per cent, to the pre-war standard of his profits. It becomes a simple rule of three to' ascertain how much profit a man would obtain on a given amount of capital. If he is to have 10 per cent, added to his pre-war standard in respect of money he had not then invested, he cannot also ask . for the deduction of the amount he invested later on. I moved this amendment because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> objected to the Commissioner being made an autocrat. I am quite willing to let the clause, stay as it is, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> wishes to leave the Commissioner as an autocrat. </para>

                    <para>. - The taxpayer is given the right of appeal under Parts 4, 5, and 6. I was not complaining so much of the Commissioner being an autocrat when the taxpayer has the right of appeal, but I was complaining that the Commissioner might be an autocrat when the taxpayer had no right of appeal. He has no right of appeal in any other part of the ' Bill than Parts 4, 5, and 6. As this is the beginning of Part 4, I have no doubt the taxpayer under this clause, if he feels that an injustice is being inflicted upon him by the Commissioner, will exercise his right, particularly if the Board of Referees sits near his place of business. What I said applies also to sub-clause 3, and if the Government will expand subclause 3 I do not think there can be much harm in whatever we do to sub-clause 2. </para>

                    <para>. - The clause covers no less than five pages of the Bill. I dare say that the measure has been largely lifted from similar Acts in other Dominions, or from the Imperial Act. Whether that <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> so or not, a clause covering five pages with practically no marginal notes, in a financial measure is too much of a good thing. Our drafting officers, who I am sure possess ability, could do very much better if they addressed themselves to drafting measures in simpler language, with shorter and less involved clauses, and fuller marginal notes, than if they simply lifted clauses of this description from other Acts. That is all very well for legal men, whose business it is to consider Acts of this kind, and to whom legal phraseology presents no difficulties. I suppose the clause presents elements of clarity to ' them, but it does not present them to me. This measure will occupy the attention of the commercial community, and give them the responsibility of doing a great deal in. the way of personal construction of its provisions. Tq have a clause covering five pages is to make confusion worse confounded. I trust that in future, particularly in financial measures, something will be done to secure shorter clauses, ' fuller marginal notes, and greater directness and clarity. </para>

A most important point crops u.n in connexion with the administration of the Bill under the income tax regulations. If a firm makes a loss in one year and a profit in another, that loss cannot, under the income tax schedule, be deducted from the profit. If a man lost, £5,000 last year, and made £5,000 this year, he would have to pay income tax on the £5,000 this year, irrespective of the debit to the profit and loss account in the previous year. </para>

                        <para>- I intended to bring the matter up under clause 10, but was not quick enough. As the income tax is mentioned in this clause, and the matter is important, I submit that the Committee should have very wide latitude in discussing it. Another question is : Can cumulative losses made during the three pre-war years be deducted before any tax is payable in the three war years ? </para>

Reading the sub-clause in conjunction with the income tax schedule, I am driven to the conclusion that these deductions have been allowed in order to provide for some of the anomalies that will arise under the Bill.

                    <para>. - With every desire to furnish the honorable senator with as much information as possible, I cannot see why, in a Bill of this kind, such an allowance as he suggests should be made. Before the tax can become operative, a deduction must be made of the pre-war standard of profits. The honorable senator now suggests that we should make some other allowance. Let us assume that a man's pre-war standard of profits is £10,000 a year, and that he is now making £12,000 a year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> says, in effect, " I wish to take from that £12,000 some deduction which was not allowed in respect of the £10,000." The result might be to reduce the £12,000 to the pre-war standard of profits, and the individual would thus escape taxation. The honorable senator cannot fairly ask the Government to do that. Upon whatever method the pre-war standard of profits is calculated, the war-time standard of profits must also be calculated, otherwise the Treasury would lose amounts that should find their way into it. </para>

                        <para>- But that is not the point. As the Vice-President of the Executive Council has given a specific illustration, I propose to give another. Let us suppose that a man has a capital of £10,000, and that he borrows another £10,000 from a bank. Let us assume that he is in leasehold premises, and has £10,000 worth of machinery. Under this Bill, if he makes a war-time profit of £4,000, he will pay nearly £2,000 to the Government, another £1,000 for extra depreciation on his machinery and leasehold, and will be left with only £1,000 for himself. Thus the Bill will take, not only 75 per cent. of his excess profits, but will rob him in the direction of administration. </para>

The provision of the Bill is that a deduction shall be allowed in the case of a business which uses leasehold property and upon which the lessee has covenanted with the lessor to expend money on improvements which will revert to the lessor upon the termination of the lease, but now the honorable senator proposes that where the lessor, that is, the owner of the leased property, spends money upon its improvement, the tenant carrying on the business on that property shall get a deduction in respect of that expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator, by his amendment, is raising the same point as that he argued a little time ago. If the lessee spent £1,000 on the leasehold property under his covenant with the lessor, he would get the benefit of 10 per cent, on that added to his prewar standard of profit. That is a fair and reasonable concession, but now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> says that we should make a similar allowance where the lessee takes that expenditure upon himself. The lessee cannot have it both ways; if we are to give him the deduction which is proposed, we should strike out the provision which enables him to make up his pre-war standard, on the assumption that the same expenditure occurred before. </para>

                        <para>- I do not mind what it says; I am dealing with what this Bill says. In order to determine the taxable amount, we have to take a man's pre-war income and his war-time income, and the only fair way in which we can determine the difference between them is to calculate both on the same basis. If a man has invested £10,000 prior to the war, and spends, in the way <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> suggested, £1,000 in the improvement of his leased premises, that makes £11,000. If we take the profit on £11,000 against the profit on £10,000, we shall not arrive at what we are trying to arrive at, and that is, what was a fair profit during the two periods ? Tn this case, although the capital was £10,000 before the war, and £11,000 afterwards, the pre-war capital is inflated by adding the additional £1,000. and on that the owner of the business is allowed 10 per cent. Having done that, we inflate the pre-war standard of capital for the purpose of reducing the amount of difference between the pre-war standard of profits and the profits made during war time. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> succeeds in carrying his amendment, the only fair thing to do will be to deprive the owner of the business of the concession which he is given under another clause of the Bill, which enables him to inflate the pre-war standard itself. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. Let me give the Committee an illustration to show how this clause would work : Suppose a catering firm take a ten years' lease of a shop in the city, and spend on' that shop £1,000 for improvements, in order to facilitate their business. According to all the cardinal principles of business, their amortization fund for that expenditure for that period of lease should be £100 a year. There is no covenant with the owner of the property in connexion with the expenditure of this money. The Income Tax Commissioner will not allow them to deduct it from their profits unless there is a covenant with the lessor, and this Bill does not allow them to deduct it from their profits. It is not capital, but has to be expended out of the current year's profits." I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> whether his illustrations provided for that? I do not think they do. I am asking that, in a case of that sort, where the lessee is spending money, he should be covered under this Bill by a fair deduction for his expenditure, just the same as if he had covenanted with his landlord before he went into the leased premises. </para>

                        <para>- That is exactly what they would get under this Bill. I take the case of a firm with a pre-war capital of £10,000. Upon that they are allowed for their standard 10 per cent., which is £1,000.' After the war, still with the same capital in the business, they invest £1,000 in improvements in the way referred to by the honorable senator. That makes £11,000 capital they have involved. What the Bill says is that in order to determine the difference between pre-war profits and war-time profits, we have to assume that the same amount of capital was employed in both periods, and, therefore, the £1,000 spent on improvements, although it was not spent in the pre-war period, is added to the capital for the purpose of calculating the pre-war capital, which brings it to £11,000. Ten per cent. on that is £1,100, and, although the taxpayer would be only entitled to £1,000 on his pre-war capital, he is given the concession of 10 per cent, on the £11,000, and so has the deduction of £100 a year additional, which actually provides for the sinking fund which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> contends should be provided for. </para>

                <para class="block">This seems to me a very narrow wording. It might be construed that if the owner did not devote the whole of his time to the business he would not be entitled to the exemption.

                    <para>. - I cannot accept the amendment. The honorable senator must remember that the purpose of the provision is to make a further concession to the taxpayer. It says that where the owner of a business devotes his time to it he shall be allowed as a deduction a fair amount in respect of what is assumed to be the value of his services- But if we are going to depart from that principle, and say that if the owner spends a portion of his time there we shall need a detective in his office all the while to ascertain how much time he does devote to the business. T ask the honorable senator not to press the amendment. </para>
