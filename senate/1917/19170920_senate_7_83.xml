            <para>With reference to the representations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> in the Senate on 17th August regarding the censorship of an article on the Dardanelles, I have ascertained, on inquiry, that the article in question was not submitted to the Censor by the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> and that it would have been prevented publication had this been done. The publication of this article in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> and another Sydney paper was prohibited, so that the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> appears to have been the only paper in Australia in which this matter was published, and in this case only because it was not submitted to the Censor. </para>

              <para>- It is with no sense of pleasure that I have taken this step. I recognise, that an honorable senator who attempts to address himself to any international complications arising at a time like this stands upon very slippery ground. For months past I have been trying to induce the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jensen)</inline> and the Government to do the right thing to one of our Allies in a matter of trade, but, all efforts having failed, I now direct public attention to a real grievance which American business men have against the Government and the people of Australia. &#34;When the United States of America was not an Ally the British Government waspressed, and, finding it difficult to obtain explosives, requested the Australian Government to prohibit the importation of soap from other countries, in order that Great Britain might obtain the whole of the glycerine, which is a by-product of soap. The Government of which I was a member very readily acceded to the request, and immediately the Minister for Trade and Customs, not under the &#34;War Precautions Act, but under the powers he possesses, ^prohibited the importation of soap from countries ..other than Great Britain. Shortly afterwards Great Britain requested the Australian Government to permit France, Italy, and other Alliesto send their soap to Australia. The Commonwealth Government again very readily acquiesced in the request, and the prohibition was altered so that the whole of the Allies were permitted to send their soap to Australia. That arrangement continued, and under these conditions there could not be any very serious complaint as to the Australian Government, acting: in the interests of the Allies and the Empire, securing to the Allies the whole of the glycerine to be used for i the manufacture of explosives. About five months ago America Became an Ally, and from that time to the present the Australian Government have refused to put that country on the same business plane as our other Allies. I ask honorable senators: .Can that kind of thing be allowed to continue ? Here is &#38; most powerful Ally, which came in at a critical period, and if nothing else were done by America than to .give the financial assistance which it has rendered, I venture to say that we cannot calculate the immeasurable benefit which her entrance into the war on our side has been. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I am not bringing up this grievance to gain a personal advantage from the Government, but to direct public attention to what is really a very grave menace to the business relations between America and Australia. I do not think that our friendly relations with America are likely to be severed by reason of our harassing American business concerns and business people here. But we have to recollect that there are in our midst many American businesses, which have&#39; been conducting very successful trading operations between the people of the United States and. those of Australia. The particular trade to which I desire to refer is that of American fancy soaps - Colgate&#39;s, for example. Realizing that their trade in these articles is being displaced owing to the invidious distinction that is being made between the treatment accorded to such Allies as France, Japan, and Italy and the treatment that is accorded to America, these business men have approached their Consul in Sydney and have urged that they should be placed in a position of equality with those nations. Why the Government persist in the attitude which they have taken up&#39; I hope that the Minister will, be able to explain. </para>
          <para>Of course, some honorable senators may inquire, &#34; Cannot Australia manufacture sufficient soap for her own requirements, and thus prohibit its importation altogether?&#34; That would be a perfectly logical position to take up if we did not desire to draw any of our supplies from outside sources. But there is no logic in permitting France, Japan, and Italy to send supplies of soap here whilst prohibiting the importation  of American soaps, especially when America is our most powerful Ally. I press upon the attention of honorable senators the absolute, justice of the American claim, that that country should be treated equally generously with our other Allies. </para>
          <para>The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> has kindly placed at my disposal the papers in connexion with this case, and I have gone carefully through them. But they do not disclose any valid reason why the embargo upon American fancy soaps should not be removed. </para>

              <para>- By means of a regulation issued by the Minister for Trade and Customs. It appears that American soap supplies have been excluded because England is anxious to secure glycerine for her own benefit and that of her Allies. Up to the present time America has been our Ally for more than five months. Yet nothing has been done in the way of remedying this gross injustice. Even in little things I submit that we ought not to give offence to a friendly Ally, whose services will prove of the greatest value to us. I have not acted hurriedly in this matter. Week after week I have been urging that the right thing should be done. Had my request been acceded to, I. -would not have given the publicity to this question which I am giving to it now. </para>

            <para>. - Icongratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> upon the spirit in which he has discussed this question, and I hope that we shall not reduce it to the level of &#39;a question as between rival soap manufacturers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has stated certain facts connected with the matter, but he has not quite completed the story. The position is that in June, 1916, we received a request from the British Government that the importation of soaps from America should be prohibited. This is really not a soap question at all. The truth is that in the manufacture of soap glycerine is produced. Glycerine is essential to the production of munitions, with the result that, so far as it is possible to obtain a monopoly of the glycerine production of the Empire, it is desired to secure that monopoly. To obtain this glycerine it is necessary to make as much soap as possible. In the manufacture of cordite, Great Britain, . Italy, and Japan use glycerine compounds. But the United States use nitro-cellulose compounds, into the manufacture of which glycerine does not enter. Glycerine is &#39;therefore an essential commodity in the case of the Empire, Italy, and Japan. Although France does not herself use glycerine in the manufacture of munitions, she gives to the British Government all the supplies that are obtained within her own borders. Consequently our action does not in any way conflict with the war needs of America. If the United States Government thought that we were doing something opposed to the best interests of that nation, I venture to say that it would communicate with us within a period of twenty-four hours. But no such communication has been received. While the embargo upon fancy soaps may disastrously affect certain business men in this country, it does not injuriously affect America. America, though not a full Ally- </para>

          <para>The Commonwealth Government have only one desire, namely, to work hand in glove with the Government of the United States of America. We all appreciate the action of that country in entering the present war, and we all anticipate that, as a result of her action, we shall be assisted to a speedy victory. But at this distance from the theatre of conflict we cannot possibly hope to conduct war operations successfully. The most we can do, therefore, is to cooperate with the British Government and, as far as possible, accede to all their requests on matters affecting the conduct of this great struggle. Surely the question of the supply of the raw materials necessary for the manufacture of munitions in that country is not merely one of the most important, but the most important question connected with the war. I repeat that we are not able to accurately judge of the situation here, but; at the request of the Imperial Government!, we have taken certain action that has been deemed necessary to enable us to prosecute the war to a successful issue. </para>

              <para>- No. The American Government have declined to fix the price of glycerine within reasonable limits. The price of glycerine in the United States of America is &#163;260 per ton, whilst the Imperial Government are able to secure glycerine from the other Allied countries at a fixed price of &#163;87 per ton. In view of the enormous quantity of glycerine used, honorable senators will realize the importance of that difference in . price. </para>

          <para>I do not wish to discuss the merits of the question, but as we are not engaged in the manufacture of munitions, or in the direction of. the war, the least we can do is to loyally accept the decisions of the Imperial Government and act in &#39; accordance with their advice, unless we are clearly convinced that to follow that advice would be to injure our own country, and would be detrimental to the success of the Allies in the war. We are not convinced of that, and I- therefore ask honorable senators before they vote upon the motion to recognise that to lift the embargo upon the importation of American soap would be to interfere with the conduct of the war by the Imperial authorities. I am satisfied that the Australian people in their loyalty to the Empire will not ignore the advice of the British Government, and will not do anything which might interfere with the production of munitions of war by Great Britain. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> has given the Senate some information which we were not in possession of before he spoke. But I noticed that the cablegram from the Imperial Government which he quoted was dated 12th May of this year, which was practically four months ago. In the circumstances, it might be wise for the Commonwealth , Government to make further representations to the Imperial authorities in connexion with this matter. The 12th May, 1917, was just shortly after the entry of America into the present world struggle. Many things may have occurred since that time, and the Imperial Government may &#39; have changed their mind on this question. If further representations were made to them it is possible that a different reply would now be received. I realize that the question under discussion is not the country from which the best soap is imported. It is true that America refrained from joining in the struggle for a considerable period after the commencement of the war, but as soon- as she did determine to take a hand in the matter in true American fashion she did so whole-heartedly. The Minister mentioned that whilst the price of glycerine in America was &#163;260 per ton, the Imperial Government can secure it from the other Allies at &#163;87 per ton, but since the receipt of the cablegram from the Imperial Government there may have been an alteration in the price quoted in America. It is not reasonable to think that our great and powerful Ally would do anything to prevent the manufacture of munitions necessary for the conduct of the war. It cannot be suggested that, by making further, representations on this question to the Imperial Government, we would in any way be interfer-. ing with their conduct of the war, Australia is one of the Allies, we are taking our part in the war, and we are agreed that the Imperial Government should be our guide in the conduct of the war. But there isa long time between the 12th May and 20th September, and I suggest that it would now be wise to make further representations in connexion with this matter. </para>

              <para>- They might do so, but perhaps they have so many things to think of that this matter may have escaped their attention. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> has said that if it was considered in America that the embargo placed any indignity upon that country, the Government of &#39; the United States of America would have made representations in connexion with the matter. I think that in a friendly spirit we ought, in such a case, to take the initiative ourselves. I cannot understand why this powerful Ally should, in connexion with a trivial business matter, be treated in such a way. Having listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> in reply, I have only to say that if nothing further follows from the action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> the debate may impress upon the Government the necessity of making further representations to the Imperial Government to discover whether they are to-day of the same opinion as they were oh the 12th May, when the cablegram which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> has quoted was despatched. </para>

            <para>. - One phase of this matter has not so far been touched upon. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> gave what was apparently a sound reason for the refusal to lift the embargo upon the importation of American soap, when he mentioned the difference in the price of glycerine supplied from America as compared with that supplied from the other Allied countries. I point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> specifically referred to fancy soaps, and in normal times, or at the present, we do not import any large quantity of these soaps exclusively from America. Prior to the war, there were considerable importations of these soaps from Germany, and since the war they have been imported from other countries. </para>

              <para>- The question of the equitable treatment of America as one of the Allies is involved. I am concerned at present 1,0 point out that the admission of these fancy soaps from America, in view of the relatively small quantity that would be imported, could scarcely affect the supply of glycerine to the extent suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell.</inline> The quantity of glycerine produced in Australia, as the result of the prohibition of the importation of these American fancy soaps would be insignificant. Though, perhaps, quite unintentionally, it seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> exaggerated the effect which the lifting of the; embargo would have upon the prosecution of the war. Some honorable senators, may ask if that be so, why should the Imperial authorities suggest the prohibition, of the importation of American fancy soaps, and in answer to that I submit that this would perhaps be one of a thousand other similar questions dealt with, and: these soaps were not singled out for special treatment because it was believed, that .their importation would have any material effect upon the supply of glycerine. </para>

I therefore venture to assert that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> presented an exaggerated view of the situation. </para>

              <para>- The people outside, without some better explanation than has been given, will find it difficult to understand why this invidious distinction has been drawn between our Allies. What appeals to me most strongly, as I have frequently said in dealing with the question, are the conditions under which soap and other articles imported into Australia are manufactured in the countries from which they are imported. I* is because of those conditions that I am anxious to prevent their importation by a Tariff barrier. </para>

            <para>. - It is probable that the general public will read an abbreviated account of the discussion on this matter in the newspapers, and as they will not be given the details, they will no doubt come to the conclusion that some unfair discrimination is being made between the Allies, in view of the f,act that the importation of fancy soaps into Australia is permitted from France, Italy, and Japan, but is prohibited so far as America is concerned. Necessarily the people will not get all the information which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> g&#163;.ve the Senate this afternoon, and which he thinks was sufficient to justify the Government in placing an embargo on the importation of- soap from America. I am sure it is not the wish of the Australian people that any unfair discrimination should be made. America is a valuable ally in this gre,at conflict, and I am quite sure that her friendly feeling towards Australia has increased very rapidly- since she entered into this war on our side. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has pointed out, this embargo might constitute merely a pin-prick, but the mere fact that the question has been raised is aoa indication that some American people; at all events, think unfair treatment is being meted out to them. The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> would do well to give honorable senators an assurance that further representations will be made to the Imperial authorities in order to ascertain if there is still an objection to the importation of fancy soaps from America, as was the case <inline font-style="italic">p.</inline> few months ago when the embargo was placed upon this article of manufacture. </para>

I am satisfied that America is adopting all the latest scientific means for the production of explosives. The very fact that the communication came from the British Government on 12th May is a proof that the Government are not bothering very much. The humblest American citizen transacting business in this country has a right to expect that his grievances shall receive respectful consideration by this Government. I have no other interest in this matter than that Australia shall stand well with America, and that the action of our Government will not leave an impression in the minds of American business men that they are being treated unfairly. </para>

        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(a)">
            <para>Bounty for five years from 1st January, 1913, not exceeding &#163;5,000 per annum on rock phosphate manufactured into merchantable phosphatic manure at the rate of 10 per cent, of the market value; </para>

          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">A bounty was also offered for the production of wood pulp for paper-making, but that is not being renewed. Nothing has yet been collected, and no claims have been made under the Bill of 1912, but the Bill renews the offer of the bounty on rock phosphate for another five years, in the hope that a discovery of considerable importance to Australia may be made. It was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor,</inline> the Minister who introduced the Bill of 1912, that the South Australian phosphates are of low value compared with the Ocean Island phosphates, and that it is necessary to mix a proportion of the imported rock with the locally-produced rock. There have been suggestions of possibilities of discovering phosphatic rock in many States, but so far nothing of a really practical&#39; character has been accomplished. At Mansfield, in Victoria, a company has been endeavouring during the last four years to develop phosphate deposits. They have not succeeded in securing a really marketable article, but I believe that the development works are disclosing much larger beds of rock than were originally believed to exist, and there is a reasonable hope of ultimate success in that district. </para>
        <para>The importance of this matter to Australia is shown by the following figures of importations of rock phosphates for the purpose of manufacturing superphosphates : - </para>
        <para class="block">The principal sources of supply are Christmas Island, Ocean Island, Caroline Islands, Tahiti, South Sea Islands, Makatea Island, Pleasant Island, and Society Island. From those places rock phosphate, to a total value of &#163;440,300, came to Australia in 1915-16. These figures show that the industry is very important, and the Government consider that the offer of a reward of &#163;1,000 for the discovery of a vein or deposit should be very stimulating to prospectors. </para>
        <para>The total possible expenditure under the extension proposed by the Bill will be &#163;50,000 during a period of five years, commencing on the 1st January, 1918. I must say that that is not. only possible, but probable, and we all hope that the whole of the money will be collected. The . sum is payable as follows : - </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(a)">
            <para>Bounty at the rate of 10 per cent, on the market value of rock phosphate produced under the conditions of the Bill, and at the maximum amount of &#163;5,000, to be paid in any one year, and </para>

              <item label="(6)">
                <para>The maximum amount which may be also paid in any one year, by way of reward for the discovery of any deposits or veins suitable for making phosphatic manure. </para>

            </list>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>The matter is of considerable importance &#39;to the farmers of Australia, as it is estimated that the discovery and opening tip of fresh deposits of rock phosphates in payable quantities will have the effect of considerably reducing the price of superphosphates, which is now &#163;5 per ton. To show the importance of the industry to this country, we have had to take some of our own Commonwealth steamers, belonging to what is known as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline></para>
        <para class="block">Fleet, off the work of carrying wheat to the Allies, who are wanting foodstuffs, in order to bring this manure here to enable us to grow our own products. Honorable senators can realize what an early development of phosphatic deposits in payable quantities would mean to a country like Australia. </para>

            <para>- If we had to grow forests or erect mills to produce conveyancing paper, I am afraid it would not be a commercial success. The principal wood used for making pulp for paper is spruce, which is grow.n successfully on uplands at least 5,000 feet above sea-level, where they are practically covered for half the year in snow. Newfoundland and Vancouver produce spruce, but we have no such forests here, and our timber has been generally given up as a hopeless proposition, so far as papermaking is concerned. . The bounty for wood pulp was offered for five years and not claimed, but if there is hope of any reasonable development, I am sure the Government will be only too ready to respond. </para>

            <para>- I have samples in my possession now of the pulp manufactured by him. Subsequently the Tasmanian Government brought an expert from Canada, but his experiments were by no means exhaustive. The English chemist told me that they were by no means as exhaustive as he would have desired. The samples of pulp made by the English chemist were made out of ti-tree scrub, blackwood sawdust, and the woods of various Australian timbers. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> will have seen a sample of the pulp and paper. </para>

            <para>- Paper was made out of Tasmanian blue-gum and sent from the Old Country by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McColl, Agent-General for Tasmania. This English chemist - I do not know that I would be quite justified in using his name - is by no means a theorist. He is a man with a full And technical knowledgeof all branches of several manufacturing industries. Andas regards the application of chemistry in a practical way, he is engaged in investigating a process for the electrolytic deposition of zinc. I have obtained from him, as lately as some time during the last few weeks, certain samples which he told me were the result of a. complete and satisfactory installation of the process. At the same time he handed to me, made out of sawdust, something which had the appearance of linoleum. It was noninflammable, notwithstanding the fact that it had been made out of sawdust. It was actually plastic before it was properly set. This gentleman told me that he anticipated that it could be pumped over the floors of buildings, and would make a covering superior to anything in the way of linoleum. This development of his in regard to the utilization of sawdust is quite recent. If I had had any knowledge when I was leaving Tasmania that the subject was to come up for discussion I would have brought with me samples of material made out of sawdust which this gentleman gave me as recently as three weeks ago. </para>

        <para>The Minister is right, I suppose, when he says that although the opportunity has been given for some time for the earning of a bounty by the manufacture of wood pulp, no bounty has been claimed, and no manufacture of wood pulp has been established. Now, these things are not done in a day. I venture to say that many of the scrubs which now encumber Australia, and make the work of opening up the country so difficult to the farmer, will yet havea positive industrial value. A time will come when, instead of it costing &#163;8, or &#163;10, or &#163;12 an acre to clear land, companies will be willing to pay the owner a price per acre for the privilege of utilizing the scrubs which now are a deterrent to settlement. </para>
        <para>Most honorable senators have had in  their possession a pamphlet circulated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hagelthorn,</inline> a member of the Victorian Government, who sent a copy to me. I noticed that it had a covering letter in which he said that he was so struck with the substance of the pamphlet that he deemed it desirable to send a copy practically to every public man in the Commonwealth. It set forth an address given by a gentleman who is known as the adviser to the American Institute of Bankers. The substance of the address largely consisted in a statement that this adviser declared that we would have to reviseall our ideas in connexion with the war. He said that before the war it was erroneously anticipated that there would be such a rapid exhaustion of the resources of all countries that no great war in the future would be likely to last for more than a few months. But he pointed out that, given the ability, given the energy, and given the existence of certain resources in any country, nothing could bring it to its knees but the complete exhaustion of its man power, and thosepeople who went about preaching that the world would be very much poorer as a result of the war, failed to take- into consideration the great discoveries made along the line of chemical investigation. I was very much struck by one phrase in which the adviser to the Institute of Bankers said that our present knowledge of chemistry as applied to industry, comparable with what we might attain in the immediate future, was as a cup of water compared with &#39;the area of Lake Michigan. He had no doubt - this hardheaded man and adviser to the Institute of Bankers - that the application of chemistry to industry would repair the ravages of the war, and add greatly to the wealth of the world in a fashion which we at present did not dream of. </para>
        <para>I expect that use will be made of many at present useless shrubs, useless scrubs, and useless woods in Australia for the manufacture of wood pulp. In this industry, a good deal depends on the fibre. It appears that certain Australian woods do not give the pulp a sufficiently lengthy fibre, but that may be got over. Asbestos at one time had very little use unless it was of comparatively lengthy fibre; but very short-fibred asbestos has of late years attained very considerable commercial value, and has been utilized in ways which were not thought of fifteen or twenty years ago. Knowing that paper can be made out of our scrubes, knowing that the science of making pulp out of woods is a progressive one, I venture to say that the taking away of the &#39;bounty, although not with any sinister intent, is a retrograde step. </para>

        <para>The greatest difficulty is experienced by newspaper proprietors in procuring paper for printing purposes. I mentioned this matter an evening or two ago when we were discussing the question of freights. Many newspaper proprietors in Australia have had to raise the prices of their publications simply because of the difficulty of getting printing paper from America. And, beyond all doubt, so rapid is the consumption of spruce,  which is the timber <inline font-style="italic">par excellence</inline> in regard to the manufacture of wood pulp, that if we are going to continue to utilize paper at the rate we have been doing some other sources of paper-making must be discovered. All the energies of chemists must be devoted to&#39; manufacturing a wood pulp from something else than spruce, for it will not last for ever. The spruce areas in . America iare devastated to this extent I believe: that it takes several acres to provide for a single issue of one of the big newspapers of New York. I have read that statement in American magazines. Allowing for a little exaggeration, there is no doubt that there is an element of truth in the statement. I believe that in Norway they are attempting the planting of spruce, but it has not been very successful. It is very much like the pines of Tasmania. </para>

It would have been wiser, I think, if that course had been adopted, for the reasons which have been very ably stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap.</inline> For years past many persons in Australia have thought that we might perhaps be able to produce from our Australian timbers wood pulp suitable for the manufacture of paper. </para>

Whilst that expert&#39;s investigation may not have demonstrated that scientific research has proceeded sufficiently far to enable Australian timbers to be used in the manufacture of wood pulp, we know it is making very rapid strides. Now, although Australia generally cannot oe regarded as a mountainous country, there are portions of it which are densely timbered at altitudes ranging up to several thousand feet above sea-level. If, as has been stated, spruce has been found to be more useful in the manufacture of wood pulp than any other timber, and if its superiority is due to the altitude at which it is grown- </para>

            <para>- I do not think that that is a bar in regard to Australian timber, because there are many portions of this continent which are heavily timbered with different varieties of timbers at an altitude of a couple of thousand feet. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has already pointed out that the spruce areas in America are being drawn upon very rapidly, and that it requires acres of spruce to supply sufficient paper for a single issue of a &#39; New York daily newspaper. It is manifest, therefore, that some substitute for spruce must be found. It will be a splendid thing for the Commonwealth if the paper used in Australia could be manufactured at&#39; relatively the same cost as it can be produced in Canada and America. Consequently it is a pity that the Government have not seen fit to continue the bounty for the manufacture of wood pulp. However, we have the assurance of the Honorary Minister that if scientific research evidences that we can make strides in that direction, the Government will bring forward a measure to re-enact that bounty. But I fear that the withdrawal of the bounty at present may cause some of our scientific chemists to abandon their investigations. I believe that the continuance of the bounty would have had the effect of stimulating scientific research in this direction. It would be a splendid thing for Australia if it&#39; could be demonstrated that some of our native timbers are suitable for the production of wood pulp. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to point out that, although the bounty on the production of wood pulphas been dropped, there has never been any attempt made to collect it. At present the Government are making practical field tests in connexion with the production of rock phosphates. We. have really diverted the bounty which has been payable on the production of wood pulp into another channel, and we are now spending that money upon the Science Bureau. That Bureau is not only making practical tests with grasses, rushes, and even with banana skins, but is also co-operating with America in this matter. The subject is not being neglected, and if any discovery be made which is likely to prove useful in the establishment of the industry, the Government&#39; will at once bring forward a proposal to restore the bounty upon wood pulp. </para>

            <para>- Only a few minutes ago I was called out of the chamber, and was informed by a gentleman who has himself manufactured wood pulp out of ti-tree grown on the shores of Port Phillip that last-year the Department of Chemistry in South Australia published a most valuable paper dealing with the manufacture of paper pulp from Australian grasses and woods. He further stated that it has been established beyond doubt that if the industry be embarked upon in a large way, wood pulp can be produced upon profitable lines within the Commonwealth. A minute or two devoted to the consideration of this phase of the matter may not be amiss. With regard to spruce, which- is the timber from which nearly all the paper used for printing purposes is made, let me inform the Committee that the discovery of the suitability of spruce for the manufacture of wood pulp was due to the accidental observation by a workman in Saxony of the way in which certain insects made pulp out of wood. The vast industry, for vast it is, of the manufacture of wood pulp owes its genesis to the fact that a workman in Saxony going to his daily employment, picked, up a wasp&#39;s nest, and found that in that part of Germany the wasps used pulp which they manufactured from wood to make their nests. </para>

            <para>- Quite so. Under the principal Act provision is made for the payment of bounty to the extent of &#163;5,000 per annum for five years from January, 1913, to January, 1918, on wood pulp and rock phosphates. If this Bill is carried in its present form, the provision for the bounty on wood pulp will continue to operate for the remainder of this year,  and will then cease, whilst the provision for the bounty on rock phosphates will be continued for another five years. I hope that I will be permitted to test the opinion of the Committee on this matter. </para>

            <para>- Quite a number of persons are still experimenting, and are hopeful that printing paper may be successfully manufactured from the pulp of the shorter-fibred timbers. The timbers used in Canada and America for the purpose differ in character from the native timbers of Australia. I have every hope that science will overcome our difficulties, and that we shall be able to successfully;  manufacture printing paper from our timbers. From the pulp of Tasmanian timbers papers of the finer qualities for books have been manufactured. </para>

            <para>- But it would only cost &#163;50 to collect the bonus. There are dozens of different varieties of grass, as well as bracken fern, which may be used in the manufacture of paper; but, so far, this has not been demonstrated to be possible on a commercial scale. Unfortunately, Australian timber contains too much resinous matter for the machinery to treat it as rapidly as spruce, which Contains practically no resinous matter at all. We are, however, subsidizing experiments now being conducted under the auspices of the Science Bureau, with the object of extracting the restrictive proper ties in Australian timbers, and I can give honorable senators the assurance that immediately a favorable report has been received the Government will be prepared to do something in this matter. </para>

If we do as the honorable senator suggests, the money will be ear-marked, and the critics will have ground for objection to an imaginary expenditure of &#163;5,000 for wood pulp which there is no opportunity of producing. </para>

        <para class="block">We made certain amendments in the principal Act when the Bill was before us, and the House of Representatives&#39; amendments have been put in for the purpose of better draftsmanship. They do not effect any alteration in the Bill as it left this Chamber. Honorable senators will remember that during my second-reading speech I said that the Bill was to be retrospective in regard to certain matters in order to validate certain things that have been done in connexion with the war. The Crown -Law officers assured me that this matter was fully provided for in the Bill, but I raised a doubt myself as to whether it was. In order to overcome all doubt in regard to this clause, which is a validating clause, sub-clause 2 was inserted by the House of Representatives to provide that the clause shall be  deemed to have commenced from the 1st day of August, 1914. This was necessary, because this clause deals with the constitution of the Defence Forces. Owing to the outbreak of &#39; war, certain things had to be done to constitute our Defence Forces, and it became necessary to validate such action. These amendments, so far as <inline font-style="italic">(a), (b),</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">(c)</inline> are concerned, are an alteration of the verbiage ; as far as sub-clause 2 is concerned they make it perfectly clear that it dates from the commencement of the war. </para>

The condition that occurred then may occur again, because then it was absolutely impossible for the Department, with a great many of its officers overseas, or engaged in training troops to go overseas, to carry on the training of the local Citizen Forces, and this was therefore suspended for the time being.

          <para>. - This gives me the opportunity of bringing before the Minister a grave injustice which the Defence Department perpetrated on trainees under the compulsory draining provisions in New South Wales. Here is a definite case of which I can supply details to the Minister if he wants them. A young man employed in the Telegraph Department as a messenger found that his drills as a senior cadet were suspended, and when the year expired he had not put in a sufficient number of drills, and was proceeded against. There were two boys in the office, and only one could get away at a time. It fell to his lot to stay, and he could not put in his drills. He could have made up the arrears in nine months, but he could not put in sufficient in six months, owing to the suspension of the training, so he was short by seventeen hours.-  Although the Defence Department knew he had been detained by the Telegraph Department, they took him before the Court, and he was given seven days&#39; detention at North or South Head. *I investigated this case personally to see if such a gross injustice could not be met by giving him an opportunity of attending at the barracks in the mornings, as he was willing to do, but he had to serve his seven days, which he did uncomplainingly. I hope this amendment will , prevent the repetition of that sort of treatment. He had to ride from his home to the Court, and had to go straight from the Court to the place of military detention, not being allowed even to ride back to his home to tell his parents what had happened. </para>

          <para>. - A big injustice is being done under the present system to naval cadets - boys who go to sea and cannot attend the Saturday afternoon or evening drills. A number of cases were heard at Port Adelaide recently, when the boys were heavily fined, although the magistrate said it was one of the greatest cases of hardship he had ever come across in his life. One boy was, employed in the trade between Brisbane and Fremantle. The Defence Department suggested that he might do his drill at any port in Australia, but his ship was never in port more than one night, and never on a Saturday. The only way he could possibly put in his drill was to give up his employment and stop ashore, losing his wages. Yet he was penalized by a heavy fine. Cannot the Minister do something to prevent this treatment of boys earning their livelihood ? In some of the cases brought before the Court the boys were assisting to maintain their parents. Cannot something like the Imperial Naval Reserve regulations be adopted, by which the boys are allowed to take a month ashore and put in their, month&#39;s drill all at once, while still retaining their positions on their ships ? If a boy has to leave his ship, he has no chance of further employment for a considerable time. </para>

It is just possible that the lad himself was to blame, because the cadet training was suspended for only half the year, and if he found that his departmental duties did not allow him to put in the full amount of his drills, he could have applied for leave. If he could make out a good case, this should certainly have been granted to him, as has been done in quite a number of cases. </para>

          <para>. - A similar case to that mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> came under my notice in Brisbane, and when the Minister was speaking on the second reading I made an interjection i about it. The boy was employed at the Telegraph Office, Brisbane. Sometimes he finished his late delivery round after 11 o&#39;clock, and it would be 12 before he reached home. He fell into arrears with his drill, and the only way he could make up the deficiency was to rise early in the morning, after getting home at 12 at night, and go to town. He was given that opportunity, but his father would not allow him to go. A prosecution was begun against the boy, but when the father explained the circumstances to the magistrate, the Defence authorities did not proceed with the case. The boy had to resume work about 3 in the afternoon. The father pointed out to me that, in such circumstances, private employers had given their lads opportuni. ties for making up arrears, but that privilege was denied by the Post and Tele graph authorities in Brisbane. The boy&#39;s services have since been dispensed with on. quit&#169; other grounds. I mention the case so that steps may be taken to see that the practice does not operate generally throughout the Federal Departments. I asked the Minister for an assurance on the subject during the second-reading debate and he said that the Federal Departments, like other employers, would be compelled to give the boys every facility, in such extenuating circumstances, to make up their arrears. Under such abnormal conditions, the heads of Federal Departments should be a little more lenient and considerate to their employees. </para>

I shall certainly have representations made to the Departments to see that that law is obeyed by them in the same way as weshall expect private employers to obey it. </para>

I do not think a boy who happens to be in the service of the Post and Telegraph Department should be put in a better position than any other. He cannot expect all his drills to- be done in the time of the Department; but, short of that, he should get equal treatment with a boy in a similar position in the pay of a private employer. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of the measure is to enable the transfer of a sum of &#163;825,000 to be made from the account in London, known as the London Liability Account, back to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.&#39; There is in London a considerable sum, totalling about &#163;4,000,000. It is paid in there from time to time under circumstances which I will relate. Whenever an order has been placed in London, and Parliament has appropriated the money for the purpose, the practice has been for the money to be immediately paid into the Trust Account in London ; but although the order for the goods or services was given, very many months, sometimes years, elapsed before the necessity to pay the money over arose. That is to say, the goods were not promptly delivered on the receipt of the order. Sometimes, especially in the of goods required for the Defence Department, two or three years have passed by before the order could be completed. This thing has been going on for quite a number of years, and as a result there, is an accumulation of money much above the present needs. It has, therefore, been deemed desirable, and I think that the decision will commend itself to the judgment of the Senate, to utilize some of the surplus money in London rather than resort to additional taxation. The purpose of the Bill is to sanction the transfer of a sum of &#163;822,000 back to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. That amount is not expected to be required in London this year. The other clauses of the Bill involve no questions of policy, because they have relation only to bookkeeping. They represent the result of experience by officers, and have been framed in order to make our system of account keeping, I will not say a little more accurate, but a little more workable. If honorable senators desire any information in Committee, I shall be willing to supply it; but the main purpose of the Bill is as I have explained. </para>

            <para>. - I take advantage of this opportunity to remedy an omission of which I was guilty in moving the second reading. The Bill contains another feature. Certain earnings are made by the ships owned by the Commonwealth. These moneys are paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund; but as the vessels were paid for with loan money, and stand to a separate loan account, it is quite clear that the earnings ought not to go into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. . They ought to go to an account in redemption of the overdraft which was incurred when the vessels were purchased. Obviously, it would be wrong to continue to pay the earnings into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Therefore, this clause provides that the earnings of vessels, and other small receipts, shall go in redemption of the fund which was created in order to purchase the vessels themselves. </para>

              <para>- If any fault is to be found, it must be found with the Leader of the Opposition rather than with the Leader of the Senate. Any reasonable individual must recognise that to-day&#39;s record by the Senate is a fairly good one. We have dealt with a large number of Bills, and if any questions which are now being postponed have to be discussed later in the week when, very important matters will be engaging our attention, the Government are certainly not to blame. Personally, -I think we have done a very good day&#39;s work. </para>

            <para>. - I did not know that it was necessary for the combination which forms this Government to secure the services of an apologist like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie for its want of business capacity in keeping honorable senators employed. From the very beginning of my career in this Chamber I have held the view that the Senate was an utterly useless body. It is always being asked to deal . with measures as if they came from a sausage machine. To-day&#39;s proceedings afford ample proof that the Senate has never justified its existence. If the Government had only consulted me I could have put two or three matters on the business-paper which would have fully occupied our attention for the remainder of the sitting, and I know that Seuator Bolton is waiting for an opportunity to bring forward certain important business before the session closes. </para>

We were then assured that to-morrow the session would temporarily close. </para>

A policy is the last- thing one would expect from the present Government. Even the intellect of their official whip and apologist cannot provide a policy for them. They are bereft of a policy, of system, and of anything that is of any use to Australia. It is high time that they got down to business. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that their official whip and apologist should consult with members of the Government in another place to see whether they cannot frame some policy, whereby the business of the country may be kept going, and we may win the war. </para>

The honorable senator and his friends found some virtue in the Senate then. What he really means to say to-day is that he has read the verdict of the 5th May last, and has altered his opinion. Complaints have been made as to the manner in which the Government have ordered their business, but I claim that it has been handled in a business-like way. Honorable senators do not do themselves or the Senate justice by criticism of the kind to which we have just listened. The Senate is numerically a House of only half the strength of the House of Representatives, and it is therefore inevitable that it should take less time to get through the same business. It cannot proceed with business on its own account, as all legislation must be passed by both Houses. Another good reason why measures occupy less time &#39; in the Senate is that all the more important proposals are introduced in another place, and by the time they reach the Senate their main principles have been thoroughly threshed out, public interest in them has,&#39; to some extent, been exhausted, and honorable senators have made up their minds as to what they will do with them. The result is that we do not discuss the second-reading stages of important measures at anything like the same length as is done in the House of Representatives. It is decrying the Senate unfairly to attempt to make it appear that, because we sit shorter hours, and frequently find ourselves without any business to do, that is in some way a reflection upon this Chamber. It should rather be regarded as an evidence of the capacity of the Senate to deal with its business in a business-like way. When it is said that the Government should more satisfactorily arrange their business, I remind the Senate that honorable senators in charge of private business have the same responsibility. I take no exception to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> attitude this afternoon, but I point out that if it is claimed that the Government should so arrange their business as to always have something for the Senate to do, surely an honorable senator in charge of one proposal should be prepared to go on with it when the opportunity offers. </para>

I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> will say so, but I resent the suggestion from any one that I or any other member of the Government prevented <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> or any one else from bringing on business. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> knows that there is a proper time at which to give notice of business. Unless I am told so by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> himself, I shall not believe that he has any complaint to make that any action the Government have taken has blocked him or anybody else from bringing business before the Senate. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said that the Government should so arrange business in another place that it would be coming up to the Senate in regular instalments. That is what the Government are doing, but I must disclaim all responsibility for the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> associates in another place. There is now before the House of Representatives a proposal for the amendment of the Income Tax Act, the Repatriation Bill, which the Senate has already dealt with, and a Supply Bill. The Government are proceeding with that business. They are proceeding first with the Income Tax Bill, because the Senate may consider it concurrently with the consideration of the Repatriation Bill in another place. As every one knows, Supply is invariably left to the last moment. So that there is no other order in which the Government could have arranged their business. In the circumstances, I say that the Government have not only done their best, but the best that could have been done, to secure such an allotment of the business as to keep the two branches of the Parliament reasonably occupied. Some exception might be taken to our calling the Senate together on Tuesday last, and to our sitting on Wednesday morning, but I ask honorable senators to bearin mind that we were confronted with the consideration of the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill, and no one at the time the arrangements were made would have ventured to say how long it would take to pass that Bill. Its consideration might very easily have been protracted, and if in consequence I had found it necessary to ask honorable senators to sit all night, the complaint would then have been made that the Government had not taken the proper steps to get their business through in an orderly way. I do not mind any of the things that have been said so far as they may be a reflection on myself. Although I have no exalted idea of the Senate, I deprecate the too frequent tendency to unnecessarily decry this Chamber in connexion with the part it plays under the Federal Constitution. </para>
