Although the premises are not what one would select for the examination of recruits owing to the noise and want of sunlight, there was no evidence of the place being verminous or any want of cleanliness. These officers do not consider, from a health point of view, any danger is likely to arise from the examinations being conducted there. The Principal Medical Officer has not received any complaints from the examining military officer as to its insanitary condition, but has had frequent- complaints about the noise and artificial light being difficult to examine in. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister whether it is true that a regulation has been promulgated to set aside the embargo placed upon the export of stock by Queensland legislation, and whether it is time also that, notwithstanding this regulation under the War Precautions Act, the Government of Queensland are still prohibiting the crossing of stock from Queensland to adjacent States? If this is so, what steps do the Government contemplate taking to enforce the regulation ? </para>

                    <para>. - It is not my intention to oppose this motion, in view of the knowledge which I have that a very considerable majority of honorable senators desire the opportunity, which the carrying of it will afford them. But I do wish to say that whilst the motion to which the present proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> relates, is one for the individual judgment of honorable senators, the Government regrets that an effort is to to be made to discuss it here at the present juncture. It is well known that there is timed for to-night in the Imperial Commons a discussion on this very matter. It was the view of the Government that it might be more desirable that the motion on the business-paper under the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> should be delayed until after that discussion, especially in view of the generally recognised fact that an effort is being made at Home to arrive at a solution of the problem that is involved by mutual agreement. That is all I wish to say on the motion. For the rest, the subject is one upon which no man can speak for anybody but himself. </para>

                    <para>We. Your Majesty&#39;s dutiful and loyal subjects, the members of the Senate of the Commonwealth In Parliament assembled, desire most earnestly in our name and on behalf ot the people whom we represent, to express our unswerving loyalty and devotion to Your Majesty&#39;s person and.

                    <para>In this crucial hour, when the might of your Empire is being wielded to maintain the right of self-government for small nations, we feel confident that the whole people of Ireland would be made grateful, loyal, and enthusiastic supporters of that high policy through the gracious endowment by Your Majesty of the same right to them. They ask for it through their representatives - never has request more clear, consistent, and continuous been made <inline font-style="italic">by any</inline> nation. As subjects of Your Majesty we are interested in the peace and contentment of all parts of the Empire, and we desire to see this long-standing grievance at the very heart of the Empire removed. It is our desire for the solidarity and permanence of the Empire, as a Power making for peace and civilization, that must be our excuse for submitting to Your Majesty this respectful petition. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">It is almost superfluous to attempt to add anything to the words of this motion. I am sure that all of us who have listened carefully to the debates in this chamber during the last week or two have felt the urgency of the duty that is placed upon us to do all that we possibly can, and in the most efficient way of which we are capable, to secure the establishment of a peaceful and united Empire. Whilst, as an Empire, we are engaged in a tremendous struggle to preserve to the smaller nations their right of independence, we. cannot fail to recognise that, in very close proximity to the heart of our Empire itself, there are a people whose struggles for years have been devoted to securing recognition of that very right of self-government which the Empire, as a whole, is engaged in conserving for other small nations. In this motion we dictate no terms, we make no attempt to force our opinions, or to suggest what should be done. We make a simple appeal to  His  Majesty, reminding him that there are a people within his Empire who have not yet received that measure of self-government for which they have contended for years, and which we, who sympathize with and support their contention, believe should be granted to them. Whatever may be thought by others, the present appears to me the most opportune time at which such an address should be humbly presented to  His  Majesty. We firmly believe that the aid of every human element in the Empire is necessary in the great war in which we are now engaged. So far as human effort can accomplish it, every element should be brought together for the purpose of assisting to maintain the integrity, not only of the Empire as a whole, but of the separate Dominions of  His  Majesty. It does appear to me that the shortest road to the accomplishment of this high ideal is, first of all, to concede to Ireland that measure of self-government which is the natural right of all peoples, so that peace and contentment may reign throughout , the Empire, and that harmony may be the keynote of all our efforts in the mighty struggle in which we are engaged. I do not propose to repeat the arguments I used some years ago in advocacy of a motion similar to that which I move to-day,. but I do think it well to remind honorable senators that Irishmen from almost every part of the world have flocked to the standard of the Empire in this great war, and have taken up arms in its defence. </para>

                    <para>. - I have very great pleasure in seconding the motion so _ ably moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson.</inline> As one who is Australian-born, I should like to say in a few words why I so whole-heartedly support it. We Australians have enjoyed the blessings of Home Rule during the whole of our lives. We jealously guard our rights in that regard, and zealously work for the furtherance of Democracy by virtue of the measure of Home Rule we enjoy. When this very important question was under discussion in 1905, when you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> took a very prominent part in the debate, and again in 1914, when a similar discussion took place, motions on the lines of that moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> were adopted and communicated to the Imperial Parliament. I feel sure that the opinion on those occasions expressed by the Senate will be re-affirmed on this motion. I feel sure also that the Imperial Parliament will not regard the passing of such a motion as an interference by Australia, but will look upon it in quite a different light. Any guidance that can be given to the Imperial authorities upon matters of Empire importance will, I feel sure, be heartily welcomed, especially at this time, when unity amongst the peoples of the Empire is so essential. It appears to me that the re-affirmation of this motion, passed twice previously by the Senate, will be doubly welcome at the present time to the Imperial authorities. We have every justification for remitting to them such an expression of opinion. The motion, if carried unanimously, as I hope it will be, or at least without dissent, will be regarded as an expression of opinion emanating from the higher Chamber of the National Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, which is a very important Dominion of the British Empire. I feel quite sure that the Imperial authorities would look upon an expression of opinion emanating from this high and responsible Chamber with a degree of welcome and thankfulness which, perhaps, we cannot conceive at this distance. Realizing that the desire is to get the motion put through, I have no wish to recapitulate the history of Ireland&#39;s struggle for this right of self-government, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has truly said, through so many years - may I extend the term, and say for centuries? Those of us who have read the history of the Empire in its various aspects know what Ireland has endured. There is no necessity to recapitulate the story of the self-sacrifice, or the heroism, which has characterized the fight during the past centuries, not for a privilege, but for a right. That being the situation, I commend the motion to the Senate, and sincerely trust that it will meet with a speedy and unanimous passage. </para>

                    <para>. - Motions in favour of Home&#39; Rule for Ireland have been submitted to the Senate before. Whether I was here or elsewhere, I have always supported the principle of Home Rule. I believe that Ireland long ago would have been a more contented community had the blessing of self-government been conferred upon it. I believe that it would have been a more harmonious factor in the make-up of the British Empire. To-day we are faced with the position that the Empire is at war; that the_ Parliament whose duty it is to deal with this, amongst other questions, is distracted with all the many critical problems arising out of the war. Notwithstanding that position, we find that Parliament setting apart a time for the discussion of this question. We believe that that is not merely for the purpose of having an idle, academic discussion, but for some deeper purpose than that. I believe that it is for the purpose of finding a way out of this most intricate and hitherto insoluble problem. That discussion almost synchronizes with our own. With the exception of a few  irreconcilables  - shall I say bigots - on either side, because, unfortunately, neither side has a monopoly of bigotry on its side - with that exception, I believe that all the great parties in Great Britain are honestly endeavouring to find some way which will, with the least possible friction, give Ireland what she has a right to expect. I agree with this motion with one exception. The second paragraph reads - </para>

                <para class="block">Speaking for myself only, and not for the Government, I candidly confess that I am not in a position to say that that blessing of Home Rule can be granted immediately, or that it should be granted immediately. To be able to make that statement, I would first like to be armed with the views put forward in favour of an immediate grant by those who are more directly concerned, and that is the Irish National party in the House of Commons, and, if Home Rule cannot be granted immediately, the reasons put forward in favour of that view by those who are charged with the responsibility of government in Great Britain. Let us look over the events leading up to the present position in connexion with Home Rule. A measure was passed by the British Parliament, after long years of fighting and much bitter feeling. A great war broke out upon us, and, apparently with the consent of the Irish party, the grant of Home Rule was stayed, at any rate, for -a time. Subsequently that agreement, apparently within reach, was departed from. Looking at the matter from this distance, and in the light of the scrappy information we get, we find the Irish Nationalist party, in agreeing to the deferring of Home Rule for the present, did not contemplate, as none of us contemplated, that the war was going to last for years. They probably thought that it would last only for a few months, and that, at any rate, at the outset of the war, this was a question which could not be conveniently brought forward; and they agreed, no doubt reluctantly, to a postponement of its introduction. . Later, when the war began to stretch out to an interminable length, they began again to press for an instalment of this right for the people of Ireland. Then what I believe were honest attempts were made to reconcile the factions in &#39;the British Parliament to permit of an understanding to be arrived at which would enable Home Rule to Ve brought in with the least possible friction. All parties must recognise that if Home Rule is to be brought in it should not be heralded by strife. It should be heralded, if possible, by good-will, and by peaceful agreement amongst all parties. That attempt failed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George did his utmost at a later period to bring into agreement, the two most discordant factions, that is the Irish Nationalist party and the extreme section of the Unionist party. He failed, owing, apparently, to the unbendable attitude of certain of the Unionists. But he is now the head of a Government which contains some of those leading Unionists, who, there is no doubt - and I do not think that I am doing them any injustice in making the statement - have been the chief stumbling-blocks to the accomplishment of Home Rule. The very fact that the present Government have given an opportunity for the discussion of this proposition - and we are told through the cable news that endeavours are being made for an arrangement on this question - leads us to hope and believe that at last something definite will be arrived at. That being so, I ask honorable senators: Is it advisable that the Senate, as a part of a Dominion Parliament, should say to the British House of Commons when it is about to deal with this question, &#34; You should immediately grant Home Rule &#34; ? Are we, after all, reasonable in taking up that attitude? That we should say to the House of Commons, &#34; In our opinion, this is a solution of the difficulty,&#34; I quite agree; that we should say that Home Rule ought to be granted to Ireland, I quite agree; but I submit to the Senate that in using the word &#34; immediately &#34; we would go too far. We would say that, no matter what the difficulty may be, no matter what conditions may be asked or demanded, or may be proposed to be given, Home Rule should be granted. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but it is an expression of opinion. I shall not give my vote as an expression of my opinion. I want to give my honest opinion, and honestly I am not able to give that opinion until I know what are the contending views put forward in the discussion now taking place. &#39;We are face to face with a different set of conditions from those which the British Parliament ever faced when it dealt with this question before. I have outlined the different sets of conditions which existed on each occasion, and now we have another state of conditions. As one who has looked at this question from afar, I say that, before we express an opinion in favour of an immediate grant of Home Rule, we&#34; ought to know, if the British Government cannot see their way to grant it, what are the difficulties confronting them. We ought to know, too, from the Irish Nationalist party what reasons they put forward for an immediate grant. Whether they are even asking for an immediate grant we do not know. It may be that they are asking for a grant of Home Rule in six months&#39; time.- We would look rather foolish if, when the discussion took place, we found that the Irish Nationalist party, which must be deemed to more correctly represent the views of the people of Ireland than we do, asked that a grant should be made in three months, and we in Australia demanded that it should be made immediately. I approached those who are moving here in this matter, and asked if they would agree to leave out the word &#34; immediately.&#34; </para>

I have always held, and I hold more strongly to-day than ever I did, that it commences to travel a very doubtful path indeed when the Legislature of one self-governing body begins to project its thoughts and activities into the arena controlled by another self-governing body. I ask honorable senators to reverse the position for a few minutes. In this country we recently had a very sharp controversy over the question of conscription. What would have been said by members of all parties here if the Imperial Parliament at that time had passed a resolution recommending conscription to us, or suggesting that it was in the best interests of the Empire, or that it was fair and just, that we should, by adopting conscription, render the same proportionate measure of assistance as the people of the Old Country were doing 1 We know that we would have taken a very strong exception to such a proceeding. There can be no controversy on the proposition I am about to put forward. If to-morrow, for Imperial interests, a House of the Imperial Parliament ventured to pass a resolution asking us to forego our White Australia policy, what would be said by the members of all parties ? In very brief, colloquial language they would tell the members of that House to mind their own business. It may be said that this is a matter of Imperial interest, &#39; and that we are concerned in it. So was conscription, and so was the White Australia policy. </para>

                        <para>- This motion deals with the question whether the Parliament of one self-governing country should proceed to impress its opinions and try to project its thoughts upon the Legislature of another self-governing portion of the Empire. It seems to me quite an inverted view to take that a local self-government, an autonomy under which we claim the right to frame our own laws, should take this authority upon itself with regard to another portion of the Empire. For that reason I have voted against a motion similar to this before, and I propose to vote against this motion, but I do not want to shrink from the expression of my views on this subject. There is a clear distinction between the proposition itself and the principle referred to. I am one of those who believe that a measure of Home Rule for Ireland is inevitable, but when I say that I am not able to vote for the motion as submitted, I want it clearly understood it is because of a disinclination to deal with motions concerning matters under the control of smother Parliament. Further, whilst I believe that a measure of Home Rule for Ireland is inevitable, I shall vote for no motion which carries with it the suggestion of the coercion of Ulster, and this motion does in some way contain an idea of the coercion of Ulster. </para>

I hope I shall set an example of brevity to other honorable senators, because I feel that nothing can injure the motion more than undue talking upon it. I merely wish to say that had the word &#34; immediately &#34; been retained, I would have supported the motion, for the simple reason that I believe that immediately Home Rule is granted to Ireland there will be a new Ireland. I believe that John Redmond properly interpreted the position and the feelings of the Irish people in this community. Because I have believed in the principle during the whole of my political career I am supporting the motion now. I do not want to say any more. My- position is now beyond all challenge. </para>

                    <para>. - I think I was the first in this chamber to speak on Home Rule, when the motion was carried on the first occasion, the mover contented himself with simply submitting it. The opinions I expressed on that occasion I still hold. Had the mover of the motion insisted upon retaining the word &#34; immediately,&#34; I would certainly have supported him, because I think if any subject should be dealt with immediately it is this question of Home Rule for Ireland. The carrying of a colourless motion, indefinite as the time, is of little value. I do not think the motion will in any way embarrass the Imperial Government, because when I was in London recently I frequently visited the House of Commons and met there representatives of the Irish people as well as members from other parts of the United Kingdom. I heard, on very good authority, that the arrangement made by the present Prime Minister was well received by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Carson, and that any difficulties that arose were due to the action taken by Lord Lansdowne in the House of Lords. I believe, therefore, that the motion now before the Senate will be welcomed by the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and assist him in his task. One pleasing feature of this debate is the brevity of the remarks made by honorable senators, in order that we may dispose of this motion, which is a matter of urgency to the Irish people. I will be equally brief in my remarks, and content myself by saying, &#34; God speed &#34; to the resolution. </para>

As an Australian born son of an Irishman, I have always wondered why Ireland did not have the right of self-government, and I shall always remember with pleasure my connexion with that big demonstration in the Melbourne Town Hall a couple of years ago, when I was privileged to speak on a resolution dealing with this matter. If the motion had been retained in its original form it would have received the same unanimous support - because, apparently, the vote is going to be unanimous. I cannot see why Ireland should not have Home Rule. I shall, of course, vote for the motion as amended, but I regret that its original form was not retained. </para>

                        <para>- There is not another example of that kind in Europe. Some people may claim that this state of affairs has been brought about by what might be called the &#34; cussedness &#34; of the Irish race. My own opinion is that it has been caused by misgovernment by the landed aristocracy of Great Britain and Ireland. I hope that if this war accomplishes nothing else it will at least de throne that kind of government in Great Britain for ever. </para>

                        <para>- I know that. I have been an advocate of the granting of Home Rule to both Ireland and Scotland for many years. I suppose honorable senators will recollect that, just prior&#39; to the outbreak of the war, there was some hope that Ireland would be granted a measure of Home Rule. At that particular time, we found one very prominent member of the British Parliament in open rebellion against the Government. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Carson. He bought ships, purchased ammunition, and organized and drilled troops for the express and unconcealed purpose of opposing the British Government if it decided to give a complete measure of Home Rule to Ireland. To the disgrace of that Government, he was allowed to go about his ordinary avocation unmolested. He was allowed to preach his sedition from one end of the country to the other without let or hindrance. He was permitted to inflame the minds of multitudes in Great Britain and Ireland, and nobody said &#34; booh &#34; to him. Why? Because he was a member of the privileged classes of Great Britain. We know, too, that the very officers in the British Army threw their commissions in the face of the British Government rather than take part in putting down the rebellion which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Carson was endeavouring to organize. They flaunted their commissions in the face of the Government, and the Government said nothing, but took it as quietly as if it were a lamb or a sheep before its shearers. But when the Nationalists organized a little bit of a procession, what happened ? The military were called out, bullets flew, some men were killed, and others were injured. What I want to show is the difference between the treatment which was meted out to those who were opposed to Home Rule and that which was extended to those who were in favour of it. The reason why we want Home Rule for Ireland - and that immediately - is because the Empire is struggling for its life. We want every portion of the Empire to be whole-heartedly with us in this struggle, and I am certain that if Ireland is given Home Rule now, she will be as enthusiastic in the fight against German domination as is any other portion of the British </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;4.16&#93;.- I am quite sure that there is no wish to drag out this debate so as to provide bitter feelings in the minds of any honorable senator. We all know that Home Rule for Ireland is a matter which has been taken in hand by the people of the Old Country with the object of devising some scheme which will prove acceptable both to the north and south of Ireland. I join with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline>
                    in saying that it is deplorable that any British Government should have allowed people to openly arm themselves for the purpose of fighting it, as a certain section was permitted to do, just prior to the outbreak of the war. But when we talk about a just measure of Home Rule for Ireland, we know that, despite the efforts which, were recently made in that direction, there was strong opposition to the proposals of the - Imperial Government. While the people in the north of Ireland were opposed to the scheme suggested, those in the south were opposed to the exclusion of any portion of Ireland from the Homo Rule Bill. Thar, was the bone of contention at the very time that the war broke out. To the credit of the Irish people, they at once brushed this dispute aside, in order to join with the remainder of the Empire in vindicating its honour and integrity.

We know that Ireland has always had good representation in the Forces of the Empire when it has had any difficulty to confront. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> asked just now whether that circumstance is not a reason why we should pass a motion of this character. Does he not recognise that, in so doing, wa may be pushing forward this matter m a way which w&#187;U aggravate the difficulty that exists at the present moment, instead of assisting to promote a peaceful solution of tha problem. We cannot close out eyes to the fact that immediately prior to the outbreak of the war there was much trouble over this question. We cannot forget that Germany counted upon it to disrupt the Empire. </para>

                            GOULD. - I am very proud that she did, because it shows that, at heart, the people of Ireland are loyal to the Empire. Do we not all know that an attempt was made to settle this question by the exclusion of Ulster from the Home Rule Bill
                            <inline font-style="italic">1</inline>
                            That proposal was vigorously fought by the people, who were whole-heartedly in favour of Home Rule. The question therefore arises as to how far we are justified in interfering in this matter at all. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has pointed out what would happen if the Imperial Parliament, by means) of a petition, attempted to dictate te us in regard to a matter of domestic policy. In my judgment, this question of Home Rule for Ireland, although a .national one, may be Best dealt with by the Imperial Legislature. It cannot be denied that, during recent years, Great Britain has endeavoured to redress many of the grievances under which the Irish people laboured. I have such confidence m the good sense and honesty of the people of Great Britain, and in their desire to do what is just, as to believe that we are not called upon to intervene in this controversy. Personally, I doubt very much whether the adoption of this motion will carry any weight with the Imperial authorities. I recognise that an attempt has been made to settle it, and that when the war is over it will have to be settled in a way which will bring contentment and satisfaction to the different parte of Ireland. A few moments ago an interjection was made in regard to granting Home Rule to Scotland. The Scottish people may, with equal justification, urge that they ought to have Home Rule. And if Scotland is granted Home Rule, why not Wales? To my mind, the only way in which this great difficulty can be overcome is by dividing the Empire into different portions, and by conferring full  powers  of local self-government upon each of them, reserving to the Imperial Parliament the right to deal with all truly national questions. While I am sympathetic with the desire of the people of Ireland to control their own affairs, I do not think that this Parliament is called upon to express an opinion upon this very great question.

But we have to remember what has taken place during the past few years whenever Great Britain has endeavoured to enact legislation which it was thought would bring contentment and happiness to Ireland.

                    <para>. - On &#34; Win the War&#34; Day I was going to take part in the recruiting meetings held in connexion with the unveiling by the Minister for Defence of the broken column in Yarra Park. On my way there, I met a big Irishman, who said that he was also going down to the column. I said, &#34; I .am glad to see that you are interested,&#34; and he replied, &#34;I am interested, for, although it is thirty years since I came from Ireland, I have reared a family in the meantime, and two of my sons have fallen at the front, and a third is going there.&#34; I told him that I was glad to be in the company of a patriotic and self-sacrificing man, and he then said, &#34; Oh,  but  why do they not give us Home Rule, seeing that they have given it to the Boers of South Africa, who, sixteen years ago, had arms in their hands fighting as enemies of the Empire ? Look at the good results which have followed there from Home Rule. Home Rule for Ireland would bring about equally good results between the peoples of the different sections of the United Kingdom, united at present, but to be united in a better sense subsequent to the granting of self-government.&#34; I am certain that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was right when he stated that the granting of a measure &#39;of Home Rule for Ireland &#163;s inevitable. Something more is inevitable, and that is a decentralization of government in the United Kingdom, which will affect not only Ireland, but Scotland as well. I shall not pursue that phase of the matter. I am going to say a word or two in a gentle sense to those peoples who live side by side in Ireland, but who, unfortunately, have had at times unsatisfactory relationships with each other. I say to them, &#34; Let not the griefs of the old time follow. &#34; Let them remember, if possible, what one of the greatest masters of the English language has written about that historical Irish figure, Maeldune. I refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Voyage of Maeldune.</inline> Maeldune went, in accordance with the custom of the times, to an island in the ocean away from the coast of Ireland, in order to find the slayer of his father, and do him to death. But, in the course of his wanderings, he met with a saintly humanitarian, personage, who took him to task, and said, &#34; Let not this thing be. Go back to the Isle of Finn, and suffer the past to be past.&#34; I say to all dwellers in the Isle of Finn, which is Ireland, &#34; Suffer the past to be. past. Be reconciled&#39; to each other. &#39; &#39; Maeldune took the advice of the personage, and returned to his own country, Old Ireland, and on the return voyage he came to the isle which he had been seeking, and saw the murderer of his father - </para>

                    <para>.- As one who is an Australian, and keenly interested in the Emerald Isle, though one whose religion is not that of the majority of the people of Ireland, I hope that this motion will be carried,&#39; and that it will be sent to the Imperial Parliament to strengthen the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Redmond,</inline> and those .who are assisting him, as a message that we are in favour of the measure of local autonomy for Ireland which we enjoy in Australia. Though the times are strenuous just now, local self-government is working fairly well here, and no doubt it will work a little better in a few  months&#39; time. One of the reasons &#34;why I support the motion is that history proves that people are to he trusted with their own government. Though we have been a little suspicious of them in the past, and inclined to believe that they may do something detrimental to the interests of the Empire if given local autonomy; history proves that people so trusted have never proved false to their trust. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has cited the example of South Africa. Sixteen or seventeen years ago the Empire, and Australia as a part of it, were engaged in a struggle with the people of South Africa. We sent from Victoria and other States of the Commonwealth some of the cream of our manhood to South Africa to fight Botha, De Wet, and others, who to-day are taken into the councils of the Empire. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. After expending millions of money and pouring tons of lead into the midst of the Boers, we conquered them. No one will deny that they put up a great fight against us. I was against the Boer war. I believed it was wrong. I am not now against the war with Germany, let that be thoroughly understood. After we had conquered the Boers, and brought them to their knees, they were treated with the justice with which Great Britain always treats her conquered foes, and, judging by the attitude of these people in connexion with the campaign in German South Africa and East Africa, the Boers would appear to be amongst the most loyal people in the Empire at the present time. Some people may try to raise the sectarian issue, and tell us that we cannot trust the people of Ireland. They may say, &#34; Look at the Sinn Feiners; look at <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Roger</inline> Casement, and at the Connelly case.&#34; These matters are referred to, and it is said that we cannot give Home Rule to Ireland, because if we do she might rise against us and stab us at the heart of the Empire. In view  of our experience of the conduct of  the people  of South Africa when they  were  wanted Home Rule, I do not think that we need fear the grant of local autonomy to the people of Ireland. Apart from the few Sinn Feiners, with whom I have not the slightest sympathy, and apart from a few individuals such as exist in every community, just as we have members of the Industrial Workers of the World in Australia - with whom, again, I have not the slightest sympathy - I believe that the Irish people as a nation would be found loyal to Great Britain. I would give local autonomy, not only to Ireland, but to Scotland and Wales, and every other portion of the Empire. I care not what a man&#39;s religion or politics may be, or what view he may take of this question, I consider it is only right that, enjoying as we do the full benefits of local self-government, we should send a cable to the Imperial Government, at the heart of the Empire to which we are proud to belong, intimating that we are in favour of .the same rights of self-government being given to the people of Ireland that we enjoy ourselves. Ireland is to-day just as loyal to the Empire as is South Africa or Australia. One of the first men to gain the Victoria Cross in the present war was the Irishman, Sergeant O&#39;Leary, who fought so well and so valiantly. No man can tell me that the nation that has reared men of the stamp of Sergeant O&#39;Leary and his fellows at the Front is going to be disloyal to the Empire at this crucial time in its history. Though I have not a drop of Irish blood in my veins, I believe I shall be doing the right thing, and the best thing, not only for Ireland, but for the Empire, in supporting the motion to give to the people of Ireland the same right to govern themselves which we enjoy in Australia. I shall vote for the motion, and the more strongly it is worded the better it will suit me. </para>

                    (Tasmania} &#91;4.35&#93;. - I shall endeavour to be no less brief than honorable senators who have preceded me. This motion has been before the Senate previously, and honorable senators will remember the position I have taken up with regard to it. Long before I entered the Senate, or took part in political life at all, I unhesitatingly, freely, and publicly in my own State expressed my attitude with regard to Ireland&#39;s aspirations for autonomy. I had the pleasure and privilege recently of being in the United Kingdom and of visiting Ireland. I spoke in Ireland as one who came from an overseas Parliament, and my remarks in Dublin, and those of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline>
                    Carroll, were called in question by certain newspapers. They tad overlooked the fact that we were visiting Ireland as private individuals, and were not there by an invitation or tinder any arrangement with any organization or any department of government. As a matter of fact, Ireland was not included in the itinerary of those who visited the United Kingdom from Australia recently. Those of us who went to Ireland did so of our own volition, and entirely at our own expense. Consequently, when I spoke in Dublin I said a few words there as words of reassurance. I have not a report of my speech with me now, but the Lord Mayor of Dublin, in welcoming those of us who came from the different overseas Dominions of the Empire, stated that he regretted that we would see Dublin under conditions which he and every one in the room deplored, and conditions for which neither he nor anybody in that room would accept responsibility, either in sentiment, sympathy, or assistance. He was referring to conditions which had been occasioned by the outbreak in Dublin some little time before. It was a proper statement for him to make, and in replying I took occasion to say that if they exercised patience in Ireland the people would find that their aspirations for autonomy would be realized, because I believed that behind them was the strongest force in this world, namely, a fairly unanimous opinion of those portions of the Empire which had enjoyed, and, therefore, knew and appreciated, the principles of self-government. I pointed to the fact that when the war broke out not one of the Elf-governing Dominions had, apparently, been consulted. No suggestion, no direction, and no request had come from the Imperial Government, but, like hounds let loose from the leash, they sprang to the mother&#39;s side. This, I considered, would prove a very effective lesson in the future consideration of Ireland&#39;s position in the Empire, and I said to the Irish people, &#34;Be patient.&#34; I think that was practically the statement I made, and yet it was called in question by certain organs who thought I had unnecessarily intruded upon matters of domestic legislation. Less than a week later, in the north of Ireland, I repeated my statement, and pointed out that I was free to speak as I chose, because I was not there as the representative or the guest of any particular organization, but as a son of Irish parents, who ever since he had reason and power of thought, and had given consideration to this matter, had felt one way about it, and only one way. That has been my position- in the past. This question has come up here before. I voted for the proposition then.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    referred to-day to some considerations which, no doubt, are of great importance. Had I not been to the Old Country as I have been recently; had I not given close attention to the whole question, not merely of the self-government of Ireland, but of the Empire in this crisis; had I not given that sympathetic attention to these matters which I have, and had I not felt about them as strongly as I have, I might perhaps have attached as much importance to those considerations which are impressing
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    as he does. But I can say, honestly and sincerely, that after my visit I am assured in my own judgment and conscience, as one loyal to the Empire, that these considerations ought not to influence me now. This motion has been on the notice-paper for some little time. It was put there before the recent developments, and it has come up for consideration to-day. We have expressed our opinions previously,  practically all of us, either here or elsewhere, and I see no reason why I should depart from the attitude I have taken here, and everywhere, when this question has arisen.

It proposes, also, to ask for Supply, and to submit for parliamentary consideration, and, I trust, approval, an Electoral Bill providing for voting by soldiers at the front. </para>

                    <para>. - Before the Senate adjourns I desire to say a few words with regard to a matter raised last week by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> in reply to a statement that I made concerning his support of the Fisher Government. On that occasion I gave the figures, I admit somewhat rather hurriedly, but since then I have had some assistance, and consequently I can speak with a great deal more certainty than I could last week. It will be remembered that I asserted, somewhat humourously, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> when in Western Australia, and later on when speaking in the Senate, instead of discussing the particular question before the country, devoted nine-tenths of his time to recounting measures passed by the Labour Government in 1910-13. I said that, judging by the manner in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> had referred to those measures, one would naturally feel inclined to think that he had some special claims for what he had done to have the Acts placed on the statute-book, I pointed out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> had no particular reason to claim any merit; that, as a matter of fact, he had very little to do with them. I find, from an examination of the division lists, that I was substantially right when I said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was equally entitled to claim credit for having passed the measures referred to. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie now brings forward a statement showing that in one session I voted against the Government thirteen times, and for the Government fourteen times. I may have voted against the Government during that year every time that a division was called on a certain clause in Committee, for the simple reason that ever since I have been a member of the Senate I have never voted in Committee as other people may have wished me to vote. I remember, when the Senate was dealing with the Bill relating to the pawning of medals, that for weeks I kept up an opposition to it, and moved every amendment that I could think of; but it cannot be said that because my name appeared in the division lists as voting against the Government then I was against the Labour Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, by his action to-day, has only increased his own reputation for doing this sort of thing. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is renowned for one thing more than another it is his method of attack, which all who know him despise, but which all who know him could only expect from that honorable senator. </para>

They are not only .written up, but they bear the signature of William Morris Hughes. There was a lengthy debate, and the motion put to the meeting by the then leader of the party referred to the question of calling up the men on the 1st October instead of the 1st September. That was carried by twenty-three votes to twenty-one, because it did not matter very much. </para>

I did so in the hope that we would be able to hold the party together. No man who remembers the circumstances of that time can say that any Minister could have left the Government at that time lightly. If there is one thing I am proud of it is that I remained in the Cabinet; and although I was subjected to the taunts of many men of the type of the honorable senator, I never replied, but took  my  gruel without, a word. </para>

                        <para>- I rose, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to reply to the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, who is trying to discredit me. I want to say that ever since I have been in this Parliament one of the principles I have always lived <inline font-style="italic">vp</inline> to has been that during the discussion on a Bill, no matter where an amendment came from, if I thought it would improve the measure, I would vote for it. I venture to say, also, that I can speak for the whole party in regard to Bills in Committee. Yet he says that in order to mislead the outside public, and I am taking the trouble to reply to his statements, because I know the man and his methods. Were his methods not checked, the next time that he appeared on a public platform in Western Australia these insinuations would become untruths. But <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> fortunately, circulates there. The best that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie can find with which to buttress his charge against me is that I did not support the Fisher Government as well as did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> May I say that during the period that I sat with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in the Fisher Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> supported that Government a great deal more generously than did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. </para>

                        <para>- They will expel any member of the party who breaks his pledge to vote in Parliament as the majority of a duly-constituted Caucus meeting may decide. Not long ago I attended a meeting which was presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and at which a certain motion was submitted. Twenty-three members of this Parliament who were present at that meeting suddenly walked out of the room and formed what is known as the National Labour party, and they have been squealing ever since because of the result of their actions. Of course, I recognise that thos&#169; members now have great, broad national ideas. Only this morning the Premier of Tasmania made it known to the public that the opponents of the party which I have the honour to lead in this Chamber were suspiciously cognisant of the fact that a vacancy in the representation of Tasmania here was likely to occur two or three days before it actually took place. That gentleman was asked by the Prime Minister to make provision to fill the vacancy immediately, and he promptly acceded to the request. Honorable senators opposite are bound to the new &#34; National &#34; party and to the chariot wheel of a man who will drag them through the mire so long as they consent to follow him. Yet they are not game to say a word by way of protest. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie boasts of his broad &#34; National &#34; party - the &#34; National &#34; party which has proved the greatest national disgrace we have ever had in this country. Until to-day that party was confronted with the most suspicious evidence of wrong-doing, but that evidence ceased to be suspicious the moment that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee</inline> had spoken. Now, this &#34; National &#34; party, which has no sense of national honour, desires to hurry into recess in order that it may let a general election prove- </para>

                        <para>- That statement astonishes me still more. If ex-Senator Ready&#39;s position should have been filled by a person who entertains similar political views, the wrong man has been sent here. Nothing, however,, can alter the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee</inline> met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and was told by him two or three days before we became aware of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> illness, that there would be a vacancy in the Tasmanian representation in this Chamber. He immediately inquired whether  the retiring senator belonged &#39; to the Liberal party or to the other side. Having been satisfied upon that point, he at once agreed to nominate a person to fill the vacancy. But he missed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> in Melbourne. Then an appointment was made, and you, sir, received <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> resignation at one minute past 6 in the evening. I should like to know how you got that resignation. If it was delivered by messenger, that officer must surely have had tardy feet if it took from 2 o&#39;clock in the afternoon till 6 o&#39;clock in the evening to reach you. Of course, if it was posted, that supplies an answer to the whole business. I have drifted on to this subject - I did not intend to speak upon it. But having been drawn into it, I wish to say that the Leader of the Government in this Chamber, finding that the Government had lost their majority, came down here and stated that, owing to opposition on the part of members of my own party, the departure of the Commonwealth delegates to the Imperial &#34;War Conference had been delayed. The world now knows that the departure of the delegation was delayed because the Government could not be sure of the support of members of their own party. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has put forward a method by which, for the time being, Australia could be represented at the Conference. He suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> and the Agent-General for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McCall, should represent the Commonwealth until the arrival in England of our own delegates. I commend his suggestion to the Government, in the hope that it will receive consideration. We all recognise that the Commonwealth should be represented by Ministers of the Crown, but until they can get there, we might well be represented by the gentlemen whom I have named. After nearing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> statement, I am not at all sure that it was not complete cowardice which prevented our delegates from leaving for England. I am not sure that the postponement of their departure is not directly due to the misfortune which has befallen two of our ships in the Indian Ocean. Although men were to be dragged from their homes and sent as they were required, not only over perilous waters, but also into the trenches, to take the risks there, it would be too serious a matter to risk the valuable lives of these three gentlemen. Although there may be doubts as to where the &#39; credit lies for stopping this delegation - perhaps all the circumstances operated together, and particularly the tear of the risks from submarines and raiders that these three men would have to undergo- </para>

                        <para>- I did say that if Australia was to be represented at the Conference, it should be by Australians; but the point that I am making now is not that these gentlemen should fill every inch of the bill, but that, for the present moment, when no other representatives can reach the Old Country from this Parliament, if they were chosen, we should be represented by men in whom we can place trust and confidence. I did not pick out the names. They were mentioned by the Tasmanian senators, and they appear to me as being a very fair representation of the Commonwealth. Tasmania would be represented, and two men would represent Australia who have been considered qualified to fill the position of High Commissioner for the Commonwealth. What better arrangement could, in the circumstances, be made? I do not say that these men should in the ordinary official way represent Australia at the Conference, where the Commonwealth should be represented by men chosen by the votes of Australians, but only that they should, as suggested, represent us for the time being. We would go a long way before we could get better men to fill the bill for the time being until the people can have a voice in the matter, and say what type of men should go to the heart of the Empire. We want our voice to reach the ears of its governing body, and men to  voice our views  who are in touch with Australian sympathies. Serious results follow from misrepresentation. Grave things may happen through the position of Australia being misrepresented at this critical juncture. That is why I appeal to Australia not to be unrepresented at the Imperial Conference, and to send to it the men suggested, not by myself, but by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> until such time as the elections are over, and Australia can send her own representatives. I hope that the Government will pay some attention to that suggestion. </para>

                    <para>. - In view of certain statements made by the Premier of Tasmania, and reported in this morning&#39;s newspapers, I asked the Government at the opening of to-day&#39;s proceedings whether they would reconsider their decision and appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the  circumstances surrounding the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready. Senator Millen</inline> said that he would consult the Government on the matter, but I think that it is only fair to the Government, to the State of Tasmania, and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee,</inline> the Premier of Tasmania, whose name has been mentioned several times in the Senate in connexion with this matter, that I should read a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee,</inline> and published in the Launceston <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> yesterday morning. A <inline font-style="italic">precis</inline> of the statement has appeared in the Melbourne newspapers. It is sufficiently important to place on record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> This is what the Premier of Tasmania is reported to have said to a representative &#39; of the Launceston <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph -</inline></para>

                    <para>The Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> H. Lee,&#39; stated last night, with reference to the development in the Senate yesterday, that he desired to make a full and complete statement as to his connexion with and the part taken by his Government in the matter of the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> to the position in the Senate rendered vacant by the resignation of ex-Senator Ready. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee</inline> said, &#34; On Friday, the 23rd ult., I was at Swansea with the Director of Education, when I received a telegram from the Prime Minister asking me to at once go to Sydney by the s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Moeraki</inline> leaving Hobart next day at 10 a.m., for the purpose of discussing important business. The nature of the business was not specified, but 1 concluded it related to the importation of wheat into Tasmania, a matter in connexion with which I had been corresponding with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> my last letter to whom I had not received a reply to. I motored to Hobart that night, and joined the <inline font-style="italic">Moeraki</inline> next morning, arriving in Sydney on Monday morning. That morning I had an interview with the Prime Minister, when the wheat question was discussed at length, after which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> asked me to telegraph to two of the Tasmanian&#39; millers to go to Melbourne to meet us in conference. The hops difficulty was then fully gone into, and an arrangement made that I should telegraph to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> to go to Melbourne with the leading hop growers and discuss with us a possible solution of the trouble, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> having interested himself in the hop question, and, at the request of the Government, having with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Shoebridge  some months ago conferred with the Prime Minister on the subject. After the matters referred to had been discussed, the Prime Minister said he understood that there was a possibility of a vacancy occurring in the Senate through the retirement of a Tasmanian senator, and asked me whether, in the event of such a happening, my Government would appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> to the position. I said, &#34;Who is the senator?&#34; He replied, &#34; I cannot tell you.&#34; I said, &#34; It must be an Opposition member to be of any use to yon.&#34; He said, &#34;It is.&#34; I said, &#34;I understand a certain Tasmanian senator is taking a trip to the East.&#34; The Prime Minister did not reply. I referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline> who I understood was suffering from a very serious malady, and surmised he was contemplating retirement from public life. I told the Prime Minister that, so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle&#39;s</inline> appointment was concerned, the matter would have to be submitted to the Cabinet, but I thought, in view of the facts that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> had announced himself as a candidate for the Senate at the approaching election and that my Government was in sympathy with his attitude on war matters, there would be no objection to his appointment, and that I, personally, would strongly recommend it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> then asked me if it would be possible to arrange for a Cabinet meeting immediately on my return to Tasmania to ascertain whether, in the event of there being a vacancy, the Government would appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle,</inline> as it was imperative, in the event of there being <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> vacancy, to have the position filled as speedily as possible so that the Commonwealth delegation to the Imperial Conference could leave Melbourne on the next Thursday, for unless such delegation did leave on that day Australia would not be represented. Realizing the great importance to the Commonwealth being represented at this Conference, I said &#39;that I would arrange for a meeting of the Cabinet immediately on my return. I left Sydney on Tuesday, 27th February, arriving in Melbourne on Wednesday morning, where I, with the  Tasmanian  millers, Messrs.  Monds  and Gibson, conferred with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> on the wheat question. I did not see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle,</inline> but discussed the hop question briefly with Messrs. Jones, Shoebridge, and Okines,  who had gone to Melbourne with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle.</inline> I tried to see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle,</inline> but missed him. Subsequently, I understand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle,</inline> in company with Messrs. Jones, Shoebridge,  and  Okines,  conferred with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in connexion with the hop question. On Wednesday, 28th February, I left Melbourne, arriving at Launceston on Thursday and at Hobart the same evening, when the Cabinet was held at 8 p.m., all the members being present except the two Honorary Ministers, Messrs. Shields and Hays. I communicated to my colleagues the. matters, communicated to me by the Prime Minister, and a general discussion ensued, in which Ministers agreed that my surmise as to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> was possibly correct. During the discussion a notification was received from  His Excellency  the Governor that he had received a communication from  His Excellency  the Governor-General that SenatorReady had resigned from the Senate. Later I received a wire from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> that he was willing to accept the appointment as senator for Tasmania. Later a further telegram was received notifying that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> had resigned his seat in the State Parliament. All three communications were received by me while the Cabinet was sitting. I was rather surprised at receiving <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle&#39;s</inline> resignation then, as I had made it clear to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> that 1 could not commit my Government to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle&#39;s</inline> appointment without consulting my colleagues, and had promised that so goon as a decision was arrived at as to what my Government would, do in the event of a vacancy, I would communicate the result to him. After the communication referred to had been received the Government decided to appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .</inline> Earle to the vacant position, and an Executive meeting was held the same evening and effect given to the de- termination of the Cabinet, and notification was made to  His Excellency  the Governor-General by a telegram. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee</inline> said that the only reason for taking such active steps to ascertain the views of his colleagues on the matter submitted by the Prime Minister and appointing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> to the vacancy was for the purpose of permitting the delegation from Australia to take part in the Imperial Conference. He considered this Conference of such vast importance that for Australia to be not represented would be a calamity. He concluded by saying that, so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> resignation was concerned, it was not until he received the notification from the Governor-General while the Cabinet was sitting that he had the _ slightest knowledge of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> contemplated retirement. </para>

                        <para>- It is only fair that the statement of the Premier of Tasmania, who distinctly admits that the Prime Minister told him on Tuesday last that he was expecting the resignation of an Opposition senator from Tasmania, should be printed in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> That statement, taken in conjunction with the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> resigned on the Thursday, has led to all these rumours - they may be unfounded, but still they are rumours - and all this suspicion in the minds of a number of people. Therefore I was justified in asking, in the interest of all parties whose names have been mentioned in connexion with the matter, for the appointment of a Royal Commission to clear away these suspicions. When they are cleared up, if suspicion may still rest on any one, then let it so rest ; but if the inquiry can show that there is no justification for suspicion, it will be in the interest of those on whom it is now resting. It is remarkable that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee</inline> should have stated that he believed it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long&#39;s</inline> resignation that was coming in ; yet he was willing to appoint a supporter of the Government to the vacancy in order to permit of the prolongation scheme being carried. He seems remarkably simple in his innocence concerning the Federal Constitution. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> had resigned, and not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> the Government would still be unable to. carry their proposals through the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said that, unless the Government could carry their prolongation proposals through the Senate, they would not be able to send the delegation to the Imperial Conference. According to this Tasmanian journal, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee</inline> was very anxious that the dele- gatton should go without any delay, and that was why he was so eager to fill the vacancy, but if he had any knowledge of our Constitution, he must have known that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long&#39;s</inline> resignation would not have altered the position. An alteration of the position could only be brought about by the resignation of a senator who was able to attend and vote. Assuming that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> may support the Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long&#39;s</inline> resignation would have left eighteen senators on either side, and seventeen on either side available to vote. The proposal for the prolongation of the life of Parliament would then have been resolved in the negative. I have read the article from the Launceston <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph.</inline> In the interests of every one concerned, and especially of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee,</inline> whose name has been used by myself and others, and against whom I do not impute anything wrong, the Government should appoint a Royal Commission. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee</inline> would ask for it, and I hope that the Government will grant it. </para>

                    <para>. - Last week <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> who was here earlier to-day, but is now absent from the chamber, quoted some statements that appeared in the New South Wales press on the question of the manufacture of toluene. I promised to obtain a reply to the questions he asked. There were four points raised. The first was in regard to an article which appeared in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun,</inline> in which it was said that the regulations prohibiting the storing of crude tar would come into force on 1st March, and not on 1st May. As a matter of fact, the regulation that comes into force on 12th March - and not on 1st March, as stated in the article quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> - does not prohibit the storing of crude tar, but deals only with the treatment and disposal of the light oils obtained from the distillation of tar within certain areas. The second point raised was that representatives of the Albion Quarry Company, of Melbourne, had waited upon me. The company is engaged in the distillation of tar, and it was said that its representatives had waited upon me, and had given information regarding the production by the company of toluene and benzine. This particular company has not yet produced on a commercial scale the toluene required by the Defence Department. The company, however, proposes to alter its still in the hope of being able  to  do so. The third matter referred to was a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Octavius</inline> W. Cowley, a director  of  De Meric Limited, Sydney, who said that it was with much astonishment he had. read in the <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> a statement under the heading &#34; Distilled Coal Tar,&#34; made by the Minister for Defence. He quoted the statement, which was to the effect that-  I  had said that we had not yet been able  to  secure the successful production of toluene up to the standard required. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cowley</inline> went on to contradict that statement, and to assert that his company are distilling tar, and, in addition, manufacturing benzol, solvent naphtha, and sublimed naphthaline, and many other products  of  coal tar, and have for twelve months produced and supplied, under contract to the Imperial Russian Government, quantities  of  toluol for the manufacture of high explosives. The facts in this matter are that De Meric Limited have not been supplying the Russian Government with toluol&#39; to the British Imperial Government&#39;s specification, which is the standard required by the Defence Department, because we have to pass it on to the Imperial Government. The contract between Messrs. De Meric Limited and the Russian Government is for a mixture of benzine and toluene, or toluol. I think it is necessary to make this clear, because we are anxious to induce manufacturers to take up the manufacture of toluene, which will be useful for the manufacture of high explosives for this war. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cowley</inline> said, further, that the directors of his company are prepared to negotiate with the Minister for Defence to deal with such products and to supply toluene. They did make an offer&#39; to supply toluene to the Defence Department, but, as their proposal involved an&#39; estimated loss of about &#163;1,000 per month&#39; to the Defence Department, while apparently showing a very handsome profit  to  Messrs. De Meric Limited, the proposal was declined in the form presented. There is only one other matter to which I would like to refer, and that is in connexion with a point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> I think the facts should be correctly set before the public. The honorable senator challenged the statement that the Labour party at their Caucus meeting did carry a resolution approving  of  the proposal put forward by the then Hughes Government in regard to conscription. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and other honorable senators who were present at the Caucus meeting will,  no doubt, remember that there were three points involved in the proposal put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> at the outset. First, that there should be a referendum on the question of conscription; secondly, that a proclamation should be issued under the Defence Act and the War Precautions Act, calling up men for service under the Defence Act three months prior to the taking of the referendum, so that when it was taken the men would be sufficiently trained to be sent away; and, thirdly, that if conscription were carried at the referendum, that would be deemed to give authority to the Government to proceed. That was the proposal put forward by the Government; and after discussion had proceeded upon it, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> on behalf of the Government, altered that proposal to the effect that the men should be called up under the proclamation two months prior to the taking of the referendum. Pressure was then brought to bear on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and the Government in that party meeting to have the calling up of the men after the referendum had been taken, and a number of the members of the party- present intimated that if that were done they would support the Government proposal. As a compromise, the period for which the men should be called up prior to the taking of the referendum was brought down to one month, . and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> then put the Government proposal with that compromise. Those who were present at the meeting will remember that he said, &#34;Well, we come down to one month, and I put the proposal to the vote. All those who are in favour of that &#34; - &#34; that&#34; meaning the Government proposal with the compromise reducing the term for which the men were to be called up to one month instead of three months before the taking of the referendum- </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The military necessities of the situation were that the men should be available to be sent overseas after the referendum, and it was therefore desirable that we should get them into camp at the earliest possible moment. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> made what I said at the time was an unwise conces-sion,  because, had conscription been carried at the referendum, it would have been necessary for us to keep the men in camp here for some time before they would be ready to be sent overseas. However, when he made that concession, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> put the proposition to the meeting as a whole, and those present knew that very well when they voted upon it. A majority of twenty-four to twenty -one agreed to that proposal put before the meeting by the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I accept the honorable senator&#39;s denial, and then what is the position? It is that we have had honorable senators here denouncing the referendum and conscription theugh not compelled by any party obligation at all. Of their own free will they came here and supported something in which they did not believe. There might have been some excuse for men going into a party room and saving that their organizations required them to follow the lead of the majority; hut there can be no excuse for a man who has any conscience or heart coming here and deliberately supporting, under no party obligations at all, something in which he does not believe, and which he believes to be wrong. </para>

                        <para>- Leaving these two honorable senators, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> admits I did, without any knowledge than that their minds were open&#39; and on the balance, I had naturally to think round the position. I argued, &#34; Clearly these gentlemen&#39;s&#39; minds are in a state of balance. What are the probabilities?&#34; First of all, these . two gentlemen have been associated with the Liberal party. They, as members of the party, helped to bring about the present union, and to place me here. I have had long associations with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> and. a few years&#39; association with &#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap.</inline> I formed this opinion, that if their minds are so evenly balanced on this matter when they come to take that fact into account they, having helped to place me here a week or two ago, will not se soon join with those who wish to pull me from the Treasury bench. I did not believe that these two gentlemen were going to destroy that which they had so recently helped to create. I repeat that there was another factor. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> did tell me that he was going to leave for Tasmania on Friday afternoon, and, although I pointed out to him what it meant, he still said that he was going, having engagements to make. He did not go to Tasmania. He has said here that he did not leave Melbourne because of what happened on Friday morning, but he did not come and tell that to . me. He told me on Thursday night where he was going, whereupon I pointed out the position to him, assuming that these two gentlemen would think matters over again, and view everything as it came along. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> never came to me afterwards and said, &#34; In view of what has happened I must vote against the Government,&#34; nor did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I do not challenge it, and I do not want the honorable senator to think that I am. At the same time, I wish to point out the facts on which I shaped my judgment and my statement to my colleagues. The party attachments, and, may I say, the personal attachments, which existed between the two honorable senators and myself induced me to believe that their minds were evenly balanced, and that these factors would in the final resort turn the scale. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> told me that he intended to leave for Tasmania on Friday, and I found he did not go, I argued that he had thought the matter over, and had decided to stay and support the Government, seeing that he had not come to tell me that he was going to do otherwise. If there was an obligation upon any one in these circumstances, if they had finally made up their minds then, - I did not know whether they had or not - it was to acquaint me with their decision. </para>

                        <para>- The Cabinet did not come to another decision. I still said that, so far as the motion was concerned, we could carry it, but I pointed out that, with a hostile, remorseless, reckless Opposition bent upon doing anything, we could get over the first difficulty, though, in my judgment, it would be impossible to go very long on the road we had set out to travel before we would find ourselves in a difficulty, and it was not worth while to take .the risk. </para>

                        <para>- I have said all that I want to say on that point. I only regret that it has been necessary to refer to the matter again. I have told the Senate, without any reservation, the report which I made to my colleagues. That report also included an estimate of how we would get along in the Senate if we did carry the motion to prolong the life of Parliament. It was not the action of Senators Bakhap and Keating which shaped the advice I ventured to give to my colleagues, nor did I know what action they were going to take; but it was the knowledge that there were fifteen or sixteen senators on the other side who had not only said by plain words recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but had shown by their acts, that they were nob prepared to allow us to. get on with the business. </para>
