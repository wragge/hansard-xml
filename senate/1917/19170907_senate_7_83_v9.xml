Is it the intention of the Department to relieve the Division so that the men may visit their relatives in Australia during the coming European winter ? </para>

                            <para>- It was pointed out at the time that the only way to give practical effect to the suggestion is that sufficient recruits should come forward in Australia to take the place of the men. Up to the present I very much regret to say there has not been an indication of an intention by those who are fit to undertake that duty to come forward in sufficient numbers. </para>

                        <para>The railway employees struck against an award of the Arbitration Court. I admit that, candidly, just as the friends and supporters of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> have been striking against arbitration awards' ever since the inception of arbitration in Australia. Let me instance a few cases which occur to my mind. The firstl body to violate an arbitration award under the Federal jurisdiction was the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, which locked its men out. We had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Badger</inline> not abiding by the result of an award in appealing to the High Court and threatening that if he did not get satisfaction there he would take the appeal to the Privy Council. The employing builders, who termed themselves master builders - a title which I do not apply to them be cause I do not think -that they are entitled to it - not only threatened, but actually did take their .  appeal to the Privy Council against an award given to the builders' labourers. Is that not evidence of a system of the breaking of awards on the other side? Let me make a sweeping and yet definite assertion. Since the outbreak of the war the employing sections and the commercial community generally have been breaking every industrial award given by a tribunal by inflating the cost of living to aeroplane heights.

I am not going to sum up the position through the spectacles of Conservative newspapers in Melbourne. But when I see it recorded, as it has been recorded, that railway employees of all grades by ballot decided by a majority of ten to one to go on strike, then I am satisfied, realizing, as they all do, what a strike means, and all the consequences which follow, that the men must have had a grievance. And when I read that in a large city like Townsville all the employees of the Railway Department, from the stationmaster down to the lad-porter, went out on strike, then I am not going to accept the judgment of the Conservative press that they went out for nothing, because no strike has ever been brought about without good grounds. </para><interjection>

                                <para>- I do, exactly; and I say, further, that there was a grave anomaly, to use no harsher word, in the arbitration award. A mechanical union - I think it was the boilermakers or engineers union - actually did go on strike long before, and, following upon their action, the award in their case was made retrospective to the 1st January, but, in the case of the general employees who did not go on strike, their retrospective pay was dated from the 1st July only. </para>

I think that the Prime Minister himself must have realized it, because be received from the Farmers Association on the Atherton tableland a telegram saying that the trains were not running, and asking for military protection to the farmers themselves or bodies of citizens who would forcibly take possession of the trains and run them. In these circumstances, it will be agreed that the position was serious. Those of us who know the vast territory of Northern Queensland, and are familiar with the hinterland of Cairns and Townsville, must realize how a stoppage of railway communication must have affected the people. Let me say, in passing, that a majority of these people are in unison with the political and industrial principles of the men on strike. So that the men did not go out on strike for nothing, and penalize all these people, including a large section of the community who agreed with them in every detail. </para><para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> received the request for military aid he sent it on to the Premier of Queensland, informing that gentleman that he should supply police protection. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> promptly wired back to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> telling Kim that the railways of Queensland were under the jurisdiction of its Government.

We were told so recently as yesterday by quite a number of speakers that the present industrial unrest was not an ordinary strike but an industrial upheaval, a mutiny, a rebellion, and a revolt, due to the presence of disloyal persons and pro-Germanism. If that be so, do  the  Government desire it to continue? The merits of the strike are not involved in this side request for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins' services. The point at issue is, Does the Government condone the refusal by the Prime Minister to consent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins acting as arbitrator? </para>

Certainly the honorable senator acted in all innocence, and I feel a great deal of pleasure in referring to it in that way   because it is a pleasure to me to recognise that on occasions the honorable senator can be innocent. However, in his notification Ee was not very specific as to the purpose for which he intended to move. He supplemented his first letter by another, in which he said that he proposed to confine himself to what he referred to as " the J  Justice  Higgins question."

                        <para>I am in this matter under another disability arising from our own Standing Orders. Whilst the honorable senator is perfectly free to say what he likes about the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> I am not free in this chamber in discussing this motion to say what I am in a position to say regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. Nobody short of a W. S. Gilbert could do anything like justice to the position. The services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, the  President  of the Arbitration Court, are required in order to say whether the men out on strike shall or shall not obey can award of an Arbitration Court already given ! The Judge against whose award the men are striking, whose legal decision they are defying, and to that extent making themselves law-breakers, is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> McCawley. I know nothing of him other than his public record, but" I believe he was appointed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Ryan</inline> and his friends to the position. He is certainly no nominee of the hated capitalist. He is the nominee of the "capitalist" Ryan, and was the Secretary or Under-Secretary of one of the p"ublic Departments of Queensland. There were Judges there carrying on this work, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan's</inline> nominee was selected out of that Department to be put into this position over the heads of other Judges. Do any of us, who are all practical politicians, suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> followed such an unusual course in order to put into the position a man who was not regarded as being acceptable to the workers whose case would come before him ? It is a fair assumption that the Ryan Government appointed a man whose record justified them in believing that he would be an acceptable </para>

This Judge gave a decision, which was apparently accepted by the men, with one exception, but because in the exercise of his authority and the redemption of his responsibility he gave in his decision one item which the men would not accept, they claimed the right not only to break the law, and cast his decision to the winds, but also to bring the whole of the railway system of that portion of Queensland to a standstill. And now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> demand that because these lawbreakers will npt accept the  decision of one Judge they should have the right to appeal to another. The thing seems utterly absurd. The men who ask for arbitration must first show a willingness to abide by its results. These men have had arbitration, and have practically said by their acts, which speak louder than words, " The only arbitration we will accept is that which gives us what we want." </para>

                        <para>This request means that the services of a Judge of the Federal Arbitration Court should be made available every time a body of workers refuses the decision of a State Judge. It cannot apply only in one case. Do my. honorable friends urge that because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> McCawley's decision is not acceptable to the men they are to have a sort of right to ask for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins' services? Does not the same thing apply when the workers object to a decision of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Heydon in New South Wales? Will not a union in any State that finds fault with the decision given by its own tribunal have an equal right to ask that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins should go there? Has it come to this, that arbitration depends solely on the decision of one Judge? Is it not well to recognise the fact that behind all this is the absolute refusal of the men to accept any verdict with which they do not agree ? . If that is the position, it is idle for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> to say that all the workers want is the sweet reasonableness of arbitration. They will have to learn somehow or other, either by the action of the public or by force of circumstances, that there can be no arbitration worth a rap unless they loyally abide by the decisions which that arbitration brings. </para>

When these farmers offered to get supplies so badly needed out there, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.- Ryan</inline> became indignant 'and condemned "this threatened  illegal act." He had not a word to say about the illegal action of the men who were breaking the award of the Court, and who would not allow anybody else to run  the  railways. He stood by those men who were in revolt. It was only when, the farmers and settlers said, " We will take steps to get the food out there, which is necessary for those who are nearest and dearest to us " that he became horrorstricken. </para>

                                <para>- Because your strike is breaking down. When the farmers asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to take over these railways in order to supply them with food, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> immediately became indignant and exclaimed, "Keep your hands off. This is a State matter. Don't you dare touch anything connected with our railways." So I say that this strike is a State  matter, too. It is a matter concerning the State Government of Queensland and its own employees, and if the Commonwealth Government would have committed an impropriety, as it was alleged it would, by attempting to keep the wheels moving on that line for the purpose of carrying food to the settlers, because it was a State rail way, let <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> apply the same doctrine to the strike on that railway, and proceed to deal with it through the State Judiciary which he has established. </para>

                        <para>There is another matter which is worth referring to. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> invited the Prime Minister to take some steps in connexion with waterside labour in order to get supplies u,p there. He pointed out the position in which the settlers were placed on account of the stoppage of supplies. In other words, he wanted the Commonwealth Government to step in, and, by keeping supplies going by water, to break his strike for him. If the Commonwealth Government had been in a position to restore the Inter-State trade along the coast, the effect would have been to break the strike. </para>

I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that, although there are associated with the present strike many men who in the past have exhibited a loyal desire to assist in the prosecution of the war there are to be found in their ranks to-day every man who has stood out prominently in opposition to recruiting. All the men who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> were anti-recruiters, are to-day standing side by side with the strikers. </para>

                                <para>- The cheap gibes of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> pass me by as the idle wind. Why, resolutions have been passed in opposition to recruiting by the very bodies upon whose behalf he has been speaking to-day. Only the other day certain members of the Trades Hall, Sydney, were successfully prosecuted for taking up a hostile attitude towards recruiting. I do not say that every striker is an opponent of recruiting, because in the ranks of those who are voluntarily idle to-day' there are hundreds of good, loyal men, misled though they may be. But every man whose attitude towards the war has laid him open to suspicion is to-day standing in the ranks of the strikers and behind them. </para>

There are only two explanations for it. In the first place, these gentlemen begin to sense defeat for the men they have led astray, and they are now trying to move heaven and earth to open some door through which their dupes may pass back to work. </para>

                                <para>- I am glad that the honorable senator is gaining such an intimate acquaintance with our Standing Orders. The first explanation of this activity in parliamentary circles arises from the fact I have mentioned and from another one which was set out very tersely by one of my honorable friend's friends when addressing an audience on the Yarra bank yesterday. Before quoting his remarks, may I remind honorable senators that it is a singular circumstance that the men who are leading these various strikes to-day are not the public leaders to whom the rank and file might reasonably look for guidance. The latter have been singularly silent. The individuals who are leading the strike in Sydney are not the older men of the political Labour party there- </para>

I want to know why they are not down here on this platform? They have become too respectable to meet with you workers nowadays. They should be here taking their places with the men who are fighting the battles of the working classes, who put them where they are. Frank Anstey writes in the <inline font-style="italic">LabourCall,</inline> but why is he not here ? And all the other Labour members, both of the State and Federal Parliaments, are the same. </para>

Personally, I viewed the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> as one lacking in <inline font-style="italic">bona fides.</inline> I considered that it was an effort to utilize the services of a Judge of the Arbitration Court merely for the purpose of enabling <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> to escape from what might otherwise have - been  an awkward political position. The proposition which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> has put forward to-day is that men who are not satisfied with the decision of one properly constituted arbitration tribunal shall have the right  of  immediate recourse to another. If he wishes to act as the friend of those on whose behalf he has submitted this motion, he should tell them that they have no right to appeal for the assistance of an arbitration tribunal unless they show that they are prepared loyally to accept the decision of such a tribunal when it is given, whether they approve of it  or  not. </para>

                            <para>. - I wish to make a few remarks, chiefly in reply to the attitude which the Government have adopted with regard to the very reasonable request made to them by the Queensland Government, that the gentleman who, perhaps, stands highest in the estimation of the general public as an arbitrator - I  refer  to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins - should  be  allowed, at the request of both sides,  to settle an industrial trouble which arose in Queensland. We have seen the extraordinary squirming - if I may use what is, perhaps, an offensive term - of the Leader of the Government in the Senate in replying to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks.</inline> He, first of all, complained that the letter which the honorable senator sent him yesterday placed him in a difficult position. No honorable member of the Senate or of another place, intending to move a motion of adjournment, has ever given the Leader of a Government a more complete indication of the course he intended to take than did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> in that letter. In a straightforward and courteous way he indicated exactly what he intended to do. When he found that in submitting a motion for the adjournment of the Senate he was obliged under the Standing Orders to deal with a specific subject, he again communicated with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and stated the subject with which he proposed to deal. </para>

                                <para>- Let us consider the honorable senator's attitude with regard to the strike in Queensland.

                        <para class="block">Ryan, very properly indicated that his Government were responsible for running those railways. Because the Queensland Government would not allow the Commonwealth Government to interfere unconstitutionally with State affairs, we are invited to believe that that is to stand as a reason why the assistance of the Commonwealth Government should not be given to the Queensland Government when it is requested by that Government. In the whole of this business, the only thing which honorable senators opposite can urge against the Premier of Queensland is that he has done, with regard to the industrial trouble in his State, what should have been done by other Governments in dealing with a similar condition of affairs. He has found a settlement of the trouble. </para>

                                <para>- When, for their personal advantage, they can no longer use the influence of unionists, they become the bitterest opponents that unionism ever had. I shall not use any offensive term to that section of persons who have been brought into the public life of the country by organized unionism, and whose kindest word now is more bitter than the condemnation of the bitterest Tory, but I shall refer to them as the malignants of the Labour party. That is a term that fits them well. I shall not go outside the Standing Orders to refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's statement yesterday. It was quite in keeping with the attitude of the malignant section. He said, " Surely the men in the unions to-day are the same type as the unionists of yesterday." </para>

                                <para>- It is not rubbish to say that there is ah organized attack upon unionism. Any person possessed of ordinary intelligence must be aware that in certain circles, and among the governing bodies and those who have always been opposed to Labour, there is to-day being carried out a well-organized and well-prepared attack upon unionism in Australia. I have heard one man, a pastoralist, who I do not say is a representative man in any sense, saying that if they could win in this strike and break unionism, though it cost them a million of money, it would pay them well to do it, in the interests of the pastoral industry. </para>

The real difficulty with honorable senators opposite in this matter is that the Queensland Government and the Queensland strikers have found a means of amicably settling their industrial dispute. Because there is an organized and deliberately prepared attack upon unionism generally, the Federal Government takes up the attitude that they should not lift a little finger to help both parties to the Queensland dispute to arrive at a satisfactory settlement of their differences. </para>

The true position of affairs is that the Queensland Government have not only brought about a peaceful settlement of the dispute, but the basis of it is a condition that the most reputable arbitration Judge in Australia should be asked to arbitrate between the parties. </para>

It would be considered the height of absurdity for any one to say that, because there are burglars, our law against burglary is a failure. No one would contend that we should repeal our criminal law because, although for years we have had the punishment of death as a penalty for murder, that crime still occurs. </para>

A man charged with the most trivial offence before a magistrate is given the right of appeal to a Judge.

                                <para>- I have not the slightest doubt that before arbitration is the success which many of its ardent supporters hoped it would be, and of whom I claim to be one, there will be some provision for appeal. I can claim that during the last fifteen or sixteen years We have to thank arbitration for very much. If we take the pastoral industry, there have now been ten years of industrial peace in that industry as the result of arbitration. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator certainly said that every Tory was represented in the league. Immediately after the league was formed, and before any announcement of its policy had been made - in fact, before any statement as to what the league was to be had been published - a Brisbane newspaper came out with an article under this huge headline, " Another Anti-Labour League Formed."It will be recognised that ever since the inception of the league the object of our honorable friends on the other side, from Queensland, has been to decry the league in every shape and form. </para>

                                <para>- We consider that, in order to protect the interests of the soldiers, it is necessary that they should have political representation. It appears to me to be quite fair and reasonable that returned soldiers should have representation in Parliament, just the same as any other section of the community. </para>

When an urgent request was sent down to the Federal Government that they should take some action to interfere in the strike, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> who was Prime Minister, pointed out that it was simply and solely a local affair, and that it was not within the province of the Federal Government to interfere. </para>

                                <para>- To my mind it was a question of State rights. On numerous occasions the Ryan Government have squealed about the maintenance of State rights. They have frequently objected to the Commonwealth Government interfering with the State rights of Queensland just so far as it pleased them. But when it suits the Ryan Government to ask the Commonwealth Government to interfere in an affair where they are likely to gain some credit which is not due to them, they are quite ready to make a request. </para>

                                <para>- I wish to point out that, in spite of all the praise which has been bestowed upon the Ryan Government by honorable senators on the other side this morning, during their term of office there has been probably four or five times as much industrial unrest in Queensland as was ever known before. And what is still more important, there has been more discontent amongst the public servants in Queensland since the Ryan Government came into power. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> simply moved the adjournment of the Senate to-day to set out the good points of the Ryan Government, I think that he has failed very miserably. Again, take the statement he made regarding the vote of no-confidence which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tolmie</inline> moved against the Ryan Government, because of the action they took in connexion with the strike. The statement goes to prove that the honorable senator is, as I said, simply trying to defend the action of the State Government, and to deplore the conduct of the Leader of the Opposition in the Queensland Assembly. I have no more to say, except that as one who is interested in Queensland, and wishes to see its State rights preserved, I sincerely hope that the Commonwealth Government will take no action to interfere in the dispute between the Queensland Labour Government and its employees. </para>

                        <para>It seems to me that the Federal Government, in conjunction with the other antiLabour Governments throughout the Commonwealth, will not only do nothing to smooth out the existing industrial difficulties, but will throw as many obstacles in the way of a settlement as they possibly can. This request for the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins is a most reasonable one. It would apparently be the means of completely smoothing out the difficulty in Queensland. It may be that, later, the men would want still better conditions than they have now. That is a most reasonable anticipation, I think. </para>

                        <para>During the maritime strike of 1890 a very considerable number of men were unemployed. Their earnings ceased, and certain things followed. It will be remembered that a commercial crisis was immediately followed by a very serious financial collapse. It will be remembered, too, that the banks and other financial institutions in Melbourne were unable to meet their obligations, and that depositors lost their money to the extent of between £17,000,000 and £20,000,000. To a lesser extent 'that applied in Sydney, where probably from £5,000,000 to £6,000,000 was lost. </para>
                        <para>The Federal Government has an opportunity of doing a very great deal to bring the present industrial dispute to an end ; but, so far as I can see, it is determined to do nothing in that direction, not even to permit <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins to go to Queensland for a few days to dispose of the small differences that exist there. What is going to follow ? At the present time, we have, I suppose, quite 100,000 men out of work. The wages of those directly and indirectly concerned represent probably £500,000 per week. To that) extent, money is not being circulated. </para>

                                <para>- In just one moment I will, sir. I propose to show honorable senators on the other side that the North Queensland strike is only part of the existing industrial trouble, and that, in view of the almost certain following of a financial crisis, they ought to leave nothing undone to settle disputes of that sort. Do they realize what it means ? Have they forgotten how the various banks in Melbourne and Sydney were rushed years ago? Why? Simply because a considerable number of union men were having a holiday for a\ few weeks. That is taking place now. We are losing about £500,000 per week on account of wages not being paid. That will not continue very long before we shall have another financial crisis upon us. It will not continue very long before the banks in Melbourne and Sydney will be rushed. A financial crisis, perhaps equal to that which occurred in Australia in 1891, will probably be the result. The Government should realize what this means. I know they are anxious to win the war, but we will not even be trying to do that unless we endeavour to smooth out our own difficulties. There is no reason at all why the Government should not grant the request .from the Queensland Government in order to settle this dispute. I ask them not to forget what was the result of the 1891 strike, because, as surely as daylight follows darkness, notwithstanding the ability of this country to produce wealth in all its forms, if the men who do this work - and they are not the Fairbairns - are not dealt with justly, this country will be up against a proposition similar to that which confronted it in 1891. On that account, I urge the Government to do nothing to support the ill-advised action of the New South Wales Railways ' Commissioners. </para>

The whole position is absurd, from beginning to end, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> were not blind, he would realize how ridiculous the position is. Now what are the facts? I know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> McCawley very well. He is a personal friend of mine, and so I know his views on many matters. I am certain that his bias, or sympathy, is on the side of the workers, and, in regard to this dispute, he did his best. He gave them an award, with good conditions of work, but declined to make the award retrospective. Honorable senators . will see that this would set up a new principle in arbitration? It might suit a Government in a position to pay the award, but it would absolutely ruin private! employers. In consequence of this decision the railway men defied the Arbitration Court and the Government, which, though elected to administer the laws on "Behalf of the people of the country, failed ignobly to carry out their duties as a constituted authority, so I have nothing complimentary to say about) that Administration. </para>

The honorable senator must know how the people of Richmond and Cloncurry were suffering because the Queensland Government failed in their duty.

                                <para>- I never said that. I know men who live on it, but the big majority of the leaders, do not. I know from experience that they do not, but there are * any number of them at the present time living on it, and there is a degenerate class coming into the movement that are leading the men out on strike. There are men like these in the Australian Workers Union with Industrial Workers of the World views, men full of disloyal sentiments, who are using the Labour movement for their own purposes; and the men who represent the Labour movement have not the courage to denounce those who are ruining the movement and ruining Australia. </para>

                                <para>- I was challenged by an interjection to prove what I had been saying. I set out to prove that, in a Queensland shed, the shearers defied their own executive, broke the law, and went out on strike; and that, finally, the pastoralists had to give them the rise to 27s. 6d. per 100 which they went out for. Those men broke their own agreement, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> admits. It is these defyings  and breakings of agreements that are making all the trouble; and every executive and governmental power, should be brought to bear to compel the men to carry out the law and obey the decision of the Court. I congratulate the National Government on refusing to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins to go to Queensland to intervene, when the law has been defied in the way it has been in that State, and in view of the way the Ryan Ministry have backed down and made a farce of constitutional government. The whole business has been worse than a Gilbert and Sullivan comedy. What really made the people of Australia send the Nationalists into power in this Parliament, -as much as the desire to win the war, was their intention that the National Government should see that arbitration agreements were carried out, and constitutional government restored. </para>

                            <para>- The question of retrospective pay is not a new one. I am a member of an organization which has a case before the Arbitration Court at the present time. The different employers, and the members of that organization, are now engaged in conference, and retrospective pay has been agreed to between the parties, and was, indeed, suggested by the Judge of the Court himself. This is a question of industrial peace rather than of industrial war, and there is no analogy whatever between the trouble which occurred' in Queensland in 1912, and which was referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> and the request which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> has put forward to-day. </para>

                        <para>. - It is a pity that the names of the Justices who preside over our Arbitration Courts should have been dragged into the political arena. Considerations of propriety are usually sufficient to keep the names of these Justices outside of our political discussions. Anybody looking at the question soberly must admit that it is a great blunder to drag into our political controversies the names of gentlemen who occupy high judicial positions. </para>

                            <para>- Having initiated the debate, the honorable senator alone is responsible for anything that has since been said in that connexion. I regret to say that the principle of arbitration, and, indeed, everything connected with trade unionism, ' is gradually drifting into a worse position. Where things will end, it is difficult to foresee. The whole position would be comical if it were not tragic. To-day, we actually find men holding responsible positions as members of this Senate urging that one Judge should he set over the head of another Judge, simply because the award of the one has not been satisfactory. When we drag into politics that aspect pf our Arbitration Court proceedings, we are rendering the worst service that we can to that institution. </para>

                            <para>- No; this is a matter which is quite outside the jurisdiction of the Court. I speak as one who rendered as much service in securing the principle of arbitration in Australia as most men rendered. For quite a number of years, we battled to secure compulsory arbitration at a time when men who are now misleading the Labour movement were unheard, of. The old-time trade unionists have had a bitter experience pf industrial warfare. We had to fight for years to secure Arbitration Courts, and in those days it required a man of backbone to he a leader of trade unionism. </para>

                    <para class="block">Having, in matters of conciliation and arbitration, devised the best machinery known to any country in! the world, action after action is now being taken to bring the principle of conciliation and arbitration into disrepute and contempt. The proposal that Judge McCawley should step down in order that another Judge might review the case,, could only be adequately reviewed by Gilbert and Sullivan. Any sane man must be prompted to ask, " Where is it all going to end?" For years the South American Republics have been the laughingstock of the civilized world. But what a picture will Australia present to future Gilberts and Sullivans? Instead of going to the Balkans and other little States for the scenes of their comic operas, they will come to Australia. The action which has been taken here to-day is really another move in the direction, of dragging trade unionism into the mud. </para>

                            <para>- There are many men connected with the Labour party to-day who, in the past, have ridiculed the principle of arbitration in every shape and form; who told the old Labourites, when they, advocated arbitration, that they were merely hacks for the capitalistic class. There are men occupying prominent positions in the Labour party to-day who, in a great measure, are responsible for bringing about the existing condition of affairs. These individuals jump, quickly from one position to another. One day they are advocating the principle of compulsory arbitration, and the next they are espousing the cause of direct action. In the light of these facts, it is undeniable that the whole machinery of arbitration is being brought into the realm of absurdity. But I have no desire to occupy further time. I merely wish to say that those who do not believe in arbitration ought to take up a definite attitude by declaring that they have done with arbitration, and that, in fighting for trade union principles in the future, their weapon will be the strike. They cannot have both Arbitration Courts and the  weapon  of the strike left in their hands. But, at present, they are making use of both as the opportunity presents itself. </para>

                        <para>. - I listened very attentively to the debate which took place here yesterday, and also to the discussion which has occupied our time to-day. Honorable senators opposite know that for some time past there have been in the ranks of trade unionism, two distinct classes of thought. There has been that class which believes that the political and industrial emancipation of the workers can be achieved by constitutional and legislative methods; and there has been another class which believes that that result-can be achieved only by direct action. The latter have designated themselves the " militant " section of trade unionism. There has been a conflict in the Labour movement for many, years between these two classes. </para>

                            <para>- There has been a conflict for the past ten years. I wish to remind honorable senators opposite that, some time ago, the direct-action section of the Labour movement, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peter</inline> Bowling, came into conflict with the section led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> consequent upon the attempt of the former to bring about a general strike in the coal and shipping industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> was associated with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in the efforts which he put forth then to avert such a calamity. It was eventually recognised by the great body of unionists that, if they had accepted the advice of Peter Bowling, unionism would have been destroyed. Ultimately, I repeat, the reasons put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes, Senator Guthrie,</inline> and others who took a prominent part in the fight, triumphed; with the result that the trade .unions- of New South Wales and Australia were saved. Later, owing to the development which occurred at the time of the referendum, that section of the Labour party which believes in. constitutional and legislative methods was expelled from the movement. They left behind them that section which believes in direct action, and which has, in this Parliament, and in the State Parliaments, certain members who follow the leaders of direct action outside, but dare not open their mouths upon this question. While the direct actionists  were bringing about disaster to unionism in Australia, my honorable friends opposite remained silent. They have remained silent until they know that defeat stares them in the face, and now they come to the Government and ask it to intervene. </para>

They mean that action should now be taken to avert defeat, and to turn defeat" into victory for the direct-action section of the Labour movement, by enabling them to say to the followers whom they have deluded, and led into this position - " See how we have saved you.

                    <para>What is the argument that is used by these honorable senators? They ask us to look at the suffering that these strikes are inflicting on the community; to look at the thousands of innocent people who are being turned out of work every day, and think of the women and children who are being starved as a result. That is exactly what we who have advocated legislative action have always pointed out as the reason why arbitration should take the place of the strike. These gentlemen are against arbitration and constitutional methods, and contend that the strike is the right and proper weapon to use. Honorable senators opposite, who are tongue-tied because they have not the courage to tell their followers that they are wrong, come along now' and ask us to save the community from all this suffering. Who has inflicted the suffering upon the community? Who is responsible for it? Are not those who are preaching direct action immediately responsible for it? They are not to have their dignity offended; they are not to be asked to back down or to say, " We made a mistake; we led you into a morass. We led you to disaster." Oh, no, they must not be asked to say anything of the kind, but the Government must come along and surrender. We are to place the militant section and the supporters of direct action in a position to say, " See how we dictated terms to the Government of Queensland, and told them what they must do. The Government of Queensland are prepared to give us what we demanded as a result of the strike." But they want a catspaw. That is the plain truth, and honorable senators opposite know it. ' </para>
                    <para>What is asked for is not merely that certain pay should be retrospective. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> knows that these men are asking that they should be paid for striking, for breaking the law which they had a voice in making. They are asking that they should be paid for flouting the Court which a Government of their own creation established. Honorable senators opposite, who know this as well as I do, have not the courage to get up and tell their deluded followers that they have been deluded. They have not the courage to tell them that the right thing for them to do is to obey the law which they made and the Courts which they created. They desire, forsooth, that the Federal Government should be a party to a base surrender of the rights of the people of Queensland, in order that men may be paid for having broken the law. If the Queensland Government take up that position, and expect this Government to condone it and be a party to it, they mistake altogether the purpose for which the members of this party are here, and for which the present Federal Government was formed. The members of this party are here, and this Government was formed, for the deliberate purpose of upholding responsible government, and not government by terrorism and force; not that a minority shall have the right to starve the people into submission. That is what the strike amounts to. </para>
                    <para>What really is this strike which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> tells us was decided upon by ten to one of those concerned in it ? The strikers told the people of North Queensland, "Unless you compel the Government to climb down and give us all that we ask we will starve you." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> has talked of the brutal capitalist starving the workmen, but what difference is there between the methods of the capitalist who takes advantage of an overstocked labour market to starve labour into submission and those of the railway strikers of North Queensland, who endeavoured to starve the people of that State into submission? </para>

But they all come here, and say that because' of the effects of the strike we should do what the strikers ask. If that be so, it is a direct intimation to the party of direct action outside that they have only to take direct action, and because of its effects any Government will be forced to climb down. If we are going in for that sort of government in Australia, let us be open and aboveboard about it. Let us say plainly that we do not believe in governing the country by parliamentary institutions and by law, but that we propose deliberately to hand over the government of the country to the executives of these unions, and let them say what is to be done and it shall be done. It is far better that we should do that than- that we should carry on the farce of law-making and of government through Parliament, and, at the same time, hand over the real power of government to the union executives. </para>

The people are learning the lesson, and they will exact retribution from those who have taught them the lesson. Did we not learn the lesson of the maritime strike? What lesson did it teach us? It taught the trade unionists of Australia that by industrial action we could do nothing to improve the  condi-tions  of the mass of the people. It taught them that a strike is a boomerang, which comes back and hits those who use it. It was out of the maritime strike that there arose the political Labour movement, with the idea of achieving through political action what trade unionists had utterly failed to achieve through industrial action. Yet some honorable senators opposite, who with us learned that lesson of the maritime strike, are to-day so timid and so craven as to allow, without protest, the same spirit that led the Labour movement to disaster in the maritime strike to lead it again to disaster to-day. </para>

                        <para>. - The speech which has just been delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is a very strong argument in support of the request of the Queensland Government which has been approved by honorable senators on this side, since it would mean the avoidance of the direct action which the honor able senator says is so detrimental to Australia. We desire that this matter should be settled by an arbitration tribunal. That is the purpose of the request of the Queensland Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has just delivered a direct-action speech. I wish I could take the view of the present position which is taken by some honorable senators on the Government side. They profess to see something of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera about this great industrial trouble, but it is altogether too serious a matter for such comment. The levity of honorable senators opposite is entirely misplaced at the present time. </para>

                    <para>I wish to put <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> right on one point, and that is with regard to the request for the forwarding of foodstuffs to the Gulf ports. It had no application to the North Queensland railway strike, because, although a boat carrying foodstuffs would pass Townsville, the cargo would be sent round by Normanton, and at the time the request was made the men who went out on strike were back at work on the Northern railway. When a request was made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fuller,</inline> the Acting Premier of New South Wales, to expedite the sending of flour to the Gulf ports, following the cue of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.- Hughes,</inline> he tried to get in a political shot, and replied to the effect that a train load of flour would be sent along if the Government of Queensland could guarantee that it would be handled on the Queensland side of the border. </para>

It is that he, as  President  of the Sugar Producers Association, was wiring to all the sugar districts asking the farmers to stand firm by their strike, while at the same time he was harvesting his own crop in the Mossman district. </para>

No, they are not. They may temporarily succeed in their object, but the reaction that will overwhelm them afterwards will be far greater than any boomerang effect which they have sought to apply to the action of the workers. </para>

Evidently they are out to keep this industrial ferment going. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> almost confirmed every word I uttered this morning in that regard when he talked about retribution overtaking the Labour party and the Labour movement as a result of these strikes. He almost "blew out" in his exultation over the fact that retribution would come to the Labour party and Labour movement as a result of the industrial upheaval throughout the Commonwealth at the present time. The National party are looking for what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> described the other day as " good stuff."  His  troubles about the war, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> troubles about industrial peace so long as they can get " good stuff " for electioneering. That seems to be their main object. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> I think, expected industrial trouble when he called the men into camp. If he could have got industrial trouble then, realizing that we as a party always suffer after a strike, although they accuse us of fomenting strikes for political reasons, he would have come with a sweep on the question of conscription, and I believe that, in those circumstances, he would have carried it. It was only the leaders of the industrial movement throughout Australia - the men who have been so derided, and even abused, here to-day - who were responsible for keeping the workers as a body from making any industrial demonstration at that time. Therefore, they thwarted the desires of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> They did not want the workers to be brought out, on account of men being called into camp in answer to the. proclamation for home service. They tell us that we cannot have it both ways, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has it both ways. He has it by legislative means, and he has it through the War Precautions Act in deregistering unions, in refusing preference to unionists, and in a dozen other ways. </para>

I feel quite sure that the obstinacy of the Government in supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> bitter attack on the State of Queensland will confirm the widely existing impression outside that' the Government is determined at all hazards, at the risk of losing industrial peace, or even at the risk of interfering with war preparations, to continue this well-prepared attack on unionism to the bitter end. That is the impression outside, and here is a confirmation to-day in the support and remarks given by honorable senators on the other side. </para>

                <para>That the Senate do now adjourn, </para>
                <para>I should like to refer to a matter which was brought up in this chamber some time ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks.</inline> It will be remembered that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> made a statement imputing that some manipulation of the soldiers' votes had taken place in connexion with the military service referendum, and that he also raised some doubt as to the accuracy with which certain votes were counted and added to the totals after the result of the poll in connexion with the recent election had been announced. If those statements had any substance in them, they would have constituted an extremely grave charge, because if there is one thing upon which the people of Australia are united more than any other, irrespective of their political feelings, it is their determination that their electoral machinery shall be kept perfectly free from any manipulation of that kind. In view of the statements made, and of the suspicion thus created, I felt justified in personally making an investigation so that I might not only satisfy myself as to the facts, but also be in , a position to bring before the Senate such further evidence as might be obtainable in support of the official figures which had been given. The result of my investigations, I am sure, will be very interesting. The following facts have been placed on record by the Chief Electoral Officer with reference to the naval and military vote in connexion with the military service referendum : - </para>
                <para>The scrutiny and counting of the votes took place at the following centres :  - (a) London, (b) Rabaul, (c) capital cities of the Commonwealth. The responsible Returning Officers were respectively - London, Brigadier-General Anderson; Rabaul, Brigadier-General Pethebridge; capital cities of the Commonwealth, Messrs. J. G. McLaren, R. H. Lawson, R. H. Allars, O. H. Stephens, J. E. Cathie, and S. Irwin, Commonwealth electoral officers for the several States. The results of the count were communicated by the responsible Returning Officer at each centre to the Chief Electoral Officer for the Commonwealth, and were accepted only after verification. The attached statement accurately represents the result of the referendum in so far as these votes are concerned. </para>
                <para class="block">I am reading from the official minute supplied to me by Mr.' Oldham, the Chief Electoral Officer, and the figures I am about, to read are supported by a certificate signed by the individual officers whose names I have mentioned.

                    <para>At the time of the official publication of the results of the voting on the referendum in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> of 23rd November, 1916, the whole of the overseas votes had been included in the count, and the outstanding votes which were subsequently counted and embodied in the statistical returns were cast in Australia almost exclusively under the provision of section 9 of the Act under which the referendum was held. The suggestion that some wickedly-disposed person or persons " manipulated " the overseas naval and military voting returns, either in connexion with the referendum or the elections, .scarcely appears to call for official comment. It may, however, be stated that in the case of the voting on the referendum the scrutiny abroad was conducted by the Returning Officers, with the assistance df responsible officials (many of whom were officers of the electoral administration), in the presence of Australian citizens, who certified to the correctness of the count, and that in the case of the elections the overseas scrutiny was similarly conducted in the presence of scrutineers appointed by the political parties, who' jointly certified to the ac7curacy of the proceedings in regard to the checking, allocation, scrutiny, and counting of the votes. </para>

                <para class="block">The civilian witnesses who certified to the scrutiny of the overseas vote in connexion with the military service referendum at the recent election, as counted in London, were: - Messrs. O. C. Beale, New South Wales; T. Baker, Victoria; D. P. Dickson', New South Wales; B. Moulden, South Australia; J. A. Robertson, Queensland; and the  Hon.  R. B. Rees, Victoria. These were Australian gentlemen who happened to be in London, and were appointed by Brigadier-General Anderson to act as witnesses at the scrutiny. These gentlemen, therefore, were parties either to the accuracy of the counting or to the manipulation of those votes. I also find amongst the records a certificate, and in connexion with this matter I remind honorable senators that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks'</inline> suggestion, indeed his statement, was that in the recent election the soldiers' votes had not been allocated to the districts to which they belonged - in other words, that we were jerrymandering the votes, and allocating them to districts where the, were wanted.

                <para>I come back now to the genesis of those figures relating to the military service referendum. In the official minute which I have just read it is stated that the  figures were published in Australia on the day following the vote. That waa a Sunday, and my investigations have led me to the interesting" discovery that on the day mentioned a telegram, addressed to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper, was lodged at the Sale telegraph office by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Overend,</inline> who, I understand, is the local correspondent of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> The telegram did not appear. It was suppressed by the censor owing to its inaccuracy, but it was worded as follows : - </para>
                <para>At the conclusion of  11  o'clock Mass at St. Mary's Cathedral yesterday morning <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Phelan,</inline> after removing his vestments and stepping outside the altar, announced to the congregation that the Australian soldiers' votes recorded in the trenches on the referendum were  106,000  " Noes " against  43,000  " Yes " - a majority of  63,000  votes for the " Noes." Voting passed off smoothly at Sale, considerable interest aroused, but nothing special occurred in the way of incidents. (Sgd.) Overend. </para>
                <para>That is the first evidence that I have been able to obtain as to the publication of these figures. There is undoubted proof that they did not originate in Dublin, but that they originated here. The telegram, as I have stated, was received at the telegraph office in this city, and was brought under the notice of the censor, who declined to allow its publication because of its obvious inaccuracy, as the vote had not then been counted. As a matter of fact, it was not until the first of November following that the Chief Electoral Officer in Australia received a progress report from London, and at that time less than half the votes had been counted. I am not concerned to know how Bishop Phelan obtained his information. I am merely concerned with my duty to bring it before the Senate, and, through the Senate, before the people of this country, so that they may know exactly where the figures originated. </para>
                <para>We come now to the question of their publication in Dublin. Honorable senators will please remember the dates. The information was published in <inline font-style="italic">Freeman's Journal</inline> in Dublin on 5th January-. The telegram lodged at the Sale telegraph office was censored, so it is quite clear that those who were concerned in giving the figures publicity knew that they would have no chance of cabling the information, because if a telegram intended for circulation within Australia was held up by the censor, obviously the same message as a cable would also fall under the ban of the censor. If honorable senators will remember the dates they will see that there was just sufficient time to get this news Home through the post. It was suppressed here in the early days of November, and was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Freeman's Journal</inline> in Dublin in the early days of January as follows: - </para>

                    <para>It is a remarkable fact that the figures of the voting by the Anzac troops in the Australian referendum on conscription have never appeared in the British press, although two months have now elapsed since the referendum was taken. It will be remembered that when the early figures of the voting in Australia were published, and showed a relatively small majority against conscription, that advocates of that policy expressed the confident hops that when the votes of the men actually serving and other Australians resident abroad were counted they would be found to reverse the decision of their fellow countrymen at home. The failing to publish the voting of the troops was in itself extremely significant, but we are now - </para>

Shortly after the vote was taken, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> moved on this side for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into all the rumours going about regarding the result of the soldiers' vote. Various estimates were given, and various calculations made. Why was the information now given kept back for twelve months? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was most explicit when moving for the appointment of a Select Committee in saying that we only wanted to know' how the vote went. The reason given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who was then leading the Government in the Senate, for the refusal to give the information was that the result of the soldiers' vote could not be made public because the Imperial authorities had said that, for military reasons, it was not to be divulged. If those military reasons existed then, do they exist to-day? If they do not exist to-day, did they exist then ? What object had the then Government in refusing the information then asked for by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> per medium of a Select Committee? They refused to appoint a Select Committee to inquire into the very things on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has made his statement this afternoon. </para>

                    <para>. - I referred last night to the question of the cablegrams sent in connexion with the offer of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to communicate with the British authorities to get them to take a certain quantity of evaporated apples. The Minister, in his reply, seemed to resent the attitude I took up, and my two Tasmanian colleagues, Senators Keating and Earle, almost read me a lecture. I thought I was raising the matter in the right way and at the right time and place, and, therefore, I did not bother to ask anybody else what course I should take. I am still satisfied that I took no unfair course. I urged that there had been an unwarrantable delay in getting from the British authorities a reply to the request made on behalf of the Australian fruit-growers. I still think there was a delay occasioned either by a mistake made by the High Commissioner or in the Prime Minister's Department. I was told that the Prime Minister communicated directly with the Secretary of State, which was the right course, and that when the Premier of Tasmania found that the reply was so long delayed he should have communicated with the Prime Minister direct instead of with his Agent-General in London. That is a matter between the Premier of Tasmania and the Prime Minister, but the fact remains that the delay occurred. My statement that this is a matter of very serious importance to many thousands of fruit-growers in Australia, and a few thousands in Tasmania - a question of very nearly ruin or otherwise to a large number - is borne out by the following statement which I received only to-day from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> E.

                        <para>During the season of 1916, 1,300,000 cases of apples were exported from the Commonwealth to oversea markets. Notwithstanding this large exportation, apples were sold in the city markets at ruinous prices. Since then many hundred acres of orchard have come into bearing, and a much larger output may be expected in 1918. The exportation of 1,500,000 cases in a dried form will be about the quantity we would have shipped under normal conditions. But we have sent away between 300,000 and 400,000 young men, who would have been our chief consumers. It follows that unless at least 1,000,000 bushels are exported in some form the future of the fruit-growers is absolutely hopeless.

The ship was delayed through striking a mine, or was torpedoed. We are informed that the insurance companies decline to pay insurance, as the apples have arrived. But as the Imperial Government take all war risks we are of the opinion that the Prime Minister should be urged to communicate with the Imperial authorities to make good the loss. We have to pay heavy insurance, and it seems hard that we should have also to bear the loss when trouble arises. If the Imperial Government does not pay the insurance it means that the growers not only lose their fruit, but will have to pay about 3s. to 4s. per case to make up for freight and expenses. </para>

                        <para>- That is not material. It is the delay that is of such grave importance, because the people concerned have to make preparations for' evaporating the fruit that is going to be taken by the Imperial authorities. I have a rather bitter reason, personally, for being able to substantiate the statement in paragraph 5 about the 1915-16 season. I was an orchardist in a small way in Victoria, and owing to the enormous surplus prevailing in the four apple-growing States at about the same time, there was an immense surplus in Australia in the early part of 1917, and many of us lost the little cash we had invested. I know it hit me pretty hard. There is every probability in the coming season of another large crop. </para>

                        <para>- In the apple-growing districts it is possible at this time of the year to get a very fair idea of what the crop is going to be. Of course, they have to chance a number of pests striking them, but this time last year they knew pretty well what the crop was likely to be. It looks at the present moment as if there is going to be a very large crop in the apple-growing districts of Victoria and Tasmania, and growers are afraid that in the absence of shipping facilities there will be a large local surplus. If that is so, they will have to depend on some other means of disposing of their produce. With reference to paragraph 7 of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan's</inline> letter, they will have to pay 3s., or perhaps 4s., per case to make up the freight and expenses. </para>

                        <para>- It is very hard luck for them. Surely that circumstance in itself justifies the representative of a fruit-growing State in bringing forward this matter, and in 'urging the Govern- . ment to do everything in its power to assist the growers, especially in view of the fact that some weeks ago the Prime Minister promised to do what he could in that direction. Of course, it was pointed out last night that if anybody is to blame for the delay which has occurred, it is the Premier of Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- It does not matter to any Tasmanian representative where the fault lies. What does matter is that everything should be done to expedite a decision in regard to the offer which has been made to the Imperial authorities. If the delay which has occurred was unavoidable -and the Vice-President of the Executive Council last night attempted to show that it was - I do hope that there will be no more delay, and that the Government will do everything in 'their power to induce the Imperial authorities to say promptly whether or not they intend to purchase this evaporated fruit. If they do not intend to purchase it, I trust that the Commonwealth Government will step in, and rescue the fruit-growers of Tasmania from the grave difficulty which now confronts them. </para>
