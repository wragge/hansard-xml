                <para>I have much pleasure in submitting this motion. I need hardly remind honorable senators that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has had a long and honorable parliamentary experience. Except for a short period, this Senate has known him from its inception. It has learned to recognise his ability and firmness in debate, and his virtues as a private citizen. The Senate has carried out its work under his presidency, and so we have had the advantage of the opportunity to judge the ability and impartiality with which he has filled the high office of  President.  It is but fair to him to say that while he has filled this high and important office he has dealt out even-handed justice to every interest represented in this Chamber. Having had experience of his work, and being satisfied as to his qualifications for the position, we shall, I think, do well to honour him, and at the same time honour ourselves, by placing him again in the office of  President  of the Senate. </para>

I had occasion, about three years ago, when he belonged to a political party between which and myself there was a great division of opinion, to bear testimony in the capital city of my own State to the fine sense of parliamentary justice with which he presided over our deliberations. I must say that no action of his from, that time onward has caused me to alter in the slightest the opinion which I then expressed of him. That being so, very little remains for me but to briefly second the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> I do hope, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens'</inline> candidature commends itself to honorable senators, that during his term of office our deliberations will savour little of recrimination, but will constitute part of a vast and beneficent, process, such as the labours of the representatives of all democratic peoples should do. </para>

I look forward with! confidence to receiving similar consideration: in the future. I have always honestly endeavoured to protect the interests of every individual senator. . I have attempted to know, and to show, no favour to either side of the Chamber, and it has. ever been my aim to protect the interests, of minorities in the Senate, and to deal out even-handed justice to all. I shall do my level best to deserve the confidence and high honour that has been bestowed upon me, and at the end of my term I hope that I shall deserve the kindly commendations that have been showered upon, me by Senators Lynch and Bakhap, and which have also been expressed in the unanimous good will of the Senate.

                    <para>. - In view of the unanimity of the proceedings I feel, sir, that I can offer you the hearty congratulations of the whole of this Senate. As you have said, the position to which you have been recalled, does, in a sense, confer an honour upon you, but I submit that it is also one in. which this Chamber confers an honour upon itself. In electing you to that position, the Senate has been largely guided by its experience of your conduct in the Chair during the years that you have occupied it. It is the commendation of your services there,, which has been responsible for your unanimous re-election. Of course, it is inconceivable that in the heat of parliamentary debate we should always see eye to eye with the Chair at the time a decision is given. I, myself, am conscious of having been suppressed by you on more than one occasion, but I venture to say that other honorable senators who have had a similar experience have felt), on reflection,, that the action taken by the Chair was in conformity with our Standing Orders and parliamentary procedure and that above all it proceeded from a stern desire to be just. I feel that those attributes that have marked your occupancy of the Chair hitherto, will continue to be exhibited while you act as our  President.  I am equally certain that honorable senators will extend to you the utmost assistance in the difficult position in which you will sometimes find yourself. I may be pardoned, perhaps, for adding my personal congratulations as one of your oldest associates here. In saying that, I need not remind you that although we have been invariably at variance on political issues, there has . been no interruption of the personal friendship that has existed between us. In these circumstances I do feel that I can add to the congratulations of the Senate my own personal congratulations on account of that friendship. </para>

                    <para>May I be permitted, sir, to take this opportunity of congratulating you upon the esteem in which you are held by honorable senators on both sides ? It must have been very gratifying to you to hear the tributes from honorable senators to the justice which has been meted out to them by yourself, and the manner in which you have filled the position. I trust that you will long retain that confidence, and be spared to rule over the deliberations of this Chamber. </para>
                    <para>A year ago, when the members of the Senate were discussing problems similar to those which we are likely to discuss to-day, it was thought that by this time the awful war which has thrown the nations of the world into turmoil would have ended. We thought that long ere this time peace would reign in this beautiful land once more, but we have been disappointed. We grieve much to think that our noble sons are still fighting the battles of the Empire in a land far removed from our shores. Despite all our struggles, and all the hardship which has been heaped upon the British people, we feel proud that the soldiers belonging to the British Empire, and the lads from Australia, are still maintaining the glorious traditions handed down to us by our forefathers from their struggles in the past. We feel that, no matter what may be the duration of the war, so long as our lads are reinforced, so long as this country is loyal to them, so long will the Old Land stand by them and fight for justice for the future. </para>
                    <para>A great responsibility rests upon every member of the Senate. Our duties are many and complex; they are grave, indeed; and whatever our political opinions may be, there is only one way in which we can fulfil the demands of the people, and that is by being loyal to the Empire and our country. If we do that regardless of our political views we shall have done at least all we can do to satisfy the desire of the people when they returned us to this Chamber. I admit that at this time politics must vary, and we must differ one with the other. I realize that before the present session is over we must have strenuous political struggles. I recognise that the Leader of the Opposition is a man to fight for his opinions. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that we will have some criticism on this side. It is the duty of honorable senators at all times to try to criticise measures. The only way in which we can perfect the Bills which are so important to the prosecution of the war is by criticism freely given from both sides of the Senate. We take it that the policy submitted by the Government is in the best interests of . the Commonwealth. I am prepared to stand by the Government on all measures which I think are essential to the best interests ' of the Commonwealth and its people. I shall certainly criticise measures when I think it is right to do so. It is proper that every honorable senator should be given that privilege, and I recognise that every one here is quite capable of claiming it. </para>

                    <para>One of the first questions submitted to us in the Governor-General's Speech is the repatriation policy of the Government. We merely have a heading to the scheme. What the provisions of the scheme are, we shall look forward with interest to find out. We must admit, however, that it is one of the greatest questions which can tax the minds of honorable senators. It is intricate to a degree, and certainly it bristles with difficulties. I have every sympathy with the Minister for Defence, who is to have charge of the Bill. He looks rather worried to-day, and probably by the time he gets the measure on to the statute-book more wrinkles will have been added to his forehead. I believe . that the Minister is desirous of doing the best  he can in the interests of returned soldiers, and I have confidence that honorable senators, including  Colonel Bolton,  who are interested in the repatriation policy, will do their utmost to help the Minister to frame the Bill in a manner satisfactory to the requirements. I trust that it will receive the utmost consideration of the Minister, and that few errors will be made when the measure .is brought into operation. Take the land question in particular. ' It is proposed to spend something like £10,000,000. Every care must be taken to see that the best quality of land is acquired in the most suitable districts. If you exceed the productive value of any land you will only add to the misery of these men during the remainder of their lives. It is not, I am sure, the wish of any honorable senator to do injury to those who have suffered so much, and who, if necessary, are prepared to suffer more, in the interests of all here. Care must be taken. It is easy to make a mistake in settling men on the land, and it is easy, too, to break the prospects of these men. I was engaged for two years in investigating the closer settlement areas of Victoria, including the dry and wet areas. I was never so disappointed in my life as I was at the discovery of the terrible state of affairs existing there. The legislation was putt on the statute-book not only to meet the requirements of individuals, but to add to the wealth of this great State. I believe that the Ministers in charge of the measures and 'the administration desired to do their best. Whether they had the necessary qualifications ito administer the Department I do not know, but serious mistakes were made whereby hundreds of families have been robbed, hundreds of farmers have been ruined, and a great amount has been added to the debt of this State. Our soldiers must not! be exposed to the ( privations which many of our settlers in the past have had to put up with. If they are, the effect will be to retard to a great extent the production of the country, upon which in the future everything will depend. Unless we produce sufficient to meet our liabilities, we must expect to go under as a nation. Every care must be taken to enable our people to apply their energies effectively to the occupation of the soil, and the production of wealth, and their efforts in this direction must <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> £]am. receive the consideration of the various Parliaments of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>I find that in paragraph 12 of the Speech it is stated that it is the intention of the Government to introduce a Bill for the taxation of war-time profits. This is very necessary, and I only regret that the imposition of this form of taxation has been so long delayed. Money is so urgently required for the development of the repatriation policy, and % for the prosecution of the war, that in my opinion this source of revenue should have been touched many months ago. However, it is not too late to begin the imposition of this taxation now. I feel that those who enjoy the opportunity to make wartime profits will be found ready to pay the proposed tax. We do not blame any man for making war profits while the laws of the country permit him to do so. He adds to the wealth of the country by the energy he devotes to the industry in which he is engaged. If the Government! of the country say to such men, "We propose to take from you a certain amount of the profits you have derived in order to successfully prosecute the war, and thus safeguard your interests in the country to which you belong," I am sure that no one liable to the tax will be found unwilling to respond to that demand by Parliament, I trust that the Government will bring forward legislation for the imposition of this taxation at the earliest possible date. </para>
                    <para>In paragraph 15 the statement is made that it is the intention of the Government to take steps to insure the continuity of industrial operations and the prevention of strikes or lockouts. A great expansion of our industries is essential, and in order that it may be brought about we must have legislation to prevent the occurrence of industrial disputes" When we have an Arbitration Court to deal with disputes pertaining to all industries, there should be no occasion for strikes or lockouts. If that Court deals out justice to workers and employers, both must be made to comply with its decisions. If at present the law is so defective that individuals may override it. and declare a strike or a lockout . independent of what the Arbitration Court may say, it is necessary that something should be done to tighten up our arbitration legislation. We cannot hope to push the development of the industries of the country in the way we desire if we are threatened with continual industrial unrest. Under such conditions men will not invest money in the country in the establishment of industries, when by going to other parts of the world they can enjoy greater freedom and obtain security for their investments. It is necessary that those possessed of capital should be induced tlo invest in this country, by increasing its industries, and so add to the wealth of the nation. I hope that the Government will in the near future be able to so tighten up the provisions of the arbitration law that we shall have peace on both sides, and that employer and workman will, be able  to work hand in hand in a manner in which they have never been able to do before. There is no reason why they should not do so if they are satisfied that justice will be dealt out by our Arbitration Court. </para>
                    <para>We must realize that the only thing we can do in the future for the benefit of our people is to push on in every way with the industries of the country. Great opportunities are - afforded for the expansion of industries in the Commonwealth in connexion with our wool, our wheat, and our mineral resources. Vast deposits of mineral ores are lying untouched, and we are sending our wool to all parts of the world to be dressed, and returned to us in the finished article. There is no reason why that should be so. We ought to be a self-supporting nation at this time, but we are a long way from any such position. The present great war has opened the eyes of the people, and enlarged the vision of our politicians, and I hope that when peace has been attained every man in this community will be prepared to assist with all his might the expansion of the industries and production of this country. </para>
                    <para>In paragraph 16 of the Speech we are informed that it is the intention of the Government to appoint an Advisory Council of scientific experts so as to make available the best and latest results of investigation and research for the benefit of our producers, and of those concerned in the industrial activities of the Commonwealth. Such a council is badly required at the present time. I agree that our producers have been given great consideration by the various Legislatures of the Australian States, but much more consideration might well be extended to them. I find that last year alone iti is estimated that sheep to  the value of no' less than £2,000,000 were lost in Queensland from the effects of the blow-fly. That would be a serious loss for the Commonwealth, let alone one State. . Unless this matter is investigated, and the pest successfully combated, we may expect that our losses in this way in future may be trebled. There are many other directions in which an Advisory Council such as is proposed would be able to suggest relief. I hope that the Government will secure the best men obtainable for appointment to the council, and that they, will apply themselves effectively to the consideration of matters for the advancement of all engaged in production and industry.  </para>
                    <para>I come now to the ship-building proposal of the Government, and I am glad to find that they intend to launch upon a project of the kind. If ever there was  a  time when this country was' in need of ships it is the present time. We have. , reason to fear that before the war is over . the number of ships now available will be  still further greatly reduced. The one supreme effort- which Germany will make to bring about a peace satisfactory to herself will be to sink, if possible, every ship that sails our seas. We must not lose sight of the opportunities she has to give effect to such a policy. She has no fleet' to maintain at the present time. She is not troubling about the building of warships. v She has no merchant ships to sail the seas. She is consequently in a position to devote the whole of her energies to this one destructive submarine policy. If it is possible for her, by the increase of these destructive weapons of war, to so reduce our shipping, and bring about a peace satisfactory to herself, she may be expected to do so. Before she can accomplish anything of the kind, we must expect to suffer severely from her submarine attacks. If we ask the producers of the country to extend their operations, we must be prepared to promise them, at least, that the produce which they secure from the land will be disposed of in suich a way as to compensate them for their . labours. We must not, because of the scarcity of shipping, allow the productions of the country to be lost. We must safeguard the interests of our fruit-growers, amongst others, by extending the refrigerated space available for the export of their produce. </para>
                    <para>I recently travelled throughout Victoria, and noticed many fine orchards  that are now coming into full hearing. These must add enormously to the wealth of the State in the future.

                            <para>- The position would not be so bad if we had pigs, and could dispose of the fruit in that way. The question is one  with which we must grapple, and the only way at present open to us to deal with the production of fruit is by the expansion of refrigerating space for export, and the development of the canning process. We have no.t sufficient canning factories at present to meet) our requirements. The Government propose to cope with this matter, and I feel sure they will give the States financial assistance in this direction. </para>

                    <para>Whilst looking to the building of ships, we have to take another of our wheat problems, into consideration. The present is certainly a most opportune time for the Commonwealth Government to assist the i State Governments in bringing into effect the system of handling wheat' in bulk. Four years ago I was a member of a Royal Commission  that investigated this particular problem. We recommended the Victorian Government to go ahead with the proposal to handle wheat in bulk. I wish they had at once done so, as it would have meant great relief to our producers and the saving of millions of pounds to the country at the present time. Our producers have now great anxiety in regard to the preservation of their produce. </para>

                            <para>- I have said that the Government propose to undertake the building of ships, and that in consequence there could be no more opportune time to bring about the bulk handling of wheat. By adopting a proper  standardized system of ship building they  will know exactly what is necessary to carry wheat cargoes in bulk in the future, and the first cost will be the only cost. Whilst serving on the Commission to which I have referred, the agents for the ship-owners stressed the alterations that would be required to enable their ships to transport wheat in bulk. They pointed out that the expense involved would be considerable, and the difficulties great. But in the present instance the Government themselves propose to build ships, and they are in a position to know precisely how those vessels ought! to be built, with a view to catering for that particular class of trade. </para>

I have merely dealt with the programme outlined in the Governor-General's Speech, a copy of which was placed in my hands only about an hour  ago. What little assistance I can render the Ministry in regard to the measures enumerated in the Vice-Regal utterance I shall be glad to extend to them. But upon any occasion that I may feel justified in criticising their action in respect of those measures I shall not hesitate to exercise my right. I trust that by the time the present session closes the disastrous war now in progress will have terminated, and the flag of peace will be waving triumphantly. I' feel sure that with the great financial assistance that will be rendered to the Allies by America, the German people must begin to realize that the end is at last in sight, and that Prussian militarism is doomed. Before many months have passed, I believe that Germany will recognise that it is better to have peace than to face another winter in the trenches, with the exceedingly heavy casualties that must inevitably accompany it. I. trust, therefore,  that  before the present session closes we shall have waving above us the flag of peace. </para>

                        <para>.- I rise to second the motion for the ad option of the Address-in-Reply. I feel very greatly the honour that has been conferred on me, and upon the State which I represent, in being asked to second that motion. When the oath of allegiance was being administered to honorable senators this morning, it struck me how very necessary it is, at a time like this, that all sections of the community shall be loyal to their Sovereign. Were it not that loyalty existed throughout the entire. Empire upon the outbreak of the war, and that the call of duty found a responsive echo in the hearts of all Britishers, .1 venture to say that we should not be -privileged to sit here today as the representatives of a free people and the servants of a great ruler. Now the Government have been returned for the purpose of winning the war, and I sincerely trust they will leave no stone unturned in that endeavour to place all our resources at the disposal of the Mother Country. </para>

                    <para>The result of the recent elections is an intimation that the people of Australia are determined that at all costs we shall continue to play our part in this great struggle against a military despotism. I trust that all sections of the community, and all honorable senators, will do everything that is possible to encourage the voluntary . recruiting system, and to secure the 7,000 reinforcements that are required monthly at the front. It would be deplorable indeed if it became necessary for Australia to break up any of our divisions now in, the firing line. Apart from the fact that we have made certain promises to the Motherland, we have to consider the position of 'the men who are fighting in these divisions. Every man fighting in France to-day is proud of his division, proud of its achievements, and is imbued with a desire that its performances shall outshine those of all other divisions. These men would bitterly feel the breaking up of any one of our Australian divisions. </para>
                    <para>Then I am very pleased to note that the Government intend to make ample provision for the dependants of soldiers. Any Ministry which failed to do that would be neglecting their duty. Widows and orphans must not be allowed to suffer as the result of the sacrifices made by their breadwinners. I am very pleased to know that the Government intend to embark on a scheme of repatriation. When that scheme is announced, I believe the effect upon recruiting will be a good one. At the present time there are a great number of men who have not enlisted because they were not certain of what their position would be upon their return from the war. When the details of. the Government scheme are disclosed, I believe that the provision which it is proposed to make for returned soldiers will prove a great' stimulus to recruiting. Another reason why I am glad this scheme is to be launched immediately is because I believe the time has arrived when the question of repatriation should no longer be left in the hands of private- individuals or of voluntary subscribers. So long as it is thus left, there will be a certain number of persons who will contribute liberally according to their means, and a certain number who will evade their obligation to do so. I wish, here to pay my tribute to the splendid services which have been rendered by many of our <inline font-style="italic">men</inline> and women in connexion with repatriation. They have done good work, but on  account  of their  limitations  they have not been able to do as much as they would have liked. For this reason, I repeat that when the people see clearly what the Government propose in connexion with this matter, and when they recognise that returned soldiers are to be fairly treated, a great fillip will be given to recruiting. </para>
                    <para>I am also glad to observe that the Government intend not only to preach economy, but to practise it. I believe that practice is' better than precept. We know that there are certain economies which cannot be effected without sacrificing efficiency, but I think that a good 'deal of economy could be effected in our Government Departments nevertheless. </para>
                    <para>I also note with pleasure that the Government intend to give returned soldiers a preference in the matter of employment in all Departments of the Commonwealth service. I consider that a man who has exhibited his willingness to sacrifice everything to fight for his country, ought, on his return to Australia, to be granted such a preference. In this connexion I recollect that in Queensland, only a little while ago, an award was made under which returned soldiers employed in a particular place were compelled either to join a certain industrial union or to forfeit their positions. I have nothing to say against legitimate trade unionism, because I recognise that when conducted upon sane lines it is a distinct benefit to the country as well as to industry. But "at the time the award of which I speak was made, it was publicly announced that these returned soldiers must join a particular union, otherwise it was not considered right that they should enjoy privileges which had been won for them by the other members of that organization. I contend that the men who have been fighting at the front have won for themselves greater rights than have been won by any industrial organization in Australia. For this reason, no returned soldier should be bludgeoned into any such organization; and I am pleased, indeed, that the Government intend to grant a preference to those who have fought for their country. </para>
                    <para>I also welcome the announcement that the Ministry propose to take steps to deal immediately with the blow-fly, prickly pear, and worm nodules in beef. The State from which I hail has suffered more from the ravages of prickly pear, cattle tick, and the blow-fly than has any other part of Australia. Its people will hail with delight the declaration of the Government that they intend to take immediate steps towards coping with these pests. </para>

                    <para>I am pleased, also, that the Government intend to deal with the question of cold storage. At present, owing to the shortage, of refrigerating space in the oversea steamers and butter being declared a luxury in Great Britain, there is practically no market there for Australian butter, and the cold stores in Queensland are full of butter which they are unable to get away. Unless some action is taken to deal with the matter in that State there is a big chance that the whole industry will go tq the wall. A great many small farmers there are entirely dependent on their cream cheques to keep the wolf from the door, and if the industry is allowed to go down many dairy farmers will be in sore straits. The industry in Queensland has a turnover of over £1,000,000 a year, and it will be a very serious matter if it is allowed to collapse. I trust the Government will take immediate steps to see that relief is given to the dairymen, or that increased storage accommodation is provided* for them in order that they may store their butter until it can be shipped away. </para>
                    <para>I am pleased, also, to notice that a Com' mission has been- appointed to  inquire  into the working of the Departments of Defence and the Navy. The fact that <inline font-style="italic">s&gt;</inline> many complaints have been made against the Defence Department - I do not say that they are all just, but some of them are- is very prejudicial to recruiting. I believe that when the Board gets to wore, and eliminates those complaints or reduces them to a minimum, the effect on recruiting will be good. I trust tha Board will commence its  operations  without delay, so that many of the complaints now outstanding may be quickly settled. I am not going to condemn the Minister for Defence or any officer of the Department for what has taken place, for, when it is remembered that the Department is now controlling an Army as large as that of Great Britain in times of peace, we must admit that it has done remarkably well. With the addition of a few experienced men, it has carried on work that has increased 1,000 per cent, during the last three years, and it is only natural that complaints such as are being made should arise. I believe that when the Board gets to work it will be able to remove speedily the causes for complaint. </para>
                    <para>I am confident that when the policy outlined in the Speech is made known to the electors to-morrow it will be received with acclamation throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. The people will see that they have at last returned to power a Government prepared to place Empire before party, a Government representative of all classes, and determined to carry out the pledges it made to the electors. </para>
                    <para>I thank honorable senators for the attention they have given my few remarks as a new member, and I cordially indorse <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain's</inline> hope that the time is not far distant when peace and normal conditions will be restored. I sincerely trust that it will not be very long before Great Britain is again in her proud position at the head of the nations of a world at peace, after we have secured a victorious peace guaranteeing the freedom of the smaller nations, and rendering it impossible for such a war as this ever to take place again. &gt; </para>

                            <para>. - As one who opposed conscription, I welcome this Speech. The  fact that the Government stands to-day where the "no" voters of New South Wales stood last October is a justification of their votes. If conscription is not wanted to-day, it certainly was not wanted nine months ago, and that it is not wanted to-day is proved by the fact that a Government elected as a " winthewar" Government, with a very large following of earnest conscriptionists, has presented us with a legislative programme  that foreshadows no intention on their part to introduce it. </para>

                            <para>- I am delighted, and congratulate the- Government on the fact that they have given up conscription. I am aware that they pledged themselves, through their Prime Minister, not to introduce it, but I disbelieved that pledge when it was given. I stated from the public platform that I did not believe it, and am glad to admit that I was wrong. When the Prime Minister said that he did not intend to introduce conscription I did not believe him, because I did not think he had a following sufficiently strong to carry with him the number of conscriptionists within his ranks. I thought they would overbear him, and that conscription would be introduced. To those enthusiastic members of the Government party who said .that conscription was necessary if Australia was to do her part, I would point out that Australia has done- her part better than any other v Dominion of the Empire, and will continue to do her part while her resources of men, munitions, and supplies are handled by the Government in the way they should be handled. I take it that this is the last that will be heard of conscription in the Commonwealth. Now that this Speech has been put before the people as the Government policy, I trust that we shall have no honorable senators trying to make people believe that conscription may yet come here. What are the reasons that have brought about this change? </para>

                            <para>- They have already done that, and I feel sure that it has gone a considerable 'way towards  winning the war. That party from every platform professed that the one intention of the combination of parties was to do something effective to win the war. I appeal to members on the other side to tell me what there is in the Speech to justify all the statements they made then. Is there one line, one sentence, one clause, to justify their claim as a party, not only that they were out to do more than any one else could to win the war, but that those who would not agree with them in their methods and in all the details of their policy were traitors <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> Australia and the Empire? </para>

What is there in the Speech which could not have been put there by any Government returning from an appeal to the people? The prickly pear and blowfly problems have been receiving investigation by State Governments for years, and as a member of the Government which appointed the Advisory Council of Science, I know it was shown that the State Governments were quite up to date in their method of handling those problems. </para>

                                <para>- What we would have done had we won the election must always be a matter of guesswork. The Government won the election on definite promises to a community which believes, and will insist, that promises be kept. They won the election on a definite promise to do something to win the war, and my complaint is that the programme as submitted to this Parliament and to the country contains not a ray of hope for their supporters, who were led to believe that if they returned this ,party they would do something exceptional to win the war. </para>

Towards the close of the last session I tried to get direct information 'from the Minister for Defence as to the truth or otherwise of that statement, bub up to the present I have not been successful, and in the absence of such information I have not the slightest hesitation in declaring that the Prime Minister's statement was untrue. The casualty lists issued monthly give the lie direct to any suggestion of that kind, no matter by whom made. There is the unfortunate record of the men who die each week fighting in the trenches and in France. That record is a sufficient answer to the slander that Australia was not keeping her word with the men at the front. When the history of this .war is being written, and when the historian of the future, searching for the necessary information, reads the Prime Minister's statement that Australian troops had to be withdrawn for the reason stated by him, the position occupied by the Prime Minister will, unfortunately, allow that slander to go sailing down through the ages. It was a lie that should never have been uttered, and it should be withdrawn now that it has been uttered. To my mind it is most discreditable that Australia, which has done more than any other Do minion, and which has .prosecuted this war with vigour and energy, should be placed in that position by the Prime Minister of .this country. </para><interjection>

                                <para>- I am adopting this simple standard, that nations estimate that 7 per cent, of the population are fit for war, and that Australia has already enlisted more than 7 per cent, of her population. I am adopting the further standard that a population of less than 5,000,000 persons lias already created a public debt which will remain a burden upon generations yet unborn. The thanks which Australia gets for that work is to be held up to ridicule and contempt by men who are continually libelling her. They continue to utter their libels in the vain effort, as they think, of doing something more. " Win the war " was their great cry before the elections were held. The elections were won; honorable senators are safe in their seats, and imagine that the war is won. It was the seats which they wanted to win, and now that the elections are over they are prepared to sit comfortably back on their benches, believing, as the Government say in this document, that nothing further is necessary. </para>

The electors dealt with the Government handsomely and generously, but having won the elections do the Government bring forward any proposals for more effectively dealing with the situation , than they did in the past? An opponent of the Government, as I am, I would have welcomed such proposals, because then there would have been a gleam of hope for Australia. But the Government bring down a programme which is " neither fish, flesh, nor good red-herring" - a programme containing really nothing, and their supporters accept it with perfect satisfaction. There would be a gleam of hope if there were sufficient manliness, intelligence, and independence on the other side to complain of the breach of faith with the electors; but there is none. </para>

                                <para>- I am not complaining, but rejoicing. I rejoice in the fact that the Government and the National party stand to-day where the anti-conscriptionists stood last October. That fact gives me all the satisfaction I need. The justification by the Government of the "No" voters on the 28th October last gives me, I venture to say, as much satisfaction as I have ever experienced in this Parliament. To an anti-conscriptionist, it is quite a pleasure to have this statement from the Government that conscription in Australia is not necessary, because, if it is necessary, it is urgent. The fact that the Government have not made it a matter of urgency conveys to me their opinion that it is not necessary. </para>

                                <para>- Tes. The Minister remembers the defiant and triumphant way in which he asked me whether I disputed the Imperial War Council's figures. I ventured to dispute them last December. The honorable senator was so impatient when I was giving my reasons that he, by a series of questions, insisted on me saying how many men per month I thought were necessary, and I gave my reply. He was very persistent in asking for definite figures. </para>

                                <para>- I did. not see the message while I was a member of the Government. Indeed, I will go further, and say that I never believed that the message came. I simply looked upon it as a make-believe for a Government who wanted conscription to fool the people. When I was speaking of these figures in December last, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said, " Give me the number which you think necessary." He would not allow me to give the information by my own method, hut he persisted with questions until I said that 5 per cent, would be a great deal nearer the number than would 16,500 men per month.  His  statement that I was disputing the Imperial War Council's figures was used against me at the elections from one end of my State to an- . other, but he now knows that the Imperial War Council was wrong. </para>

                                <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> will never hear me complain of a Government that keeps faith with the people. The chief pledge which the present Government gave to the people in many words, by many publications and speeches, directly and indirectly, was that if they were returned to power something most effective would be done in order to win the war. That is the pledge which they have to redeem. </para>

                                <para>- Honorable senators who applaud that as a fair statement of the Government policy, and who are satisfied with what} the Government have put before us to-day in order to redeem their pledge, can have no conception of the high hopes raised in the minds of the people outside by the pre-election pledges on behalf of the Government. The parents of the boys who have been fighting, the mothers who are anxious about the return of their sons, the wives who are looking forward to the return of their husbands, have been waiting for the meeting of Parliament to learn that the Government are doing something to bring about the winning of the war and the return of those in whom they are interested. Prior to the 5th May, and from that date until to-day, thousands of men and women in the Commonwealth have been waiting for some pronouncement from the Government of their intention to do something more than has hitherto been done to bring the war to an early termination. I am pointing out the high hopes which were raised in the minds of the electors by the platform speeches of Ministerial candidates, the manifesto of the Prime Minister, and various nationalist publications. The electors were invited to believe that if they voted for the present Government combination they would win the war. Yet now the Government bring forward a programme which contains no proposal to do other than has already been done for the purpose of winning the war. </para>

                                <para>- I have made it my business to keep a very careful tally of our casualties, and also of the figures of the Defence Department. The military estimate of the sick and wounded returning to the fighting line is 64 or 65 per cent. I take a lower figure, and basing my argument upon an estimate of 60 per cent., I can prove that the number required to cover the casualties during the last twelve months would not average 4,000 per month. </para>

The extraordinary results which have followed from the appeal made to the manhood of Australia must surprise every one who has the time to consider them. </para>

While men are voluntarily giving up all, including even their lives, no one in this community should be so selfish as to claim the right to make profits during the period of the war.

We know that during the ,period of the war, and out of the war itself, many well-conducted business firms have made huge profits.- I say that war-time profits, as a whole, should go to pay the cost of the war. We have sent over 300,000 men from Australia to fight for us, and they have done so in such a way as to earn the highest prestige for the Australian people. At the same time we have had at home many thousands of people who have been making big profits out of the war. How are we going to treat the men who are fighting for us at the Front ? In order to clothe them, feed them, and pay their wages we are now borrowing money. Up <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the present we have piled up a war indebtedness approaching £150,000,000, and the process is likely to continue. When our soldiers have been to the Front, when they have accepted all sorts of risks on our behalf, we hold out to them the prospect of returning to Australia and paying the interest upon the money which we have borrowed for the prosecution of the war. That is how it is proposed to treat them. These men may fight for us, platitudes in their praise may be spoken from every platform, but the fact remains that while they are absent fighting our battles we are borrowing the wherewithal to sustain them, and when they return to us we intend to give them the privilege of paying interest upon it. Is that a fair deal to extend to the soldiers? </para>

                                <para>- Neither do I. But I have an open mind upon the number of recruits that are required for that purpose, and if the Vice-President of the Executive Council can convince me that I am wrong, I am quite ready to be convinced. I have followed the figures relating to our casualties very closely, and I have proved that my own estimate has not been inaccurate to any appreciable extent. Indeed, the figures which I submitted in regard to the number of recruits that are required monthly to replace our casualties proved to be much nearer the mark than did the estimate submitted by the Imperial War Council. But I ask once more whether it is a fair thing to say to our troops, "We will borrow money to feed you, to clothe you, and to enable you to fight for us, and when you return to us we will give you the privilege of paying the interest upon it " ? </para>

                                <para>- I do not say that, but I do say that before we have exhausted every avenue of taxation, including that of war-time profits, we have no right to charge any Australian soldier a shilling on account of this war. So far, the avenues of taxation open to us have not been touched. Why? Because the profits of those who make profits must be left to the last moment. But now we are assured that there is to he a tax on war-time profits. If the Government will promptly introduce the Bill dealing with this matter they will find no opposition to it. </para>

The very statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs</inline> in the other Chamber in regard to the "War-time Profits Bill brought about the combination which we now see on the benches opposite. It was cheaper for those chiefly interested to purchase party leaders than it was for them to pay taxation. </para>

The fact is that the machinery of' the Labour movement has been captured by extremists, narrow  sectionalists,  men who joined the Labour party not to fight for it, but to live on it, or to use it for their own selfish purposes. </para>

                                - We stand for Australia as an integral part of the Empire. We have sunk party during the war as the Labour parties in Britain, France, and Belgium have done; as you yourselves have done; and, like you, too, we ask of our comrade now only whether he loves Australia and has the courage of a man. We ask you to vote for the Ministerial candidates for the Senate and House of Representatives, and pledge ourselves to carryout the policy set out by the Prime Minister, doing all things necessary in this war to safeguard the rights "of Labour, to encourage the producer and the industries of Australia, and to deal with your dependants and you when and as you return, in a spirit and a manner worthy of the men of Gallipoli, Pozieres, and Bapaume.

If there is, I throw the lie back in his teeth. That the Labour party is an extreme party, I am aware, and I have always been aware of it. I am the result of that extreme party, and I am one of the extremists of that extreme party. Everything that is avowed in the quotation which I have read was said about our party twenty-five years ago. Yet, for twenty-five years, the steady, pressure of Labour organization and Labour - legislation has bettered the conditions of the workers of this country.

But my point is that a party signing itself as the Labour party, endeavoured. to build up a reputation at the expense of men who have given the best of their lives to the Labour movement. Does anybody mean to tell me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .</inline> McDougall, a trade unionist who has been fighting in the cause for over forty years; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant, Senator Barker, Senator Maughan,</inline> and' others whom I see around me, because they differed from honorable senators opposite, suddenly became the puppets of the extreme section of the Labour party ? </para>

They will watch the interests of Labour, not only surrounded, but controlled by the classes that hold the power, and that have fought us with all the weapons of vilification and slander since ever we entered into this fight. In the manifesto they issued' to our soldiers they are still Labour members. I have no doubt that when the soldiers .read of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie sitting in the same party with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gregory,</inline> they will say " That is good company for a Labour member!

                                <para>- They gave the honorable senator a majority because he promised to win the war if they did. From every platform, and in every newspaper, he promised to do something to win the war and two months after they gave him his majority we find him quite happy when the Government he is supporting brings down a proposal containing not one word of additional effort to win the war. "We are in the same position that we were in two months ago, and even six months ago, only infinitely worse. We have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> statement that from the time a soldier leaves Australia it is six months before he can get to the trenches. If that is so, can those who say they want to maintain the fighting line at the strength they say is necessary, go slow in such an important matter ? Can they afford to let days run into weeks, weeks into months, and months into years, and then probably when some disaster or other happens a few months hence make frantic efforts to pick up the time wasted? If they believe in all they said before, they were elected they will have th'e courage to say to the Government, " The proposal you are putting before us is not good enough; it is not a business proposal; it is certainly not a soldier's proposal." Whether they are aware of it or not, the enthusiasm created in the minds of the people, among the parents and other relatives of those fighting at the Front, by that splendid election cry of "Win the war," gave them their majority - that, and nothing else. </para>

But if ever there was a wet blanket put on a flame it is this document brought forward by the Government two. months after the election. In it they tell us quite seriously that in order to win the war they will deal with the prickly pear, devise means to obtain alcohol for commercial purposes, and find a remedy for the blow-fly pest. </para>

The young and fit men do not go there as people imagine they do. The race-courses have done their share, and done it well, but no doubt it will please a section of the community if, by curtailing sport, the Government can make people think more seriously of the war. Sport is a good recreation and active relief for thousands of us from the anxieties of the war. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator will wait a long time before he finds me building my speeches on selfish reasons. The Government will do well to consider very seriously where the stopping of any sport begins or ends. I can quite understand in Great Britain, where there is a scarcity, or the possibility of a scarcity, of food for human beings, that they will curtail horse-racing, but no such scarcity obtains in Australia. We have ample food supplies, and if means of transport were available we should be only too willing to send food to the Home Land to replenish the supplies there, but because Great Britain curtails horseracing are we going to slavishly follow suit, and stop it here? Are the Government going to interfere with the sport of horse-racing that gives legitimate employment to thousands of our people who are unable to go to the war, and gives the prospect of a market for the produce of thousands of our farmers ? Stop horseracing, and that market is immediately gone. Behind all these questions of stopping sport there is the serious trade aspect to be considered, and the man who rushes in hurriedly to win the war by stopping sport because he thinks some of the people looking on should be at the war may be making a big mistake.- This Government and its followers have to take the responsibility for lookers-on who should be at the war not being there. The people of this country have given them their, majority to deal with them in a legitimate and straightforward way, not in a mean, contemptible, and underhand way. Stopping sport to assist recruiting is worthy of this so-called National" party. It is worthy of a combination of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>

It may be a long way off, or it may be near, but we shall have to face it. </para>

                            applauded the Government for giving preference to soldiers, and I say " hear hear " to that too, but I venture to say there is not a soldier who wants preference under such conditions that he must "scab." The soldiers who went to the war expect preference, and it should be given to them, but I venture to say that when the bulk of the soldiers return they will not be prepared to take their employment by " scabbing " on the unionists.

                                <para>- I am glad to hear that. The honorable senator also led. the people of Tasmania to believe that there were two parties to this fight - one, the National party which would do something to win the war, and the other, the Labour party, which merely side-tracked that great issue. It mattered not to him that we had published our manifesto, saying that the war was still the most pressing problem, and that we had determined to continue to do our best, as we had during the past two years. All that has been done by Australia in this great struggle stands to the credit of the Labour movement. ' </para>

                        </continue><para>I have touched very briefly upon the subjects contained in the policy speech. My reason for speaking immediately, without moving for the adjournment of the debate - in which course, no doubt, I would have had the approval of the Government - was to conserve the time of the Senate, and to enable the Government to get on with their " win-the-war " policy. The cards are now upon the table. The programme of legislation for this session is now before us. The Government have told the people of Australia what they are intending to do. They are going to curtail sport in some directions, and they are going to allow scientific authorities to pursue investigations with regard to prickly pear, alcohol for commercial purposes, and the blow-fly pest. That is the sum  total  of all the promises made during all those weeks of the vigorous election campaign. If one had read the leading? articles in the National press, and had read all the pledges of the National leaders,' one would have thought that it was men like myself and my colleagues who were preventing anything being done for months ; that we were the obstacles in the way; that we were viciously using our majority to prevent the Government from doing anything. Now the Government have a majority in Both Houses, so there is nothing to prevent them from doing something to win this war. It appears, however, that their policy was to win the elections, and in that respect it was effective. There is* no question about that. As far as I am concerned, and deploring as I do the serious loss to Australia of some men for a Brief period, I do not regret 'that the Government have unrestricted power to  do  anything they may have in mind to win this war. </para><interjection>

                                <para>- This declaration of the combined intelligence of the National party appears now to satisfy every honorable senator opposite. Valiant as their protests were before the 5th May, they now accept this departure from the position they then took up - this bolt to cover, now that they are faced with the responsibility. The destinies of this country are in their hands, but as I said in the beginning of my remarks, the Governor-General's Speech promises nothing more towards winning the war than what we were doing before last October. Moreover, it is a justification of the  ' No " vote given by the people of Australia last October. Honorable senators opposite agree with that, because they do not condemn the Government. They have not the courage to do so here, where condemnation would be' effective. </para>

                                <para>- I would if the honorable senator would show me there was any prospect of a majority by promising his, support, but he is a member of the party which practically elected <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> as  President  and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> as  Chairman  of Committees, so I take it that a vote of censure would be quite useless in the face of caucus-pledged members opposite. However, as imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, we of the Labour movement are pleased that senators supporting the Government have followed the good example we set them. </para>

The Government, in their policy speech, have buried the conscription issue ; they have told the people of Australia that there is no need for it, and that it is not. wanted. This is the position we took up last October. Nine months have passed since then, and it is still not wanted, as the Government do not propose to take any extraordinary steps to get more men. These facts are given to us by the Government in the policy speech. I am pleased to think that they have accepted the view taken by a majority of the people last October when they turned down the conscription issue. </para></speech>

                            <para>. - I should like, in a few words, to offer my congratulations to the two honorable senators who proposed and seconded the motion which we have now under consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain</inline> is not quite a. novice in parliamentary life, and I am sure, therefore, he will pardon me if I pay a special compliment to the younger senator who, I understand, made his maiden parliamentary speech this afternoon. I only wish to say that, judging by his remarks, the Senate has received an addition to its strength, and that with experience the seconder of the motion will prove a very useful member of this Chamber. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>I want now to remind honorable senators that many things have changed since the 5th May, but neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> nor his speech can be included in that category. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is still the same as before the 5th May. He cannot discriminate between noise and sound argument, and does not realize that the mere throwing about of wild statements is not. the  presentation of sober facts. Those of us who have been privileged to be here before have been wearied with the honorable senator's tedious repetition, and I venture to say, without for one moment resorting to the language of exaggeration, that if these walls have rung to his speech once they have listened to it a dozen times. The very stones of this building could finish almost, any sentence commenced by the honorable senator. I do not wish it to be understood that I suggest that any limitation should be placed upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> speeches, but I do feel it a personal grievance that I should be expected to furnish, a fresh reply to the same speech on every occasion. It is becoming wearying for me to do so. Unless he can find some fresh matter, he will have to pardon me if, in the future, my replies to his speeches are shorter than perhaps he may think courteous. What was his complaint in dealing with that portion of the matter which had an appearance of freshness because it dealt with the Governor-General's Speech ? He complained that the Government are not proposing to bring in conscription. He does not seem to understand that a political party can be loyal to the pledges which it gave to the country. If he did, he would not have expressed surprise that the present Government were not bringing forward conscription. Every honorable senator on this side went and pledged himself definitely to the electors, and for the honorable senator to say there is no reference to conscription in the Governor-General's Speech is merely to state what everybody here knew, and what everybody in the country recognised, and that is that a pledge given by this party would be honoured. We won the elections on that pledge. I can quite understand the surprise which was in the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> when he found that any body of politicians or public men are capable of keeping a pledge. It may be, perhaps, a useful lesson to the honorable senator to note that the National party, having given a pledge, will act upon it. He admitted that in one particular he was wrong. He said that throughout the country he told the electors that the pledges given by the members of the National party would be broken, and urged them, therefore, to vote against that party, because they were not to be trusted. He stood here to-night and said that we are to be trusted. I want to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> and the electors outside, that, having been faithful in .that matter, as we are, upon his own admission, we will be equally faithful in other matters. </para>
                        <para>The honorable senator, who admitted that his warnings and his prophecies have been falsified by the actions of this party in the past, was not . in any way restrained from indulging in a further series of warnings and prophecies. One of them was that those who sent the National party into power are going to be woefully disappointed when they read in the morning's newspapers of the presentation of measures by means of the Governor-General's Speech. Before the honorable senator is twenty-four hours older, I venture the prediction that he will again find that he is in error; and in whatever other walks of life he may be successful, it is not going to be as a political prophet. I utter the prediction that when the people read the statement presented by the Government through the mouth of the Governor-General they will accept it as a practical working proposition for the redemption of their pledges to the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> said, "What was there in the Speech which would not have appeared in a speech presented by any other Government?" It is possible that there may be a measure of truth in his remark ; but I remind him that there are only two ways in which recruits can bc obtained, and that is by either the voluntary or compulsory method. I think that, almost without exception, the members of the National party believe in the compulsory principle. It is an accepted article of faith with them that it is the only sound, economic, and democratic principle, and we submitted that view to the country. I venture to say that, but for the restraint placed upon us by the country, the National party would still be desirous of putting that policy into effect. But, the people of the country having intimated that they were not able to indorse our view, we then told them that we would endeavour to obtain men by the only policy which was left. My honorable friends opposite offered the same promise. They said that they, too, would seek to obtain men by the voluntary system. They said that they would do as much as we would do. Seeing that we declared that the question of conscription was not an issue at the elections, and that both parties professed a willingness to support the voluntary method, the obvious thing is that the country believed this side, and did not believe the other side. The electors knew that, whilst' it was one thing for candidates seeking their suffrages to stand on a platform and profess adherence to a particular faith, something more was wanted. They knew that merely to say that a party was in favour of encouraging recruiting and helping to win the war was not sufficient. They knew - and their fears on that occasion have been amply justified since - that whilst both parties professed a willingness and a desire to obtain recruits, there was one party which meant what it said, and that there was another party which they were not prepared to trust. </para>
                        <para>

                            mentioned something about the National party having been elected because of the hopes which it had excited in the minds of the electors. That is largely true; but it is equally true that a large measure of support came to the National party because of the fears which the Labour party had excited. To show how sound was the public judgment on this matter, let me remind
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>
                            of what transpired at a Conference which he attended. The National party did go to the country saying that it was out to win the war. The Labour party used the same words, but made it quite clear to the electors that, while they did not mind the war being won, they were not going to disturb themselves to secure the winning of it. They have shown since then that they were much more anxious to secure peace at any price than to ask their supporters to submit to some inconvenience and some sacrifice, in order to secure that honorable peace which alone will assure future safety to this country. At the Conference to which I referred just now a resolution was passed. What was it? I have not the exact words here, but it was, in effect, that steps should be taken to secure peace without annexations and without indemnities. There were other resolutions passed on that occasion - resolutions which were repeated at a Conference recently held in Melbourne. Can any one dispute for a moment that these resolutions, and the unanimity with which they have been adopted in one State after another by the members of
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline>
                            party, indicate that it is prepared to abandon everything and anything if it can only get peace?

                        <para>This evening the honorable senator gave an indication of the utter recklessness with which he will make statements. He denounced here tonight a cablegram which the Minister for Defence stated had been received from the War authorities at Home, declaring that . 16,500 recruits per month were needed to maintain our divisions at their full strength. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> said tonight that he did not believe that such a cablegram was in existence. He was a member of the Government at the time when the cablegram was received, or if it was not received, he was a member of the Government after the Prime Minister - his chief - had publicly given the contents  of that document to the world. I ask honorable senators to picture the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> going throughout the country and declaring that he had received from the Imperial authorities a cablegram stating that 16o500 men per month were necessary in order to maintain our divisions at the Front. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> believed then, as he believes now, that statement to be a deliberate and wicked lie for the purpose of deceiving the people of this country, he never opened his mouth. He was content to remain under the leadership of a man who he declares was trying to deceive the country by a fictitious cablegram. </para>

                                <para>- What the honorable senator may have done in the secrecy of the party room I do not know, but he has to account to the country for the fact that, for six months, he knew that the Prime Minister, and those who stood with him, were fooling the people of the country by telling them a wicked and deliberate lie. How can the people of New South Wales, or of this country, be expected to give any credence, or . attach any importance, to the remarks of a public man who is so utterly reckless in his use of words, or so utterly indifferent to the obligations which ought to rest upon him ? Here is another instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> unreliability. </para>

                        <para>Here is another instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> recklessness. He came here this evening, and, with that appearance of dauntless courage which he always assumes, said what a monstrous wrong it was that we should attempt to defray the cost of the war out of loans until we had exhausted all the avenues of taxation. Then, becoming almost pathetic, he pictured the position of our soldiers coming back to the country - as we hope they will do- and being asked by taxation to provide the interest and sinking fund for the loans raised in their absence. The statement sounded very well, but, without turning to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> I ask my honorable friends to draw upon their memories. We all know that it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> Government which brought in the first War Loan Bill ever seen in Australia. They had not exhausted the avenues of taxation - nothing like it. </para>

It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> when he mounts a platform outside, away from the press and the restraining influence of those who are in a position to answer him, to indulge in statements of this kind, but in this Chamber honorable senators know the facts, and they will conclude that his statement on this point affords only another example of the reason why the electors did not accept at their full face value the assurances which he ventured to give them. </para>

                                <para>- If we could rob honorable senators opposite of the name attached to the party now we should be rendering them a service which they do not deserve. We were informed that these soldier lads of ours did not know what was going on in Australia, but honorable senators opposite took very great care that the soldiers should know what was going on from their point of view. They appointed one of their number - Sergeant, or is it Field Marshal, McGrath - to act as their representative and scrutineer. Although many of them here showed very great facility in the misrepresentation of facts, Sergeant McGrath has nothing to learn from any one of them. He, at any rate, put the case for the consideration of the soldiers in a way that was not excelled by any honorable senators opposite. He told them what no doubt will appear to my honorable friends opposite as facts. We have heard a great deal said about the scandalous wickedness of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce, Mr. Hughes, Senator Thomas,</inline> and others. We have heard something about the wickedness of members of the Labour party, headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> because of the terms they applied to the section of the party that left them. I am not saying that the terms used were Chesterfieldian in style, but those who indorsed the work of' Sergeant McGrath can find no fault with them. I quote from Sergeant McGrath's circular addressed from London to the soldiers at the Front. As a matter of fact, the circular was reproduced in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> but in common with others I hold a copy of the actual circular itself. </para>

                                <para>- I venture to say that when honorable senators opposite appointed Sergeant McGrath to do this work for them they had confidence in his loyalty to themselves, and his business capacity to perform the work which they appointed him to carry out. If they mean to suggest that Sergeant McGrath was, to use the vernacular, " in . the bag," it is not* for me to dispute it, but he was their accredited agent, and it is reasonable to assume he did his work thoroughly. I know this is painful matter for my' honorable friends opposite to listen to, but I ask them to bear with me for a while. Sergeant McGrath, addressing the fighting sons of Australia, said - " The ballot-paper upon which soldiers will vote is a fraud." </para>

It was, as all such documents necessarily are, but for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to say that those who subscribed to that manifesto were attempting to hide what had happened is proof either that the honorable senator does not know (he meaning of the words he uses or that he is himself trying to convey an impression that does not . square with the facts. </para>

                                <para>- What I say is that that " section " which Arthur Rae has so admirably described is the section which has captured the machine to which my honorable friend belongs. The proof of it is that Arthur Rae points out that that " section " ran a ticket for all offices, and he was the only person who escaped. I can quite understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDou-</inline> gall's feelings when he thinks of the next two years, after which he has to go up for re-election. Prom a long association with the honorable senator I can extend to him my heart-felt! sympathy. But putting on one side any tendency to levity on these matters, it appears tome that neither this Senate nor the country is interested in these echoes of past elections, these wails of disappointment, these moans of despair. To-day they belong to something in which the country is not interested. What, does interest it, is the practical work to deal with which this Parliament has been summoned. </para>

If there are sins of omission to be laid at the door of the Government, surely it was his duty to have pointed them out. Nobody can say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has indicated anything which ought to have been included in the Vice-Regal utterance, but which, is not there. It may be that he was unable to find anything, but if he did know of something and declined to offer a suggestion for public consideration, he was remiss in the duty which he owes to the country. But the honorable senator is like the character in Dickens, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Gummidge,</inline> " never happy unless he is miserable," an'd I venture tlo say that he is going to be both happy and miserable for some years to come. </para>

                        <para>The Government have submitted their policy, and the only fault which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has found with it is that it does not contain a proposal the inclusion .of which would have tamped this party with ignominy and dishonour. But this policy does represent a practical, sane, and effective means of redeeming the pledges of the Government, when we bear in mind the limitation which the electors themselves imposed upon us. It is quite possible that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> himself does not recognise the significance of some of our proposals. He may not see, for instance, how intimately industrial and shipping matters are interwoven with the war. If he does not, there are many honorable senators who will be only too pleased to , enlighten him when these matters engage our attention. Th&lt;s Government present a policy which, whilst giving first consideration to the obligation cast upon  us  to do all that we can  to  prosecute the war  to  a successful issue, exhibits a very sound regard for the necessity of closely watching our industrial affairs, and above all, a just appreciation . of the great need for expanding our production in order that we may with less distress carry the burden which is the result of the war. I say that when honorable senators look at our proposals which are designed to meet these public needs, they will say that this policy represents a fair, honest, and practical, attempt  to  redeem the. pledges upon which we were returned  to  this Parliament. . </para>
