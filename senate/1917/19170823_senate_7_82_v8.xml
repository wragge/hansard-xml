                (South Australia) [3.6]. - I rise to suggest to the Minister for Defence that, instead of putting in a reference to a provision in the Army Act, the sub-section itself should be inserted. There are very few persons who are supplied with a copy of the Army Act, and, therefore, it - is very difficult to ascertain what is the meaning of Active Service." In the Army Act that term is defined as follows: -

            <para class="block">That definition, if inserted in the amendment of section 4 of our Defence Act, would not occupy more space than does" the present reference to it. There is always a difficulty in finding out the meaning of a reference to a provision in an Imperial Act. I recognise that the question may be raised, and possibly will be raised by the Minister, that if an alteration were made in the definition in the Army Act, it would nullify this provision. But I would point out that should such an alteration be made, probably this provision would be deleted, so that an alteration in our Act would be required as well. I do not propose to submit an amendment, but merely to make the suggestion to the Minister. I should like to know what his views are. </para>

                    <para>. - I was about to rise to give the reasons why this amendment is thought necessary. The amendment of our definition of " Active Service" and the definition of "War Service " are necessary, because the definition of "Active Service" in our Defence Act is not the same as the definition in the Army Act. Our troops in war, except in special cases, would have to work under the Army Act, and the difference in the definitions has always been productive of a lot of misapprehension and confusion. The wording of the definition in the Army Act under which our troops work reads - </para>

                    referred to. The Army Act. might be amended at any time, and that would always necessitate an amendment of our Defence Act. We have expressly safeguarded our position as regards the control of our soldiers in all that concerns them by providing that where . the Army Act is inconsistent with the Defence Act the latter shall prevail, so that if any amendments were made in the Army Act dealing with questions which were dealt with in our Defence Act and inconsistent with the Defence Act, it is our own Defence Act that would prevail. But all we adopt here is the definition of " active service " in the Army Act. After all, this is not a clause that will be. specially looked up by anybody or everybody. It only comes into play
                    <inline font-style="italic">on</inline>
                    occasions when it is necessary to define what " active service " is, when our troops are away on active service' associated with other troops. It is then necessary that there should be one common definition of " active service " for all the British troops who are fighting together. I therefore suggest to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rowell</inline>
                    that there is no great necessity to put the words in our Bill. Some slight amendment might be made later on in the British Army Act, and then we would have to amend our Act. No particular harm is caused to anybody by this definition. ' There can be no injustice done to any of our troops, because they are safeguarded by that provision which renders the Army Act null and void as regards our troops where it is inconsistent with the Defence Act.
                </para>
                <para>I may explain the other definitions provided for in clause 4. The definition of "District Commandant" is altered. That is necessary because the definition in the present Act has a very limited meaning. When the Commandant is ill somebody has to act for him, and the present definition is too restricted. We are widening the definition to enable us to overcome that difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is referring to a matter about which a number of enterprising business people have approached me. They represented to me that there was no prohibition of the sale of the Australian Rising Sun badge in England. It can be manufactured and sold there freely. They submitted that we should, therefore, allow it to be trafficked in here. That is not a convincing argument to me. There is no particular reason why the British Government should interfere on our behalf in that matter, but there was a very good reason why we should stop the practice here, because there were countless cases of men . obtaining those badges, parading the streets, obtaining money on the ground that they were returned soldiers, disgracing the uniform, and bringing the Forces into disrepute. Business people selling those things for profit were lending themselves to that kind of thing. That is why we stopped it. </para>

                        <para>- I think so. There will then be a greater demand for the decorations by people who never earned them. We want to see that those who earn them have a monopoly of them. This, however, is only a definition clause. The penalties are dealt with later. </para>

                <para>There is also a definition of " officer." The term "officer" is defined . by section 190, sub-section 4, of the Army Act, as an officer commissioned or in pay as an officer." It is necessary to insure that all persons acting as officers should be subject to responsibility, even though irregularly appointed. It can be. easily understood that in dealing as we have been doing for the last three years with an army raised quickly and under great difficulties, the formalities regarding appointment have not been observed in all cases. Officers may have been for the time- irregularly appointed, and may have thought that they were quite regularly appointed. Some detail may have been overlooked, and they may have done things which they were empowered to do only if they were regularly appointed officers. We take steps later on to validate' those actions, but it is necessary to insure in the definition clause that such officers shall be subject to responsibility. Officers now on 'active service in the Australian Imperial Force are appointed by the General Officer Commanding subject to confirmation by tha Governor-General, and are, therefore, acting until confirmed in their appointment. Such confirmation may be refused. An officer while acting may do something which may come to the knowledge of the authorities before the appointment is actually confirmed. The appointment then is not confirmed, yet in his position he may have carried out certain duties. It is necessary to regularize what he has done. </para>
                <para>There is also a definition of " war service," which is necessary for this reason: At the termination of the war, and on the proclamation of the war as terminated, most of our troops will probably be in occupation of enemy countries - or, at least, we hope they will - and their return to Australia may be delayed for lack of transport. It is obviously necessary that during the absentee of the operation of the civil law, the military code under which _ 'they now serve should continue . until they are discharged in Australia. The Army Act provides for such circumstances, but the terms are not easily applicable. It is, therefore, thought better to use the new term " war service" to include both service during the war, and service until such time as the soldier returns to Australia, and is discharged. </para>

                    <para>. - "Under section 8 of the Defence Act the Governor-General has the power to appoint and promote officers, but has no authority to delegate that power. It is obvious that the Governor-General - meaning in this case practically the Minister - cannot appoint or promote officers on the other side of the world, and so it is necessary to delegate this power -by authorizing the Officer Commanding the Australian Imperial Force, General Birdwood, to appoint or promote officers. The clause, therefore, really validates appointments and promotions made under the authority which has been assumed under the general powers exercised by every Government in time of war. </para>

                        <para>- No, I mean aliens, because ten years hence we may be at war with another country. The fact that -such officers hold appointments under the Defence Department has caused public resentment, and in many respects it has operated to the disadvantage of the Department. Whether it has been the cause of or not I cannot say, but . I know that it has been made an excuse for, very active opposition to voluntary recruiting, and I think the Minister must be aware of this. I. should have expected, therefore, that he would have taken some precaution, now that the Act is being revised, to bring down such amendments as would have avoided such an undesirable state of affairs in the future. </para>

I have listened with some interest to various questions that have been put to the Government in regard to aliens, and I have listened with more interest to the replies. The most that can be said for those replies is that they have been evasive, and I want to know why there is all this delicacy when dealing with the subject of aliens.- We seem to be living in an atmosphere which precludes any reference to them. It appears to be thought dangerous to refer to one for fear we might hurt somebody's feelings. </para>

                        <para>.- Honorable senators will remember the conditions that existed in this country just prior to the war. All our docks and harbors were open to aliens, and the whole of our commerce and industries were available for their activities. These men were even welcomed into our homes; they partook of our hospitality, sat down at our tables, and had extended to them the hand of friendship; but while they had smiles on their faces black treachery was seething in their hearts. I say that men of a race capable of such duplicity are not entitled to this delicacy of treatment on the part of the Government. To-day they are the accursed of all humanity, and by their diabolical treatment of human beings they have forfeited all right to sympathy and consideration. Why should we exhibit a chivalrous regard for their feelings ? It is high time that the Government took off its kid gloves in regard to this alien question. </para>

                        <para>- If adopted, French soldiers who have fought with us in this war would be given to understand that their sons could not obtain a commission in, our Australian Forces, and the same remark is applicable to an American or an Italian. The amendment seeks to deal, not merely with an alien enemy, but with an alien. Now we all hope that when this war has terminated there will be a large stream of immigration to Australia. We trust that a considerable proportion of that immigration will be British, but we must all realize that if the stream is to be entirely British we shall have a very small accession to our population for some years to come. Personally, I would not object to our French and Belgian Allies, or their descendants, coming to Australia- </para>

Surely the best proof that any man can give of loyalty to a  country is his willingness to shed his blood for it. Under the amendment proposed we should be saying to these people, " Neither you nor your children shall ever be eligible to receive an appointment as a permanent officer in the Australian Forces." </para>

                        <para>- Thus we should be branding them as enemies of our country. Something has been said of permanent officers in our Defence Force who are of alien birth. It is true that there are some such officers. But I venture to say that there has not been a single case in which the slightest evidence of disloyalty on the part of these officers has ever been forthcoming. On the other hand, there has been abundant evidence of ability and willingness on their part to serve this country. As a matter of fact, some of them have rendered distinguished service, and have obtained recognition for it. Whilst it is desirable that in the appointment of officers we should, wherever possible, appoint officers of British birth, it is nevertheless a fact that difficulties have sometimes arisen because an officer has borne a German name, although in reality there has been very little German blood in him. But in order to remove the suspicion which has attached to such officers, are we justified in proclaiming that the descendants of races which are to-day fighting side by side with us should not be eligible to obtain commissions in our Defence Forces? </para>

                    O'LOGHLIN (South Australia) [3.38]. - I do not think that the mover of the amendment can have considered its far-reaching effect. As has already been pointed out by the Minister, it includes not merely the aliens who are to-day in arms against us, but also the descendants of our allies. I wish expressly to dissociate myself from what amounts, practically, to a persecution of our German colonists who are not in arms against us, although their countrymen are. I , desire to indorse the statement of  President  Wilson, in the manifesto which he issued to the world, that the American people especially dissociated themselves from any quarrel with the German people. We are fighting against the Prussian junkers and the military spirit of Germany, but not against the German people. An instance occurs to my mind which will serve to illustrate how the amendment, if adopted, might operate. On the first transport which I commanded there was a young officer of German descent named Hubbe, who was well-known to  Colonel Rowell  and all South Australian senators. He has since been killed at the Front.  His  father fought in the Boer war, where he, too, paid the supreme penalty.  His  grandfather was one of the best colonists we ever had in South Australia, and was mainly responsible for the Real Property Act which was passed by the State Legislature - an Act of world-wide significance. If the Committee adopt the proposal of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline>
                    it will exclude, not merely the aliens who are in arms against us, but our Italian, French, Belgian, and American allies. I remind honorable senators that the generally accepted definition of an alien is one who was born outside of the British Dominions; but we know that such a person on being naturalized is no longer considered an alien, but a British subject. I have no sympathy whatever with the amendment, and I trust the Committee will not agree to it.

                    <para>. - I agree with the Minister for Defence, and also with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin,</inline> that the amendment goes much too far. The use of the word " descendant " would carry its effect to the third, fourth, or later generations. However, I am very heartily in accord with the principle of the amendment. I think that we should prohibit aliens, and even those who have become naturalized, from obtaining commissions in the Australian Array. Much has been heard from many platforms of the principle of Australia for Australians, and that is the principle underlying <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton's</inline> amendment. I believe, that commissions in our Army should be reserved for our own loyal Australians. I shall not follow through all its ramifications the public unrest which has been created, or refer to the many instances which are known to honorable senators of the rebuffs we have received in connexion with the employment of aliens as a result of our too liberal British policy. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> that it would be well if he altered his amendment- -to read - </para>

                <para>Provided that no person, being an alien unnaturalized or otherwise, shall be eligible for appointment as an officer in the Australian Military Forces. </para>
                <para class="block">That would carry us in this matter as far as we can reasonably go. It would provide a safeguard for the future, and prevent a repetition of the mistakes1 of the past. I hope that the Minister for Defence, in view of what has gone before, will be prepared to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton's</inline> amendment in the modified form I suggest. So far as I can see, it would inflict no injustice upon any one. It would not be disloyal even to our Allies, because, after all, the people of the countries included in the British Empire have been, and possibly will continue to be, more liberal to foreigners than are the people of any other country.I urge upon the Committee the necessity for incorporating in this Bill a provision to safeguard our interests in the future by prohibiting the employment in our Australian Army of - aliens, whether naturalized or unnaturalized. Honorable senators will re- collect that here in Melbourne, just before the war, the German Consul for Australia specifically told a meeting of Germans, naturalized and unnaturalized, that they must unconditionally decide whether they were Germans or British, and that they would have to decide the matter for themselves and for the future. We know not what the future has in store for us. We do not know whether we shall have a peace by victory or a peace by negotiation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton's</inline> amendment in the form I have suggested could do no harm, whilst it would prohibit the employment in our Defence Force of aliens, naturalized or unnaturalized, and its effects would not go beyond the first generation. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not wish it to be considered that I am putting up a plea for our German colonists at the present time when I say that we should be fair to the descendants of Germans who settled in Australia many years ago. There is a very great deal of dissatisfaction expressed, not only in our Army, but in the community generally, because of the number of Germans who are supposed to be in our Australian Forces at the present time; but there is nothing to be said against them, so far as their conduct and behaviour is concerned. Where their loyalty to Australia can be questioned, action is very quickly taken ; but no suggestion of a lack of loyalty has been raised with respect to them. I should like to say, however, that I am concerned about recruiting in South Australia at the present time. The organization with which I am associated has sent officers through the districts largely settled by Germans from one end to the other, and recruits are not being obtained from those districts in anything like the number that we should have. It is not unreasonable to condemn families in which there are four, five, and six eligible sons, not one of whom has enlisted. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but not to the same extent. The results of the recruiting movement in districts settled by Germans have proved that the German colonists are not volunteering in anything like the same proportion as are the people of British descent. I should like to point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton's</inline> amendment would not prevent the enlistment of aliens as private soldiers. If an officer has a right to complain that there is an officer of German descent alongside of him, the man in the ranks has an equally good right to complain if a German has enlisted as a private. He has, indeed, more right, because the officer of German descent would have come from the ranks, and have received his promotion for merit. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the case in South Australia'. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> probably refers to the enlistment of aliens born outside of Australia. I could mention an instance that occurred in South Australia, where a distinction was made between cousins, the sons of a brother and. sister, because the son of the brother carried his father's German name, whilst the son of the sister carried the name of her British husband. Mistakes of that kind are bound to occur. It shows how frail the premises are -when we say that because one man bears a certain name he must be disloyal, and because another man bears another name he must be loyal. We are anxious to get young Australian-born Germans into our Army. They have as much right to go and fight for Australia as have any other residents of it. </para>

                        <para>- They do go to an extent. The Minister has pointed out to the honorable senator that every casualty list contains German names. I know that there are hundreds, possibly thousands, of young Australian -born Germans who have gone to the Front. But there are thousands who have not gone, and I want them to go. I desire them to become soldiers and fight for this country. I cannot ask them to do that unless I hold out to them the inducement that they can rise to any position in the Army. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that it would not. An Australian-born German, of course, cannot be called an alien. The clause with the amendment would be more acceptable to me than it is at present. I could not think of voting for the clause as it is and asking these young men to join the Army. Certainly with the omission of the words "descendant of an alien ' ' the clause would be less objectionable. I do not know exactly what the effect of that amendment would be; but I certainly am not anxious that full-blooded Germans should have any positions in the Australian Army. In fact I would have full-blooded Germans kept out of every position of responsibility in Australia at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- No; it applies to all our Allies who are aliens. From' Broken Hill, from Port Pirie, and other seaports Greeks and Russians are being sent Home to-day to fight in this great war. They are all aliens to the British race, but because to-day they are friendly Allies we could not possibly include them in a provision of this kind. For one thing it would be un-British to' include them, and for another thing it would be absolutely unfair. I do not know what the Minister thinks of the proposed new clause in the amended form which has been suggested. I do not know that it would be wise to carry the new clause even in that form. I am anxious to get the young German wherever I can lay my hands upon him. He ought to go and volunteer to fight for Australia. And if w© insist upon him doing that we cannot prevent him from attaining to the rank of officer if his ability should warrant his promotion. That is the point I wish to make. ' </para>

                <para class="block">Imperial Government, or attached to Imperial Departments of State, there were men who helped to land us in our present difficulty. We left the door too open, and to-day we are paying the penalty. It is not too late to try to make some alteration, but <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> is reaching out too far. I cannot imagine a man of enemy birth, and naturalized in Australia, becoming an officer in the Australian Imperial Forces. Shortly . after the commencement of hostilities the Defence authorities here had to take action in connexion with an officer who, I think, was attached to the Automobile Corps. He was a captain named Edwards. It was discovered that he was sending to his mother in Germany letters giving all the facts, and hoping that Germany would win. The Minister had to take action immediately, and did the right thing in interning the man. It shows the danger which besets us in putting a man of enemy origin in a position of trust and responsibility in the Military Forces. I object utterly to these men having anything to do with our Forces, good, bad, or indifferent. But when we are asked to exclude tha descendants of aliens we are asked to go too far. I would keep the man of enemy origin out of every Department of State; in fact, I would keep him in " durance vile,", whether he is naturalized or otherwise, because he is a source of danger to us. The system of espionage has been another factor in bringing us into our present position. I could not be a party to the carrying on of a vendetta from generation to generation. </para>

                    <para>.  - I would go further than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> and certainly further than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin.</inline> I approve of the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> and would support him even it he were inclined to go so far as to adopt this expression : ' ' enemy alien or the son of an enemy alien." I do not believe in carrying the prohibition beyond that point. No doubt honorable senators have been brought into personal contact with young Australians who are the sons of enemy aliens, and have noticed that their sympathies are almost as keenly with Germany in this war as are those of their parents. Blood is thicker than water. The son of a German is surrounded by German influences.  His  home life is German, although he is a young Australian, and probably he is just as much, imbued with German ideals', and has very nearly the same devotion or respect for his' father's country, as has the father himself. </para>

                        <para>- He is just as German in many cases. It is not the fault of these young Australians that their parents' country is at war with us; it is their -misfortune. Other persons have to put up with misfortunes attaching to their nationality. It would not be consistent to say that an enemy alien, or, following out my idea,, the son of an enemy alien, should be debarred from getting promotion if he joins as a private. I would even go so far as to say that neither  as  an officer nor -as a private is it wise to have the son of  am  enemy alien going out of Australia to fight on our side. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. But it is only natural that the sons of enemy aliens should be actuated by an undercurrent of sympathy with' their fathers' country in the war. One of my greatest- friends for many years in Tasmania was a full-blooded German. He only came out a few years before the war began. He was one of the finest men I have ever met. He candidly told a friend of mine that immediately the war broke out he wanted to get out of Tasmania. He was honest and straightforward enough to say that he wished to get away and fight for his own country. He had become a naturalized subject of the King, but, still, when his country was at war with us he felt the pulsation of the German blood in his veins, and thought that it would not be fair for him to refrain from trying to get away to fight for his own country. I believe it is so in many instances with the sons of enemy aliens. I do not think it is very wise for us either to persuade them by way of recruiting to join our Forces or to allow them to do so. That may be an extreme yiew, but it is mine. </para>

                        <para>-  Australian Germans of the first generation have the German blood in them. Can we trust them? Would they fight with the same ideals as the Australian-born son of an allied alien? It might be argued that our ally of to-day may be our enemy of next year and our enemy of to-day our ally of a few years hence. Granted ; but history shows that that has always been the case. There is always a Parliament, and legislation can be altered to suit any altered circumstances. It would, therefore, be safer to go even to the extent I have mentioned. </para>

                    <para>.- If the words "enemy alien" are put in as suggested by Senators Needham, O'Keefe, and I, think, Newland, they will have no effect, because as soon as the war ended Germans and Austrians would cease to be enemy aliens, and no alien would be excluded by the amendment, which would therefore have effect only while the war lasted. </para>

                        <para>- The clause does not say they should be expelled from the Forces if they become enemy aliens. The term " enemy alien " is altogether unworkable. The clause applies to all branches of the Military Forces. Under the rest of the Act we compel the naturalized enemy alien to train. He goes into the ranks and becomes a citizen soldier. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> would say to him, "You can never have an appointment until after the war, because you are an enemy alien, but as soon as the war is over you can get an appointment, and if your country remains friendly, you can continue to receive promotion." After all, we all share the feeling of detestation of our enemy, and it is likely to warp our judgment in regard to the effect of this clause on our friends. I have consulted the military officers, and am assured that since the war began there has not been a single case of desertion <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the enemy in the Australian Imperial Force, although there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of descendants of enemy aliens in it. When the war began we applied to the British Government for permission to enlist unnaturalized Frenchmen in the Australian Imperial Force, because a number of these had asked us to give them the opportunity to serve. Later we asked the Russian Government and the American Government for permission to enlist their citizen, and in all three cases consent was given. The Italians did not give their consent. A large number of Frenchmen, a considerable number of Russians, and a fair number of Americans enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, and are now fighting with our Forces. If this amendment is carried we say to them, " No matter what services you render, we debar you from promotion, and if, after fighting through the war as a private you come back to Australia and become naturalized, you can never get promotion in our Military Forces.". Would that be fair treatment? Whatever mistakes may have been made before the war there is no doubt that all Governments are going to learn the lessons of the war, and one lesson is to make them very careful about accepting persons of alien birth. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The elimination of the words " or descendant of an alien " will not get over the chief injustice of the clause. I therefore ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> not to press it. If the war has convinced honorable senators that certain disabilities ought to be laid on aliens generally, we should deal with the. subject as a whole, for there are a great many more things that ought to be done. The whole subject can be dealt with in connexion with the Naturalization Act. An amending Naturalization Bill was passed lately, but it dealt only with details, and the British Government have intimated to us that one of the first things they propose to deal with as the result of the war is the fundamental principles affecting naturalization. At the first Imperial Conference that' will be held, one of the subjects already listed for consideration is the fundamental principles of nationality - that is, whether naturalized persons are to enjoy the full rights of British citizenship. We should not, in this Bill, deal only with one phase of that big question in a way that will inflict injustice on a person who has rendered to the Empire the best service that any man can render to a country - that is, he has been prepared to give his life, if necessary, to defend it. </para>

                    <para>. - We cannot possibly allow the clause to go through in this way. I regard it as an attempt to enlist men for the Australian Army, and to debar them from promotion when they get there. If I thought for a moment that the clause had any prospect of passing I would certainly move to strike out the word "officer," and insert words which would prevent aliens from joining the Australian Army altogether. I am confident that the good sense of the Committee will induce it to reject the clause, which is manifestly so unfair, because it seeks to confer privileges upon an officer, and withhold them from a soldier. I thought that in a measure like this we were fighting for the rights of a democratic army, but it seems to me that we are fighting for the rights and privileges of officers only, for, according to the proposed amendment, they are not to have their susceptibilities shocked by association with aliens, but soldiers may fight alongside alien soldiers in the trenches or anywhere else. For that reason I ask the Committee to reject the clause, not out of any regard for enemies of Great Britain, but on the ground that it is unfair and one-sided. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> does not remove very many of the objections that have been urged against the whole of the proposed new clause. The. question of nationality is a difficult one to settle. To illustrate what I mean, I may mention that when I was in France last year I had brought under my notice a case illustrating a fatal objection to the. clause, even in its amended form. With other members of the parliamentary party I visited Armentieres, where an interpreter was engaged in the service of the Australian Army. At that time Marshal Joffre was in charge of all the Forces in France, and his instructions had to be interpreted to the officers commanding the Australian Forces. The interpreter in that case was an Alsatian. Can any honorable senator say if an Alsatian is a Frenchman or a German? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, at the present time he is, but that interpreter was one of. the most enthusiastic fighters in the French Army. It would seem, therefore, that this question of nationality requires delicate handling. It cannot be settled in any slap-dash fashion such as is now proposed. It would be far better, I think, to allow every case to be settled on its merits. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> referred to the case of a German named Edwards, but when all the circumstances surrounding that matter were made public, nobody had any doubt as to what should be done. Hundreds of such cases will occur in our Defence Forces, and it will be difficult to decide any of them without knowing the whole of the circumstances, and we have that power already. </para>

                        <para>- No. The Minister responsible for the administration of the Act will decide. Referring again to the employment of foreign officers, I  might inform the Committee that a few days after our visit to Armentieres I visited a dressing station at Croix-du-bae, and there met Australian soldiers who had just come out of the battle of Fleurbaix, in which they had been rather badly knocked about. Somebody had blundered, and in this case the officers who came in for the criticism were Australians. One of the men said, " I wish to God we had either Frenchmen or Englishmen at the head ofus." </para>

The question before the Committee was the proposed new clause by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton.</inline> Discussion took place on that, and it was suggested by one or two honorable senators - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> in the first place - that the words " or descendant of an alien " be left out. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> then asked leave to alter the proposed new clause, which is practically an amendment, but this can only be done by leave of the Committee. You straightaway put the question, " That the words proposed to be left out be left out," when there was no such proposal at all. I contend that the proposed new clause is still before the Committee, and that, before any words can be left out, leave of the Committee must be obtained. </para>

I submit that proposed amendments - that is to say, amendments which have not been' carried - are not susceptible of amendment. "Whenever an amendment of an amendment has been proposed, the practice invariably followed has been for the mover to obtain leave to amend his amendment in the direction desired. In the present instance that was not done. Instead, the  Chairman  put the question " That the words proposed to be left out be left out." I contend that his action was altogether irregular. </para>

Now, whenever an honorable senator has moved an amendment, and has subsequently desired .to alter it, the custom has been  for him to first obtain the leave of the Committee to so - amend it. In the present instance, what happened was that, after discussion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> suggested that certain words in the proposed new clause should be left out. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> thereupon sought the leave of the Committee to amend the clause in the direction indicated.

According to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, something happened which was not heard by many of us. It does seem to me that if any honorable senator, other than the mover of the proposed new clause, had moved an amendment to it, the  Chairman  would have been quite right in putting that amendment to the Committee. But when the mover of the proposed new clause himself wished to alter it, he should, in accordance with our invariable practice, have obtained the leave of the Committee to do so. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, one has to write out his dissent very hurriedly. My contention is that the proposed new clause cannot be amended in the way that it was sought to be amended, and that the honorable senator who desired to amend it should first have obtained the leave of the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- The matter at issue is a very simple one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> has proposed the insertion of a new clause in the Bill, and it is contended in the written disagreement with the Chairman's ruling that the Committee has not the power to amend that proposal. It is manifest that the Committee has power to amend any amendment or any proposal that maybe placed before it. I would point out that it is one of the most frequent practices for a Minister in charge of a Bill to get up and move amendment after amendment in it. If a Minister has a right to do that, every other honorable senator has an equal right to do it. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister must recognise that the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> was proposed by leave of the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> obtained a special instruction from the Senate to the Committee to enable him to submit his amendments. I have always held, and I shall continue to hold, that every honorable senator has equal rights with a Minister, save only as regards one or two exceptions provided by the Standing Orders. Consequently, I rule that when an honorable senator proposes the insertion of a new clause, he has a right to move any amendment to it. It would be quite different if it were an amendment proposed on an amendment of one of the clauses of the Bill itself. </para>

I must uphold the Chairman's ruling, because the Committee has a perfect right to amend any amendment.

                        <para>- In order that there shall be no danger of any appointees at present in the Forces being interfered with. I ask honorable senators, in dealing with this matter, to dissociate from their minds the present war and our present enemies, and to look forward to the halcyon days of peace which we hope are ahead of us. The word " alien " really means a foreigner, and it must be obvious to us all that one of the lessons of the war is that we must tighten up many avenues previously left too widely open. This is one which I very strongly hold should be tightened up. If I stood alone in this matter, I should, to the best of my ability, support a provision of this kind in the interests of what I hold to be the future welfare of the Australian Forces. </para>

                        <para>- No. The object of my amendment is that the provision shall not be retrospective. It should meet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland's</inline> argument. In peace times, the Australian Military Forces will consist very largely of cadets from sixteen to- twenty years of age, and, so far as I can see, the amendment as amended would not touch them, since, in the great majority of cases, they would be Australian-born British subjects. I hope the Committeewill seriously consider this matter. I regard it, to some extent, as the thin end of the economic wedge which the Australian people will have to use after the war. So far as I know, no alien and no foreigner is treated as leniently or as liberally in other countries as he is in the British Empire. I am sure that, after the war, some example will be set us by the Mother </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> suggestion that, so far as we can, we should, in considering this matter, dissociate ourselves from influences naturally arising out of the present war. But we cannot overlook the fact that we have amongst us friendly aliens as well as enemy aliens. I wish to cultivate a friendly feeling with the people of other countries, and particularly with our American cousins. This chamber rang the other night with sentiments of that character, when we were discussing a proposal to establish a representative of Australia in the United States of America. Honorable senators were lauding the Americans to the skies on that occasion, but, instead of cultivating that friendly feeling to-day, it is proposed that we should include a provision in this Bill contradicting the sentiments expressed the other night, and showing that we are not really anxious to cultivate a friendly feeling with Americans. I do not desire to encourage unfriendly feelings with friendly aliens, and I look forward particularly to a good understanding with the American people in the future. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> that if we are going to cut out all aliens, including friendly aliens, we should start from the bottom in our Forces, and should prevent the enlistment of any aliens. I direct attention to the fact that all these appointments will rest with the Governor-General in Council, which means the Minister for Defence. I have a warm sympathy for the sentiment of Australia for the Australians, but I do not think we should be so exclusive as to shut out everybody. To do so would be to tie our hands behind our backs, and, if an occasion arose, when it was desirable to appoint a very competent man to an important position we might, under this provision, be unable to do so. </para>

                        <para>- I am not disposed to follow the people of other nations in everything they may do. The Government will appoint officers on military advice, and this Parliament and the people will control the Government. If Ministers appointed men to important military positions who did not meet with the approval of the community, the people would very promptly let them know about it. I think that Ministers are not at all likely to appoint enemy aliens to such positions. Broadly, I believe in the sentiment of Australia for the Australians, and where we have a capable Australian available he should be appointed to any position he is fitted to fill. I believe that any Australian Government may be trusted to adopt that course. </para>

It does not appear to matter how many alien subjects we may get into the ranks. I wish to preserve the private soldier as well as the officer from associating with aliens in the ranks. I am not concerned with what the consequences of carrying the amendment or the provision itself might be.

It is pretty clear that a majority of the Committee are not in favour of the proposed new clause, but even if they were I would point out that the amendment would make the provision meaningless, as part of section 8 of the principal Act, because that section deals solely with officers. The amendment, if carried, would make the section deal not only with officers, but with members of the Forces generally. That question will have to be dealt with in another part of the principal Act. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> that he ought not to press his amendment, but should vote against the proposed new clause. </para>

I was rather gratified to notice the concern which many honorable senators had for the feelings of aliens. One of my chief reasons in submitting this proposal was to protect aliens who are already officers in our Military Forces. These gentlemen have been subjected to a very great deal of offensive and hostile criticism simply because they bear alien names. It was as much to insure their protection as to remove the possibility of such an undesirable situation in the future that this amendment was submitted by me. I ask honorable senators to recognise the righteousness and justice of the proposal, and to vote for it.

As a late member of the Australian Forces, and as one who during his service abroad came in contact with officers and men who belonged to different nationalities from our own, and were fighting with us, I should be very sorry indeed to be a party to excluding those men from joining our Forces in the future should they so desire. </para>

                    stated that his reason for submitting this proposal was because he wished to conserve the rights of the Australian Forces. I contend that it would not do anything of the sort. It would simply conserve the rights of a certain section of our Military Forces, namely, the officers. In the course of this discussion, we have simply heard about one class of men. whose rights are to be protected, namely, the officers. I represent here another class of men. I represent the private soldiers, and I quite agree with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline>
                    that if we are to debar aliens from becoming officers in the Australian Imperial Force we should debar them from joining those Forces. Surely if it is
                    <inline font-style="italic">infra dig.</inline>
                    for an officer in the Australian Imperial Force to mix with one of these so-called aliens, it is also
                    <inline font-style="italic">infra dig.</inline>
                    for a private soldier to have to fight alongside of him ! The thing is just as broad as it is long. To my mind it would be a gross outrage to ask the descendant of a German to enlist in our Forces, and to go to the Front, and if he turned out to be a good Australian soldier and won honours, then simply because his parents were born in Germany to debar him from receiving promotion, or a recognition of his services to Australia.

                        <para>- I contend that if it is carried, it will say so. We know quite well that a great many of the Germans who came out here a generation ago did so out for one purpose only, and that was to dodge Prussian militarism. I am sorry to say that a number of them are not so loyal as they should be, but some are just as anxious as is any one hereto see that Prussian militarism is crushed. </para>

                        <para>- I will get away from the German question altogether, and deal with the case of a naturalized Frenchman. If the proposed new clause were enacted, it would allow a naturalized Frenchman to enlist and fight in the Australian Forces at any time. It would allow him to do his bit for the country of his adoption, but it would debar him, from the enjoyment of any privileges which he might have won at the Front. This is one of the most unfair provisions which I have ever seen. During my short experience on the other side, I learned that the first contingent from Australia included a great number of men whose parents came from all parts of the world, and who fought well. Let me give the case of a Norwegian who came to Australia a long time ago. In two or three months, by reason of his good fighting qualities on Gallipoli, he worked his way up from private to warrant officer. If the proposed new clause were enacted, it would prevent any other such man from doing so, because the definition of the word " alien " would prevent an alien, even though he was a neutral, from winning his spurs in our Military Forces. I will now give the case of another man who distinguished himself on Gallipoli. In the Boer war, he fought on the side of the Boers, but afterwards he came to Australia, and when war broke out in Europe, he was one of the very first men to offer his services to fight against Germany. </para>

                        <para>- This man, although he was bitterly opposed to Great Britain at the time of the Boer war, proved himself to be a good soldier in our Forces. I believe that he eventually won a commission. In the part of the peninsula where I was, he was regarded as one of the bravest men. If there was a ticklish job to be done, he was always detailed to do it. If honorable senators put unfair restrictions on such men simply because they have not. been so fortunate as we have been, they will do a very great injustice. If men of alien birth are to be debarred from becoming officers in the Australian Imperial Force, I am with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> in his desire to protect the private soldiers in the same way. </para>

                    BOLTON (Victoria) [5.18]. - Senators Foll and Newland spoke to my proposed new clause from the stand-point of whether the individual is a private or an officer. That is not the idea of this proposal. My intention is a national one. At a time of war, it is most undesirable that aliens should be allowed to hold positions of trust in our Army, and have control of important military sources of information, which by reason of their national sympathies, they might use and operate to the disadvantage of this country. That is the sole reason why I submitted this proposal. With me, it is not a question of whether a man should be an officer or private; it is not a question of distinction between man and man, but it is a question of who should control the interests of this country in time of war; in short, whether the officers should be British or aliens.

                    <para>. - I notice what seems to be a conflict between certain provisions of this clause and regulation 50 made under the Defence Act 1903-1915. The regulation provides that after the 1st June, 1916, no person who is not a graduate of the Royal Military College shall be appointed an officer of the Permanent Military Forces. I do not want to depreciate the value of any services which may have been rendered by any soldier who has gone to the Front. Everybody in Australia recognises the value and merit of those services, but I want an assurance from the Minister that there is no conflict between the clause and the existing regulation. It is provided in the regulation that under normal conditions promotions shall follow a certain course. It is .obvious that there must be a certain number of young men under training for graduation in the Military College who are not able to go forward into active service in this war by reason of their age or other  circumstances.  Are they to be handicapped in their promotion, and are other men who have gone forward into active service to be put above them, so that afterwards they may even be subjected to training at Duntroon by those over whom they have been promoted in this way? </para>

They may have held the rank of private when they went away. They may obtain commissioned rank, and even high rank, on the field, but under the Defence Act as it stands they would have to serve as privates if they came back to Australia. This clause gives the Governor-General power to appoint them to a rank in the Citizen Forces similar. to the' rank they hold in the Australian Imperial Force. </para>

I have in mind the case of a soldier who may go ashore at Capetown and unfortunately miss his boat. He is really not a deserter, because, his ship having sailed, he will have to wait two or three weeks until the next vessel comes along. Would such a man be severely punished or treated for drunkenness and for being absent without leave? </para>

                    (South Australia) [5.46]. - Can the Minister state if any provision is made for the commitment of men, sentenced overseas, to prisons in Australia ? I know that a difficulty with regard to this matter arose some time ago, and the question was raised whether we had the power to commit those men to Australian prisons. When I was in office in Adelaide I had to sign warrants of commitment in regard to returned imprisoned soldiers. Some of them had received sentences of three or four years, and had about two years to serve. At that time the validity of the warrant was questioned. Can the Minister say if this question has been settled ?

I may mention that we have endeavoured to keep military prisoners, sentenced for offences against the Army Act, separated from criminals in the civil gaols. We now have military prisons associated with State prison establishments, and they are administered as military prisons. </para>

I need scarcely remind honorable senators that the year in which a lad attains the age of eighteen years he passes into the Citizen Forces. Now it may happen that his eighteenth birthday falls right at the end of the year, and, consequently, he passes into the Citizen Forces when he is only a little over seventeen years old. Some of these lads are very immature, and although they may have passed the medical examination, they are not physically fit to undergo the harder training to which they would be subjected in the Citizen Forces. Where a medical officer reports that it is in the interests of any lad's health that he should be retained in the Cadet Forces for another year, it has been thought desirable that authority should be given for him to be so retained. </para><interjection>

During the continuance of the war, this particular class of military training may, I think, advantageously be suspended, and the expenditure that is incurred upon it be thus saved to the Commonwealth. We have to recollect that our military training scheme was initiated in 1911, and that each year's quota represents about 20,000 men. As there have been seven quotas since the inception of the scheme, it is obvious that 140,000 men have been theoretically trained as soldiers ready for war, But, as a matter of fact, the Defence Department directs that such of these men as enlist in the Australian Imperial Force must go into camp, and there be trained for a period ranging from six to nine months in the elementary duties of a soldier. Therefore, by suspending the military training of persons from twelve to eighteen years of age during the continuance of the war we shall not be limiting our capacity to produce soldiers. Under our Defence Act it is mandatory that this work shall be carried on. </para><interjection>

There are many warrant and non-commissioned officers in the Permanent Forces of Australia who volunteered or went to the Front. They put up a splendid record, and in some cases have won high rank and distinction. It is, in my opinion, eminently desirable that the services and experience of these men should be utilized in the best possible way for the benefit of our Military Forces. No better methods of utilizing their services could be suggested than by promoting them or giving them commissions in the permanent branches, combatant or non-combatant, of our Australian Military Forces. The work which has been done by them has shown them to be men of intelligence, courage, and education, who are well worthy of promotion. Honorable senators will no doubt recollect that quite recently a learned gentleman in Melbourne, discussing universities and university professors, said that he knew many bricklayers who ought to be university professors, and he knew many university professors who ought to be bricklayers. I know many non-commissioned officers in the Permanent and Australian Imperial Force branches of the Australian Military Forces who' ought to be generals. And at the same time I must admit that I know some generals who ought to be bricklayers. </para><continue>

                        <para>- I should like to accept amendments that are considered improvements upon the Bill. .We do not think that this amendment would be an improvement. Parliament has voted large sums of money to establish a Military College for the deliberate purpose of providing' a staff of instructors specially trained for the work of instruction. That Military College is based upon the anticipation that it will be able to supply a sufficient number of instructors over a given number of years to keep our Permanent Forces fully staffed with competent trained men. As I pointed out on the second reading of the Bill, if we open the staff ranks of ''the Permanent Forces to other than graduates of the Military College we shall never know from year to year how many graduates we shall  require  from the College to fill up any gaps there may be amongst the permanent officers, because that is all that the Military College, under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton's</inline> amendment, would have to do. Suppose thirty officers  were required each year in order to keep the Staff Corps up to strength ; the Minister for Defence might in one year appoint the whole thirty from men who served with the Australian Imperial Force. There would be no limitation upon the number selected from that source if the amendment were accepted. Having done that, we would have thirty graduates of the Military College, which is costing £30,000 a year to keep up, and would have no positions to which to appoint them. Parliament designed the Military College to supply trained men for these positions, and yet, under the amendment, the Minister could fill all the positions vacant with men from outside the College. </para>

What I am trying to point out to honorable senators is that the Permanent Force of Australia is not the corps to supply the officers to lead our Australian Army in time of war. If is the Citizen Force officer who will have to lead our Army in time of war. The Permanent Force officers are merely the instructors of our Citizen Force officers, and the Military College is the school in which we train our instructional officers. </para>

                    <para>In the United States of America the Military College of West Point sets an example of a severe and thorough military training imposed by a Democratic Government, and I should advise that Australia can only expect to produce officers of the type required by the establishment of a Military College similar in ideals, if not altogether in practice - for that will vary with national characteristics - to West Point. </para>
                    <para>Hitherto it would have been difficult to find employment for the graduates of such a primary military educational establishment, but I have carefully examined this point, and find that, now it has been decided to create a National Force, there will be ample posts to be filled by the graduates of a Military College. </para>
                    <para>My recommendation is that a Staff Corps be formed to provide the officers for all these requirements, areas, districts, and head-quarter staffs, and permanent troops. </para>

                    <para>The proposed organization contemplates the formation of 215 areas, which are required to produce a fighting Force of 80,000 men. The officers in charge of each of these areas may be of the rank of captain or lieutenant.. In addition, twenty-two majors will be required - one to supervise every ten areas. The six district staffs require twenty-five officers, mostly of field rank; head-quarters will absorb twelve; the Military College, eight; and the Permanent Forces (on the present scale), forty-eight. </para>

I ask honorable senators to imagine the political pressure which would be put upon any Minister for Defence once the door was opened by enacting that any officer who has served with distinction in the Australian Imperial Force can come back to Australia and be appointed by the Minister to the Permanent Forces. I pity the Minister who has to withstand the pressure to make these appointments, because it is not as if there were only a few officers, as occurred after the South African war, who have come back with Distinguished Service Orders, Military Medals, and Military Crosses. Their number is becoming legion. I pity the Minister who will have to stand up and say, "Yes, I refuse to appoint Lieutenant-Colonel Jones. It is true that he won a Distinguished Service Order, has a Military Cross, and several other decorations, but I do not consider him fit to be appointed." </para>

                    <para>A great deal can be done to strengthen the practical side of training in Australia by levelling up the higher criticism brought to bear upon camp training. A non-commissioned officer is rarely capable of giving higher tactical instruction. He should confine himself mainly to teaching cadets and recruits. For the kind of work I am considering an officer - a highly educated one at that - a man whose views have been widened by travel and by manoeuvre working with the three arms combined, would be able to do a very great deal of good. The Duntroon graduate should, in due course, produce the very type, especially if he is encouraged to see something of the great outside military world. Such a man once appointed should be left free to devote himself mainly to the higher instruction of the militia officers and non-commissioned officers who must themselves be the instructors of their men. The strong point of the army is in its men - men. at the same time intelligent and biddable. The weak point of the army lies in the comparatively small number of its officers who are capable of giving good instruction. This will come in time - it is coming all the time - but there is the weakest spot of to-day. </para>

                        <para>- I look upon Lord Kitchener as the greatest army organizer the British Empire has yet produced. The safety of the Empire to-day is due to his organizing ability and the magic of his name. He it was who gave us the plan from which we are working. He it was who made the Military College the keystone of the arch, because it was to 'provide the men who were to instruct the officers to enable them to lead their troops in time of war. I appeal to the Committee not to rashly throw away that scheme, as they will do if they carry this amendment, for it is no small amendment, but a very important one in its effect. </para>

                    BOLTON (Victoria) [6.27]. - I would point out that the Minister, in his own amendment, proposes to appoint to the Permanent Forces certain officers. He does not seem to express much alarm about the danger to the Military College over the fact that certain ordnance, survey, and clerical branches should have officers appointed from the Permanent Military Forces. 1 know very well that criticism of this part of the Act or our universal training system is rank heresy. I know that it is considered so largely because the name of the late Lord Kitchener is associated with the system.- But let me tell honorable senators that Lord Kitchener was not the gentleman who initiated the scheme. It was initiated in quite another quarter - a rather ill-considered scheme at the time - and it was accepted and launched by the Government more as a political venture than as a military measure.

                        <para>.- I am of that opinion. Of course, the Government invited Lord Kitchener to come to Australia and put upon the scheme the hall-mark of the professional soldier, which he very obligingly did. But I contend that even Lord Kitchener, or any other man who travelled through Australia for a few days at the rate of 60 miles an hour, would not be in a position to form a sound opinion as to the temperament, or conditions, or the ideals of the Australian people. High professional opinions from men who do not know or understand the Australians is not always of the face value which some ' persons would take them to be. Take the later report of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ian</inline> Hamilton - a voluminous one it was - about the Australian Forces. If I recollect aright, he said, that the military value of three Australian soldiers was" somewhere about equal to that of one European soldiers I think that he has had reason to alter that opinion. </para>

A Minister with the courage and determination of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> could exercise the power of appointment and control in such a manner that only those who richly deserved it should have the promotion. Moreover, consider the importance of these men from the training point of view. The Minister has said that the citizen officers will lead the troops in time of war, but the permanent officers will train the officers in the Citizen Forces. What better instructors could you get for the Citizen Forces than the officers who have been through a dreadful war, and have gained high rank and distinction ? They ' are the best instructors whom it will be possible to get for the next ten years to train the Citizen Forces. </para>

                    O'LOGHLIN.That was really the purport of the Minister's remarks. I have the greatest admiration for the Cadets of the Military College, and all those who have had to do with them on active service know that they have made good in every possible way. I should never make one to interfere unduly with the existing enactment that officers appointed to our Permanent Forces must come from the Military College. To that extent I agree with that portion of Lord Kitchener's report quoted by the Minister, but the amendment deals only with very special cases. When that report was framed we were training our Forces under peace conditions.

                        <para>- We now have a number of men who have had three years and over of practical experience in the firing line. The Minister is unduly curtailing his own privileges in absolutely debarring those men from appointments to the Permanent Forces. No matter how specially qualified a man may be, even if he is a graduate of the University, and has higher educational qualifications than can be imparted at the Military College, or has specially distinguished himself at the Front, and shown his special fitness for leading men in the field the Minister is absolutely prohibited under the Defence Act as it stands from availing himself of his services' in the Permanent Forces. It is not fair to the Minister to debar him, through some red-tape provision in the Act, from using the services of the very best men available for training our Forces. However valuable academical qualifications may be, practical experience in the field, and special fitness to command, are more valuable still. Practically the only decisive success achieved in this war has been achieved by men who had no Military College training. I refer to General Botha and General Smuts, his able lieutenant in South Africa, who did, under perhaps favorable circumstances, what we have not been able to do in any other field of action during the war - annexed large tracts of the enemy's territory. The Minister and the Department should have the right, if special cases are brought under their notice, and special qualifications shown, to employ a returned soldier in the Permanent Forces. </para>

                </interjection><para>The question of patronage has been raised, but the Minister has been able to grapple very successfully with that for the last three years or more. Naturally there have been occasional complaints of political patronage and undue influence in regard to the appointment and promotion of officers, but, considering the number of men we have sent to the Front, they have been very few indeed. We have enrolled, graded, and placed in positions in Australia and at the Front from 360,000 to 370,000 men, and the Minister has been able to do all this without incurring any very great difficulties in the way of political patronage. Surely he is able, in the case of the very small number of Permanent Force appointments' to which this proposal will apply, notwithstanding the few extra difficulties that will be placed in his way by the opening of the gates to some extent, to allow returned soldiers in special cases to be appointed to permanent positions. A great deal of the Minister's argument was special pleading, and if he persists in his opposition to the amendment I trust the Committee will show it's good sense by carrying it. When we are endeavouring in every way to find employment for returned soldiers, it seems paradoxical to me that we should debar them from obtaining employment in the very line for which they are specially qualified. </para></speech>

                <para>That the following words be added to the clause : - " Provided also that warrant and noncommissioned officers of the Permanent Forces may be appointed to the commissioned rank for the positions of adjutant and quartermaster to units of the Australian Military Forces." </para>
                <para class="block">My object is to make some further provision for men who have well earned recognition for services rendered. A quartermaster has charge of the stores and equipment of a regiment, and requires special knowledge of routine, and of methods of caring for equipment, and keeping check of receipts and issues. The position is one which an active and intellectual non-commissioned officer is specially qualified to fill. The amendment would offer some outlet for men who have  rendered  many 'years' service in the Administrative and Instructional Staff of our Military Forces. The same argument applies to the position of adjutant. He is an officer capable of training noncommissioned officers in all the elementary work of their military duties. He has also a special knowledge of the routine administrative work of a unit.  That is particularly the class of work that an efficient warrant officer or noncommissioned officer of the Administrative and Instructional Staff is qualified to fill. I may claim to have had some experience in this direction, and am sure from my experience that if the Government are given power to appoint warrant and non-commissioned officers to these positions it will be very much to the advantage of the service in general and the Military Forces of Australia in particular. </para>

                    <para>.- If the words " adjutant and " be left out the amendment will be acceptable to the Government. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> knows, adjutants are part of the staff, and that post is one step in the graduation to the chief staff position, so that the amendment, in its original form, would be like supplying a fifth wheel to the coach, because an adjutant could go no further. In the Staff Corps a man commences as an Area Officer, and from that position he may advance to that of a brigade-major, or it may be an adjutant of a militia unit. There he would get experience of administration, and could go on to a position in the brigade, or the district staff, becoming eventually a commandant or a staff officer of division. If an adjutant is included in the proviso, as submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton,</inline> that officer could not go on to the other staff positions, and would come in between the flow of promotions from an Area Officer to the highest staff position. On the other hand, the training which a non-commissioned officer gets specially fits him for the duties of a quartermaster, but not for those of an adjutant, because the latter's duties are largely administrative, whereas the training a non-commissioned officer gets is largely instructional and in the care of stores.
