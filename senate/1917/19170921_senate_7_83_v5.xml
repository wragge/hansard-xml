                    <para class="block">I am submitting this motion as a general protest against the growing practice of legislation by regulation instead of by what we are accustomed to in a deliberative assembly - legislation by Parliament representing the will of the people. </para>
                    <para>This is one of many cases in which the War Precautions Act has been misused most unfairly. It has been misused in a way which was never dreamed of by those  who  originated the measure and those who passed it. We were told when it was under consideration that it was a measure to enable the Government to grapple with emergency cases arising out of the war. At that time, that is, in the early stages of the war, we naturally realized that things might happen which would detrimentally  affect  the conduct of the war, and render it necessary ford the Government to act without convening Parliament to grant additional powers. The regulation which I ask the Senate to disallow reads - </para>

                    <para>It does not need many words to bring home to honorable senators the seriousness of legislating in this manner by regulation. Here is an attack made upon our system of arbitration, a system which, provides a legal and legitimate way through the properly constituted Courts of the Commonwealth to decide questions of whether unions should be deregistered. But what has happened ?  When  some of these cases were actually under the consideration of the  Arbitration Judge, he found himself placed in a position that, no matter what his decision might be, even the Attorney-General could reverse it under legislation of this kind. </para>
                    <para>This, to my mind, is part and parcel of the arrangement - and I make the statement without fear - between the State Government, the &#91;Commonwealth Government, the Chambers of Manufacturers, the Chambers of Commerce, and employers generally to break up unionism. It is .a deliberately planned organized attack on the unions of this country. Not only has it been carefully planned and effectively carried out - and I admit that the parties may have obtained a passing advantage </para>

I know that they have not made any open attack upon wages ; they dare not do that.

                    <para>What excuse is there to use the War Precautions Act to deal with business which can be dealt with. well and effectively by the ordinary Courts of the Commonwealth and the States? Within the last few weeks we have had example after example of where the Judges presiding over the Commonwealth and State Courts have, after hearing the cases in the manner prescribed by law, deregistered unions. If that machinery is not effective owing to the conditions under which we are living, why should the Commonwealth Government rush in to pass legislation by regulation ? This Parliament is sitting, if an amendment of the Arbitration Act was needed, why was it not consulted, and asked to amend the Act by giving additional powers ? </para>

Their decisions are given day after day, in most cases in conformity with the arrangements made by the combination of the State Governments, the Commonwealth Government, and the organized employers of this country. </para>

They are to be deregistered before there is an appeal, and the Court constituted to hear the appeal is actually the Attorney-General himself. If he is not satisfied that the grounds of appeal are sufficient, nothing further can be done. There sits on that side supporting such a proposal <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> who gave the best years of his life to organizing and building up unions, and is now devoting his declining years to destroying all the good work of his earlier days. </para>

                            <para>- Under this regulation a registered union can be deregistered because of the acts of some of its members, acts that can be instigated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> himself or by the Government, acts that can be carefully thought out and planned to bring unions into a position in which they can be deregistered. Everybody knows that one of the chief reasons for the strike was the irritation of the pastoralists at) having to obey the recent award of the Arbitration Court. They have endeavoured to bring out the Australian Workers Union by irritating and annoying it by every means in their power, in the hope that it would break the award of the Court, so that they might escape the necessity of having to obey that award themselves. If. they can only get sufficient men to join a union to create a disturbance, that union can be deregistered and robbed of the arbitration award that it has worked for years to obtain. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> propose to give power to the Attorney-General, in his present frame  of mind, to do a thing like that? Is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid,</inline> who was at one time, I believe, a Labour member, going to do iti? </para>

                            <para>- I said in this chamber that the immediate cause was the card system, but that the trouble was really the old trouble of the organized employing class trying to impose degrading conditions on the employees. Let us consider this regulation apart altogether from the question of organized employers as against organized labour generally. The properly constituted Courts of the country are to have their powers taken from- them, or to see greater powers given to the Attorney-General and the Government. What would be said if we attempted to take from the business people of Australia their right of appeal to the Supreme Court and obtain the judgment of the best legal minds, and hand over all their civil rights to a partisan Government which they knew would vindictively attack them? That is what legislation of this kind does to the labouring class. If any honorable senator believes that the War Precautions Act should be used by the Government to override our civil Courts and our civil liberties, when the persons with whom they are dealing are in no way interfering with the conduct of the war, he is agreeing to the use of that Act in a manner which was never intended. </para>

I have no desire to traverse the ruling of the  President,  but I appeal to men who at one time represented Labour to say whether they think an organization should be deregistered at the will of a Government merely because some of its members have acted contrary to the award under which it was working.

This is not a question of whole unions defying the Arbitration Act. Take an organization like the Australian &#34;Workers Union, which has some 50,000 or 60,000 members. Under this regulation, if a section of that union be driven to strike, the whole of the award which it had only obtained after years of fighting, and which was perhaps being loyally observed by 999 of every 1,000 of its members, would be severely punished. . </para>

                        <para>. - Those who have listened to the honorable senator and who recognise the circumstances under which he spoke, will make every allowance for him. He and many of his associates occupy a very peculiar and difficult position, and naturally they are looking for a way out of it. Therefore I make every allowance for the frantic efforts which are now being made by them to escape, just as one can understand and sympathize with the dying struggles of a drowning man who attempts to catch at a straw. The position of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is that he and others who are associated with him have led a large body of those who look to them for leadership into an absolutely impossible position. They have led them to take up an attitude of defiance of constituted authority, they have fanned the flames of this strike, and now that the men recognise that there is coming upon them the unfortunate consequences of their own action- </para>

                            <para>- Let me put it in this way. The men who should have led the strike, and who, if they had any intelligence, must have seen that the strikers were taking a wrong course, which could only bring about disaster, never raised a voice of warning to tell the strikers what they were doing. On the other hand, we know that, even in this chamber, they &#39;have encouraged them to continue the unfortunate struggle in which they engaged. Only a few days ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> declared here that the men were absolutely solid, that he had never seen men so solid on a question before, and then he expressed the hope that they would continue in the course they were pursuing until they secured that for which they were fighting: Those were words of encouragement to the men; and now, when the strikers see that they were misled, and there is a tendency on their part to call to account the men who misled them, and when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> finds that he is likely to be called to account, and that his claims to leadership are threatened and undermined because of the false position in which he placed those who followed his advice, we have him making an appeal to class prejudice and passion in order still to induce his deluded followers into the belief that he, and he alone, can save them. </para>

                            <para>- It does, absolutely. I say that in time of war there can only be one consideration for the country, and that is the national safety. Men who, in the time of war, think we can afford to be guided by the niceties of rules which we might be expected to observe in times of peace, ignore the teachings of history. They are unintelligent and innocent of common sense, or they wilfully mislead those who are foolish enough to believe in them. </para>

                            <para>- In time of war, even despotism may be necessary. For too long the Empire to which we belong conducted the war with kid gloves on, and we are paying the penalty for it today. I remind honorable senators that the responsibility upon a Government in time of peace is intensified a hundredfold when the nation is fighting for its existence. In my judgment, the first responsibility upon the Government to-day is to see that nothing is done in this country which will paralyze its energies and activities in making the best contribution it can to the prosecution of the war. One of the first things that it- is necessary for us to do is to keep the wheels of industry moving. It is impossible for the nation to carry on the war if it refuses to find food for its soldiers and have it transported across the water for their sustenance. It would be impossible for us to continue to carry on the war for twenty-four hours if we ceased to produce the material things necessary for its prosecution and the maintenance of the nation. </para>

                            <para>- It has a most important bearing upon it. If all industries ceased in Australia, could we continue to carry on the war? Is there no relation between the needs of our troops at the Front requiring food and wool and the action of men here who say deliberately, that they will not load those goods on to the transports? I need not labour the point. No one who considers the position to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has referred to-day can venture publicly to deny that the relation between the strike and the war is indeed of a most intimate character. </para>

                            <para>- I was one of those who wanted to commandeer the men. The War Precautions Act was passed to meet emergencies arising out of the war, and I say that an emergency arose in this case. The statement that the Law Courts were competent to deal with the cases covered by the regulation to which exception is taken is absolutely incorrect. The only cases which the Arbitration Court dealt with, and with which it was invited to deal, were those which occurred immediately the strike took place. The Executive did not interpose in any way in those cases between the Court and the men where a breach of the law had taken place. It was not until the industrial crisis had &#39;continued for four weeks, and unions were coming out one after the other, and those who were leading them were doing their level best to bring still more into the strike, and throw further industries idle, that the Government issued a proclamation, which they did not make retrospective, but in which they said that if in future any more unions struck they would withdraw from them the registration which they had under the law. </para>

                    <para>Let me say why I justify the action taken by the Government in this matter, apart&#39; from the method adopted. What is the registration of a union but a privilege secured to it by law ? Those who rely upon registration claim that they are entitled to it because the law gives it to them, but they must remember that they cannot have the privileges of the law without its responsibilities also. When honorable senators say that the action taken by the Government is an interference with the law, to what law are they referring ? Is it not to the law which the unions have broken and destroyed ? It is an absurdity for men who are willing to trample underfoot one portion of the law, and to bring the whole of the industries of the country to ruin in violation of the law, to immediately turn round and claim not only its benefits and privileges, but that for violations of it they shall be proceeded against by the ordinary slow processes of the law, at a time like the present. The only men who can appeal to the law in this case are those who are prepared to abide by the law. </para>

I remind the honorable senator that the Courts in his own State showed that certain unions had lost their right to registration because they were law breakers. It was proved that they were law breakers, and I ask whether in a time of war we are to stand by and see our industries brought to a standstill, and our efforts to prosecute the war paralyzed at the instance of those who have been proved to be law breakers by the decisions of the Courts, to which&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> referred.

We know that it arose, not because of any efforts on the part of the employers, whether private or Government, to introduce iniquitous conditions, to harass men, tyrannize over them, or sweat them. We know that the strike had its roots in matters that extended back to the 28th October of last year, and which were emphasized on the 5th May of this year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie made a most useful contribution  to our debates when he placed certain resolutions before the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- If they were the men who engineered it, let them fit on the cap. I am not concerned about any particular body. The statement I make is that the strike was engineered by those who desired to deliberately challenge the Government of the country. The Government could not stand idly by when it was vested with certain powers, given to it by Parliament. The action taken was not that of a despot, because it was Parliament that gave the Government their authority under the War Precautions Act. When the Government were faced with circumstances requiring action to be taken, they would have been remiss in their duty if they had failed to do what they have done on this occasion. The only reason for regret is that the action taken by the Government was not adopted a little earlier in the strike. The regulation was not issued as a punishment for what the unions had done up to that time, but as a warning to unionists as to the position in which they would stand if they gave heed to those who were seeking to wreck this country by tying up its industries. </para>

                        has said that this regulation was issued in order to punish the law breakers. If that is so, it should be applied all round, and to all those pastoralists, graziers, and employers who are seeking to form one big union to fight against the arbitration laws of this country. Apparently, they can do as they like; but if the unfortunate workers use the only implement at their disposal, they are deemed to be law breakers. Listen to this -

I am not attempting to justify anything that has taken place, but I do condemn the Government for having issued regulations of this sort to punish only one section of the people. On the opposite side of the Chamber, there are men who have been our political opponents all their lives, and&#39; we are proud to know them as our life-long opponents, but regret the enmity and spleen that pours from many of those who a few weeks ago were our political friends, but are now behind the Government. </para>

                        has said this is a political upheaval. If he is correct, he must be in the &#34; swim,&#34; and the political move must have been on the side of the employers of Australia. I maintain that this trouble was caused by the action of the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales in forcing upon the men conditions which they&#39; will never accept. There waa in existence an agreement as sacred as the marriage bond, not to interfere with the relations between employer and employee during this war; but the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales deliberately broke that agreement, and caused this industrial upheaval. Volunteer strike-breakers are now being secured ; but we had news only yesterday that a vessel loaded at Williamstown by these strike-breakers has been destroyed by an infernal machine which had been placed in No. 1 hold. If that vessel had been loaded by union labour, there would have been leading articles in&#39; every journal of this country condemning the unions, and placing responsibility upon those bodies.

                    <para>I object to the regulation issued by the Government, and I contrast their attitude with the course adopted by the Governments of Great Britain and the United States of America. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George went to the Welsh miners, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law interviewed the boilermakers and engineers on the Clyde in order to settle industrial disturbances in the, Old Country. They held out the hand of friendship to unionists, and by their actions averted serious trouble in Great Britain. In the United States of America, also, during an industrial crisis, the Government sent for the Labour leader - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gompers</inline> - and secured his intervention to prevent any trouble during war time. The Commonwealth Government, instead of holding out the hand of friendship to the working  men of this country - the men who are fighting our battles - issued a regulation penalizing them for any action that has been taken, for by the workers has every battle been fought, and by them has every battle been won, and always they have been rewarded by returning again to toil and amass money for the money lords who meet in secret conclave and shackle them hand and foot by fixing the price of foodstuffs and raiment. </para>

Indeed, if he were to perform in any other manner, members on this side of the Senate would be very much surprised. He tried to insult every member on&#39; the Ministerial side, and his whole attitude seemed to be due to his intense hatred of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> the Prime Minister. It is just as well, therefore, that we should review the position, and see where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> stands in the opinion of those who know him best. </para>

No other man has done so much for the Labour movement in the same number of years as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> The Prime Minister was invariably called upon to interpose when unionists revolted against the Arbitration Act, and although it was always a very distasteful duty to approach the men during such times, no other member of the party was ever asked to do it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> often had to travel a rough road to get the Labour movement back to a sane and sensible position.  His  ability and courage were always recognised, so that when the leadership of the party became vacant, he was regarded as the only man fit for the position. </para>

                    <para>Years ago, the Labour party, after a prolonged agitation, secured the enactment of an arbitration law, not only in the Commonwealth, but in the States. It took years of agitation to arrive at that stage. The opponents of arbitration in those times were undoubtedly the Employers Federation, and its champions were the Labour party; but all the opposition which was ever offered to the principle by the Employers Federation has never done it so much harm as has the action of the so-called friends of arbitration. And now, having landed themselves in a pickle, &#39;they turn round to the one man whom they never cease to abuse when an opportunity presents itself, and ask him to get them out of their difficulties. Time and again since this strike began we have had very good indications of the  truth of what I am saying. Time and again delegates from the Trades Hall and elsewhere have been only too anxious to induce <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to get them out of their troubles. </para>

                    <para>Some remarks have been made about the attitude of the British Labour party in this connexion. When I was in Great Britain last year I was surprised to find that in the land which has been often referred to as the classical land of trade unionism they had practically suspended every rule, regulation, and principle in connexion with trade unionism, so that the war might be continued in the most successful way possible. That attitude was taken up in the Old Country by the Labour party, with two exceptions, and only very recently I read in a Labour newspaper here an article in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> was criticised for not having sufficient backbone, and the writer was wishing for a Snowden or a Macdonald to lead Labour at the present time. &#34; Oh, for a Ramsay Macdonald or a Philip Snowden to lead our Labour party in Australia&#39;s Federal Parliament!&#34; This indicates the fate awaiting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor.</inline> With these two exceptions, the Labour party in the Old Land are united in the strongest possible way, backing up the Government to do everything in their power to bring the war to a successful end. The ordinary principles of trade unionism - the practices which had been in vogue for generations - were suspended so that the maximum quantity of guns and munitions could be produced. Here was an example of loyalty and solidarity which it was undoubtedly refreshing to, see exhibited. Still, it has been stated here that a tyranny is being practised against trade unionism in Australia which the unions in the Old Land know nothing of. </para>

It is time that the country decided whether it is to have the strike system or the arbitration system. It is very unfair to those who advocated the principle of arbitration in bygone years, and helped so materially to secure its enactment on the statute-book, that certain men to-day should be killing the principle. </para>

                    <para>This statutory regulation is, I consider, one of the most monstrous proposals which have ever emanated from a body calling itself a Democratic Government, and trying to guide the destinies of a Democratic country. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> very pertinently interjected, &#34; This is not law, but despotism.&#34; If this action of the Government was going to be so comprehensive as to embrace all so-called law breakers, perhaps one&#39;s opposition to the monstrous proposal would be weakened. But we are told in the regulation that there is only one section of the community included in the category of law breakers, and that section is tha workers of Australia. They are dubbed disloyal because they have dared to stand up against an attempt to. introduce&#39; one of the worst systems of sweating which the world has even known - a system which was turned down by even America, one of the greatest speeding-up countries of the world, and one which would not be allowed to be introduced into Great Britain. &#34;Who was the originator of this trouble? We have been told from the Ministerial bench to-day that it is a political struggle, that it is a re-echo of the 28th October, and, as a result, of the verdict of the 5th May. Nothing is farther from the truth. The men who stand condemned to-day as the instigators of this industrial trouble are the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> just said, they broke the bond. . Talk about Germany and a scrap of paper! Here was an honorable agreement between the Railways Commissioners of New South, Wales and their employees, that no new conditions of employment would be introduced during the time of war. But the Commissioners broke the agreement and threw down the gauntlet to the men. The latter would not have been men worthy of a free Democratic country if they had not stood up to the Commissioners. </para>
                    <para>What has been the result? We are told by this statutory regulation that if trade unions do certain things they will be deregistered. The Government knows that there is in existence a judicial tribunal which could have done all this work. But consider the remarkable position which the Government have taken up ! It has put one man in the position of being an absolute dictator. So strongly did the  President  of the Arbitration Court feel on this matter that he had to protest from his seat on the Bench against the action of the Executive Council in taking to itself certain powers which it could exercise under the War Precautions Act, and, at the same time, coming to him as the  President  of the Arbitration Court and asking him to do something which it could do under the regulation. He pointed out that if he refused to do what was asked, after all judicial thought and care had been given to the application, then the Government could do the thing itself. Is there any other part of the civilized world, be it in time of war or in time of peace, which would take up such an attitude as that? </para>

                        Largie has said that we are attacking the Prime Minister, and that during this unfortunate, strike the leaders of trade unions have approached the Prime Minister. It is true that they approached the Prime Minister. To whom could those leaders apply but to the head of the Government? They did not go to him because he was William Morris Hughes, but because he was the Prime Minister and Attorney-General of Australia. And, in that regard,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                        wants to justify paragraph 2 of the regulation where it provides that in every case the Attorney-General has to determine whether or not an appeal in the case shall be allowed. There is no similarity between the two things. I think it is right for men to approach the Prime Minister  with the view to getting a matter settled; but it is quite a different thing when that gentleman, as Attorney-General,  deregisters  an organization, or a section of it, and then is called upon as a judge to determine his own action. It is absolutely a prostitution of all forms of Democratic government.

                    <para>All the time I have been in public life, I have been an ardent supporter of arbitration. I am that to-day. The greatest offenders against the arbitration law all these years have been the employers, and even to-day they are amalgamating with a view to flout the decisions of the Court. Yet there is nothing about the employing class in the regulation. They can do whatever they like, because, in the present Cabinet, there is a majority ot men who were put here by the employers. There are five men in the Cabinet who would never have  seen  Cabinet rank, and never have been in any parliamentary hall if it had not been for the workers whom to-day they are endeavouring to crush. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and the rest of them can make all the protestations they like; they are practically bought, politically, body and soul. The Cabinet contains a majority of six men who, all along the line, have endeavoured to damn the workers of Australia industrially and politically. Now they have the power, and the five other men, who hitherto have been Labour&#39;s champions, are helpless in the lion&#39;s mouth. I oppose the regulation. It is unjust, monstrous, and a prostitution of all Democratic law. </para>

                        <para>. - The regulation contains no power for the deregistration of organizations of employers, although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> seems to think that the same power exists to deregister associations of employers as of employees. If it is considered necessary to pass a regulation of this kind, which means Government by regulation, and not by this Parliament, sweeping aside the laws passed by this Parliament, it should surely not be one-sided. Is it not fair to apply it to both sides? </para>

                            <para>- He shut it up for the time being to flout the award of the Court. I do not defend the breaking of awards by either side; but let us be fair. Do not let all the condemnation come from one side of the Senate, and fall only upon one party to the disputes. This is a case, typical of many, in which the awards of the Court have been broken by the employing side all over Australia. It is a flagrant instance, which stands out from all the rest, of an award being openly flouted. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hutton,</inline> of course, carried on his business soon after; probably he got some cheaper kind of labour. I can give another instance to show how the employers are always trying to dodge the award of the Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Guy,</inline> M.H.A., of Tasmania, has given me these facts. The Waterside Workers in Launceston did not go on strike. This regulation, by the way, applies to men who did not go on strike, which shows the injustice of it. These men never refused work as a union, although one or two individuals might, at some time or other, have done so in the recent industrial upheaval. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morris,</inline> the central secretary, sent word instructing them to remain at work, and the men continued to work. They were waiting to be employed at the usual place, the shelter shed. Holyman and Company, for whom J. B. Ellerker, the great strike breaker, is the representative here, showed that they deliberately wanted to smash the union if they could. Instead of going to the usual place for picking up wharf labourers, although they knew that the men would be there, because they had received a letter from the secretary of the Waterside Workers Branch there informing them that the men were prepared to continue in their employment, they employed free or voluntary labour. The object, of course, was to smash the union. In all previous cases, when they required labour, they sent to the secretary of the branch, and the men were always engaged. This time the secretary, thinking there might be trouble, wrote to tell them that the men were there ready to be employed. The men had never struck, but not only did these people not employ them, but they deliberately refused to employ them, thereby showing that they were only too pleased to do their part in smashing the union. Holyman and Company, who own a. small line of freight steamers trading between Launceston and the mainland, had been in the habit of writing to the secretary of the union if they wanted men, but, on this occasion, they did not do anything of the kind. </para>

                    <para>It has been said here many times that the beginning of the whole dispute was the coming out of the railway men in New South Wales, because they were opposed, not only to the Taylor card system, but to any proper system which would give the value of their work to their employers, the people of New South Wales. That is supposed to be the genesis of the whole of the industrial trouble that has been causing so much disaster to Australia, and it has been said repeatedly both here and in another place, in the New South Wales Parliament, and in the press, that the men came out because they did not want to do a fair day&#39;s work, and objected to any system which would show whether they were doing it or not. As that is said to be the reason for the beginning of this great industrial trouble, which in turn is the reason for the gazettal of the regulation now before us, I trust I shall not be out of order in putting briefly before the Senate an extract from the report of a Commission sent by the South Australian Government a few months ago to Sydney to inquire into the system of working in the New South Wales railway workshops. </para>

We would be glad if you would, for our benefit and the benefit of our own State, tell us where you look for those leakages; leakages which mean uneconomy, loss of time, loss of value through spoilt material? </para>

                        <para>So far as concerns the leakage from slow working, loss of time of any description, we discover by keeping a good system of accounts where the leakage occurs. We compare one leading hand, or chargeman, and a gang of fifteen or twenty, with another gang of the same number doing precisely the same work under similar conditions, and hold the leading hand, or chargeman, responsible for the output. In that way we are able to discover eventually the individuals to whom this lack of effort can be applied, and we deal with them. </para>

                        <para>With regard to the wastage or loss of materials, we have a system of watchmen and a system of detectives; also, by means of assays of castings made in the brass foundry and various other castings which contain such valuable metals as tin and copper, and less valuable metals, such as spelter and lead, we determine, by the amount of assay, the total castings coming out which contain such-and-such a proportion of tin, and we say, &#34; Where is the tin consumed during the month gone to ?&#34; &#34;What is the percentage of waste or losses!&#34; In that way we can check any leakage. </para>
                        <para>What is the result of all this care? Do you really check wastage and reduce to a percentage basis the loss on what you think you ought to achieve from all your work and that which you get? - Yes. </para>

                            <para>- They should not be provoked by interjections from either side. Innuendoes prove nothing. This matter should be studied from both sides. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> would be a much better man if he viewed it from the other side. I know that industries which have been fighting for their very existence have recently been paralyzed as the result of the strike in New South Wales. We cannot develop Australia as we ought to develop it if we are going to be confronted with interminable disputes under the most flimsy of pretexts. It is the duty of the Government to uphold law and order during the continuance of this war. </para>

                    <para>It will not be necessary for me to unduly trespass upon the time of honorable senators in submitting this motion. Whatever may be thought of the principles of the Bill, it is a fairly simple one. One of its purposes is to continue for the current year the existing income tax, which, as honorable senators will recollect, requires, in accordance with the present Act, to be renewed annually. A new tax is imposed by clause 6 of the Bill on bachelors and widowers without children, over the age of twenty-one, and a tax is also imposed in respect of cash prizes in lotteries. The rate of the tax payable by bachelors and widowers without children is &#163;5, or 5 per cent. of the taxable income, whichever is the greater. The rate of the tax to be imposed in respect of cash prizes in lotteries is 10 per cent. of the gross prize money. In cases of hardship the tax on bachelors and widowers without children may be reduced at the discretion of the Commissioner. The following persons are to be exempt from the tax: - Members or ex-members of the fighting Forces, a person the majority of whose brothers of military age have been or are members of the fighting Forces, persons permanently incapacitated for work, or persons in receipt of an invalid or old-age pension. In estimating the taxable income under clause 6, provision is made for an allowance of &#163;26 in respect of each person wholly dependent upon the taxpayer, and of such less sum, in respect of each person partially dependent upon him, as the Commissioner may allow. These are the provisions of the Bill, and I do not think that it is necessary at this juncture that I should add anything to the remarks I have made. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators will no doubt have  a  recollection of a Bill that was. recently passed through this Chamber, known  as  the War-time Profits . Tax Assessment Bill. It was limited entirely to machinery provisions for the collection of a tax, but it did not impose the tax. The tax will be imposed by the Bill now under consideration. This is in accordance with the precedent followed in connexion with taxation measures by presenting them in two Bills - one providing the machinery for assessment, and the other imposing and determining the rate of the tax. This Bill provides that the rate of the war-time profits tax shall be 50 per cent. on the excess profits in the year 1915-1916, and 75 per cent. on the excess profits of the years following  -  1916-17. As honorable senators, in dealing with the other Bill to which I have referred, had in mind the rates of the taxation imposed in this Bill, I have no doubt that there will be little difficulty about its progress to completion. </para>

I anticipate that we can complete the consideration of the Income Tax Bill on Tuesday, though we may have to sit a little late, and that by meeting on Wednesday morning it will be possible for us to complete the remaining business in time to permit us to close on Wednesday afternoon. </para>

                    <para>. - I take advantage of this motion to again refer to a matter that was mentioned this morning, and that is the refusal of the Government to permit the Queensland Government to act as an agent for the export of tungsten metals from Australia. According to the arrangement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> with Dalgety and Company, that firm has a complete monopoly of the agency for the export of tungsten metals. This is operating detrimentally to the production of those rare metals. It is well known that prior to the war Queensland produced quite one-half of the world&#39;s output of molybdenite. It is also known that wolfram and scheelite are largely produced in Northern Queensland. Just prior to the outbreak of the war, the prices of these metals began to rise very perceptibly ^ doubtless owing to the fact that German purchasers were &#34; on the job.&#34; Prior to this, Germany had been acquiring most of these metals from various sources. In 1915 the price of molybdenite of 90 per cent, purity, which is equal to about 54 per cent, of pure metal, soared up as high as &#163;615 per ton. The price fixed in Australia is &#163;525 per ton. Tungsten metals are indispensable in the manufacture of munitions of war. They are used to toughen and harden steel. The magnetos of explosive shells, aerial and submarine torpedoes, and aeroplanes all require the use of these metals. This was brought home to the Allies . very noticeably in the first eighteen months of the war, owing to what might be termed the slow action of Russia, and the comparative inactivity of Italy and Roumania after they had thought fit by declaration to enter the war. </para>

                <para>Under the agreement with Dalgety and Company, their charges per ton exported amount ito abou* &#163;4 8s. North Queensland miners maintain that this is altogether too high&#39;. As well as the general agency, Dalgety and Company obtain as local agents an allowance of &#163;2&#39; per ton on these metals exported. They are further collectors on their own behalf, and when they collect these metals consigned to themselves for export, Dalgety and Company are given the right to pay to Dalgety and Company a commission of 1&#163; per cent, on the metals consigned to them. When this metal is exported Dalgety and Company pay Dalgety and Company another li per cent, export commission, making a total commission of 2-J per cent., in addition to the local agents&#39; allowance of &#163;2 per ton. Between 8th September, 1915, and the 30th June, 1916, according to a statement laid on the table of the Senate on the 13th February last, Dalgety and Company had acquired for export, on behalf pf the Commonwealth, a total of 843 tons of these metals. Up to the 30th June, 581 tons had been disposed of on which Dalgety and Company&#39;s commission amounted to &#163;2,558. When the whole of 843 tons would have been dealt with, their- commission would reach &#163;3,678. This matter has been before the Prime Minister on several occasions, on behalf of the Irvinebank Tin Mining Company of Queensland, and the Thermo Electric Ore Reduction Company of Great Britain. I am not advocating that the export agency for these metals should he given to any individual firm outside of Dalgety and Company, because I recognise it is essential that great security is required in the matter of supervision, to see that the metals do not reach enemy countries, as we know only too well was the case when the ores went through Mertons and other firms with English-sounding names. </para>
                <para>As a result of negotiations through the Queensland Agent-General, an arrangement was arrived at whereby the British Ministry for Munitions agreed to allow the Queensland Government to act as supervising agent for the export of these metals. Seeing that this overcame the objections by the Irvinebank Tin Mining Company, the Federal Government should have allowed the Queensland Government to do this work for the North Queensland miners, especially as the State Government were prepared to act free of charge. Under the present arrangement, it costs &#163;31 19s. 2d. per ton in commission, realization, and other charges, to export wolfram from Australia. </para>

Brown, who represents the Thermo-Electric Ore Reduction Company, stating that the production at the &#39;&#39;Irvinebank Tin Mines, in Northern Queensland, during the two years prior to the war, totalled 600 tons of wolfram, but that for the two years after the war started the production was only 100 tons. This decline was not due to any depletion in the ore reserves, or on account of any industrial disturbance of magnitude, but purely because there was not sufficient inducement to maintain the previous rate of production. </para>

                        <para>- Dalgety&#39;s charges for export, as I have shown, amount to &#163;31 19s. 2d. per ton, whereas in New Zealand the cost is only &#163;16 10s. 5d. In the case of the Commonwealth, the extra charge is due to the fact that Dalgety and Company are the sole agents, and centralize everything in Sydney, or from whatever port they operate, with the result that charges have to be met for cartage, storage accommodation, resampling, re-assaying, and  rebagging.  These costs could be reduced  if  the Queensland Government were permitted to act as agents, because they have an assay office at Mareeba, and they could easily arrange for storage accommodation there. </para>

                <para>I fail to see any objection to the request made by the Queensland Government. When the Prime Minister initiated the policy of operating wholly through one source for the export of these tungsten metals, it was contended that a smashing blow had been delivered at German influence. Perhaps that was so, and perhaps the policy would have been wise if the production of metals had been encouraged. At a conference of the Ministers of Mines for the various States and the  Prime Minister, held in Sydney in February, 1917, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones,</inline> Queensland Minister of Mines, put before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> this proposal that the Queensland Government should be allowed to act as an export agency. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> promised to give the matter consideration, but Dalgety and Company are continuing to act as &#39; sole agents because the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> has informed me that no permission had yet been granted to the Queensland Government to undertake this agency work. I do not intend to enter upon a tirade against Dalgety and Company, or any other business house. They are a reputable firm carrying put commercially a commission intrusted to them by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Commonwealth Government; but the policy is not in the best interests of the producers of these metals in Northern Queensland. Shortly after the Sydney conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins,</inline> in a report tabled in the Senate, attempted to justify the policy of the Government, but I think that those who have perused his report, will come to the conclusion that even he found grave cause for complaint. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins&#39;</inline> report was accompanied by a statement from H. H. Ling,- of the Commonwealth Audit Department, who stated - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>It was found that a fixed price of 12s. 6d. per parcel was being made by Dalgetys for assaying, &#38;c, small parcels up to f 50 in value. In these cases, therefore, assuming the producer was paid at schedule rates for his minerals, he is not only bearing the cost of assaying at the schedule rates, but also an addition of 12s. 6d. per parcel. The company would appear to justify this extra charge on  the ground that the schedule rate for assaying is not sufficient to cover the cost in the case of small parcels. Even if this be true as a matter of equity, it should form a debit to the handling charges, and not to the producer, as the Commonwealth retains any profit arising from the excess of the schedule charges over the actual disbursements. If the Commonwealth appropriates the credit in one case, it is only equitable that it should shoulder the liability in the other case should it arise.

                <para>Dalgety and Company have since foregone that special charge of 12s. 6d. for assaying small .parcels; their action, I presume, being the result of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ling&#39;s</inline> observations with regard to the matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ling&#39;s</inline> report continues - </para>

                    <para>In connexion with the minerals purchased at Wolfram Camp) it has been found that the schedule charge of &#163;2 15s. per ton for cartage to rail is &#163;1 in excess of the actual disbursements; therefore, to protect the producer the Commonwealth&#39;s agents have purchased from Wolfram Camp, * at Cairns, f .o.b. prices. Although this is  a  departure from the agreement, it is a fair solution of the difficulty, and achieves one of the objects of the agreement, viz., to protect the primary producer. </para>
                    <para>Paragraph B, clause 5, page 4, of the agreement would appear to be in conflict with the Schedule in the matter of local agents&#39; allowance and collecting agency . commission. According to the conditions contained in the paragraph quoted, it would- appear that collecting agency commission was only to be allowed where local agents&#39; allowance had not been paid, and yet both charges are provided for in the schedules. The Government agents have followed the schedules, and allowed both charges. I shall be glad of an official interpretation of this section of the agreement. </para>

                <para>The Irvinebank Tin Mining Company are prepared, of course, to export their metals through their own agency to their representatives in London, but I am not advocating their case to-day. I am urging that the Queensland Government should be allowed to act as agents for the export of these metals direct to the British Ministry for Munitions. They are prepared to consign metals to any port indicated by the Federal Government or by the British Minister for Munitions. </para>

                    <para>The figures of the cost are astonishing and absolutely unnecessary. They could be brought _ down to half if the mines were allowed to ship direct from Queensland to the Government brokers in London, as is done in the case of Indian mines or in any other part of the world except Australia. Therefore, I would very strongly urge the Queensland Government to get permission to ship ore direct to the brokers of the Ministry of Munitions in London. There is no doubt you would get the support of the Ministry for Munitions in this matter, and it would mean a great deal to us in securing capital to develop properties in Queensland. </para>

                <para>That seems a fair proposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins,</inline> in his report, says that generally the agreement is working satisfactorily and successfully, but I venture to say that not one miner operating these metals in North -Queensland will indorse his statement. The producers of these rare metals in North Queensland are not&#39; satisfied with the present agreement. There is great discontent about what they consider the harshness of its operation. While I realize that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> possessed of ability, may be able to handle a  great  many matters, political, industrial, and otherwise, I submit that it is too much to expect from any man that he can have a full grasp of every business which the right honorable gentleman has undertaken, such as the marketing of wool, metals, sugar and wheat, in addition to all the other national and industrial problems on which he has been engaged during the past two years. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has not a grasp of the metal situation. He made a mistake, either under a misdirection or under wrong advice, and he is not to blame in that regard. But he is to blame for allowing  a  continuation of this unfair treatment to the tungsten producers of the Commonwealth, particularly in North Queensland, since the mistake was pointed out to him at the Conference of State Ministers for Mines, and since the Queensland Department of Mines or its Government undertook to act as agent, free of charge, to the producers of these rare metals, which are so indispensable at present. </para>
                <para>Only yesterday we were told what  a  great factor would have been the comparatively small quantity of glycerine that would have been obtained from the manufacturers of American fancy soaps which represent Australia&#39;s portion of the exportations from that country. The non-speeding up of the production of these rare metals overshadows that matter by a thousandfold. We realise the scope there is in Northern Queensland for an extension of their production. It is a conservative estimate to say that there are 20,000 square miles of country there carrying these metals. We maintain that if the Queensland Government were encouraged, as it should be encouraged, to further produce these metals, it would be of immense use to the Allies and to Australia. </para>
                <para>There is a further unfair aspect about the monopoly agency which has been granted to Dalgety and Company. It is that while the company has the sole agency for the export of these metals - a very vital factor, it will be admitted - it will have all that inside knowledge which the Defence Department or the Attorney-General&#39;s Department had in the past. The company must become possessed of confidential information: - to an extent confidential - by virtue of the directions it receives, regarding the destination of the metals to be sent away. Its commercial connexions in this respect will be so important, and so widely embracing, that not only will it have a monopoly during the currency of the war under this agreement, but it  Will  have become so firmly established by virtue of the knowledge gained through its present monopolistic powers that when peace is declared no other firm in the Commonwealth will be able to have a look in with that company regarding the placing and disposal of these metals. </para>
                <para>It is &#39;unfair to other firms that this arrangement should be confined wholly to  Dalgety and Company. It was well from the aspect of safety and security that such stringent precautions should be taken in  the early stages of the war. But when a responsible Government - not a private firm, not an offshoot of what might be another Merton, not a firm which would be likely to send the metals to enemy countries,  but the responsible Government of an important State in the Commonwealth - undertakes to supervise, transmit, and export the metals under the direction of the Commonwealth, to co-operate with the Commonwealth, and to take any directions outside the Commonwealth from the Imperial Ministry for Munitions only, we want something better than the pronouncement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins,</inline> that the agreement generally has worked pretty well. &#34;We want explained away the discrepancy between the charges operating in Australia and the charges operating in New Zealand, just about double. From Australia it costs &#163;63 15s. per ton to export molybdenite and &#163;31 19 s. 2d. per ton to export wolfram, whereas from New Zealand the cost is &#163;16 10s. 5d. per ton. The saving to the producer, were the charges the same here as in New Zealand., would be about &#163;12 10s. per ton in the case of wolfram and about &#163;i25 per ton in the case of molybdenite. </para>

                <para>This matter was brought under my notice very early last year. It is true that Tasmania does not produce wolfram and molybdenite in such quantities as do the districts in Northern Queensland. But, nevertheless, &#39; we do produce in Tasmania considerable quantities of tungsten ores. In fact, one company - the Shepparton and Murphy Company, which produces tin and wolfram - has declared substantial dividends for some years past. In the Ben Lomond district, several mines have been operating in connexion with the production of wolfram under very great difficulties for many years. I am sorry to say that these companies will be affected very adversely by recent legislation. But that is by the way. </para>
                <para>The trouble in 1916 seemed to be that, notwithstanding that the owners of these mines had been in the habit of disposing of their tungsten ores to British firms by the operation of the arrangement referred to Ky <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> they were precluded from selling their ores through the channels which had previously been available to them. One of the proprietors of the wolfram mines in the vicinity of Ben Lomond, in Tasmania, is a very old friend of mine. He is a Scotsman, and has developed his mine in circumstances of very great difficulty. He has been in the habit of selling hie ores to a firm known as Fox and Company ,  of Birmingham, in England - a firm on the War Office list. It is an approved firm, and British in every way. I understand. The papers which my friend sent to me, and which I submitted to the Honorable Hugh Mahon, when he was representing the Prime Minister in his capacity of Attorney-General, proved beyond doubt that this firm could not give quotations for the ores which my friend was producing, and which had previously been shipped to Fox and Company. And the fact, so my friend believes, and as the papers seemed to disclose, was that through having to dispose of his ores through the present channel, which was mandatory, he secured, a price several pounds a ton less than that which would have been available to him had he been able to dispose of the ores directly to Fox and Company. </para>
                <para>From time to time. I have heard complaints in regard to this agreement. If the charges are what they should not be, and if satisfactory channels are available through which the ores can be disposed of to the Imperial authorities - disposed of at a cost less than that which is incurred at present  -  I think that the Administra- &#39; tion might very seriously take into consideration a variation of the means of disposal. </para>

                        <para>- It is all a question of shipping being available, because ships leaving Australia would be only too ready to take as part of their freight ores so necessary to carry on the war as wolfram. Early List year representations were made to me that the present arrangement imposed on the producers of wolfram in Tasmania the necessity of disposing of their ores at a figure which left them several pounds per ton poorer than if they had been permitted to avail themselves of the channels through which they had hitherto disposed of them. In any case the ores went to the British Government, and there was&#39; no imputation on the Birmingham. firm of being in any way un-british in character. </para>
