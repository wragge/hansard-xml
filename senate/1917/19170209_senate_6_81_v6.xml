                <para class="block">I do not know that I have anything to add to what I said on this subject yesterday. There is an impression in the public mind that the gentlemen who occupy parliamentary offices hold positions which -are largely ornamental, and that opinion is sedulously cultivated by the press. But those of us who have served on Standing and Select Committees, or have in other . ways been brought inti- - mately into contact . with the officials, and have had the best opportunity of seeing the work that they perform, know that this opinion is fallacious. We recognise that the work which these officers are called upon to do is of a high order, requiring training, experience, and judgment; a considerable knowledge of parliamentary procedure, and the proper conduct of public business. In this regard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell,</inline> the cessation of whose _ service we so much regret, has. filled his office  with- credit to himself and to the Senate, and with advantage to. the country; because it is of public advantage that the work of Parliament should be facilitated by the adoption of correct procedure. The motion, expressing as it does our appreciation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell&#39;s</inline> services, will have the unanimous support of the Senate. It is sincerely meant, and I have had much pleasure in moving it. </para>

                        <para>. - I second the motion. The Minister has referred to the recognised and admitted capacity of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell,</inline> and I have nothing to add to his eulogy beyond the statement that T heartily indorse it. Furthermore, honorable senators, in addition, to their appreciation of the manner in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline> has discharged his official duties, have a very kindly recollection of his personal characteristics. In leaving the parliamentary service he carries with him our appreciation of the effective way in which his work was done, and our very deep personal regard. That regard induces me to re-echo the hope which you, sir, expressed yesterday, that the rest which he is about to take may restore him to good health. </para>

                        <para>. - Having been an. officer of the Senate for four years of the period during which. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline> was-  Clerk,  I wish&#39; to give my cordial support to the motion. No senator has enjoyed better opportunities of appreciating <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell&#39;s</inline> courtesy, and his willingness, and, indeed, anxiety to help us in the conduct of our deliberations. I have reason to appreciate the assistance which I received from him when. I was elected  Chairman  of Committees,, without experience of the work of that office.  His  help was of inestimable value to. me in the .decision of the points of order that are continually arising without notice during discussions in Committee. I hope that his successor may be equally happy in gaining and keeping the good-will of honorable senators. I trust, too, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell&#39;s</inline> retirement from public life may vastly benefit his health, and that he may live long to enjoy his leisure. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;11.7&#93;. - I do not wish to let the motion pass without saying- a word ot two in support of it.. I recognise- fully the ripe knowledge that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline>
                        invariably brought to bear, upon the performance of his duties, and his unwavering, courtesy to. every member of the chamber. We had in him a man eminently qualified by experience and by nature for the work that he was called upon to perform. I have enjoyed the privilege of knowing him for many years longer than most honorable senators can have known him. When I entered the Parliament of New South Wales he was one of the junior officers of the Legislative Assembly, and I had &#39; the pleasure of seeing him advance step by step to the position of  Clerk  of the Senate. It would, I think, be well if we added to the motion the request that you,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline>
                        shall convey to
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline>
                        this expression of the appreciation of the Senate. No doubt the resolution will bo conveyed to him in the ordinary course, but I think that it should be placed on record that honorable&#39; senators generally desire that this expression of their sense of obligation for the great assistance given to them by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline>
                        shall be conveyed to him by their presiding officer.

                        <para>. - I am unwilling to intrude into this debate, because the motion is one upon which we are unanimous, appreciating as we do, the work done by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline> while  Clerk&#34;  of the Senate. During three or four years of Ministerial office in this Chamber, I had a splendid opportunity of estimating the value of his services.  His  conduct was animated by the constant desire that this Chamber should- not only discharge its duties to the country efficiently, but also that it should maintain its proper position in relation to another place provided ford in the Constitution. Those who have  sat in the President&#39;s chair, and those who have held- Ministerial office, have had reason to realize that fact more than once. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell&#39;s</inline> services to- the Senate speak for themselves, so that it is hardly necessary for us to extol their value. I should like to say this, though I do not wish to sound any note of discord: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell&#39;s</inline> place is filled now by another officer whose capacity for the position no one would for a moment venture to question&#39;. I do, however, ask that with respect to other officers of the Senate, it shall be made abundantly clear that their claims to- promotion, upon the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline> have not Deen overlooked on account of any deficiency in their service-, or of any incapacity. I think it is due to them. </para>

                            <para>- Before putting the motion I wish to say a word or two upon it. I have very little to add to what I have already said on two previous occasions when my duty demanded that I should refer to the matter in the Senate. First of all, I wish to :indorse everything that was said by the Minister for Defence, the Leader of the Opposition, and other honorable senators as to the great capacity and unfailing courtesy with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline> discharged his duties. Every member of the &#39;Senate had &#39;in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline> a friend -who made the path of parliamentary procedure easy for him.  His  services -were especially -valuable to men -who, like myself, .attained a high, .official position without previous experience.  His  -services &#39;were invaluable to me :as a private member, and in my .present position .as presiding officer  of the Senate. Nothing &#34;was &#39;a trouble to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell,</inline> and I am sure that honorable senators were not only impressed by his ripe knowledge and unfailing courtesy, but have a high regard for him because of his personal qualities. He has left the service of the Senate with the esteem  and- goodwill of every member of it. I believe that every -member of the Senate most sincerely regrets that the cause of his retirement is in any way connected with the failure of his health.  I should like to refer to a matter mentioned by the Minister for De- fence in submitting the motion. There seems to be an impression, which has been very sedulously cultivated by members of the press, who on all occasions desire to magnify their own importance at the expense of Parliament, that such positions as that which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline> occupied are largely ornamental. I am sure that if any of the editors, leader writers, or members of the staffs of the great newspapers were suddenly called upon to perform the duties of these offices, they would find themselves in a very considerable fog. To efficiently fill the position of  Clerk  of Parliaments -requires a large experience, and very special ability. </para>

                            <para>- And, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> reminds me, a very considerable amount of study. The forms of Parliament with which the  Clerk  of Parliaments must necessarily- be acquainted in order to insure the proper conduct of business, and to give adequate assistance to honorable senators in the discharge of their duties, do not represent, as some of the newspapers invite the public to believe, mere surplusage and excrescences upon the public life of .the country. Every one of these forms and methods of procedure has been adopted as the result of long experience, and almost entirely with the object of safeguarding the rights and interests -of the people. Any -one who has given attention to the procedure of Parliament must be aware of this. There is also an impression -that when the Senate is not sitting there is very  little to do. T-hat is not correct, as in addition to the ordinary office work, there is a- large amount of very special work in connexion with the arranging and indexing of records, papers, Asc, and it must be remembered that the work -during the session is often of a very strenuous and wearying character. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline> was intimately acquainted with all the forms and methods of parliamentary procedure, and the&#39; reasons which led to their adoption. Whilst he was punctilious in urging the observance of those forms, he never allowed them to become a bar to the discharge &#39; of their duties by members of the Senate. He did all that he could to facilitate the discharge of their duties as representatives of the people, and members of this Chamber recognised and appreciated his .services accordingly. No -one regrets more than I do on official and personal grounds that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline> has been compelled to retire at this stage. I again express the hope that the rest which he will now be able to take will have the effect of restoring him again to robust health, and that for many years to come we shall have the privilege of enjoying the friendship with him which we have valued so much in the past. With regard to the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> I wish to say that it will be competent for any member of the Senate to raise that question on future occasions, and if it is raised, I shall be happy to -give all the reasons which guided me in making the decision I have made. </para>

                            <para>- There seems to be an impression on the part of many farmers, and the public generally, that the Commonwealth alone is responsible for the position to which he refers. As a matter of fact, the Board consists of one representative of the Commonwealth and a representative - the Minister for Agriculture - of each of the four interested States. The Board has decided against the special representation of farmers on it. I do not say for one moment that that decision is final. Representations may still be made&#39; by  private individuals or members of Parliament, but the question is one that must ultimately be determined by the Board itself. I am not in a position to say whether such a proposal would or would not be favorably received at its next meeting. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a lack of anxiety on the part of members of the Liberal Opposition to address themselves to the motion. In view of the fact that Liberal members are represented in unusually large numbers this morning, it seems to me that a great change must have come over the scene. Are we to assume from the silence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and his colleagues that all the criticism levelled at the Government during the past twelve or fifteen months was unjust, or that the grounds of complaint have been removed ? Are we to take it that there were no grounds for the many brilliant orations of the members of the Liberal Opposition against the administration of the Government ? </para>

                        <para>- To which Government does the honorable senator refer ? Probably when the numbers go up, there will be still greater quietude on the part of those Liberal members in Opposition. Yesterday I was rather interested in some views expressed here by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> and in the reply made thereto by the Minister for Defence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> pertinently, and, in my opinion; very ably and fully, touched on the . evils of secret diplomacy in international affairs, and, in reply, the Minister for Defence gave us the threadbare argument or assertion that it is quite necessary to keep from Parliament and the people everything that goes on in the diplomatic world. I think I am justified in saying that the practice amongst the nations of the world for so many years past - and in no country more strictly than Great Britain, with the exception, perhaps, of Russia - has not been a success. If we have regard to the position of the world to-day, the diplomatic methods of the past have failed. </para>

                        <para>- I shall make a brief comparison of the methods, as I have been able to trace them, operating amongst the nations. Yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie made an interjection, which we have often heard, in the form of the question, &#34;Has it ever been done before?&#34; What I suggest has not been done before; but that is no reason why it should not be done now ; and a very strong reason why it should be done now is the situation of the world to-dav. If Parliament and the people cannot do better in the all-important matter of diplomatic relations, and in the control of events which lead to or have their ending in war, it can safely be said that Parliament and the people could not do worse. </para>

                        <para>- I am leading to that point. There is a great feeling in human nature that there should be no changes made. That, of course, is the essence of Conservatism - what has been always should be. In spite of that feeling, however, I contend that the question of war, with its future effects on civilization and humanity, should be considered, and, if possible, grappled with by the people of this generation. We must not wait until such time as things settle down again. People are in the habit of saying that we shall be all right after the war - that we shall settle down as before.  But that is just what humanity and civilisation do not want. We do not want things as they were before the war ; and  in  spite of the obstacle of Conservatism, it appears to me that it is time for the Parliaments of the world to take some responsibility and control over the destinies of the nations. It is not a question for kings,  monarchs,  kaisers, or diplomats, but a question for the higher authority of the. Parliaments and the people who elect those Parliaments. As a preliminary, let me for a moment view war as we now know it at a distance. There is no gainsaying the fact, for it is impressed on us by our returned men, that war is bell ; and we believe it to be hell. It is  shuddersome  even to read the newspaper accounts of the conflict; and the idea sought to be inculcated by those who regard themselves as the reform parties in different parts of the world, is that, if war is hell, the question must be tackled. Their arguments and aspirations are described as Utopian, as something that would be all very well if it could be realized. Well, if the choice is to be between Utopia and hell, I am going to strive for Utopia, and, at any rate, get a certain distance nearer to it. . </para>

                        <para>- I hope to make my remarks appropriate to the occasion ; at any rate, they will have to be very academic to be too academic for the honorable senator. People in responsible positions are beginning to ask what will the gain or the result be to Australia if the war goes on for another year or two. If war be as futile as some people are beginning to realise - people who have greater interests in Australia than any of us have - what is to be the ultimate result to this country ? Some people whom I believe to be misguided have said that if we had only had more Australians at Gallipoli, we should have won the Dardanelles. This is said, notwithstanding the fact that there were 40,000 Australians in Egypt at the time. </para>

                        <para>- Did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie never hear it said that if we had had more men we should have got through the Dardanelles ? Why, that was said all during the referendum campaign, as an argument for sending more Australians to the front. Assuming that to be a correct statement of the case - although I do not think it is - and we had taken the Dardanelles, that part of the country would have been in the possession not of Great Britain or Australia, but of Russia, and with a continuation of the existing secrecy as to diplomatic relations, it is quite feasible that in ten years&#39; time Great Britain and Germany might be fighting Russia and other nations. Where, then, would have been the reward for the Australian blood that was spilt to capture the Dardanelles? That is not a far-fetched prediction, because only a few years ago Russia and Japan were flying at one another&#39;s throats. To-day they are allies. </para>

Any member of the Imperial Cabinet is a busy man, yet practically the whole responsibility of what is done in regard to alliances, treaties, agreements, and arrangements with other powers is left in the hands of that Minister. It is true that he comes before Cabinet and says what he is doing. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister is responsible to the Cabinet, and the Cabinet is responsible to . the House of Commons, which in turn is responsible to the people; but that is after the mischief has been done. In ordinary times the Cabinet, as a matter of course, indorses a Minister&#39;s recommendation. I venture to say that, prior to the outbreak of the war, the Cabinet accepted every recommendation made to it by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> as Minister for Defence. The people of Great Britain, or the members of the House of Commons, do not know what the Cabinet is doing. To become a candidate for even a humble post in the Imperial Diplomatic Service one has to be possessed of a private income of &#163;400 a year. The object is to keep out the democracy, . to make it exclusively an asylum in times of peace for the sons of the well-to-do. The positions are practically kept for the sons of lords and dukes, and often illegitimate sons at that - men who can be shouldered off in that way instead of sending them out to what the old Conservatives used to call in their supercilious manner the &#34;Caw- linies.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- Nor would even the legitimate son of the poor man. The higher the income the more responsible the post the candidate will be sent to,&#39; or the more extravagant or costly to keep up. When these men get to the different continental cities they ape the evil manners and customs of those cities, learn continental languages and continental ways, and often become entangled with women in the continental secret services, who, I suppose, find these men with large means and little brains very pliable in their hands. Those are the men employed in a service which has the power to tie up Great Britain behind the back of Parliament and behind the back of the people. The evils of such a system are so apparent- that it is unnecessary for me to enlarge upon them, and no thinking person would say that such a state of affairs is judicious or safe. Illustrations can be given of the bad effects brought about by knowledge of what is being done being withheld from the House of Commons. In the Morocco question, about 1904, a public declaration was made which was supposed to be binding on France and Great Britain. This was openly placed on the table of Parliament, but it was not until 1911 that the fact was revealed that, after the actual signing of the declaration, a code of private or secret rules was drawn up violating and over-riding the actual declaration itself. These were attached to the declaration, but kept secret even from Parliament for seven years. That reminds me of the system that we often find operating in Australian politics. </para>

                        <para>- I will endeavour to give the honorable senator a real fact now. The Treaty of Paris was signed in 1856, after the Crimean War, and Russia, as a party to the treaty, agreed to neutralize the Black Sea. But within a  comparatively few years, Russia repudiated that condition of the treaty, and every other , party to the agreement broke away at its own time. It may be said that what Russia did is no indication of what Great Britain would do, but I come to an instance in which Great Britain did tear up a &#34; scrap of paper.&#34; In 1852, by the Treaty of London, Great Britain and other nations agreed to maintain the integrity of the Danish Monarchy, and approved of a certain succession to the Crown as being the safest guarantee of that integrity. But when, in 1864, Prussia and Austria, the two Central Powers which, in the last three years, have been guilty of tearing up scraps of paper and of all manner of brutalities in war, seized Schleswig-Holstein from Denmark, Great Britain calmly looked on without making any protest. At that time Great Britain had no fine sensibilities about the crime of tearing up an international treaty. Here is another instance of more recent date. In 1877, when Germany and France were about to fly at each other&#39;s throats, there was a very active agitation by influential writers and newspapers in England in urging that, as the treaty guaranteeing the neutrality of Belgium had been made prior to the closing up of all the military passages between France and Germany, and as the only passage remaining was Belgium, it would be- quite right for Germany to violate the neutrality of Belgium in order to reach France. These instances prove that treaties and alliances are honoured or dishonoured, according to the dictates of expediency. All the nations of the earth can be accused of lapses in that way from time to time. I do not defend, the tearing up of scraps of , paper, or the dishonouring &#39; of international arrangements, but the official record of the questions in the House of Commons will prove that existing secret naval commitments to France were denied in the House of Commons on the 24th March, 1913, only sixteen months before the outbreak of war, notwithstanding, as was afterwards divulged, that the naval commitments existed before 1912. Another instance proves how contemptuously even the House of Commons is treated in these matters&#39;. A question was asked on the 11th June, 1914, eight weeks before the outbreak of war, and a denial was given that Great Britain was in any way committed navally to France. But the record of -debates in the House of Lords will show that on 6th&#39; August, of that year, Lord Lansdowne, representing the Foreign Minister, said, &#34; The negotiations constitute obligations of honour, obligations no less sacred because they are not embodied in a signed and sealed document.&#34; There we see that two days after the declaration of war an announcement of these commitments was made in the House of Lords, although they were denied eight weeks earlier, notwithstanding that they had existed before 1912. This brings me back to the interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> that Cabinet is responsible to the people. Before Cabinet can be held responsible the mischief has been done. When Cabinet has entered into an agreement to help an ally, the House of Commons is bound to support the Government, and the people in turn fall in behind the House of Commons. What are the systems operating in other countries? In the French Chamber of Deputies there is a Budget Committee consisting of forty-four members who are elected .for one year. That Committee examines all Budget matters and issues reports. In addition there is a grand Committee for external and colonial affairs, also comprising forty-four members elected for four years. That Committee has power to send for and examine persons and papers in connexion with foreign affairs, and to issue reports to the Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- That is no reason why Great Britain should not lead the world in the reform I am advocating. It is true that in the British Parliament also the Estimates are discussed/ but for many years past there has been a policy of hush in operation, and Parliament has not been able to discuss international affairs, because, by so doing. Great Britain might disclose her hand to the enemy. Just prior to the outbreak of war the discussion on the Imperial Naval and Military Estimates occupied only a day and a half, and even then the day&#39;s discussion was the result of an accident. Half a day would have sufficed, but members had nothing else to fill in the time with and so they gave another day to the Estimates. Members, however, did not touch upon international relationships; they talked about China and Korea, or some other places, and referred perhaps to little grievances in the Crown Colonies. The policy in Great Britain, as elsewhere, has been to keep these matters secret from the people. The opinion appeared to be that Labour members of the House of Commons were useful enough as being conversant with industrial matters, but of course could not be expected to know anything about big national issues. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of what has been the attitude in the past. Labour members, it -was said, could not be expected to know anything about big national issues, and the leisured classes were too busy with their social engagements, so it was the policy not to allow members to know anything about the arrangements in regard to treaties. Now the position is different in the United States. With all its evils the great Republic has reserved to itself the right to declare that the  President  shall have no authority to enter into any treaty, obligation, or agreement unless it has been indorsed by two-thirds of the members of the Senate. Therefore, before any treaty can be made the Senate must agree to it. In both the House of Representatives and the Senate there are Committees to deal with these matters at the negotiation stage, and the Senate, as being possessed of treaty powers, quite properly conducts its sittings in secret. In the House of Representatives, on the other hand, the discussions are open to the public. </para>

                <para class="block">I defy the honorable senator to- uphold this custom under which Imperial naval commitments to France were kept from the House of Commons for seven years. There can be no justification for such a procedure. This brings me back to the impending Imperial Conference. Is Australia going to perpetuate all that is worst in these many bad old British and -other traditions? Many of these evils have already permeated our national life, for since the outbreak of the war the Defence Department of the Commonwealth has been exclusive and secret to a ridiculous extent. We have been told that no discussion can take place on certain matters for fear it might assist the enemy in some way. </para>

                        <para>- All this talk about not trading with the enemy after the war is unworthy of any sane thinking person who knows the ways of capitalists and commercialism in Australia. It is all so much lip-loyalism and brummagem patriotism, because if they can buy articles &#189;d.- a gross cheaper from Germany they will do so. I am not going to be a party to the proposal to send any delegate from Australia to the Imperial Conference - I do not care whether it is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes, Mr. Cook,</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> - because I . think that the Imperial Conference only requires the Australian opinion, and no man is better able to supply that opinion than our present High Commissioner. Recent events in Australia should have opened his eyes to the position here, and he should now be much better able to express the Australian sentiment than when he left the Commonwealth - jockeyed out by the present Prime Minister. </para>

He will be misleading the men attending the Conference when he says, &#34;Yes, I guarantee it on behalf of Australia.&#34; He must have given such an assurance at&#39; the Paris Conference. Before leaving Lloyd George, he must have given the Imperial authorities a guarantee regarding conscription, and as he is likely to- give a similar guarantee again, it is too dangerous to let him go without instructions. A critical time may come in the history of the </para>

At every meeting I addressed during the last election the only reference I made to the war was that I regretted it, and would like to see it over, but if I had my way I would put in the front rank of the firing line all those people who caused it, embracing those irresponsible diplomatic agents to whom I have already referred, and I would have the workers back on the hills, waving the flags, lighting the bonfires, banging the drums, and singing &#34; Rule, Britannia !&#34; </para>

                            has said that he did not represent Australia, but was representing Great Britain. At least- he has said this since the referendum was defeated, but every one knows that he was at the Conference as the mouthpiece of Australia and the other Dominions.

Was it reasonable to expect sane men to regard the Prime Minister of Australia as the representative of Great Britain, who had displaced other men who would have attended the Conference in that capacity without the fact having been mentioned ? </para>

I was touching on this subject some months ago, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> called me to order. On that occasion I was leading up to the point that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> on his return to Australia had been successful in inducing the people of Australia to shackle the manacles of conscription on themselves, ne would have said good-bye to Australia, because he would. have been too big a man for this continent to hold, and would have gone Home, and perhaps had the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Henderson in the inner War Council, representing, not only Labour, but also the Dominions. He would probably have had a seat in the House of Lords as the Earl of Anzac. What reason has been advanced by the Government for copyright- . ing and keeping inviolate the word &#34;Anzac&#34; ? This was done because the word was to be retained by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> would have had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henderson&#39;s</inline> place in the War Council. Some time ago I stated my belief that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> were in collaboration for inspiring press messages to Australia just before the referendum campaign, and my remark evoked indignant howls of protest all round the chamber. Since then there have been none of these significant appeals from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, specially directed to the people of Australia. There were many of these appeals arriving here just prior to referendum day, and I do not believe that .there is a thinking person in Australia, unless his judgment be clouded by prejudice, who is not of the opinion that there was an arrangement between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George to send&#39; out cable messages to Australia prior to- the taking of the referendum vote. So that I am- quite entitled, as I suppose every man in a free Parliament is- entitled, to express his belief as to what is- likely to occur in the present crisis. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughesis</inline> going, to get out. I think that he is going away as Prime Minister, and- that . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, in- return for what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has tried to do, will see that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is all right. Events will&#39; show whether I am- exuding so much hot air as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> does when he lets go his dominating personality. The position then is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has done, as I said, no evil to Australia or the- Labourparty. What his intentions in that direction were is, of course, a horse of another colour. But, so far as animus is concerned, my objection- to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> representing Australia is not dictated by that feeling. He is a man whose head, in my opinion, runs away with his judg;- . ment. Without speaking with any disrespect of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> I regard&#39; him. as a. man who, on- this question of Imperialism, is semi-demented. I do- not think that the man is rational. Let us for a moment examine his actions before he went to. England. Can a man say. that his action in leaving Australia was- the action of. a rational man, giving publicity all over Australia to. the statement that he would be leaving Adelaide by the <inline font-style="italic">Osterley</inline> on such and such a date? It was advertised throughout the length and breadth of Australia that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was going by the <inline font-style="italic">Osterley.</inline> He. slipped over to Fiji for a start, and then he went to Vancouver. </para>

                        <para>- That is nothing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> did not consult his colleagues on the conscription campaign. He knew that 1,500 passengers were to leave Australia by the <inline font-style="italic">Osterley.</inline> It did not matter if the Germans submarined the 1,500 bodies and- souls who- were aboard the <inline font-style="italic">Osterley</inline> for all Mir-. Hughes would care, but it did matter about his precious hide. I would not like to see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes-</inline> submarined. Here is the- monumental position which he built- himself into by that action. Did he think for a moment that all the energies of the German, destroyers, battleships, and so forth were awaiting his departure, saying in effect, &#34; Look here. If we can only get that many Hughes, Germany has won the war?&#34; That is the corollary to the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> In my view it is not the attitude of a rational- man, and there is nobody who will deny that after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> return to Australia he absolutely ran amok. I know his stock on the other side of the world has deteriorated. Since the defeat of the referendum campaign it will have received a pretty hard blow; it &#39; will have suffered a great slump ; it will be at a- low ebb now. On his next visit he will be shorn of .the assistance of the Northcliffe&#39; press. Those newspapers used <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> as a stick&#39; with which to beat the- then Liberal Government dog. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. The Northcliffe press wanted to destroy the then- Liberal&#39; Government. . Lord Northcliffe, and his newspapers&#39; &#34;boosted&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and used him for the pur* pose, and with their aid <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George acceded to power. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has rightly interjected that the Northcliffe press may not discard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> yet: Certainly they may use- him a bit more. But in the end, as with a sucked orange, they will- throw him away. I, for one, am not prepared, and I do not think that the reform movement of Australia is prepared, to see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> go to the impending Conference and speak with a free tongue and run amok generally in regard to Australia, because I fear that Australia might be irretrievably bound up, and then a time would come, perhaps in ten years, when if .the Empire were embroiled, the cry might have to go up, &#34; Australia will .not go there.&#34; </para>

Since he has been good enough to lead me on to the question, I will mention that only to-day I was reading in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> the official paper of the new junta, that the Liberals have been very magnanimous to the Hughes party, because a proper calculation of the  strength  of the respective parties, thirty-six Liberals, and twenty Hughesites, cuts up the eleven available Cabinet seats in the proportion of 6.6 for the Liberals, and 4.4 for the  Hughesites.  The point is that the Liberals are treating  the Hughesites  liberally. That is to say,* &#39;their generosity amounts to .2, I will not say of a Minister, but of a  Cabinet seat. </para>

                        <para>- Are they going to cut and dry matters in this way with the fate of Australia, as we are told, hanging in the balance since the commencement of the war ? Just prior to the last adjournment the Senate, exercising its undoubted right, and what has turned out to be its wisdom, curtailed Supply from three months to two. From the anti-Labour senators in this chamber there was a concerted howl against the patriotic attitude of the Labour majority. They said, &#34; You are stopping members from going out recruiting. The cry from the Empire, is for men. The fate of Australia hangs in the balance.&#34; The Labour party, thinking that they .were doing the right thing for Australia, as has undoubtedly been- proved since, stood firmly and granted only two months&#39; Supply, and we went home on the eve of Christmas. Yet, even before the 1st January, the newspapers were referring to the negotiations between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> that were impending. Thereupon all these ultra loyal persons, these energetic defenders of the interests of Australia, dropped their recruiting intentions, and hastened back to Melbourne to be in .at the death should  anything happen. The loudest roarer of them all, that patriotic, jingoistic blusterer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, had booked his passage to Western Australia to assist in the recruiting campaign there, but it was announced that &#34; important public business .detained him,&#34; and he did not go to Western Australia at all. </para>

In reference to the impending Imperial Conference, I have not the slightest objection, and, on the contrary, I should be quite pleased to see the present Prime Minister of Australia go to that Conference. Although I am not a supporter of his to-Hay, arid differ from certain of his statements and actions, I do not know of any man in Australia who could represent the Commonwealth as well as could the present Prime Minister at the very important Conference that is about to be held. </para>

                        <para>- I do not bother myself about prejudice. I &#39;desire to be fair to all men, since I look to other men to be fair to me. Whilst I have every respect for the right honorable gentleman who may, and who I hope will, be the delegate of the Commonwealth to the War Conference, I think it is only right that he should leave Australia&#39;s shores with full instructions from Australia&#39;s Parliament. I venture to say that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had acted as Australia&#39;s representative under instructions when he was last in England, the Commonwealth would not have been involved in the recent conscription campaign. That is past and gone, and I do not want to refer to it again. The people&#39;s verdict on the point has been given. The War Conference about to assemble in Great Britain will be the most important Conference ever held in the history of the British Empire. As a component part of the Empire, we should be represented at it, but I contend that our representative should go to the Conference with full instructions from this Par- &#62;liament. so that he may not commit Australia to anything which may, in the light of after events, prove injurious to this young nation. The question may be asked : Are these instructions to be given to our representative at a public or private session of the Parliament? That is a very important point. I know that the questions which will be considered at the Conference will be of vast importance, and it might well be neither diplomatic nor wise to give the enemy any indication of what they are. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but there is more than one way of dealing with it. We are all aware that under the Constitution Parliament must put its imprimatur upon the present Tariff before it expires by effluxion of time, otherwise it would be necessary to refund all the duties that have been collected under it. That, of course, is inconceivable. It might be possible to get over the difficulty by passing a short validating Act; but I contend that the Parliament should go into the whole question of the Tariff as it stands to-day. Even in this time of war, when our importations are compulsorily restricted, we find that our Customs revenue continues to increase. Recognising that it is the express will of the people of Australia that we should have an effective Tariff, and that the Tariff laid .on the table of another place towards the end of 1914, and which has been operative ever since, is anything but protective in its incidence </para>

                        <para>- We could with advantage devote three or four weeks, and a considerably greater time, to a consideration of the incidence of the present Tariff. It would not be- wise to go into it too comprehensively at the present time, so far as trade relations with our Allies after the war are concerned, before this Parliament expires, but we should revise the Tariff and remove, the varying  anomalies that now exist. The. Australian wool clip, which, is now in the hands of the Government, is another matter to which I desire to refer.- It is not fair to any of the States, and particularly to Western Australia, that wool-owners should be compelled to send all their wool to the one port in each State. The whole of the wool raised in Western Australia, for instance, must be sent to Fremantle, there to be appraised. Thousands of bales of wool are lying on the Geraldton wharf, where they could easily be appraised and sent direct to London. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. There is just one other question to which I desire briefly to refer. When we were discussing the War Pensions Bill I asked the Minister for Defence whether its administration would be kept entirely separate from that of the Old-age Pensions Act. I asked him whether, if any citizen was in receipt of a war pension as the result of the loss of, or injury to, a loved one on the battle field, that circumstance would militate against him or her receiving the full amount of the old-age pension. In reply I was assured that the fact that any person was in receipt of a war pension ought not to operate adversely against the receipt by him of the old-age pension, but that if it did the Government would bring down a Bill to amend the Old-age Pensions Act, so as to make the two pensions quite independent of each other. Now there are in Australia to-day persons who are receiving war pensions, and these same individuals have been refused the full amount of the old-age pension because of the fact that they are in receipt of war pensions. </para>

                        <para>- As citizens of Australia they are entitled to the old-age pension. Because they are in receipt of perhaps <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> a week as a war pension, owing to the loss of one of their family either in Prance or Gallipoli why should they be denied the full amount of the old-age pension ? Is this the reward which we offer these people whose relatives have sacrificed their lives in defence of the liberties of the Empire? If it is, it does not harmonize with the promises made by the Government from the inception of the war, or with the pledge given by the Minister for Defence when we &#39; were discussing the War Pensions Bill. </para>

                        <para>- That cannot be avoided. It is inevitable that this war will cost us many millions of pounds. But because that is so, it is not right that the relatives of those who have suffered on the battle-fields of Europe should be penalized. In all fairness, the fact that an applicant for an old-age pension is in receipt of a war pension should not be taken into account; and I hope that the Minister in charge of the Bill will refresh the memory of the Minister for Defence, and see whether there cannot be an amendment in the Act in the direction suggested. </para>

                    <para>. - I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> on what I may call the temperate tone of his speech, which was in marked contrast to the one of the honorable senator who preceded him. The position of the few Liberals in. the Senate, and the division of parties, are such that each individual vote&#39; here is of considerable importance at this juncture; and circumstances have so altered as to make the position of the few Liberal senators very much more important than it was a few months ago. Certain references have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> and, I think, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> to the position occupied by the Prime Minister, and to the over- . shadowing importance of the representation of Australia at the Conference which has been convened by the Prime Minister of the Imperial Government. It is, of course, well known to the public that certain negotiations have been on foot here for some time past with a view to the formation of what has been called a National Government. These negotiations have been initiated, and rightly initiated, somewhat in imitation of what has &#62;taken place in the Old Country. There, the position of the Empire is regarded as so serious that it has been . thought wise to&#39; invite the co-operation of the best minds in all political parties in the formation of a Government to prosecute the Empire&#39;s cause in this great and far-reaching struggle to what we nope will be a victorious conclusion. This is no ignoble object, but a truly imperial object, which has been1 held in view by minds at the Empire&#39;s seal of government. I do not think that there is anything derogatory in the stand taken up by any political party on the suggestion that we, in this important part of the Dominions overseas, shall imitate the Imperial example. We know that, in America. - which is, perhaps, on the eve of being drawn, almost against the will of its people, and certainly against the will of its  President,  into this great, world struggle - assurances have been given by political leaders that there shall be unanimity of action, if not of opinion, in the great Republic should it become one of the parties to the war. </para>

                        <para>- If any man could be rightly accused of politically throwing kerosene on a fire, it is the honorable senator who interjects. Let me, as one who believes in Liberalism, say something in regard to the present position. I was elected as a Liberal, and Liberalism, as regards domestic politics, and, indeed, Imperial .politics, is a sufficiently good political philosophy for me. But I regard the necessity for unity at this juncture as imperative. Although I differ, as I have always differed, from the party on the Government benches in regard to many matters of domestic policy, I think the consideration of these matters might be very largely, if not completely, subordinated to the greater question of how we, as a unit of the Empire, may do our best at this &#39; critical stage. Beyond all doubt this great struggle is going to be lost or won within the next few months. Much greater men than myself have pointed out the difficulty of putting a period to this war; but the submarine campaign, if it is not squelched, and very rapidly squelched, will bring about a decisive stage in the conflict in the next eight or ten months at the outside. I am sorry to say that if the menace is not properly counteracted, the result of the war will be disastrous to our Empire and our Allies. Those honorable senators who have studied the classics will remember how the. maritime supremacy of Carthage was destroyed through the invention of a Roman Consul. He saw that the Romans were not a maritime people, and that it was absolutely necessary to reproduce on the seas the conditions of land fighting before the Romans could have a chance of victory. He invented a sort of drawbridge which the Roman sailors could attach to the Carthaginian galleys; and thus the Roman legionaries were enabled to reproduce the conditions of land fighting, and practically destroy the maritime supremacy of Carthage. Germany, beyond all doubt, recognises her naval inferiority as compared with Great Britain, but she also sees that the mercantile marine of Great </para>

                </continue>
                <para class="block">Britain is our heel of Achilles, and, leaving our naval might untouched, she is attacking the mercantile marine, and thus creating the conditions for England in regard to food supply that we hope to create in Germany by means of the naval blockade. I hope that the German attempt will not succeed, but the position is sufficiently dreadful at the present time to deserve the serious consideration of every man who has been honored with a <inline font-style="italic">seat in</inline> one of the King&#39;s Legislatures. I am not a man fond of saying, &#34; T told you so.&#34; I do not know that there is any great merit in such an attitude; at any rate, the only merit  is to rouse the people to a proper appreciation of the problems in front of them, without regard to problems past and gone. I do say, however, that the key to my actions and utterances in this Chamber, from the beginning of the war up to the present time, is my very keen appreciation of the Empire&#39;s danger, and its weakness in the particular spot at which it is now being attacked. </para>

                        <para>- At the beginning of the war, I said that it was absolutely essential for Great Britain and her children dominions to recognise the desirability of bringing the war to a successful conclusion in a few months, if possible, and to do so by throwing in the whole strength of the Empire. Why ? I think I can almost from memory reproduce the words I uttered; at any rate, they were reported at the time in a Labour newspaper. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Martin,</inline> a member of the Labour party in the Tasmanian House of Assembly, had a controversy with me in the Labour paper over this very question. I remember writing over two years ago that, it was necessary for the Empire to bring the war to a successful conclusion before the Germans so improved the submarine as to constitute the approach of a merchant vessel to the ports of the United Kingdom a matter of the greatest difficulty and danger. The event has now come upon us. I am not a slavish admirer of all the men who have held the helm of the ship of State in the Old Country during the war. At the present moment many of them are hesitating to adopt measures that they should adopt at once. We are told of solicitations by one particular Imperial Minister, charged with the matter of food supply, to the people to voluntarily curtail their daily and weekly diet. Why does not the Government ration the people at once, as it will- have to ultimately, and as is being done in other countries? As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George says, we are always dogged with the spectre of &#34; Too late.&#34; The Germans organized their nation ; we have had to follow suit. There does not seem to be any initiative about our rulers. The Germans are rationing their people, but the people in the Old Country are told by the Government to voluntarily curtail their dietaries. The position has to be gripped in such a way as will admit of no misapprehension, and no mistaking in regard to the ultimate result. I urge every honorable senator to read <inline font-style="italic">The Day of the Saxon,</inline> a book published two years before wa.r was declared, in which the actual areas of conflict were defined, and the coming war regarded as inevitable. Let honorable senators read it, and realize how serious is the position of this territorially-disintegrated, but, I hope, racially-united, Empire. I am naturally optimistic,- and have all along said that the resources of the British Empire are sufficient, if properly and intelligently exercised, and the powers of the Empire great enough, if properly wielded, to defeat the German Empire even if we were fighting it single-handed. I am sorry to say that the resources of the Empire have, in many instances, not been intelligently organized or vigorously exercised. There is in the minds of our race too much of that denseness which foreigners have sometimes attributed to the foggy atmosphere of the islands from which most of our ancestors came. We do not seem to be quite quick-witted enough, although we have all the virtues of tenacity and stubbornness. I should like our politicians to have a little more imagination and a little longer vision in dealing with the great crises of Empire, one of which is now upon us. The mind- of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Ferricks  is much exercised by the question whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> should go to London, and whether we shall have a </para>

                <para class="block">National Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has never been my leader. He became the leader of a political party whose domestic policy I opposed, and to many items of whose domestic policy I am still opposed.  His  Government is the successor of the Government which displaced the Liberal Administration from the Treasury bench. When the war came upon us, the Liberal party decided that its proper and patriotic course was to support the existing GoVernment in all its legitimate legislation in relation to the Empire crisis. The Minister for Defence has from time to time in this chamber acknowledged the support which we gave the Fisher Administration, that subsequently became the Hughes Government, in all its measures for the prosecution of the war. Subsequently a line of cleavage showed itself in the Labour party, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> remained on the Treasury bench, but with a somewhat different Ministry, and followed by only a section of his party. We did not displace him. We realized that the matter did not greatly concern us. We supported the reformed Hughes Administration, and, so far as I am concerned, that Ministry would have received continued . support if it had decided to be content with it. The Liberal party sought no alliance with the Ministerial party. It did not bargain for anything <inline font-style="italic">when</inline> it gave its support to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> latelyformed Administration, and I have not the slightest doubt that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had at once published the fact that he had received an invitation from the Imperial Prime Minister to a Conference to be held in England, and had decided to accept it, the Liberal members of this Parliament, so far as was, and is, in our power, would have prevented him from receiving any parliamentary affront during his absence. Let the people of Australia understand that. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> himself has, in the interests of the Empire and of political unity in Australia in regard to the prosecution of the war, solicited a closer association between our party and his. Who is to say that we are not preserving the dignity of our party, or that we are regardless of Australian and Imperial interests by listening to .and entertaining his invitation? We decided that, in order to follow the Imperial example in all particulars, the official Labour party, which is quite ready to pro fess its loyalty and its adherence to the Imperial ideal, should be invited to cooperate in the formation of a National Government. It declined to do so, and the matter  now rests with the two parties who believe that unity is essential at this juncture. If in the United States, where there is such a keen feeling between Republicans and Democrats, the sinking of all party animosity is regarded as desirable, since the great Republic is, perhaps, on the eve of having to step into the war, surely in Australia, where there are only 5,000,000 of people, almost purely of British extraction, unity is not a bad objective. </para>

                        <para>- I deprecate the secrecy in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is alleged to have kept this matter. I understand that this invitation, which was surely not a war item, was known to the- people of the United Kingdom, and presumably known to the people of the other self-governing Dominions, and to the Germans, and it is not a matter such as should have been withheld one hour from the people of Australia. But responsible papers, which are urging the alliance of parties in the interests of national unity, state that they were prohibited for at least one or two days from publishing the statement that the invitation had been received. What good purpose is served by action of that kind ? The people of Australia should have been immediately taken into the confidence of the Prime Minister, and he had no reason for suspecting that the Liberal party would withdraw the loyal and disinterested support which we had given him thitherto. Why did he not say that, having received an invitation to attend the Conference, and being Prime Minister, he intended to go to England ? Why did he not define his attitude in regard to this matter? After all, the shuffling of portfolios does not greatly concern this Chamber. If we rightly understand, our functions as legislative&#39; censors, we will not be particularly concerned with what is happening in another place in regard to the formation of Governments. The impulse of popular power is from below, and although the . Senate has coordinate powers with the other Chamber in most matters, it is well known that rarely do we initiate legislation in this Chamber. That being so, our constitutional province in theory, and certainly in practice, is to act as legislative censors of measures that come before us,  and not of Governments formed in another place. I do not intend to be vitriolic in my criticism of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> He has had a great deal of responsibility on his shoulders in the last year or two, and it may be that a mind somewhat distraught by the cares of office does not always come to the wisest conclusions on important matters. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had better understand that a great statesman in a Democracy does not indulge in an undue amount of secrecy. Some secrecy there must be, but the best and boldest course for a man worthy of the name of statesman is to take the people at once into his confidence. On that ground, I object to the course taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in regard to the Imperial invitation. Outside electors who did not understand the disinterested attitude of the Liberal party, were beginning to accuse us of preventing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> from representing Australia at the Conference. So far as we were concerned, he could have accepted the invitation at once, and gone to England. And I say of the Liberal party that, although we may be few in this Chamber, nothing we would have done, would have impaired the power and prestige of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> as the Australian representative at the Conference. </para>

                        <para>- I know he is not; but one generous word from him would have dispelled the mists that were rising in the public mind. We were supporting him disinterestedly, and would have continued to support him in the same spirit if he had accepted the invitation. If we have been solicited to join with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> - and I say the objective is a national one,, and will be salutary in the national interests - the initiative and the solicitation have come from him. There has been no resigning of the Liberal interests. The Liberal party has not wanted, to use a vulgar expression, to get its snout into the dish. I have no desire to delay the passage of this Bill; but I could infer from the interjections that we Liberals would be challenged with having kept our own counsel until the situation had developed. I say now that I have supported the war administration of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and his colleagues ever since the war started, and I would have continued to support it unless gross mismanagement was disclosed. There is nothing sordid or indecent in the attitude of the Liberal members towards the party on the Ministerial benches at the present juncture. It was the Liberal party that caused the invitation to join in a National &#39;Government to be extended to all parties. The refusal of the Official Labour party tp support that project is on their own shoulders. If the majority of the people of Australia desire that that refusal be indorsed, then all I can say is that &#34; for the people who like that sort of thing it is just the sort of thing they like.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- If the. Minister would like me to mention in detail - the improper and irresolute acts of the Prime Minister, I will willingly do so ; but I am not one of those who desire to pour oil on fire. I will support any Ministry, even if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is at the head of it, which acts properly and imperially at this juncture. But if I were to hold my tongue now, and were to utter these criticisms later, my political opponents would say that I was one of the disappointed portfolio seekers. We know that, at the Melbourne Town Hall, a banquet was held at which the sphinx was to declare himself. Australia, it was said, was in a state of expectancy. The Prime Minister said that he accepted the verdict of the people at the poll, but that the men who had been called into camp under the proclamation would have to obey the law. He declared that they would have to go into training, and that those who disobeyed the law would be punished. Inside  a week,  however, a notice appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Government Gazette</inline> rescinding the proclamation, and absolving those men who had not obeyed the law from any punishment. That was an act of irresolution which I could hardly pardon. I can overlook many indiscretions in  a  leader of a political party, but  I  cannot pardon irresolution to any great extent. In this case the irresolution of the Prime Minister may be accounted for to some extent by the fact that he has had imposed upon him such  a  vast amount of responsibility of late as to impair his judgment. We have been told, in connexion with these negotiations, that the Liberals are out for office, but I can say that Liberalism has always been good enough for me, and in regard to the war I am prepared to support any responsible party that has for its object national unity, which I believe to be imperatively essential. </para>

                    <para>, - I do not intend to take up very much time, but I would like to say a few words in connexion with the subject that has been touched upon by various speakers this afternoon. There can be only one opinion concerning the present political situation in Australia, and that is, that it is a most unfortunate one. As an Empire we are engaged in a life and death struggle, and at the present moment we have not, in this Parliament, any political party which can be truly said to represent the opinions of our people. Such a position should not exist in a country governed by the people, and in which the franchise is the widest to be found in any part of the world. At the last election two parties went to the constituencies - the Labour party and the Liberal party - and as the result of that appeal to the people, the Labour party came back with an. overwhelming majority in one House, and with a respectable majority in the other. This was an indication at the time that the people of Australia accepted not only the Labour platform, but chose the Labour party to see Australia through the war. Since then, however, something has happened, and the Labour party is. now divided into two parts. I do not intend to go into the reasons which brought about this  condition of affairs. All that concerns us at present is the fact that the party which was returned to power at the last election is now divided. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman can take it whatever way he pleases, but I have already pointed out that I do not intend to discuss that aspect of the question. We are now only concerned with the fact that the Labour party is divided into two portions, and it can no longer be said to have a majority in the Parliament. It has a majority in one House certainly, but not in the Chamber which more directly represents the people. Now I take up the position that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> found himself no longer the leader of his party, and no longer&#39; capable of carrying on the government of the country, his only honorable course was to resign. </para>

                        <para>- When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> found himself unable to carry on it was his bounden duty to resign. I am not making any reflection upon the party now behind the Prime Minister, but I point out that it is a very small one in the House of Representatives, and in combination with the Opposition it cannot command a majority in the Senate. But instead of resigning, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> immediately formed a new Government, and went on as if nothing had happened. He understood, of course, that it would be impossible for him to continue the government of the country unless he could get a majority in the House of Representatives. What did he do then ? So far as we can discover - nothing has been divulged to us - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> must have entered into an arrangement with the Opposition. To do what? To carry out the Labour platform? The arrangement could not have had that object in view, because the Opposition, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has pointed out, is bitterly opposed to nineteen out of twenty planks in the Labour platform. The Labour and Liberal parties are diametrically opposed to each other, and so far as general legislation is concerned, they can no more unite than oil can be mixed with water. </para>

                        <para>- There may be something in what my Scotch friend has said. I was going to say that in all probability he is fond of occupying a high position in the councils of Australia, or he thinks himself a heaven-ordained saviour of the country in its present difficulties, In any case, whatever his opinion of himself may be, he has been trained in the school of Democracy, and must have known that when he lost his majority as Prime Minister he was no longer entitled to hold office. My first ground of complaint against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is that he improperly continued in his position after he had no warrant for holding it. The only warrant a man has for holding the office of Prime Minister of the Commonwealth is that Parliament supports him. Does the Commonwealth Parliament support <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes?</inline></para>

                <para class="block">Wo are told that the only reason why the Liberal party is supporting him, and why he is accepting the support of the Liberal  party,  is to win the war. Every member of the Commonwealth Parliament is anxious to win the war; there is no man in the Labour party who has not done his very best to help in winning the war; there cannot be two opinions upon the matter; but honorable senators overestimate the importance of Australia in this regard. If we sent every man, woman, and child from Australia across to Europe, and exhausted all our resources, I doubt very much whether it would have any great .effect on the winning or losing of the war. If &#39;the war is to be won it may be won without any assistance of Australia. It can only be won by Russia, Great Britain, France, and Italy. If they cannot -win the war the position is hopeless so far as Australia is concerned. But all parties are united in regard to the matter of winning the war. </para>

But to come back to matters which are of more present importance here is a most unfortunate situation for the people of Australia - a situation which has been created for them, not by themselves, but by men whom they elected to Parliament to do a particular thing, and to see the war through in a particular way. Let me repeat once more that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> ought to have resigned his position the moment he found himself without a majority. Why did he not do so ? </para>

                            sent his resignation in, not with the purpose of resigning the position of Prime Minister, but simply with the object of rearranging the portfolios. . But my contention is that he should have completely abandoned the office. He ought to have said, &#34;I have no longer a majority. I have no longer the power to carry out the platform on which I was elected, therefore I vacate the position.&#34; But he did not do anything of the kind. He hung on to the position because, as one honorable senator said here this afternoon, he is fond of the &#34; bawbees.&#34; That is one of the most sordid reasons imaginable for hang7 ing on to any public position. That may be the right reason, or it may be the wrong reason, but if it is the reason it is one which is disgraceful in the extreme. The duty of

                            as I have pointed out, was evident. If he had resigned his position the probability is that the Governor-General would have sent for the Leader of the Opposition, and the latter would have found that, although he might&#39; have a majority in the House of Representatives, he could not carry on owing to the existence of a majority against him in the Senate.

                        <para>- We do not want it. What we desire is an appeal to the country. That is the only way to straighten out the present tangle. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> having met in solemn conclave, have decided not to send Parliament to the country - the members  of the House of Representatives do not wish to risk their skins - but to send the Senate there. Personally, I welcome an early appeal to the country; but the people should not be put to the expense of two separate elections when one would be sufficient. </para>

                        <para>- : I think not. Why are Ministers -afraid to put their positions to the test of an election ? &#39;The Labour party three years ago had the people behind it, but it is now divided into two sections, one of which is formally or informally allied with the traditional enemies of Labour. It is ridiculous to think that as things stand any representative that might be sent could authoritatively voice the opinions and aspirations of the people of Australia. There is no need to go into details; I rose merely to point out that the present position is intolerable, and can be ended only by an appeal to the country by the dissolution of both Houses of Parliament. If such an appeal does not take place, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is sent Home, the people may not consider themselves bound by what he engages to do. They may not regard him as their duly accredited representative. It would be a misfortune were any one to be sent Home at this juncture who could not truly represent Australia. </para>

                            is a man of great intelligence, possessing a good deal of spirit, and I am sure that had he been elected leader of a party possessing a majority in both Houses of the Parliament, and had subsequently found himself without a majority, and unable to carry out the platform on which he was elected, he would have resigned. I am sure that he would not cling to office if he found himself impotent. No one with the spirit of a man would. I do &#39;not wish to detain the Senate longer, but I ask honorable senators to consider that we have arrived at a time when we are confronted with a position which we should meet with faces of flint.

At the present time, when big issues are before the people, the result of the war loan is -an indication that whatever may be the differences existing amongst us in Parliament and in the country, the people of Australia desire to see the war brought to a close by a satisfactory victory for the Allies at as early a date as possible. I feel that we may exchange mutual congratulations between ourselves and Australia upon the result of the latest war loan. </para>
