        <para>That the Senate do now adjourn. </para>
        <para>This motion will undoubtedly strike honorable senators as somewhat remarkable, in view of the fact that on Friday last I invited them to meet to-day, and that in order to do so many of them have subjected themselves to considerable inconvenience. An explanation is therefore due to the Senate, and I propose &#39;to frankly place before honorable senators the reasons that have caused the Government to reconsider, not merely the business to be remitted to the Senate, but the political situation in its entirety. Upon its formation the Government was confronted with the duty of considering the responsibilities arising from both&#39; the war and the Imperial Conference. In view of the state of the . parties in this House it was obvious that, having regard to the character, urgency, and vital importance of the issues involved, these responsibilities could only be satisfactorily discharged with the co-operation and support of this Chamber. That co-operation was invited by me on behalf of the Government in announcing the formation of the new Ministry. Although the response to that appeal was not reassuring or such as the Government had ventured to look for, it was still hoped, as both the demands of the war and the urgency of the </para>
        <para class="block">Imperial Conference were pressing with increasing weight, that members would consider the grave national situation a sufficient warrant tor ignoring party issues and extending to the Government that support without which its efforts would necessarily bo ineffective. It has however, become apparent that it is idle to any longer look for that co-operation. From the first moment of meeting the Government has been assailed with a virulence and malignity never paralleled in the history of the Federal Parliament. It has been made quite clear that no help or co-operation of any kind is to be looked for from those opposed to the Government. Yet without this there can be no adequate representation at the Imperial Conference, nor can the ordinary business of the Government be conducted, still less can there be that concentration of effort which the progress of the war increasingly demands. In these circumstances it has become necessary for the&#39; Government to put an end to a situation which renders all attempts at government impossible. </para>
        <para>The Government has, after earnest consideration, decided to take steps with a view to bringing both Houses of the Parliament before - the country immediately. This, of course, necessarily involves a postponement of the departure of the delegation to the Imperial Conference. A full statement will&#39; be submitted by the Prime Minister to the House of Representatives to-morrow. </para>

          <para>. -  I have listened to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> - that it is the intention of the Government to appeal to the country - with more pleasure than has been afforded to me by any other statement that has been- made in the Senate. No one on this side desires to dispute or to deny what the honorable gentleman said regarding the manner in which the Government have been assailed by the Opposition. We, on this side, have assailed the Government because of their manipulation of the public business, and because we have evidence of the attempts of Ministers to bribe an honorable senator. We have assailed the Government because of the manner in which Ministers have succeeded in displacing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> by an honorable senator who is. willing &#39; to support their policy. As the Senate may not meet again before the elections, it may not be out of place to make a pass-  ing reference to the removal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> who was a member of this party, and the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle.</inline> In fairness to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> and to myself, I wish to say that he comes from Tasmania with as high a record as any other man in the political life of that State. If we on this side receive him in anger, it is because we, perhaps, know more than he knows of the circumstances which have brought him here. I appeal to his fairness in judging the situation. At half-past 2 o&#39;clock on Wednesday, we, on this side, became aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> was resigning his seat, and it is evident that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> was aware on Tuesday,&#39; at least, of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> intention to resign. </para>

            <para>- The Premier of Tasmania and the Prime Minister have an interview, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> hurries in his resignation from the Tasmanian Parliament. The selection of a senator to take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> place is necessary. The Premier of Tasmania after 6 o&#39;clock on Wednesday evening is informed by wire of the vacancy in the Senate, and shall I say by a quarter-past 10 o&#39;clock on the following morning the Executive have met in Tasmania, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has been selected as senator <inline font-style="italic">pro tern,</inline> for Tasmania - because, after all, the Tasmanian Parliament will yet have a word to say about his position. He is elected <inline font-style="italic">pro tern,</inline> a senator for Tasmania, a message is sent here, and he is sworn in as a member of the Senate with lightning-like rapidity. I desire to impress upon honorable senators the fact that all these circumstances are so suspicious that even an appeal to the country looks to me like an attempt to smother up the whole thing. </para>

I impute no grounds for a charge to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> but I say that statements of so grave a character have been made that the reputation of the Senate demands the fullest public inquiry under conditions permitting all statements made to be questioned to the utmost. I say that it is even now the duty of the Government to make provision for such an inquiry. We all welcome the proposed appeal to the public, and we are glad to have the. opportunity for such an appeal, but that appeal to the public will not be a judicial inquiry such as is necessary to sift right to the bottom the definite charge of attempted bribery- which has been made. </para>

We have the definite charge made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> who has told us that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> said that- if money stood in the way that would be all right. That is- as clear- and definite a charge of attempted bribery as ever was made in any public assembly in the world. There must be no mistake about these things, and there can be no mistake about them. </para>

            <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> cannot see the suspicions surrounding the sudden disappearance of a majority from this side, and the equally sudden appearance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> as a majority on the other side, all I can say is that I wish I may reach his years of manhood with such a perfectly innocent mind. I venture to say that not only I, in common with every other honorable member of the Senate, but every fair-minded man who reads the report of the proceedings, will say that the suspicions suggested are sufficiently well grounded to justify a full and impartial inquiry. Who is to lose by such an inquiry ? With respect to another person concerned in the matter, I say, as a friend of ex-Senator Ready up to the last moment, and one who was prepared to defend him up to the last moment, when suspicions concerning him were being flung around, he is entitled to a full inquiry into the matter. It may be that such an inquiry will justify to the utmost everything that has happened, so far as he is concerned. What will the covering up of the matter lead to ? It will mean that the reputation of honorable members of the Senate has been besmirched, and the Government will take no steps to afford them an opportunity for the fullest, fairest, and cleanest vindication of their honour. I hope that the Government will be well advised, and that, side by side with the proposed appeal to the electors, they will insist that this matter shall be probed to the very bottom. I read in a leading article in one of the newspapers this morning that I had made a statement which might be called in question. It is said that I remarked that there were several honorable senators &#34; in the bag.&#34; I did make the statement, and I had read the same thing in the press before I made it. I made the statement for a very good reason. I made it in demanding a pair for certain honorable senators who are unavoidably absent from the Senate. I desired that the public should know through me that those honorable senators were not &#34; in the bag,&#34; since they were willing to vote in the customary way, by pairing, against the proposed prolongation of the life of this Parliament. It is now evident that the life of this Parliament cannot be prolonged, and on that point &#39;we are all agreed and satisfied. So far as this Parliament is concerned, we are to go to the people, and while, perhaps, we might not have gone sooner with more advantage to ourselves, I venture to say that a few valuable months have been lost. When the Hughes Government lost their majority the situation might well have been left for the decision of the people by an appeal to them. We have gone on to such an extent that now the newly-formed Coalition Government are compelled to take action by the force of circumstances. </para>

            <para>- I really do not place much store in these things myself. If there is anything to complain of in party organization let us know it, for Parliament has much to be thankful for in that organization, because party organization makes parliamentary government possible. I venture to say that if every representative of the public acted of his own free will, on the spur of the moment, the difficulty in conducting the government of the country would amount to an impossibility - government would not be possible or practicable. I had a very brief experience as a Minister, but I can say, in regard to two of my colleagues, that on more than one occasion, the sturdy independence of our supporters nearly wrecked the Government. I repeat that if we had a system by which men came here with no determination to adhere to organization, parliamentary government would be impossible. I am not complaining of the solid system of the party opposite, side by side as it is with the organized solidarity of my own party. </para>

We have a Prime Minister openly charged &#39; in the Senate with attempted bribery, and we have had reported to us certain conversations with Ministers of the Crown, and the  President  of the Senate. I wish again to say that I do not associate the  President  of the Senate or Ministers of the Crown with any offers of bribery - I wish to be so clear and distinct in regard to this that nobody can misunderstand.

There is another point in regard to the suspicious circumstances of the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> and the charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson.</inline> Let us look at the analogy between the two cases. Before June, in the ordinary course, there had to be an appeal to the country on the part of one-half of the Senate.&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> had to appeal, accompanied by two sitting members on the opposite side -  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> both of whom are old in the public life of the country. It might seem to honorable senators opposite that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wat-</inline></para>

          <para>Bon had to go to the country accompanied by two  opponents,  he might be induced to join them, and, therefore, it would be wise to fetch persuasive pressure to beaT on him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> a Tasmanian senator, had to go to the country accompanied by Senators Bakhap and Keating. Here, again, those who desired the. support of some one on this side would say, &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> has to appeal with two men who enjoy the confidence of the people of the State, and we may induce him to come over to our side.&#34; The very action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> in resigning at the time&#39; he did not only lends colour to, but gives good grounds for the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> as absolutely true in every particular. I wish to place it on record that I absolutely believe every word <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> said, and. if I desired proof I have it in the- three separate statements of the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and the  President.  Of course, the  President  took the high ground that matters of confidence cannot be divulged. </para>

            <para>- Exactly ; and I do not mind the interruption. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> reminds me that the  President  said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson&#39;s</inline> statement waa incomplete and inaccurate.  I add that to my statement as constituting a correct interpretation of the President&#39;s remarks. But I  Bay  that his statement, linked up with the statement of the Minister for Defence, and read  in  conjunction with the statement of the Prime Minister, corroborates the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> in every particular. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE.</inline> - No, Each denies the essential point upon which the honorable senator bases his case. The Prime Minister absolutely denies that any mention was made of money to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> and that waa the only interview at which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> says that any reference was made to money. </para>

            <para>-  His  very retention of it will add to the reputation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> for honesty and innocence. Here is a man called to the private counsels of a political party who is made an offer. Let us put any honest man in his position - his mind wavering between two conflicting impulses, one to make clear what had been said, and the other to keep the confidence that had been reposed in him. Then a fortnight&#39; later something happens which causes him: to see that probably similar tactics have been successfully adopted elsewhere. The honest man at once says: &#34;The public of this country must be made aware of recent happenings.&#34; </para>

I invite honorable senators to read the reply of the Prime Minister upon the gravest charge with which he was ever confronted.  His  speech in answer to that charge was simply an abusive denial. From end to end it reeks with abuse of the party with which he was formerly associated. If ever there was a time when vindictiveness towards the party to which he had been a traitor should have been forgotten, that was the time. The Prime Minister did not answer the charge. </para>

That can still be done by the Government. An election will nob remove the charges, although we welcome an election. We welcome an appeal to our masters - the people - because we recognise that the time has come for that appeal. I have been uttering the same statement in this Senate for weeks. An appeal to the people by both Houses will give us settled government for I hope at least three years. As to the attempt to throw upon us the responsibility of having blocked the representation of the Commonwealth at the Imperial Conference, I do not forget that so far the Senate has not been taken into the confidence of the Government as to what was the invitation extended to Australia. I asked for the information, and was told by the Minister for Defence that one invitation was issued to the Prime Minister, but that Tie <inline font-style="italic">had</inline> no knowledge as to the nature of the other. We have no information whatever on that point. </para>

            <para>- Our tactics during the last three weeks will compare favorably with those of any Opposition in like circumstances. On questions essential to the government of the country  we have not interfered with the Government, but where the Government seem to have been smothering up their functions as a Government, and acting as a combination of parties in secret conclave, we have been demanding information for the public. It is for the Senate to say that, when we meet, the people&#39;s representatives shall be informed of what the Government is doing. </para>

            <para>- The Government Whip is one of the cutest men in the Senate in throwing out a challenge. He challenges you, and when you bowl him out, perhaps twenty minutes later, he has not the manhood to admit that he is wrong. The other day he stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> had voted more frequently for the Fisher Government than I had, and when I brought the records to prove he was wrong, the honorable senator, maintaining the reputation he has earned&#39; so well amongst those who know him, had&#39; not the manliness to stand up and admit his mistake. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator can twist and misrepresent figures, but unfortunately for him he is too well known in the Senate. I can go through the happenings of this brief session, and show that in matters essential to the good government of this country the Opposition have been generous to the Government. In matters affecting the rights of the Senate we have been firm and immovable, demanding, as is our right, a full knowledge of everything causing the Government to move in whatever direction they were acting. Our opposition to the delegation to Great Britain has, at any rate, this to recommend it, that it has been straightforward and outspoken. We believed that the delegates selected, not by Parliament or the people, but in the secret conclave of two parties who came together after many weeks of bargaining and huckstering, were not the men to represent Australia, in Great Britain. </para>

They invited to join them the men whom they had condemned in all the denunciatory terms they could think of, making us out to be unworthy to be even ordinary citizens of the community - the men whom they referred to as influenced by German gold. Without an apology for their slanders, they asked us to participate with them in the government of the country. Us, whom they had termed the associates of the Industrial Workers of the World, they invited .to take the highest offices in the Commonwealth. We might be bad, but the men who, believing that we were what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said we were, actually asked us to take the highest places in the land, were infinitely worse. </para>

            <para>- The outside management of our party is the same as it was when we were all united, and when we meet the people we shall willingly accept their verdict. We have always clamoured for government by the people, we have always demanded that the people should be allowed to know what the Government are doing. As I came by the newspaper offices I noticed an announcement that the War Conference had been postponed. Why.? I wonder whether Great Britain has heard how the majority was to be secured in order to allow the delegates to go from here? We have had a statement from the Government that the delegates would not go unless both Houses acquiesced, and now an appeal to the people is announced. I want to be quite sure that it will be so, because we are dealing with men in whose utterances we have no reason to place much confidence, unless they are so definite that there can be no backing away from them. Before the Senate expires, I hope that those responsible for the conduct of business and those in whose hands the honour of the Senate peculiarly rests will see that the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> which, if true, reflect on members of the Senate, and, if untrue, equally reflect upon the honorable senator making them, are investigated in such a way that the public will know how to weigh and value them, and how to give their verdict upon the happenings of the last few weeks. </para>

          <para>. - Happenings have been so dramatic that I had not the opportunity of answering the Leader of the Opposition on Friday, when he made a pointed request to me to provide a pair for my col league, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy. Senator Gardiner</inline> was speaking on the motion for adjournment, and, when he concluded, the motion &#34; that the Senate do now adjourn,&#34; was put, as it was then 4 o&#39;clock. I called &#34;No,&#34; but the honorable senator did not call for a division, and the sitting terminated. I desire now to state that I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> is genuinely ill. It is essential that that should be said to protect the honorable senator&#39;s position, because this is a time when all kinds of imputations are being made. There is no doubt whatever that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> hasundergone several severe and hazardous surgical operations. On the day before that on which he said he was going, into the hospital, I met him in Cameron-street, Launceston, and I had a conversation with him. It was not a private conversation. There was a third person present, a young soldier who had returned from Gallipoli, and whom I had known from his boyhood. The three of us walked down the street together, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> said to me, &#34; I would like to tell you that I am going into a hospital to-morrow.&#34; I said, &#34; I am sorry to hear it; what is the matter?&#34; He told me some of his symptoms. He told me that he had an enlargement of a certain gland - it frequently happens in . the case&#39; of elderly men - and that he would have to be operated upon. I am not a medical man, but I ventured an opinion which has since been confirmed. I mentioned that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Barron had been subject to a similar complaint, and had had to be operated on, and I expressed the hope that the honorable senator would come out of it all right. He then said, &#34;What about a pair?&#34; I said, &#34;I have no authority to grant pairs.&#34; At that time the formal alliance between the Liberal party and the Hughes party had not been effected. I continued, &#34;You. had better consult <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. What do you want a pair on ? &#34; He replied, &#34;I want a pair on all subjects.&#39;* I said, &#34; I would like to give you a pair, but I cannot give you a pair on all subjects. My opinions are not stereotyped j they are not of that kind. I might wish to vote on the same side as yourself. X advise you to consult <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie.&#34; The matter then passed, and we listened to the recitals of the young soldier about Gallipoli. All T wish to say is that, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> pointed across to me and demanded from me a pair for his colleague, he took it for granted - which he had no right whatever to do, seeing that the motion in regard to the prolongation of Parliament had not been before the Senate for discussion - that I was going to vote on the opposite side from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy,</inline> like a machine, and, therefore, that he had what might be called a friendly fraternal call on my vote because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> is associated with me in the representation of Tasmania. As honorable senators well know, I have a full conception of the fact that I am a legislative censor, in other words, a senator, and have the right, free from party, and free from every other tie, to cast my vote from time to time according to my own judgment, and I do not come here with packets of votes cut up like sticks of barley-sugar to be retailed out as occasion serves. I desire <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to understand that I am nob one of those men who are wise after the event. He is not to think that I am going to say what I intended to do if certain contingencies happened, and so on. I propose to make my position absolutely clear. Irrespective of party, I place my political relationships and my duty to my country in this order : Australia and the Empire first, the State of Tasmania second, my party third, and myself a fairly close-up fourth. In this chamber I put my State before party, and I say, in justice to my leader, the other Ministers, and every honorable senator on&#39; this side of the chamber, that not one of them had any definite assurance from me as to how far I was going to support them in a matter of the motion for the prolongation of the life of Parliament. Let me be frank. Before these dramatic developments I had intended to vote for the motion in a certain contingency. I am nob going back to Tasmania to say, &#34;No; I never intended to vote for the motion.&#34; That is not my style. I intended to vote for the motion, although I did not like it, not because it is intrinsically unsound, but because I think that a motion for the prolongation of the life of a Parliament ought to be adopted with a reasonable approximation to unanimity. That is why I strove for a union of three parties, and strove for a union of two parties when the union of three could not be obtained. All other British legislatures that have adopted schemes for prolonging the life of their respective Parliaments, in connexion with which similar motions have been submitted, have adopted prolongation with practical unanimity, as in the case of New Zealand and Canada, where there were  but a lew votes in opposition. I conceived that the virtue of this motion, although it was not intrinsically unsound, could not be considered to be very great if the delegation were to go away from the shores of Australia because of the motion being carried by a vote or two. I considered that the carrying of the motion would be somewhat of a futility if it could not be agreed to by a practically unanimous Legislature. Now, that was my attitude towards the motion itself, but I believed that it was not difficult to justify it in the present condition of the Empire&#39;s need; and I consider that the Labour party is entirely out of court when it speaks, and will speak, of a breach of our sacred Constitution being affected by its terms. They were prepared to breach Australia&#39;s Constitution for the ostensible purpose of saving &#163;80,000 ; in other words, 1,600,000 shillings, or about 4d. per head of the population of the Commonwealth. These are the gentlemen who regard our Constitution as sacrosanct. The Lord  giveth  and the Lord  taketh  away. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator does not appreciate this, but it is good medicine for him. The great Official Labour party of Australia, which holds up the Constitution as a sacred document, was prepared to breach it to save something like 4d. per head of the population. In a certain contingency I was prepared to take the responsibility of voting for the motion for the prolongation of the life of Parliament, whether it was carried or not, although I did not like it unless it could be carried by a fairly unanimous Legislature. What was that contingency? Surely I have already indicated it. A general election is not a good thing for Australia if the Army vote of nearly 300,000 of the prime manhood of the Commonwealth cannot be recorded. </para>

            <para>- I am my own mentor in these matters. Long before these dramatic happenings I asked a question iu regard to the desirability of communicating with the Imperial authorities and ascertaining if the Army vote could be properly polled in connexion with an election. If an Imperial communication had come along saying that within the next two or three months, when great military operations were contemplated, it would not be possible to record the votes of Australians in the field, I would,  whether  the motion was carried or not, have regarded it as so intrinsically sound that I would have voted for it, and the information has not yet come forward. It may be that the Imperial authorities will not provide, nor allow to be provided, facilities for recording, in connexion with the forthcoming election, the vote of 300,000 of the best men Australia has produced. That is surely a sufficient indication why reasonable men, no matter what their election prospects might have been, could have voted for the motion as it stands on the notice-paper. But certain things happened. I am not one of those who impute ignoble motives to anybody. My experience of human nature is that very often it is a great deal better than it is believed to be. We are, as Tennyson says, &#34; a piebald miscellany.&#34; We are patchy individuals, with good and bad intermingled, and very often the bad is not so bad as outsiders suppose it to be. Man is a very suspicious individual - no doubt because of the patchy nature of his own character - he is prone to impute wrong motives to other people, and to put an improper construction on very innocent positions. I condemn nobody, I accuse nobody, but I say that it was my intention to point out before voting that in the atmosphere of suspicion created since the Ready incident it would have been worse than useless to send the delegation home, because its status and prestige would have been materially impaired. We should have had bickerings continued in the Senate while the Imperial Conference was sitting, and when the delegation returned, bringing back the determinations of the Conference, those determinations, so far as they related to Australia&#39;s interests, would have been suspect. It was my intention, on my honour, to point this out to the Senate when the motion came forward for consideration, and honorable senators who know me will understand that when I state a thing there is a reasonable approximation to truth in it. I do not wear the white robe of impeccability at any time. I only ask people to accept me as an ordinary man, with ordinary proportions of good and bad. </para>

Seven years ago, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> knows, when ex-Senator Ready was elected contrary to his own anticipations, he was so overwrought that he fainted as he did the other day, and had to go to bed for several days. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> has sometimes been a somewhat unscrupulous opponent of mine, but it is due to him, as I say it is due to Senators Long and Guy, to state that I believe he was genuinely ill. </para>

            <para>- I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ready</inline> said he was sick, and I believe that, the real truth of the situation is that&#39; he wanted the Caucus to consider his position in regard to the conscription vote, and to agree to a reasonable lengthening of the life of Parliament until he had a chance of living down the opposition which his vote had aroused. He had always fought, strenuously, fanatically, and loyally for Labour and, because Caucus would not agree to that course, he became disgusted and decided to throw in his political marble. I know nothing more than that, but of a man whose reputation will be attacked for many months in this House, and against whom bitter things will be said, perhaps even after the elections, of a man who is my political foeman, I say that, knowing as much as I do about the facts of his fainting when he was victorious, I can well understand that he fainted when he came to the decision to leave political life. The rest is between himself and his conscience. In regard to yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I have been brought into close political relations with you. Until a few months ago you belonged to a party .that was opposed to me in domestic politics. I have met you many times, and I will not believe, on the unsupported statement of one man, that you said anything that was intrinsically wrong, beyond that you may have debated with a man his chances at the elections. That you, who have been admittedly  Such a fine and impartial President of the Senate, would do anything derogatory to the interests of Australia is something I will not believe. </para>

In regard to my leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> he ig not directly concerned with the allegations that have been bruited abroad, for most of the allegations relate to what transpired before the present Government came into office.- Having said this much, honorable senators will wonder, perhaps, why I had intended, in the circumstances that have transpired since the Ready incident, to vote against the motion on the notice-paper.

That was exactly the action which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> and I contemplated in the circumstances - no cowardly denunciation of the terms of the motion, and no wishing that it would not be carried.

            <para>- I am prepared to admit that a lot of wives could not have had abetter man. Honorable members, of course, know that I am referring to Caesar, who introduced a claim for divorce from his wife solely on the ground that at the ceremony of Bona Dea, which was entirely restricted to Roman women, a young man named Clodius had gained admission by dressing up in women&#39;s clothes. It was not alleged that anything untoward had transpired.- Caesar asked for divorce from his wife merely because of the fact that Clodius had gained admission to the ceremony, and because, as he declared, Caesar&#39;s wife must be above suspicion. Now, the Australian Senate must likewise be above suspicion. The events of the past few days have caused me some three or four sleepless nights, not because I believe that anything untoward has occurred, but because of the suspicion certain people attach to what has happened. I have to deal with the Tasmanian Administration. I am quite sure that the Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Elliot</inline> Lewis is a gentleman&#39; without reproach. 1 am satisfied, also, that the same can be said of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> B. Hayes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> Hays,, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee,</inline> the Premier, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Propsting,</inline> also the Honorable Tasman Shields. Do honorable senators mean to say that they would do anything wrong in securing the representation of Tasmania in this Senate? </para>

When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee</inline> was told of the vacancy, it was his duty, seeing that the State Parliament was not in session, to make the most speedy and complete arrangements for carrying out the Commonwealth Constitution, so far as concerns Tasmania&#39;s relationship to it. </para>

I voted for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the conduct of Tasmania&#39;s Chief Justice, a man who had been friendly and courteous to me since my boyhood. Why? Not only because I believed that he was completely innocent of the accusations being made against him, but because I had no doubt that in his position he would welcome an investigation. </para>

            <para>- Hold on; that has nothing to do with me at present. I sympathize with the Prime Minister. He has been in a very difficult position, but his troubles <inline font-style="italic">have</inline> largely been brought on by his own irresolution. Why did he not go to Great Britain, as I suggested he should have . done, as soon as he received the Imperial invitation ? Honorable senators are not going to be placed in the position of saying that I am wise after the event Do they not know that when I spoke on &#34;Wednesday last I was scrupulous in refraining from any allusion to the motion now on the notice-paper? Why? I had in view certain things which conditioned my acceptance or otherwise of the motion, namely, whether it was possible to poll the votes of Australia&#39;s armies in the field or not. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has been in a difficult position, but he should have gone to the Imperial Conference. I honour <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> for saying, with all his political antipathy for the time being to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> that he believes that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> should have been there. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had ample time to be at the Conference at the present moment, and even if I had been brought face to face with the possibility of voting against the motion, it would have been impossible for him to charge me with having been disloyal to his representation, because he has had ample time to go to England. He made a great mistake in not having gone. There would have been no talk &#39;about these conversations, almost undoubtedly wrong imputations, if he had gone. </para>

After all - and this is what I intended to say this morning when the motion came on for discussion - the best thing is to let the big jury decide the matter. Let each man go on as large a platform as possible, and before as big a concourse as he can get, and justify his action, if any imputations of wrong-doing have been cast upon him. </para>

            <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> is to have an opportunity in the Law Courts, that settles all difficulties. I need not further refer to the position of the Prime Minister in the matter. Let me conclude by saying that I communicated with people in Tasmania, and told them that in all probability I would have to take the responsibility of voting against the Government, that I took this action last Friday, that a telegram was sent on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mcwilliams, Senator Keating,</inline> and myself, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mcwilliams,</inline> that I have in my pocket the answer indicating that a telegram was sent, that my action in this Chamber and my vote would not have been conditioned by anything which has appeared in the press. If I kept silence on Friday it was because the forms of the Senate debarred me from replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> and I hope that he, who asked me for a pair for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy,</inline> will understand that it was impossible for me to pair myself with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> if I wanted to vote on the same side which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> intended to espouse. That is the situation. I welcome the election, because, when the atmosphere has been cleared, when the national gown has been put in the washing tub, the Prime Minister will, I hope, go to England with an added prestige, and the whole delegation will have a power and a force which it could not possess in the present circumstances. </para>

            <para>- That is his own business. I wish to make a suggestion. The Liberal party attaches very great importance, and properly so, to the representation of Australia at the Imperial Conference. For some time to come the business of the Conference is likely to be of a perfunctory, or preliminary, character. And that being so, to give dignity to Australia&#39;s position, I suggest that the man who proclaimed, on behalf of Australia, in the face of the world, the policy of &#34;the last man and the last shilling&#34; should be appointed to temporarily represent the Commonwealth. Nobody impugns his loyalty. He has been Prime Minister of this country, and, in order to satisfy all sections of opinion, if the Labour party is wise it will consent to the Right Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, who has been Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, and also High Commissioner, being associated with the Right Honorable Andrew Fisher in the temporary representation of the Commonwealth until the present political atmosphere has been cleared. </para>

I wish now to refer to my old friend and very able political opponent, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle.</inline> I escorted him into this Chamber the other day, and was very pained to notice that this gentleman, who has come, in pursuance of the operations of the Constitution, as one of Tasmania&#39;s senators to this Chamber, was received, not with courtesy and decorum, but with unseemly interjections. I think that I owe an apology for doing on the moment what I suppose was never done before, and that is protesting to you, sir, while what should have been a dignified ceremony was taking place. </para>

            <para>- I have always been opposed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> and our temporary association, perhaps to be , severed when the war is over, is solely because of our belief in one cardinal factor necessary to properly expedite Australia&#39;s assistance to the Mother Country and her duty to the Empire. He is an arch-conscriptionist, as I am. That is the sole bond of political relationship between us. This gentleman, who has often escorted me to my home after an adjournment of the Tasmanian Parliament, was surely worthy of my escort on first entering this Chamber as a representative of my State. The thing had no political significance. This old friend, this old mate, who has run against me in races and who has been engaged with me in prospecting, surely had a right to expect so much courtesy from me. While apologizing to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and to the Senate, for having broken in with an interjection upon his taking of the oath of allegiance, I plead, in excuse, that I was provoked by the unseemly interjections of honorable senators opposite. However, the die is cast, and the political situation is to be relegated to the people. I hope, therefore, that without delay both sides will do what is necessary to provide for the holding of the elections. In no spirit of disloyalty to my leaders, but because I place State before party, without imputing ignoble motives to any one, without accepting as true charges more or less vaguely laid at the door of certain members, I had made up my mind, as I have shown, to vote against the motion of the Government for the extension of the life of the Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has accepted this statement, and my explanation that, having determined to vote in that way, I could not give a pair to my sick colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy.</inline></para>

          <para>.- I received the announcement of the Vice-President of the Executive Council with mixed feelings, though personally I was very pleased with it, because my short association with the Senate has nob been as agreeable as I should have liked it to be.- I feel that the sooner the people of Australia settle the differences between the two political parties in the Commonwealth the better, though I realize that without the prolongation of the life of the Parliament Australia cannot be directly represented by her public men at- one of the most important conferences ever held in the history of the world. I wish to refer briefly to my appointment as a senator, as erroneous ideas regarding it are floating about. Some honorable senators seem under the impression that a political plot has been hatching for some considerable time, and that I have been a party to a conspiracy. I shall leave the Prime Minister, ex-Senator Ready, and any one else who may be under the suspicion of honorable senators, to defend themselves. If there has been a plot or a conspiracy I know nothing of it. I came to Melbourne, and not even honorable senators opposite could have been more surprised than I was when informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> if he had not resigned, was about to resign his seat in the Senate. </para>

            <para>- On Thursday morning. But I do not intend to submit to the cross-examination of honorable senators opposite. If there is to be an inquiry, I shall be prepared to state in detail everything that happened. At present I am making .a mere general statement. Having received the information that a senator was about to resign, and, subsequently, the information that he had resigned, together with the offer of the vacant seat if I would resign my position in the Tasmanian Parliament, I resigned, and, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, was nominated to a seat in this Chamber. I am not here bound to any party. I do not belong to the Liberal party, nor am I with those honorable senators on the other side of the chamber who have constituted themselves a party. I do not think that the Senate should be a party House. Should it become a party House, it must be either a House of obstruction or a mere reflex of the other Chamber, and a useless appendage of it. When a political party has a majority in both branches of the Legislature, and questions are submitted to its members assembled in Caucus, its programme is decided before its presentation to Parliament, and the carrying of it is practically certain. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">When under such circumstances measures have been presented to and passed through the other Chamber, what good purpose is served by presenting them to and passing them through this Chamber? Such a procedure results only in the useless expenditure of public money and the waste of public time. On the other hand, if one party has a majority in the other branch of the Legislature, and the opposing party has a majority in this Chamber, the inevitable result is that what is passed by the other branch of the Legislature is opposed and obstructed in this. In the circumstances, I say that if the Senate is to continue to be a party Chamber, the sooner it is abolished, and the expenditure involved iu its maintenance is saved to Australia, the better. As a representative of one of the smaller States, I fully recognise the value of the Senate. In the Legislature of the Commonwealth, the smaller States have equal representation with the larger. I am nob going to defend that from the democratic point of view. I do not defend the principle that New South Wales is entitled only to the same representation in this Chamber as is Tasmania; but I say that we have that principle in operation under the Constitution, and it would be disastrous to Tasmania, and &#39;the smaller States, were we to lose it. I am not going to advocate here, or from the public platform, the abolition of the Senate, but I shall advocate that it should be a non-party Chamber. </para>

            <para>- I am aware of that; and I know that, on that account, it has always been wrong. I know <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> association with it, and he knows my views, and that I recognise that it is wrong that the Senate should be a party Chamber. The present position is undoubtedly the most serious that I have ever had the opportunity to participate in. I want to declare my position here during the next month or two, and my position should the electors send me back at the next election. So far as I am personally concerned, everything that the Constitution will permit to be done, which I consider will assist Australia in any way to increase its pressure, even by one ounce, on the side of the Allies to bring about the speedy termination of the war will receive my support. It is useless for honorable senators to be fighting here over party matters while in France to-day our men are dying in defence of our Empire, and while the security and integrity of that Empire are in the balance. It is of no use for honorable senators to lose sight of that fact. I have listened to honorable senators, by interjections, conducting the most fierce party struggle across the floor of this chamber. They seem to me to be absolutely oblivious of the fact that at the present moment in Europe the very question of whether this Parliament shall continue to exist or not is absolutely being tested, and is in the balance. Their conduct has reminded me of the story of the couple who were quarrelling in an upstairs room as to how certain pictures should be hung upon the wall whilst the house was on fire in the basement. For goodness&#39; sake let us understand that it is the duty of every honorable member of the Senate, and of every honorable member of the other branch of this Legislature, as well as of every public man throughout Australia, to first extinguish the fire that is threatening to consume our whole nation, and then, and not until then, talk about the way we are going to hang the pictures. </para>

I repeat that I do not understand why an honorable and sensitive man, after being pressed consecutively by three men to do something which his conscience told him was wrong, did not there and then repudiate and hurl back upon those men the insults which they were placing upon him. According to the honorable senator&#39;s statement, he was first approached by you, sir; then following up your conversation with him the representative of the Government in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> makes further overtures to him. Having been insulted by both these honorable senators, he then goes to the Prime Minister to be further insulted by him. It seems to me so ridiculous that this young gentleman, so unsophisticated and innocent, should be walking about the victim of these ghouls, who were following him up to seduce him into evil doings. </para>

Apart from some bitter words which the right honorable gentleman used during the conscription campaign, there is not one instance in which the Opposition can convict him of one act which they consider discreditable. Yet it would appear from the interjections and speeches of honorable senators opposite that they are perfectly willing that Australia should be represented at the Imperial War Conference provided that the representative is not the Right Honorable William Morris Hughes. </para>

I wish to direct attention to the career of this man in Australian politics. It is well known that he came into public life about 1894; and so satisfactory was his representation of the people who elected him on that occasion, that, from then until the present time, he has never had to contest a pre-election. So able and so satisfactory, so loyal, has he been to those who elected him, that no man has ever thought it possible to obtain a pre-election in the organization to which he belongs, so as to supplant him in that electorate. On the last occasion, the present Prime Minister contested a seat for another branch of the Legislature under the leadership of the Right Honorable Andrew Fisher. A manifesto was published by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> with the concurrence of his party, and signed by the secretary of the party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. David</inline> Watkins, setting forth to the people of Australia that they could, without any fear or hesitation, and with all confidence, vote for the Labour party, because the first plank of that party&#39;s policy would be the complete and efficient prosecution of the present war. </para>

            <para>- We all have had to modify our opinions concerning conscription - there is no question about that. There are a number of men strongly opposed to conscription for compulsory military service, their objections being born of their experience - theoretical, of course - of conscription in the nations with which we are fighting. But we have had to realize that, in order to have equitable distribution of&#39; sacrifice - of the sacrifice which must be made by the nation - it is necessary that there should be some system of compulsory service if Australia is to do her part in this war.&#39; </para>

            <para>- What I desire is a system of_compulsion. I do not wish to have the responsibility left on my shoulders, or on the shoulders of the honorable senator, of saying when he or I have to go. I desire a system under which he and I will have to go when our turn comes. Wherever that sentiment as to &#34; the last man and the last shilling &#34; was uttered, it was cheered to the echo throughout the length and breadth of Australia. On one occasion - the first anniversary, I think, of the war, before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> went to England - I used the expression in Hobart, and it was cheered by thousands of people in- the streets of that city. The present Prime Minister, as we know, went to London to discuss the situation with the statesmen of the Empire. Here, in passing, I should like to say that no man in the British Empire has roused the people to the same standard of enthusiasm and of patriotic loyalty as did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Morris Hughes ; and we were all  proud of his work. Honorable senators opposite, who are now so embittered against him, were also proud of the work done by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in the Old Country. </para>

            <para>- I am referring to a dinner in the Queen&#39;s Hall. When the Prime Minister, as the guest of the evening, rose to respond, the guests, including honorable senators opposite, rose in their* seats, and,  waving their serviettes, made a great demonstration of their approbation and admiration of the honorable gentleman. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> after the fullest discussion with the responsible men of the Empire who are conducting this&#39; war, came to the conclusion that, if Australia had to honour the pledge given to the Old Country, some system of compulsory service must be enacted. Honorable senators know what passed and of the referendum that ensued. What crime has <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> committed to justify the unfailing bitterness shown towards him now ? It is true, I admit, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> in prosecuting his campaign, made statements which might well be resented by honorable senators holding different opinions. But was there anything in that to so embitter them against the honorable gentleman as to make them go to the length to which the past day or two has shown they are prepared to go in order to prevent him representing Australia at the forthcoming Imperial Conference? It appears to me that they want to bludgeon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> but object to him hitting back. They remind me very much of a child I saw on one occasion crying bitterly on the kerbstone, while a little boy was standing on the other side of the street. I went up to her and asked her why she was crying. Between her sobs, she explained to me that &#39; &#39; Willie would not allow her to hit him with a stick she held in her hand.&#34; That is the position of .honorable senators opposite. If the Prime Minster would permit them to belabour him with their sticks and with their bludgeon of misrepresentation- - </para>

            <para>- I do hope that honorable senators will take a wider view of their responsibilities. We must remember that we in Australia have liberties and opportunities which no other people of the world possess to-day. We must recollect that- we are part and parcel of the British Empire, and that we owe our liberties and opportunities to the protection of that Empire. We must recognise that more than 280,000 of our men have gone forth to battle for the maintenance of the privileges which we are enjoying, and that many of them have given their lives on Gallipoli and in France in their effort to uphold them. We must realize that the British Empire to-day is in the death-grip of a relentless and remorseless foe, and that it is our duty to the Empire, and to those who are fighting for us, to take a more national view of things than some honorable senators have exhibited. We must discontinue the party bickering which has been proceeding in this Parliament for months past. I have seen a demonstration of it. Although I have had many hard party fights during my career, I have never seen anything like the bitterness that has been exhibited during the past two or three days that I have been a member of the Senate. I do appeal to honorable senators to take a more national view of their duties. </para>

            <para>- I - I confess that we, on this side of the Senate, are doubly indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> in that respect. It is undoubtedly to their credit, and to the credit of the State from which they come, that they have endeavoured to redeem the position created by the fact that two of their colleagues are on the sick list at the present time. Had they taken any other course, it would have been an act of treachery towards two of their co-representatives who are incapacitated. I wish to rebut the statements that have been made in connexion with my charges in the Senate concerning what took place between the  President,  the Minister for Defence, the Prime Minister, and myself. At the outset, let me say that the remarks of the  President  were concise, and that he practically maintained an ominous silence that was, perhaps, more suggestive than words. The statement as made by the  President  was that he was always under the impression, and he hoped it would always be so, that everything said within the privacy of his own room or home was sacred and confidential. </para>

            <para>- In that I join issue with the  President.  As to the sacredness of friendship, I entered the President&#39;s room as a friend, and I left it as such. I had not the slightest conception that anything said to me by him was with a view of trying to create a position for political purposes. Such a thought did not at that time dawn upon me. The conversation was of a friendly character, and, so far as the  President  was concerned, assumed the tone of a man who sought to advise a younger member of the Senate, whose future practically depended upon what position he took up in respect to the question of the prolongation of Parliament. I believed in the sincerity of the  President,  whom I have learned to respect since I entered this chamber. He has been most solicitous in seeking to win the approbation and the goodwill of senators, according to my judgment, and I never for one moment questioned his fidelity. Anything that he said to me, therefore, was, as far as I could see, purely in a spirit of deep friendship.. After the charges that were made last Friday morning - during the adjournment for luncheon - the  President  met me as I was leaving the dining hall, and asked me to speak with him a moment. We at once sat down, and he told me deliberately that it was not to be regarded as a private interview; that I was at full liberty to make use of anything he might say. He said that I had not done him justice in the statement I had made. I asked, &#34; In what way?&#34; He stated that what he had said to me was not in the way of asking or suggesting that I should vote for the Government; that he had offered me no personal inducement; and that he was most particular in emphasizing that fact. I at once agreed with the  President  that every word that he said in that regard was perfectly true, and I told him that I was prepared to make that acknowledgment on the floor of the Senate. But I also cited to him the fact that during that conversation he had stated that, should the members of my party turn me down as the result of my voting for the prolongation of Parliament, and should I choose to run as an independent Labour candidate, he thought he could manage to get the other side to withdraw any opposition to that candidature. I said I could not think of such a thing. I did not lose my temper. I did not become angry, because I still thought that there was only one purpose in his mind, and that that was to preserve me from what he thought would be my downfall. </para>

            <para>- It did not. Since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has raised that question, may I say that I rose in my place on Thursday night to make my statement on the motion for the adjournment. Unfortunately, the Standing Orders were against me, and T was not permitted to go on. Had I been allowed on Thursday night to make my statement immediately after the  President  had given notice of the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> it would have been extempore. I had made no notes; I had made no preparation. But the paper which I read in the Senate on Friday was prepared in order that I might have everything concise, because I knew the character of some of the men I had to face on the opposite benches. I knew what disturbing elements there were to face, and I was determined to have everything in black and white, so that I could not be sidetracked in the recital of my statement. When I look at some honorable senators opposite, and particularly at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> I thank God it has been my privilege for over twenty years to warn men to flee from the wrath to come. I am quite satisfied that if I had to live in eternity with such a man it would be hell, and more than hell, to me. My statement was prepared only after my attempt to address the Senate on Thursday night, and to then put before honorable senators the facts that I read on Friday morning. As a matter of fact, I was three minutes late in entering the chamber on Friday. The last stroke of the typewriter was placed upon that paper just as the clock turned 11 a.m. I was most anxious to complete the statement in order that I might enter the chamber, so that if there was any omission from it - if there was anything that I failed to state - it was due to the fact that I did not pretend that it was a complete statement of everything that transpired. I do not claim to have a photographic memory, I do not claim to be other than an ordinary man, and many things said during a conversation will occur to one months after their utterance. Something will come to your memory, that did not previously occur to you, and, as a result of that, you may have something very important to disclose. I have endeavoured to give an account of everything that was said, so that I might complete my statement. My reference to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> waa not with a view of indicting you of an offence, nor was my reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made with that object in view. The purpose I had was to give a collected statement regarding the circumstances which had led up to the present crisis; and I endeavoured to do it as humbly and as correctly as I possibly could. When I heard of the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> our party had a meeting that same evening, and I went to the meeting and told them just what I knew concerning this matter. It took me twenty minutes to tell that story. I could just as easily have come here, and, in a twenty-minutes address, recited verbatim what I had just previously told my comrades. </para>

            <para>- The members of the party who heard that statement at the party meeting were just as much taken by surprise as were the members of the Senate. Except the few friends that I had taken into my confidence, not one member of that party&#39; meeting had the slightest conception of what was going to take place. There was no talk about &#34;being in the bag&#34; ; it was not a question of &#34;being in the bag,&#34; but a question of something coming out of &#34; the bag.&#34; When I made that statement to the meeting, I did it with the same feeling of regret as animated me in my attitude in this chamber. I am not the kind of man that seeks to create strife, or to dismember any section of the community by reiterating gossip. I have been a lover of peace, a man seeking to serve and consolidate the best interests of the community, during the whole course of my life. </para>

            <para>- I can see the sparks flying from the honorable senator already. I had previously told my own colleagues who are with me on this side of the chamber exactly what took place. I had my first conversation, I think, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> and told him how matters stood in regard to certain conversations I had with the  President,  and also what had taken place between myself and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> When I had to go to see the Prime Minister, I called <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> out of the Senate club-room, and told him I had been asked to see the Prime Minister, and that I was going there now. When I returned, I called him out again, and we went and talked in a room concerning what had taken place, and I detailed to him just what I have told the Senate. We recognised the seriousness of the position, and saw exactly the difficulties of making a statement on a matter of that kind in the Senate, having no evidence and no proof, and having to face a man of the calibre of William Morris Hughes, one of the trickiest lawyers that we have in the </para>

        <para class="block">Commonwealth. We recognised that it would indeed be a most difficult and trying ordeal for any man to undergo. We saw that my word would bie discounted, while his would probably be accepted. I had also to regard the fact that no one was injured by the interviews I had had up to that point, and there was only one man affected - myself. What was said to me had no influence on me, and did not tempt me in any degree. It could not tempt me, because I am not built that way. I have a conscience, and that to me is of more consideration than any emoluments that can come to me in public or . private life. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> professes to have known me for twenty-five years. I should like to correct the honorable gentleman, as I was introduced to him only during the general elections of 1910. He certainly knew members of my family, and I heard him speaking in the public parks of Newcastle twenty-five years ago, but I had no acquaintance with him at that time.  His  ultra-socialistic views did not suit my line of thought, and. I certainly have never subscribed to the opinions that he held in those days. Had he continued on that course I could no more have followed him than I can follow him now. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> does not question what I have stated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in his speech says - </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson&#39;s</inline>account of the events leading up to the interview he had with the Prime Minister, and as to the telegrams, is perfectly accurate, except in one significant detail. That bears on what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> said to me in the Senate, to which I will refer later. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> and myself had an interview on these benches, I told him that, as one of the managers of our party, I knew what policy had been agreed to as the policy of the Coalition Government, if it was formed, and that, speaking to him as a Labour man, I could assure him that there was nothing in that policy that he, as a Labour man, could not support. </para>

            <para>- It was an accident that the honorable senator was born. As I have just said, my election to the presidency of the Miners&#39; Federation was won without my having to go upon any platform, or ask a single man to vote for me, and was gained by a majority of 275 votes over one who had held the position for five years. When I again contested the election, twelve months later, I scored a majority of 1,525. Afterwards I was never opposed, and I could have remained in that presidency as long as I chose to serve the organization, but I considered that I was honouring its members, as well as the manhood of this country at large, by seeking to serve in these halls, and to do here what I could on behalf of the working classes. If it be an accident to come through all these gates into the highest position that a man can occupy in the Commonwealth, that of receiving the confidence of the people of the State to which he belongs, then I confess to that accident, but it is one of which I am proud . It has crowned my life, and made me feel that I can stand in equality with those men who interject with such frequency from the other side of the chamber. I utterly repudiate the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> that I gave them any groundwork for believing that I was with them, and that I was acting hypocritically towards the party to which I belong. Since the recruiting campaign began I have been going from place to place advocating recruiting, and I have not ceased appealing to the manhood of this country to fight our bitter and unrelenting foe; but I have done so without in any way advocating that the manhood of the Commonwealth should be conscripted. I concur with the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> made twelve months ago, that if the men of our country were not prepared to come forward, the country was rotten to the core, and not worth fighting for. I hold that our principles are worth standing for, and that our country is worth fighting for ; our institutions are worth a struggle to maintain, and I can give no better evidence than the fact that all that I can give have gone into the firing line to fight, and, if need be, lose their lives in defending their home and their country. But I am here to defend my honour. That which was told to me in the secrecy of the President&#39;s room, or by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> upon these benches, or whispered in the Premier&#39;s room, under lock and key, with the secretary expelled, lest he should hear what was being said, I cannot regard as being words upon which I should maintain secrecy, or upon which I should respect any confidence. I could not maintain my manhood and look my fellows in the face if, as a result of that privacy and confidence, I withheld from the country </para>

            <para>- If charity had  to  be extended to the likes of the honorable senator, I should wish to be relieved  of  any obligation along those lines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> knew well that if illness had overtaken&#34; him he could have secured a pair, particularly as he was Whip. Surely there is no man so dead to feeling but would have, if approached by a sick man, whose heart was affected, and who was in the condition of health of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> on Thursday last, willingly granted him a pair. In any case, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> need not have asked leave of the Senate for a considerable time. He could have remained absent right up to the date  of  the elections without asking for leave. But he did not do this. On the other hand, when a crisis arose, and a position to which he was opposed had to be determined, his resignation was suddenly handed in, and on the next day his successor walked into this chamber - a &#34;ready-made earl.&#34; For the first time an earl graces the sacred precincts  of  this chamber. No doubt some of my friends opposite would be pleased if all who came to this Chamber were earls and dukes. When Federation was being advocated the question of a peerage in this Chamber was raised, but Democracy obtained the supremacy, and in this House, which represents the interests  of  the States, we have the representation  of  the Democracy of the Commonwealth&#39;, though it has been misplaced so far as some honorable senators are concerned. However, that question will be determined at the elections within the coming months. I wish also to make reference to a statement made by a knighted gentleman in another place, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, and repeated in this Chamber by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> that I allowed fourteen days  to  pass without making the matter known. But no one knows better than the constitutional lawyer of Australia that, had I dared to stand up here and breathe such a sentiment, I would have been hounded down from one end of the country to the  other, and would not have been able to stand on any public platform after having assailed a man who occupied such an exalted position, and who was about to embark on a voyage to represent the Commonwealth at the seat of the Empire. May I be pardoned for saying that I yield to no man in the desire to see this country represented at the Imperial Conference, but I question the delegation that we are sending. It is not a true reflex of the views of the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- In his first address in this Chamber <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> made reference to the fact that I allowed two insults to be offered to me before I accepted the third, that in the first instance I received an insult from the  President,  and took it calmly without the slightest remonstrance or indignation, that I again went to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and allowed the insult to be repeated, and that I went to Newcastle, and on my return went hunting for the Prime Minister in order to be insulted again. That sounds nice in the public ear, but I wish to place before the people exactly what occurred. When the  President  asked me to meet him in his room, and he spoke to me as a friend, I accepted with grace everything he said. I did not agree with him, but it is not my wont or temperament to enter into a dispute with any man who calls me into conversation. I have never been of that controversial order; and unless I feel that <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> have a subject on which I can speak, I am practically a silent man in conversation, as most of my friends who know me well will admit. Perhaps that accounts largely for my remaining silent in public life as much as I do. I am prepared to speak whenever the occasion demands, but I am not a man hunting for notoriety. It must come to me without that self-seeking which characterizes some honorable senators. </para>

            <para>- I did nothing of the kind. I connected him with the story only because I could not leave him out. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> spoke to me on this matter it was in the most casual way. I had received that afternoon a letter concerning a woman who was seeking an allowance from a man at the front. He had married her while he was in camp, and had not arranged to transfer the allowance from his mother to. his wife. There had been previous correspondence on the subject. The woman concerned is <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Ball.</inline> I mention the name so that the Minister may have an opportunity of verifying my statement. I had received certain testimonials as to the woman&#39;s character, and proof that she was <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> the wife of this soldier. The allowance to the man&#39;s mother has since been cancelled, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Ball</inline> is now in receipt of the money to which she is entitled. I was anxious that the Minister should receive the documents, and having to catch a train within half-an-hour, I walked across to him and asked him to receive the letters. A conversation resulted, during which I commiserated with him on account of the load of care and business which he had upon his shoulders in the performance of his work. I have been on terms of the most intimate friendship with both you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> ever since I became a member of the Senate. I admit that the temperament of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is, as was stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> of a nervous kind, something like my own, and when two nervous men get together they sometimes find it hard to commence a conversation. It takes a man like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to conduct a conversation that does not affect anybody&#39;s nerves. </para>

            <para>- There is not much morality in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch. Senator Pearce</inline> turned from the observation I had made to him, and asked me how I would fare at the election. I said that I did not know. He said, &#34;I do not think you have a million-to-one chance of winning.&#34; Then he recited to me the programme of the National party, which has since been disclosed, and said that there was nothing in it to which a Labour man could not subscribe. I listened to  what the Minister had to say with the utmost deference, as I would listen to any man who was speaking to me in the manner and sense in which he was speaking. He was not speaking to me other than as a friend, and I accepted all he had to say, notwithstanding that I did not agree with it, without controversy or response. That I asked him not to reveal anything that I had said to him I flatly deny as being a gross misrepresentation of the truth. I said nothing to him that I could ask him to keep secret, and I positively assert that nothing I said to the  President  or the Minister for Defence affecting the interests of the country, the public life of the Commonwealth, or my own public career, would in any way embarrass me or place me in an ignominious position if disclosed to the people. I make that statement knowing that I have to face a higher tribunal than that with which I was threatened by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> He told me that the law courts are awaiting my statement. I neither fear the frown nor court the smile of any man. If I have said or done any wrong that would commit me to punishment, and&#39; cause me to endure any privations, let me suffer the just penalties of the law. But I stand not in fear of the law. I repudiate the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that I asked him to conceal something I was alleged to have said, and which would reflect on my honour and integrity. The Prime Minister has stated that having known me and my predilections he had advised me for my own good. I can only repeat that I do not thank these gentlemen for their kind solicitations on my behalf, because it is quite evident that they aimed at one point for me and two for themselves - that they were asking me to do something that would have shattered and blighted my whole career; that would have made me regarded as a contemptible cur amongst my fellows, and a traitor to the party to which I belong. I have previously stated that when the hour arrives that I can no longer follow the party to which I belong I will act honorably, hand back the trust my constituents have reposed in me, and surrender the position I hold at their hands. That hour has not yet arrived, and I trust it never will. I was cradled in unionism; I was reared in the ranks of the toiling &#39;masses. Knowing the struggles and trials of the poor I give place to no man in my sympathy for them, and my efforts will ever be directed in their behalf. The mandate of the people shall, be to me as a command, and if I am not prepared to carry out those principles in this Chamber, then let me walk out and become again the plebian I was before I was elected. </para>

            <para>- If it were not for the bonds of law that would not only suck the life&#39;s blood out of me, but out of the men I am here to represent, I would willingly stand upon any platform in this country, and give utterance to every word that I have said here. This is the only protection that can be afforded to me, but I challenge the Government, if they want my sworn testimony, to appoint the Royal Commission which has been asked for by the Leader of the Opposition. They will then give to the people of this country the  right to have my statement, sworn on oath, upon the annals of the Commonwealth. I swear by heaven and earth that my words are true. I have never sought to injure any fellow-being since I knew what reason was. It has always been my endeavour to shield a weaker brother, and to encourage those who were down. No one feels more keenly than I do this great crisis which has come into my life. I am a man who has never sought publicity or notoriety; and I tell honorable senators that no greater trial could have come into my life than that which is upon me to-day, owing to the uncertainty of the fate of two brave lads of mine who are fighting in the trenches at the present time. No time in my life could have been more inopportune for such a burden of responsibility as that which now falls upon me. Knowledge of the truth of what I say, and the consciousness of having done that which is right in the sight of God and man, alone support me in this tragic hour of my life. I am conscious, however, that right will triumph, and that nothing that my enemies or opponents can do to me will injure me in the slightest degree. I feel that, being in the right, I shall be able to surmount the difficulties which beset me at the present time, and prove to the world that the good name which I have maintained for over thirty years in the Newcastle district, lives throughout the Commonwealth, and that I shall be able to hand down to my children that unsullied character which I have borne since the days of their infancy, when they were dependent upon me. I have nothing further to add, except to re-affirm all that I have said. I defy those who are opposed to me to damn my reputation in the eyes of the people of this country. I have nothing to fear. I have spoken truly as an honest man, wishing to do right in the sight of all men. </para>

          <para>. - I did not propose to take any part in the debate but for the very pointed references to myself made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson;</inline> and I think it is due to the Senate that I should make a personal explanation with regard to the matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> said just now that I met him during the luncheon hour on Friday, and had a conversation with him, and that I prefaced my remarks by saying, &#34; This is not a private conversation.&#34; That is quite true. I took that precaution. In the course of our conversation, I asked him why, when he was telling his story in the Senate, he did not tell the whole truth with regard to myself. I asked him, &#34;Do you not remember my saying to you, and especially impressing upon you, that I did not ask or suggest to you that you should ever vote for the Government or support the Government except on this one question which concerned yourself?&#34; He said, &#34;Yes; I remember that perfectly.&#34; </para>

My room has been free to every honorable member of the Senate to come in and talk over the political situation, as they frequently have done, every man of them, on both sides of the chamber. Senators belonging to the Official Labour party, senators belonging to the Hughes Labour party, and senators belonging to the Liberal party, have come in there and freely and safely discussed every aspect and phase of the political situation; and I hope that, so far as I am concerned, no whisper of suspicion will attach to anything which has ever occurred there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> himself has admitted here that I impressed upon him that I did not want to influence him in any way, that I did not ask him to leave hh party, that I did not ask him either to vote for the Government or to support them, and that all I did was to say, &#34; your own interests you might be well advised to vote for a prolongation of thu life of Parliament.&#34; I have said that to other honorable senators. I have a perfect right to discuss every point of the political situation with any honorable senator. When anybody imputes anything improper to me, I have a perfect right to resent the imputation, and I do resent it. </para>

            <para>- I believe that there will be a few more gaps to be filled. It is significant that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> after full consideration, made a statement containing gaps which he could fill only after you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and myself had reminded him of them. It does not need much effort of the imagination to discover how he came to make his original statement. Honorable senators opposite have tried to connect it with the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ready.-</inline> They may fool those who have not been members of the Labour Caucus, but they cannot in that way fool those of us who have been. Early last week, and prior to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson, Senator Gardiner,</inline> the Leader of the Official Labour party in this House, said that rumours were freely circulating to the effect that there were honorable senators on his side who were &#34; in the bag.&#34; Is it probable, after such a statement, that there would not be an inquiry by the party as to who was likely to be &#34;in the bag&#34;? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> said to-day that there was a meeting of his party last Thursday night. For what purpose ? To discover who was &#39; &#39; in the bag.&#34; The statement that he made on Friday is, no doubt, the statement that he made at the meeting on Thursday night, to establish his innocence. He was suspect. No doubt the party said to him, &#34; The only way in which you can clear yourself is to repeat that statement in the Senate to-morrow.&#34; The statement was reduced to writing, and, by means of it, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> saved himself from being compelled to&#39; walk the plank. It was the result of the application of the third degree to him at the meeting of his party on Thursday night. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> according to himself, is a man of high honour, of the noblest sentiments, and oT keen and alert conscience. Is it conceivable that a man of that type, having been offered a bribe, could keep silence concerning the matter for nearly a fortnight, especially if that bribe had been offered to him by the Prime Minister of Australia - the Leader of the party to which he says he was absolutely opposed ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> knew that he had only to prove the statement to blast for ever the reputation of the Prime Minister, and, by bringing him down, to bring down his Government. He knew, moreover, that it was his duty, as a member of this Parliament, to at once make the facts known. Yet this man of high motives, <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> keen honour, and fine conscience, could sleep contentedly for a fortnight without making the matter known.- It was only after the third degree had been applied to him by the Caucus that he summoned up courage to do his duty in the matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> has not explained the lapse of time to which I refer. He has not told us why it did not occur to him to make the statement till after the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ready.</inline> It is to be assumed that, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ready</inline> had not resigned, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> would have carried his awful secret in silence for ever. The Prime Minister - this corrupt individual who tried to bribe that high-souled  individual opposite - would have gone to Great Britain as a representative of Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> would have said nothing. Does the honorable senator expect us to believe that, or does he think that the country will believe it? If so, he thinks that we are all very simple. He objects to the criticism that he deliberately placed himself in the way of temptation. But, on his own showing, he must have regarded you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> the Prime Minister, and myself as suspect so far as our moral intentions were concerned. Does his tender conscience prompt the honorable senator to avoid us? Not at all. On the contrary, he seeks us. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator came to me to talk about Defence matters.  His  statement to-day on this point is quite correct. On the occasion referred to we did talk over the case which the honorable senator has mentioned. Then I proceeded to talk over this other matter, on which I had previously conversed with the honorable senator, not once, but two or three times. When I again, on this occasion, broached the subject, did this gentleman with the high sense of honour and the tender conscience rush away from me as from a person of evil disposition ? Did he say to me, &#34; I must leave you; you will contaminate me&#34;? Did the honorable senator rush across to the other side of the chamber to escape my evil influence? No, he remained and discussed the question with me. When, as a result of that conversation, I formed the opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> wanted to come with us, I sent him the telegram which has been referred to in order that he might meet the Prime </para>

Not only did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> go willingly to see the Prime Minister, but he went after consultation. He tells us to-day that he asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> to come into a room, and that by themselves they talked the matter over. </para>

            <para>- I accept the honorable senator&#39;s statement. He informed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> that he had been sent for, no doubt in doing so telling the honorable senator why he had been sent for. Then he goes to the Prime Minister, the arch-tempter of all ! <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> the unsuspecting, the innocent, this virgin of honour, goes to place himself in the awful presence of the arch-tempter of all ! Having had this great temptation placed before him, the honorable senator comes back. Does he reject the temptation ? Does he announce to the world that he has been tempted, and denounce the tempter? Not at all. In the secret recess of some room in Parliament House he discusses the question with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline> Then, honorable senators should bear in mind that nothing happened even after that conference with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline> Time goes by, and it is not until the third degree has been applied to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> by the Caucus that he comes down here and makes his statement. When, after all this, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> comes before us and speaks about his conscience and his high ideals of honour, there is some reason to doubt the valuation put upon these virtues of the honorable senator by himself, and also the value which the public will be likely to put upon them. </para>

Some years ago the members of this Parliament were paid a salary of only &#163;400 a year. It was found to be inadequate, and a Bill was brought forward to increase the amount to &#163;600 a year. When the Bill reached the Senate, one of its most implacable opponents, and the one who denounced it as an act of robbery, was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline></para>

            <para>- Honorable senators present who were members of the Senate at the time will remember the fine assumption of righteous indignation with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> denounced that Bill. He fought it implacably, and announced that he would not draw a penny of the increased pay. That Bill was passed in the teeth of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> most strenuous opposition. The honorable senator did not draw his extra pay. Singular to say, the amount involved, &#163;200, was the same as the honorable senator has said would be due ex-Senator Ready if he had not resigned -the difference between &#163;600 and &#163;400. When the elections came along <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> got all the kudos attaching to the high-souled  individual who not only fought the Bill, but refused to take the increased pay. But all that time the increased ,pay was steadily banking up in the Treasury, and as soon as the election was over, the people having been consulted on the matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> not only took the increased salary, but he took the arrears of salary at the increased rate as well. No wonder the question of salary should appeal strongly to the honorable senator. He could not understand how any one could give up &#163;200 without a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo.</inline> The honorable senator judged ex-Senator Ready by his own standard. &#39; He thought of that incident of his past career, and of the way he had seized upon the arrears of salary to his credit in the Treasury, and he therefore could not believe for a moment that in such a matter ex-Senator Ready could act differently from himself. </para>

            <para>- This is a deliberate campaign of false charges indulged in by the&#39; Official Labour party ; and they are making such charges now because they have done it previously, and succeeded in their purpose. During the referendum campaign, amongst the charges made by the. Official Labour party, and those associated with them, was this: that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was concerned in a scheme for the introduction of cheap labour into Australia. Do honorable senators deny that leaflets were freely circulated throughout the country to the effect that thousands of Maltese and other cheap labourers were to be introduced? The next charge was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was party to a scheme for the introduction of coloured labour into this country, and that also was sent throughout the length and breadth of the country. Honorable senators will all remember the published cartoon of a map of Australia, inferring that those who voted &#34;Yes&#34; would vote for a black Australia. That idea was fathered on the Prime Minister, the implication being that, by means of conscription, he desired to introduce coloured labour into Australia. </para>

            <para>- These leaflets,, cartoons, and statements were. issued during the referendum campaign, and in one speech <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had been bribed by the British Government to introduce conscription. Although the same thing was not said by honorable senators opposite and others in so blunt a form, we could, throughout their speeches, see the insinuation that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had been &#34; got at &#34; in Great Britain, in order to bring about conscription. These slanders, these misrepresentations, these false charges, accomplished their purpose; they fooled the people for a time. But their contemptible character exposed the falsity of them, because, when Parliament met, those men who had been going about mouthing the charges, did not dare - not a solitary member in either House dared - to repeat them on the floor. The charges were dead - they had served their purpose in misleading the people of the country. Having, as they hoped, fooled the people on that occasion by false charges, they now hope, when they are to be sent before their masters, the electors, to divert them by creating this dust, by making false charges again. </para>

            <para>- There is no Australian who wants to see the Empire win the war. but must feel in his heart that we are approaching a crisis in our affairs. At this time of crisis, when the war has taken on a new phase - the submarine campaign which has opened up dread possibilities for us - the Government have been invited to send representatives to the heart of the Empire to discuss this and other phases of the war. And here we are faced with a Parliament which, by the attitude of honorable senators opposite, has been made absolutely unworkable - faced with the position that the invitation by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that they should co-operate with the Government met with the most contemptuous refusal. That invitation was treated with contumely and scorn. If we are to play our part in this war we have to face the problem of what we intend to do in the future. The crisis is nob one which may come upon ils next year or the year afterwards ;. it is one which may come upon us within a few months. No Government can contemplate with equanimity the possibility of facing the issues arising out of that conflict with the knowledge that they are hamstrung and helpless by reason of the action of the Opposition in this Chamber. Realizing as we did, after long consideration, that it was not only impossible but foolish to attempt to carry on this Parliament while that situation lasted, we resolved to take the course of appealing to the people of Australia; to let the people say whether they are prepared to continue to intrust the government of this country and the conduct of the war to those who sit on this side, or whether they wish to hand it over to those on the Opposition side, especially in view of the attitude taken by the organizations who hold in their hands, bo to speak, the political lives of those honorable gentlemen. It is for these reasons, that the Government have determined to appeal to the people df this country. It will then be futile for honorable senators opposite to throw these vile, and indiscriminate charges at honorable&#39; , senators on this aide. The people will want to know what is their war policy1 rather than what is their hatred of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> or what their aspersions against me or any one else. The people will demand, also, to know whether they support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> in his attitude with, regard to the war. </para>

            <para>- The people will want to know, too, whether these honorable gentlemen of the Official Labour party, controlled as they are by organizations outside - and some of them influential organizations - take up the same attitude which they have publicly taken up in refusing to assist the recruiting movement in this country. These are the issues the people will have remitted to them, and upon which they will be asked to vote. Honorable senators of the Official Labour part? may raise all the dust they please, but they will never confuse those issues and those who have made, in the Senate as well as in another place, the speeches to which I have just referred, will find, when they go to their masters, the people, that they have altogether miscalculated the spirit of Australia. They will find that they have altogether miscalculated the loyalty of Australia to the Empire, and that they have altogether miscalculated the determination of the people of Australia to see this war through to the bitter end, and to fight, to the last man and the last shilling, for the future of the Empire. </para>

          <para>.- I In another place last Friday afternoon, when these serious charges were made respecting men occupying high and responsible positions in the Parliament, the Prime Minister said that the Opposition could have two things - they could have a Royal Commission to inquire into these charges, and they could have a general election. I took it that the Prime Minister was speaking for the Government and for all of its supporters. But when the motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission was submitted to a vote ir&#62; another place, the &#39;Prime Minister, who had said he would grant the Royal Commission, voted against it, and so did all the members of his Ministry and all its supporters there.  Why did they vote against the appointment of such a Commission if they had nothing to hide and. nothing of which to be ashamed? It should have been one of the first things to be desired by a Government absolutely free from the influences which are said to have been exercised in connexion with certain doings in this place. But, apparently, it is the very last thing they want. They come along now with an announcement that there is to be an election for both Houses. I waa very glad &#62;to hear that statement made. </para>

Such a Commission would place everybody whose names have been mentioned in connexion with this unsavoury business - it is not only unsavoury, but smellful .and putrid - in the position of having to give evidence on oath. When they were on their oath, they might not be so kee,  to make the statements that they are so lightly disposed to make both in this and another place and through the public press.

            <para>- I differ from you. sir, in this way: that you say, or are alleged to have said, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> would have no chance of getting back  because be would be associated with those gentlemen. If you did make that statement, you made it unthinkingly, and I believe, with all due deference to you, that you never make a statement without thinking. When you thought this matter out, it was, in my opinion, not so much because of the association, as it might have been for some other reason, that you called <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> into your room. What justification had you for saying that Arthur Rae and Peter Bowling and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> would not get back here? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> got back last time. Arthur Rae has been here before, and we are all proud of him. I venture to assert that when some of his detractors who occupy elevated positions in the public life of Australia are dead and forgotten, the name of Arthur Rae will &#34;be remembered and revered by the stalwart Labourites throughout Australia. What justification, let me ask you again, was there for saying that he would not be returned? Do you know - you probably do - that at the last election <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> polled 339,000 votes, in round figures; and Arthur Rae polled 333,000 ? He was only 6,000 votes behind the Leader of this Chamber. And, since that event, things have happened in New South Wales. You probably read in the papers of the result of the referendum that was taken recently in that and other States. If you did not, sir, it will be information to you that, in New South Wales, conscription was not carried; and it was opposed there by Arthur Rae, the man that you said, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> had no chance. The Minister for Defence is alleged to have said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> Peter Bowling, and Arthur Rae would not have a &#39;million to one chance. You will remember, too, how the present Minister for Defence came back after a triumphal tour of New South Wales during the conscription campaign, and told us that he was quite certain, judging by the enthusiasm manifested, and the long-sustained and thunderous applause with which he and others had been received over there, that conscription would be carried in that State by a majority of three or four to one. You know that it was not carried by that majority, and you know, also, that that was the one State that gave the question submitted to the people for the conscription of &#39; the manhood of Australia for oversea service such a kick that it is not likely to sit up again and live in Australia, </para>

            <para>- They know a bit: but, in my opinion, they fell in badly. Why did the Minister for Defence interest himself so much in this matter; why was he so keenly interested as to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson&#39;s</inline> conscience? He would not send those telegrams to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> without the knowledge of the Prime Minister. Why did he send a wire to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> asking him to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes?</inline> Why did he send another cancelling the engagement, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was not going to Sydney? On <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson&#39;s</inline> return to Melbourne, why was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> so keen about his seeing the Prime Minister? What do all these things demonstrate to every fair-minded man or woman in Australia - the entry of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> into the President&#39;s room, the conversations with the Minister for Defence, and the closeting of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> with the Prime Minister? We are told that they looked under the table to see that no one was there, and that when everything was as silent as the grave, Svengali, with a cigarette in his mouth, locked the doors, spoke in a whisper to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> and asked him - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was concerned about the senator&#39;s conscience - &#34;Why don&#39;t you come our way?&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> would not yield. He asserts that the Prime Minister said, &#34;Does money stand in your way?&#34; </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> asserts that the first overtures were that&#34; he should sit opposite. He would not yield.  His  next assertion is that indirectly a bribe was offered - he might go over there if money stood in the way, and if he was not taking that offer, then he could resign. Who would fill the vacancy? The Government of New South Wales. Who is in power in that State today ? A Government of the same sort as is in power in the Commonwealth. </para>

        <para>Now we come to another who did resign. It has been blazoned forth to the world that, owing to ill-health, a young man, much younger than myself, and one who, I venture to say, on a medical examination would be found to be sounder physically than I, has resigned. Let me trace the movements of this sick young man for a few days. For some days prior to Friday, 23rd February, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Beady</inline> was in this chamber as a senator representing the State of Tasmania, and filling a responsible position as Whip of the Australian Labour party in the Senate, and on the Friday he secured the adjournment of the debate on the Ministerial statement, which statement was the first business on the notice-paper for the. following Wednesday, 28th February. On Friday, the 23rd, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> was apparently like a two-year-old. On Saturday, the 24th, he was about the build ing. On Monday, 26th, he was about the building, looking as well as I have ever seen him look. I was talking to him, and he made no complaint to me, nor, so far as I am aware, to any member of our party, that he was a sick man. He said that he was leaving for Tasmania that afternoon. I said to myself, said I, &#34; He is leaving for Tasmania on Monday afternoon, and is coming back on Wednesday; he will not have much time in Tasmania.&#34; Later on the  President  came round to the club-room and said to several of us, &#34; Have you seen. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready?&#34;</inline> I said to myself again, said I, &#34;It is funny that the  President  of the Senate, who belongs to the party sitting on the opposite side of the Chamber should know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> is going to Tasmania by the afternoon&#39;s boat, and coming back on Wednesday. Why should I not know it.&#34; I do not think that other members of our party were aware of it. At any rate, this sick young man left by Monday afternoon&#39;s boat, and arrived in Tasmania on the following day, and, according to the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> of that same date, after he arrived in Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> resigned his seat as a member of the State Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> made a statement to an <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> reporter on Saturday last. He is reported as follows: - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>He was  aware  that there was a likelihood of a vacancy occurring in the Senate representation of his State, and he had also been informed by the Government of that State that he would be nominated. He did not know of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> resignation until Thursday afternoon. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">If the statement in the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> be correct, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> resigned his seat as a State member on Tuesday last, how does that fit in with his statement that he did not hear anything about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> intended resignation until Thursday afternoon 1 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> arrived in Tasmania on Tuesday. He returned to Melbourne on Wednesday with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee,</inline> the Premier of Tasmania, came to Melbourne from Sydney. That afternoon, we are told, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> was ill. On Thursday he was at the Commercial Travellers&#39; Club. I am informed that he was in and out of the premises more than once, and it has been stated that he was in the room of the Minister for Customs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen,</inline> the honorable member for Bass, Tasmania. Be it remembered that the- negotiators in connexion with the Fusion were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes, Senator Pearce,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen.</inline> The leader of our party in the Senate went to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> and the information he then received was the first intimation that reached our party that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> had submitted his resignation. The resignation was received by the  President  at one minute past 6 o&#39;clock on Thursday evening, and before the doors of this building were opened on Friday morning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> was waiting to be admitted. It will be my endeavour, before this Parliament is prorogued, to have tabled copies of the telegrams sent by the  President  to the Governor of Tasmania, and by the Governor of Tasmania to the Governor-General, in order that the mystery and unsavoury atmosphere surrounding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> resignation may be cleared up. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> is said to have resigned on account of ill-health. For quite a long time the party which sits in opposition has been fighting the Ministerial party for good and sufficient reasons. The Government were aware that we were opposed to the prolongation of Parliament, and the only way the Government could achieve their desire in that respect was by getting a majority in this Chamber. Apparently, one of the means adopted was to bring pressure to bear on a member of our party to send in his resignation in order that a member of the Ministerial party might be nominated, thus giving the Government a majority, and insuring the prolongation of Parliament. </para>

            <para>- On former occasions, when serious charges were made in the Senate and in another place, the Government was prompt to order an inquiry by an independent tribunal. The Fisher Government without hesitation appointed a Royal Commission to investigate the allegations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler</inline> against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn.</inline> What is there to prevent an inquiry by a Royal Commission into the allegations that have been made during the last few days ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> may talk as he likes about what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathews</inline> said at a Labour meeting at South Melbourne. He may appeal to the patriotism and enthusiasm of the people in regard to the titanic struggle now raging; but what the people are concerned about for the moment is whether the charges made in this Senate are true - namely, that influence of a baneful character has been exercised in regard to the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Ready,  and attempted bribery on the part of prominent men in this and an-, other place, in order to win over one member of our party to their side. </para>

            <para>- The Government have run away from their first promise, and they are now asking the people of Australia to be the judges in connexion with these charges. I am as certain as I am of standing here that when members of Parliament go before that great assize, the people of Australia will judge between the statements made by members of our party and those made by members of the other party. A fair and impartial jury like the adult citizenship of Australia will not be long in coming to a conclusion which candidates are fit &#34;and proper persons to represent Australia and to maintain the honour and integrity of the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

        <para>We have heard something about the opposition to the proposed embassy to London. But why should there not be opposition to that proposal? Between the Hughes section and the Cook-Irvine-Forrest- Watt section of the &#34;WintheWar &#34; party there is, to use the language of the Prime Minister himself, a chasm as wide as hell itself. They have nothing in common. They hate one another. They distrust one another to such an extent that they do not meet in the same room. It is &#34; This way for the Hughesites,&#34; and &#34; That way for the  Cookites.&#34;  In the face of all this, we are told that they &#39; are a united party, brought together for the purpose of winning the war. How can they be a united party when they are disunited every time they are called upon to consider matters of importance? The members of this &#34;united party&#34; meet under different roofs. , What is there between the gentlemen in the Hughes section and the other section of this &#34;&#39; Win-the-War &#34; party ? They say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> should go to London as the Prime Minister of Australia; but I point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was discredited on the 28th October last by the people of Australia. And in what way are the other two gentlemen,. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir J</inline> ohn Forrest, representative Australians? Were they not both discredited at the 1914 election as responsible Ministers of the Crown?&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie said the other day that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest was a &#34; big Australian.&#34; Well, he is big in proportion.

            <para>- Why, then, should <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest be considered a fit and proper man to represent the interests of Australia at the Imperial Conference? Let us get on to a few more people. The other gentlemen say that we object to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine going. So we do.

I am pointing out to you, sir, that once the practice is established of allowing a man to cut his speech into sentences it will be possible for a member to occupy but a very short space of time in the delivery of an address, and to take up pretty well the whole of one issue of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> In this policy speech, the Prime Minister says - </para>

            <para>- This gentleman talks about a question which the world knows about, that at the Treasury I drew a salary which belonged to me, not to anybody else. I never said that I would not take the money, and I challenge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> or any one else, to say that I did. What I did say at that time was that the people had not been consulted on the matter, and that I thought that, in the interests of the people and the party, a referendum should be taken. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was one of those men who was extremely anxious not to let it go to the people. Then he compares the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> with something I did in drawing this money. I never drew the money until the people of Australia had been appealed to, and every man who had voted for or against the increase had been returned to Parliament. I took it, therefore, that the people at that time indorsed the increase, and, when I saw fit, I drew the amount. The  President  of the Senate, in his eagerness to get at me, as he thought, wanted to occupy a dual capacity, and to say what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> afterwards said, that I drew the money. It is perfectly true that I did. </para>

            <para>- I come back to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> this high-minded and high-principled man, who is concerned about one thing, and one thing only, and that is winning the war ! If he- was concerned about that matter, why is he so seriously worried about the likelihood of losing his portfolio? Every one knows - the dogs in the streets were barking it - that one of the obstacles in the way of this unholy alliance was that the other section of the Win-the-war party wished to have the Minister for Defence in the House of Representatives, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was opposed to that. In the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> recently appeared one of the most striking cartoons that I have seen for a long time. We shall not need to make speeches at the coming election; all that will be necessary will be to publish this cartoon, not by hundreds, but by thousands. It is one of the cartoons that live, and that sting men of the type of those sitting opposite. They are shown with the halter round their necks, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> dragging them along like slaves. They talk of freedom, but they are not free; they have been bought and sold like cattle in the market-place. They are now going to their certain doom. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> never had a more anxious time in his life than when the negotiations for the alliance were in progress, and the other side was insisting on the Defence portfolio being held by a member of the House of Representatives. During that time there was no more miserable man in this House than he. </para>

            <para>- Not as a senator, because he has not to retire this time, but as a Minister, because this Administration is doomed, and he will certainly lose his job. This is not a rich man&#39;s Government, it is not a poor man&#39;s Government; in the name of God, what sort of a Government is it? When a Fusion was formed by Deakin, Cook, and Irvine, Hughes said that the Liberals had gone into the cave of the wolves. Now he and his followers have gone into the same cave. This is not a rich man&#39;s Government, and it is not a poor man&#39;s Government; yet in it, as Minister for the Navy, we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook, whom in 1909 the Minister for Defence declared to be ignorant in regard to defence. He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> opposed the building of the Australian Navy, and particularly of destroyers of the River class, on the ground that there are only two Australian rivers, the Murrumbidgee and the Murray, and therefore, they would not be needed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> has been denounced by every member of the Hughes section of the Ministerial party. Then, there is associated with this Government <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, whom these members have also denounced ever since he entered public life. This people&#39;s Government is supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, who asserted that it was an extraordinary thing that the two Houses of the Federal Parliament should be elected on the same franchise ! This &#34;People&#39;s&#34; Government is supported by a gentleman who said that the invalid and old-age pension saps the moral fibre of the community ! It is supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> Smith, who expressed the hope that no member of the hob-nailed boot brigade would ever find admittance into the Senate. It is supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> who is extremely anxious to win the war. He has said so, not once, but several times, He said over two years ago that he was going, and when asked &#34; When?&#34; replied, &#34; Later on.&#34; He is going, make no mistake about that - when the war is over ! <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> too, is extremely anxious about winning the war. Was it not placarded throughout Australia that, after the taking of the referendum, on 28th October last, he would go to the front? Both he and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> have come, not gone, to the front - the front Ministerial bench. Yet this is not a rich man&#39;s Government, it is not a poor man&#39;s Government; it is a people&#39;s Government ! How many weeks were the negotiators haggling as to which side should have six and which five representatives. Finally they came to the conclusion that Australia could be saved and victory won for the Allies by constituting a Government of six Liberals and five Hughesites.  For weeks the destiny of civilization was at stake because the  Hughesites  desired six portfolios! <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has asked, &#34; Do you not know that we are right in the danger zone? Our lives and liberties are at stake. The Empire is quaking.&#34; He realizes that to-day. But his troubles about the dangers of the Empire when the business managers of the two sections of the present Ministerial party were negotiating about their respective representation in the Government ! These men, who talk about being free men, have not a soul to call their own. That was evidenced to-day when the Leader of the Government made a certain announcement. We, on this side, were saying to ourselves, &#34; My word, they have got a shock and a fright.&#34; </para>

            <para>- No; I could not expect to get any change from them. This, we are told, is not a poor man&#39;s nor yet a rich man&#39;s Government, but it is a people&#39;s Government. I say that it is a Government that stands condemned in the eyes of the people. It is a Government without a policy. In confirmation of that remark, all I need do is to repeat <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> statement, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> might readily subscribe to its policy and its programme. How could any senator belonging to the Labour movement subscribe to a policy or programme that has been framed by the Tories and reactionaries in the Federal Parliament ? We know very well who framed the policy of this Government. It was the majority of the members of the Cabinet, and it is because the Government stands condemned on their policy, and because of the doubt of their honesty of purpose in the minds of the people, and because of the peculiar methods they have adopted in dealing with a particular vacancy, that I feel certain that when the people are appealed to - as they will be shortly by a general election - the members of the Australian Labour party in this Chamber, and in another place, will come back to this Parliament as the representatives of the States, and constituencies they represent to-day. They will come back as representatives of the people of the State of Victoria, whilst a number of those gentlemen who have played false with their trust, and false with the people, will receive their quietus, not merely in the year 1917, but, the people measuring some of them by their words and their deeds, they will find it very difficult indeed ever again to secure entry into the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

          <para>. - It is not my purpose to detain the Senate at any great length. Honorable senators are aware that I am not given to speaking at very great length upon matters of a general character, whilst I do endeavour to throw myself into the actual work of the Senate, in Committee, and discuss all matters submitted to it with all the energy and all the ability I can compass. As a representative of Tasmania, and as one who had the honour of being sent here to represent that State in the days of my boyhood, and one who has been continuously in this Chamber, assisting, with others, to uphold the honour of the State, I have to say that the events of the previous week put me into such a position as to make it almost difficult for me, in certain circumstances, to express myself. I am not suggesting for one moment that there is anything in the nature of a solid foundation under any of the imputations or charges that have been made, in the most casual fashion, by honorable senators on the other side, and which have been directed to some of the most honorable people in the Commonwealth with whom I have been associated throughout the whole term of my political career. I might say that, on Tuesday last, I came over from Tasmania in the same boat with the gentleman who was then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> and the gentleman who is now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle.</inline> I met and conversed with them both. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> has been a political opponent of mine, and one who, I expected, would be fighting me at the forthcoming election in Tasmania, I say that the fact that he has been earnest, diligent, and loyal to his party and his colleagues in Tasmania is a fact which no one in the Senate will venture to question. Indeed, I know no member of the Senate who has been more earnest, more diligent, or more loyal, though it may be that he was often politically misguided. </para>

I saw him again here in Parliament House before I left to attend a meeting pf -the Public Works Committee at the other end of this city. I saw him again at luncheon time, and noted how ill the man looked. I was sitting close to the very table at which he was sitting upstairs, and he seemed as if he were done. All of a sudden I heard the very crash which indicated his collapse. I went over to where he had fallen, and while I am not a man who takes trumpery features as conclusive evidence, I say that I saw the man lying on the floor in a cold perspiration. </para>

            <para>- There could be no doubt whatever on the subject. The ex-senator was taken charge of by the  President,  and if there be any suggestion or implication that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> was associated in any way with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> resignation, let me say at once that the  President  is responsible for the refreshment-rooms and the internal affairs of Parliament House, and there is no one in this Parliament who could more properly have charged himself with immediate responsibility in the circumstances. I do not think there was any representative of New South Wales in the room. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> arrived a few minutes afterwards, and I said to him, &#34; Do you know that Ready has just recently collapsed?&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> replied, &#34;I saw him in the lift with the  President,  and I thought he looked peeky.&#34;  That was the beginning of the incident, so far as I am concerned ; and I think it is&#39; only due to the public, and to honorable senators, that one should speak fully and freely on a matter like this. Some time afterwards, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> and myself met <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> in a corridor in Parliament House, and we both asked him how he felt. </para>

In reply to me, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> said, &#34; I do not know, but I am sick of politics.&#34; That ended the interview; and I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> and other honorable senators from Tasmania will bear me out in the statement that, rightly or wrongly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> critics, for the last six months, have been very, very strong, and sometimes, from his standpoint, perhaps, very vindictive. </para>

Under all the circumstances, I cannot for a moment think that he could avoid hearing the criticisms as to his actions in relation to recruiting . previously, and his chances in connexion with the forthcoming elections. As a matter of fact, he was asked to resign from the Recruiting Committee because of his previous attitude, and he did so, though, on being requested, he once more took up the position. </para>

            <para>- I shall not go over the circumstances particularly, but, so far as I understand, and so far as my own observation went, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> fell seriously ill here last week - there is no make-believe about his illness. As to the causes contributing to that illness, I could suggest sufficient to make ten men ill, without ground for any imputations whatever. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> has recently gone through a period of stress and worry. </para>

        <para>The other day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> the Leader of the Opposition, asked some question with regard to the action of the Prime Minister in calling the Premier of Tasmania to meet him. The honorable senator asked whether involved in the action was the convening of the Tasmanian Parliament, or the taking of any constitutional action. As I sat in my place, I heard these questions, and I also heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> give the honorable senator his &#34; change.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> disappeared; and at that time I had hot the slightest idea of anything like what has since arisen being likely to arise. Foi some time I did not see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> about the House, but the moment he did put in an appearance and took his seat again in this Chamber I went across to him. I knew nothing about this Watson-President business, but I was not going to have any conversations in a room or private place. I said, &#34; Gardiner, I have been representing the State of Tasmania since the inception of the Commonwealth Parliament, and some imputations, or rather some questions you have addressed to the Minister suggest various things. I do not know if I am asking you a fair question, but will you tell me what you are driving at.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> said, &#34; It is a fair question, I will.&#34; I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> does not think I am breaking any confidence, because I spoke to him on those benches, and under no seal of secrecy. </para>

            <para>- But we were practically under call. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> never asked me for a pair in general or any terms, although he was about the House. I cannot say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> was actually within the Senate after we had been summoned or had met, but previous to that I saw him frequently, and under no circumstances did he ask me for a pair in regard to any particular matter. How, then, am I to assume that he de-, sires a pair upon any specific motion corning before the Senate ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has said he has gone. &#34; The dogs are barking this and that.&#34; The dogs were barking, then, about a motion for the prolongation of the life of this Parliament. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> has never asked me for a pair. I was in Launceston on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, and on Tuesday of last week up till 4 o&#39;clock; and it was well known that I was there, because interviews with me in regard to wheat and other matters were published in all the newspapers. I asked, particularly, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> was ill, what was the nature of his illness, and where he was. I do not say that I sought this information from him direct, or from any member of his family. I asked it of a pressman, and was assured of his genuine and serious illness. I was in Launceston all that time, but I did not get a telephone message, or any request, either directly or indirectly, from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> to grant him a pair. I now find that I was within 100 yards of him. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline>was lying ill, and yet I received no request for a pair. Why should I assume that I should pair with a man without first receiving either a direct request from him or an authoritative request from somebody who is in a position to be absolutely sure that he would vote in an opposite direction to myself ? As a matter of fact, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> stated this morning, after the development of last week, we both of us took this matter into serious consideration. We felt that we would have to cut out altogether the question of elections, to eliminate individuals, and to think only of the honour of our State, which was being impugned. There was a member of the House of Representatives who came over here while I was busy, and who spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> on the subject, and jointly we sent a telegram to the Premier of Tasmania. Will anybody pretend that that member was influenced by any <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> article ? Why, that very article to which reference has been made, and which I have not yet read myself, did not appear until Saturday. His action was prompted by consideration for his own State. &#39; </para>
        <para>As to various suggestions which have been made during the course of this debate, I will go so far as to say that I told the  Vice-President  of the Executive Council that I was &#39; not . quite certain of my own attitude in regard to the motion for the&#39; prolongation of the life of this Parliament. He frankly and straightforwardly told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> and myself that he was not fool enough to think that he was going to interfere with our considered judgment. He said, &#34; You are men of experience and of character, but take everything into consideration before you act, and I only hope that what you do will be in your own best interests and the best interests of the Commonwealth.&#34; That conversation was not sought at all. It was a conversation which arose through meeting  the Minister in the corridor. There was no privacy about it. That is the position in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> and myself stand. </para>

            <para>- Yes, and he had to roar to make an impression. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> referred to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Australian delegation to the Imperial War Conference, in London. I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will imagine that I am disclosing anything <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> a confidential nature when I say that I told him I felt very strongly about <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine going to London, but that that circumstance would not be the final factor in my determination of the attitude which I would assume towards the motion for prolonging the life of Parliament. As to the remaining representatives of Australia at the Conference, I look upon <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, not as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> coarsely puts it, from an avoirdupois point of view, but as one of the biggest Australians this country has ever produced. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> the Prime Minister, I considered, must go. I expressed that opinion last week, long before these developments occurred, and it was published broadcast throughout Australia. Setting aside <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine&#39;s personality altogether, I take the view that the Commonwealth should not be represented at the Conference by a man who is not a Minister of the Crown. One of the bases of the policy of the Government, as recently announced, is that we are to have responsible government - Ministers responsible to Parliament, and members of Parliament responsible to the people - so that, apart from any other consideration, no man occupying a non-Ministerial position should go to the Conference. It was in connexion with that difficulty that I spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> generally about this motion. I venture to say that neither he nor his colleagues in the Government knew - nor could they say when they met here this morning that they knew - what attitude <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> and I might take if the motion were put to a division during the  morning. Coming to other considerations affecting Tasmania, I felt that the honour, the integrity, and the fair fame of that State, in the representation of which I have shared since the inception of Federation, is in question, and the course of action that we, as representatives of the people, must take will lead to its position being speedily cleared up. For the sake of the integrity and reputation of the Commonwealth among the nations of the world it is imperative that the serious charges that have been made should be investigated and determined by the most appropriate tribunal. In order that Australia may not lack representation at the Imperial Conference, I should be quite satisfied if the High Commissioner of the Commonwealth, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> the ex-High Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McCall, a native-born Australian, who is Australian in every fibre of his being, were appointed delegates <inline font-style="italic">pro</inline><inline font-style="italic">tem.</inline></para>

That being so, the Government could not have known what were my intentions in regard to this motion. The attitude which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> and I have taken up is not, as has been suggested by some honorable senators opposite, the result of any newspaper article. We can show by documentary evidence and otherwise that our course of conduct, as well as that of a representative of Tasmania in &#39; another place, was mapped out, if not definitely decided upon in detail long before anything appeared in the press that was calculated to influence us. </para>

          <para>. - In the course of his address <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> referred to the question of pairs. He said that while in Launceston he was within 100 yards of the hospital in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> was lying, that his presence in Launceston was well known, and that he was interviewed by the representatives of different newspapers there, but that no request was made to him to grant a pair to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy.</inline> That explanation was proffered by him no doubt in answer to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator OKeefe,</inline> and to the statements that I made last week-end. As I then interjected, an official request for pairs for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> was made to the Government Whip on Wednesday afternoon last. From the moment that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> took ill, I have been the acting Whip of the Opposition, and in that capacity I told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, the Government Whip, on Wednesday afternoon last that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was anxious to know if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> would be given pairs. The reply I received was that pairs would not be given, and I informed my leader of that answer. This proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that on the Wednesday afternoon, so far as the Government were concerned, through the lips of their Whip, pairs would, not be given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy.</inline></para>

He said, &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is going to move the prolongation motion, and the Government do not desire to take any advantage of the absence of the Leader of the Opposition. Will you, at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> request, rise in your place and move the adjournment of the debate on the motion when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has finished speaking?&#34; I agreed, but the arrangement was unnecessary, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> arrived in time. </para>

He was not so bad then as when I had seen him before. He said he was going to the Commercial Travellers&#39; Club to remain there. I asked him if there was anything I could do for him, and he said, &#34; No.&#34; He told me he was not sure if the doctor was coming that afternoon or the next morning. On Thursday morning last at twenty-five minutes to 10 o&#39;clock I rang up the Commercial Travellers&#39; Club to find out how he was after the night. He came to the telephone and told me he had put in a very bad night; that he had not slept all night. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> sneers, but I am simply making a statement of facts in rebuttal, of certain statements and innuendoes from the other side. </para>

I waited until five minutes past 2, and then rang up the Commercial Travellers&#39; Club, and asked whether he was there, and whether I could speak to him. He came to the telephone, and, after </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">I had told him who was speaking, I asked him whether the doctor had been to see him. He said, &#34; Hot yet.&#34; I asked when he expected the doctor, and he replied, &#34; About twenty minutes past 2.&#34; I thereupon said, &#34;Following on my request of this morning, do you think it will be possible for you to come to Parliament House by 3 o&#39;clock? You may be wanted. You said this morning that you would come if you were wanted.&#34; He said, &#34; I cannot tell you until the doctor comes to see me.&#34; I then asked whether he could let me know at the latest by twenty minutes to 3, and he replied that he could not do so, because he would have to wait until the doctor came. At that moment I was rung off, and that ends the conversations, personal and by telephone, between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> and myself. The next I heard was the statement which was made about 3 o&#39;clock on the Thursday afternoon, when the Senate was assembling, to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> had resigned. I said, at the beginning of my remarks this evening, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> was ill when I saw him on the Wednesday afternoon in the President&#39;s room. I saw him later in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> room, and I was in conversation with him then, and at different times until seven minutes past 2 on Thursday afternoon. My wonder is that he did not intimate to me, as acting Whip of his party, or to the leader of his party, or to any member of the party, that he contemplated resigning. It is one of the first courtesies to pay to any party to which one belongs to intimate to the leader of it, or to the party itself, one&#39;s intention to resign a seat in Parliament, and it is remarkable to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> the trusted official of the party, did not let any of his colleagues know what his intentions were until he announced them to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> who went to see him at the Commercial Travellers&#39; Club on the afternoon on which he resigned. I leave the matter there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, by way of interjection before the adjournment, asked my authority for speaking about pairs in relation to Senators Long and Guy. I replied to the honorable senator at the moment, but during the adjournment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has been good enough to hand to me an <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> extract, which will throw some light on the attitude that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> intended to adopt.

        <para class="block">Last Thursday there was on the business-paper a notice of motion, having for its object the prolongation of the life of this Parliament. It was on the notice-paper on Wednesday last, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> took ill, but on that day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> asked that the notice of motion be postponed until the Ministerial statement had &#34; been dealt with. The Senate agreed to the proposal of the Leader of the House, because at that moment the Government had sixteen votes on their side against our fifteen, and no action could be taken by the Opposition on that day. But on Thursday, after we knew that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> had tendered his resignation,, when the business of the Senate was called upon, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> repeated his motion of the day before that the notice of motion regarding the prolongation of Parliament be postponed until after consideration of the Ministerial statement. The Opposition called &#34; No,&#34; and, on a division being taken, there were sixteen &#34; Ayes &#34; and sixteen &#34;Noes.&#34; Consequently, -the motion of the Leader of the Senate was negatived. It was then competent for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to proceed with the motion. You, sir, reminded him of the fact that if he did not proceed with the motion, it would drop off the notice-paper. Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> nor <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said a word, and you, sir, thereupon announced that the notice of motion lapsed. Next day, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> had been sworn in, and taken his seat, the Government plucked up fresh courage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> immediately gave notice of the same motion as he had allowed to drop off the notice-paper the day before, because the Government had not the numbers in the Senate to carry it. With the acquisition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> to their side, the Government were in a position to carry the motion by seventeen votes to fifteen, having regard to the number of votes available. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> then went further. Instead of moving the adjournment of the Senate in the usual way on Friday, he moved that the Senate should meet again at 11 o&#39;clock to-day - a most unusual procedure. Why was it taken ? Confident that he had now a majority behind him, he called the Senate together to-day in order that the motion should be put through. To-day, however, instead of moving that motion, he immediately moved the adjournment of the Senate, and indicated the intention of the Government to send both branches of the Legislature to the country at an early date. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> could have made that statement long ago. Honorable senators on this side helped him in every possible way to bring about an appeal to the people. </para>

The Government were determined that they would not go to the country; but to-day, when they find that they have not the majority for which they had manoeuvred, and of which they were sure on Friday - to-day, when they find they had reckoned without their hosts - they are compelled to take a step that is distasteful to them, and the  de&#39;il  thank them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made no attempt to dispute the fact that there was a doubt as to there being a majority on the Government side to carry the motion for the prolongation of Parliament; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> stated distinctly that the Government&#39;s decision to precipitate an election was not taken because of the fact that two Ministerial supporters would oppose the prolongation of Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> interjected that that was not so. </para>

I am wondering why, as you did not proceed with the business on Friday, you called. us together to deal with the motion for the prolongation of Parliament to-day, and then moved to adjourn the Senate. Why was that done? Because the Government had not the numbers.

I will not follow this matter further, except to say that this is certainly a point which should be determined, either by the Committee of the Senate or a higher tribunal. It will be futile on the part of the Government to say that, because of the opposition shown by this party to the&#39; proposal for the prolongation of the life of Parliament, the delegates appointed to the Imperial War Conference cannot leave Australia.- The real truth is that there is not unity among Government supporters. Members on this side welcome the action of the Government. We cheerfully pick up the gauntlet which has been thrown down, and will be prepared to leave the issue in the hands of the &#34;electors. </para>

          <para>. - I make no apologies. for address- - ing the Senate on the present occasion, although, perhaps, I occupied more time than I was entitled to only a few days ago; but, apparently, we are living in times when it becomes necessary to speak out. I feel that, having a mind capable of producing thought - the only flower that it can produce - this thought, if it is worth expression at all, should unfold itself, unhampered and uninterrupted by any agency on this earth. In a measure, if not completely so, that is the reason why we are here on your right, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and that is the reason why those gentlemen are on your left, to-night. Inside of twelve months ago, the gentlemen on your left, and a number of those on your right, were brothers-in-arms.  They confided in each other, and, except for those family breezes which are never absent, even in well-regulated families, we were, to all intents and purposes, a united party. To-day we are riven asunder, and the majority, of which I formed a member less; than a year ago,  Bit  on your left. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I am here with the small minority. Why are we here ? We are here, as I have said, because we insist upon that inalienable and unchallengeable right that a free man should possess&#39; to express his thoughts independently of consequences in a free Democracy. That is what we are here for, in strict keeping with that sacred principle, without which a free Democracy is a delusion and a. sham. For this we are taunted. Is there a word in the vocabulary of epithets which has not been wasted upon us by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan,</inline> who said that I was &#34;in the bag,&#34; to other honorable senators who called me and others traitors <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I wish to draw the minds of these men, if they are not hopelessly steeped in prejudice yet, if there is still a shimmering grain of equity and justice in their compositions, to. the position. What is it ? We are here, I say again, in obedience to. that mental injunction, that impulse of the soul,&#39; without which a free man is only a slave, to give expression to the thoughts which are in our minds, and that regardless pf what may befall us afterwards. What I give expression to here are the thoughts that affect myself outside the domain and province of the four corners of the agreement into which the electors and myself entered. It is because I am insisting upon that, even with the last breath, that I am to be called a traitor, to be taunted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> that I am &#34;in the bag,&#34; and that I am here for the salary which I drew. Let me tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> that, in opposition to his charge, my reputation of twenty-six years in the Labour movement stands out. Let me remind him that, in this country, there were positions for which I was chosen, not carrying the&#39; &#163;1,500 a year which I drew as a Minister, but carrying, perhaps, &#163;1,000 a year more than that sum, and for which, as well as the Ministerial position, I never turned a hair. Any form of preferment that has ever been offered to me in my public or private life in Australia has not been given to me by reason of my having lifted a little finger or turned a hair to get it But now I am told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> and his friends that I am where I am, after having refused other things - better things, too, than perhaps I am in enjoyment of - for the sake of what I am getting. Such is the position which we have got down to in the public life of this country, when the reputation pf a man  extending over a quarter of a century can stand out in contradiction to the foul charges levelled against him. We are here - and we offer no apology for our presence - in support of a true Democracy. Without our presence, I say again, a free Democracy would have no chance of living, either here or elsewhere, according to my reading of history. </para>
        <para>Suppose that an impartial observer were to land here from Mars, or somewhere else, and were told that a strong, organized political party existed in this country within the last few months, and that a part of the party was driven asunder for good reasons, went out from the shelter of the strongest political machine ever fashioned south of the line, went out from the friendship of comrades extending over a period of twenty years, do you, sir, not think that this impartial man would agree that there was something else in that party than material for making traitors and renegades and rats, as we have been called? We are going before a tribunal - and, thank God, it is a higher, a juster, and truer tribunal than that which has been called upon to pronounce judgment upon us in the past - and we are sanguine of success. </para>

I know well enough that men who have gone before us and attempted to do right have seldom or rarely obtained a vindication during their own life time. So it may be with us. If we are not successful now, although I believe that we will overwhelm our opponents, we shall be content, so far as I am concerned, with getting a vindication later, as every big and great man got his posthumous vindication before. </para>

        <para>What is the position reduced to? We are here, and the subject of our discussion largely ranges round the events of the last two days. Something was said by yourself, sir, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and by the Prime Minister in confidence to another honorable senator. I believe that in the interests of public justice no seal of secrecy or confidence should stand in the way of its vindication. I believe that absolutely, because contrariwise, if men choose to conspire amongst themselves, and by doing so would defeat the end of public justice and morality, then public justice and morality would have no point, and no object for existence. In my view nothing should stand between the vindication of public justice and the matters that are subject to it. Having stated my position as far as confidences are concerned, I can now proceed to reason on the basis of the statements which have been made. </para>
        <para>Starting off with that as a preliminary admission, it is to be remembered that the essence of all crime is the intent. It matters not what a man says or does or appears to do, what is endeavoured to be ascertained on all occasions is what was the secret motive moving the individual or the body of individuals whenever they were disposed to wrongdoing or to any form of misdemeanour. The intent and nothing else,&#34; I say again, justifies any person in being condemned. If it is proved that any persons have an evil intent in their minds, then, apart altogether from what they may say or do, or intend to do, they have to be judged by that fact and nothing else. Starting from that point we have this position, that for public convenience we have a Parliament House where the representatives of the people may come and discuss public questions affecting the public welfare. You, sir, have a room set apart for yourself ; the  Chairman  of Committees and other officers of the Senate have rooms set apart for themselves ; even honorable senators have a single room walled off from the end of a corridor - for what purpose? At least for this ostensible purpose, to enable honorable senators from yourself downwards to talk upon matters over which they want at least the shield of confidence and privacy thrown. Otherwise knock down these walls and create a wall-less chamber where all may congregate and all may talk together. That is what you have to do. In the complex organization of society no man can stand apart as an independent unit. Any man who thinks it possible to do so had better go to the South Pole, and form a colony of Ishmaelites  there. There are moments when members subscribing to different policies discuss matters from the same stand-point, to their mutual advantage. But would any honorable senator like to have a report of his  private conversations thrown on the screen <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

            <para>- Yes. I have had private conversations with scores of senators which I should not like to have repeated in public, and common sense and reason, which are our guides and mentors in these matters, declare that private conversations should be regarded as confidential. Free discussion would else be impossible, and those who now say anything to the contrary wilfully shut their eyes to the facts of life. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> is not now in the chamber, because I intend to direct my remarks very pointedly at him. He has said that, being invited, he approached you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> the Minister for Defence, and the Prime Minister. We have had his <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> account of his interview with you. To your honour, you declined to violate the confidence which the conversation implied, and, although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> has related that conversation in a manner to make it as ugly as possible, can it be said that there is anything in what he has stated that is discreditable to you, or that differs from what other honorable senators have said under similar circumstances many times? I am certain that no impartial judge would hold you guilty of impropriety, even on his <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Then he told us that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had reminded him of the hopelessness of his position in New South Wales, and had urged him to let the voice of his conscience prevail, and to come over to this side of the chamber. That is all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is declared to have said; that is the conversation that is the head and front of his offence. Was there anything wrong in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is declared to have said ? Having read <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson&#39;s</inline> statement dispassionately and without partiality, I cannot find anything improper in the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who may confidently submit himself to the judgment of the electors in the matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> also saw <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> who, he said, told him that his position in New South Wales was hopeless, and advised him, as his judgment and conscience did not approve of his connexion with the Official Labour party, to come to our side of the chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> contends that he will not budge an inch in his fidelity to his party, that by his party and his convictions he will stand or fall. Let us, however, take the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> report of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> said about the interview. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> reporter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> declared that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> said that he would like to be with us. The latter denies that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> whose political record extends over nearly a quarter of a century, solemnly assured the Senate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> had told him that he was not comfortable in the company that he kept, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> according to the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> report of his speech, said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> told him, after some little conversation. &#34; You are right, and we are wrong. 1 wish I had the courage to do what you have done.&#34; Thus, on the one hand, we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson&#39;s</inline> statement that he had not as much as dreamt of leaving the Labour party, and, on the other hand, the contradictions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes. Senator Watson</inline> is new to politics, and his unsupported statement is flatly contradicted by the independent statements of two politicians, each of whom has been in politics for nearly twenty-five years, supported with the confidence of tens of thousands of the men and women of this country. This being so, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> must obtain corroboration of his statement before he can be regarded as having a strong case. Is there the semblance of evidence to support what he has said ? None whatever. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> may be an estimable man, but he has not enjoyed the confidence of the people of Australia anything like so long as have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> We have these men on their honour flatly contradicting the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> and I say that, in view of the relative positions of the men concerned, we are entitled to disbelieve <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> and to believe the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> Their words stand, and defy contradiction. </para>
        <para>Moreover, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> has been asked, as I have asked him, to go out into the open, to walk outside the door of this chamber, and repeat there the charges he has made here. He has refused to do so. That is the place where the truth of his charges can be tested, and nowhere else. If he was a man with a semblance of courage or consistency he would repeat outside the charges with which he has here foully aspersed the characters of innocent men. </para>

            <para>- I am trying to deal with this matter as I think it should be dealt with, and that is in the light of fair play. We have to recognise that in the heat of party dissensions, unless things are judged by the standard of fair play, a perfectly honest man may have no chance at all. The standards of fair play do not lead either this way or that. They stand erect. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> has been given the invitation to come out into the open, to pass through the&#39; door of this chamber, and make his charges outside, and I say that his refusal to do so covers him with suspicion.

The same <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> who has been called everything black and vile and contemptuous that could come from the tongues of the men whom he had so long befriended, was asked to go round to the executives to explain the position and try to induce them to deal Leniently  with honorable senators opposite. </para>

            <para>- He offered to go round to the executives, and there was not a dissenting voice from this ungrateful set of men who now pour every vile epithet from the sump-pits of their minds on their former leader and friend. I owe nothing to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and all I am concerned! about is that he should be given a fair deal, and that men should not be found ungrateful to the man who gave so much  of his time, attention, and his matchless brains to the cause he has espoused for the last twenty-five years. For twenty-five long years in the service of the  Labour  movement, a breath of foul suspicion was never wafted against him until now. Now, all at once, as was the case with other patriots in olden times, the very men who adored him, and who threw flowers in his way, are the men who  unsheath  their daggers and plunge them up to the hilt in his back. That is what these men have done, and that is the reason why I made up my mind, quite apart from the merits or otherwise of conscription, that I would not stand idly bv and witness that black assassination of the Prime Minister. He has been morally assassinated by men who were in the Caucus, and who remained like tombstones in a cemetery when he said that he would go round and fight their cause with the executives. He went round, and we know the result. He tried his level best to save these men who now show themselves to be so ungrateful. This was after his policy was carried by a substantial vote at about half-past 2 o&#39;clock in the morning. This man has been made the object of all the vile language at the command of his former friends, whom he did his best to save. That is not how our conception of human relationship should be moulded. </para>

        <para>In civilized society to-day, there is one thing which we cannot ignore, and that is gratitude for and remembrance of faithful service. If men turn their backs upon a man who has given them faithful service, and, without just cause, refuse him the consideration to which he is entitled, the time will come when their own acts will rend them, as they deserve to be  rended,  as unspeakably loathsome specimens of the human race. For the first act by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> off must go his head. These gentlemen for whom he pleaded for leniency do not believe in a first offender&#39;s code. I said the other night that, in the junta&#39;s legal code, there is no First Offenders Act. With them, even the very suspicion of guilt is enough, and they come between the electors and the elected. In a free Democracy there is, in my opinion, no room for such a body, and I shall raise my voice and do my little best to see that what room there may be is made less and less until utterly extinguished. Gentlemen in another place affect a holy horror at any suspicion cast on the genuineness of their convictions. I have said previously in this chamber that there are men in the Official Labour party by the dozen who would, and ought to be, with us on this side, if they only spoke their own thoughts. I should like to give an illustration just to show how my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> who still keeps out of the chamber, has arrived in his position, and what is practised by these people who are masquerading in the name of freedom. There is a member of the State Parliament of Queensland whose experience typifies the conditions to which public men are brought today. This gentleman was found to be on the anti-conscriptionists&#39; side, although it was known that he had previously declared himself to the contrary. When he was asked why he &#34;was in that camp he gave a mournful and downcast glance, and said, &#34; Look here, I am here, and I am sorry; I admit that I have lost my - adjective - manhood.&#34; This party of lost manhood compelled this man to take a side to which he was opposed, but which he had to take for the sake of earning his bread. </para>

Of course, I except some of them, amongst them <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes;</inline> but that honorable senator knows as well as I do that there are not one or two, but close on a dozen, if not more, on his side who have by profession and public pronouncement declared conscription to be the right thing. </para>

        <para>Wo are here to do the best we can for this country; and no man who has taken a lead in the struggle for a free system of government has escaped the troubles now assailing the Prime Minister. If we go back through the centuries we find that any man who has made a footprint on the sands of time has, at some period or other, been the victim of foul suspicion or worse. We can start with the Bracchi of ancient Rome, who went down under the daggers of the mob they had befriended. Then, in the French revolu-tion, we have Danton with his &#34; Audacity, more audacity, and audacity all the time.&#34; Danton went finally .to his doom at the hands of Robespierre, who, is turn, had to suffer from the effects of his own policy. Danton was the man who, if he could, would have breathed into the Democracy of France something that would have caused it to live and stand the test of time, for he was ever a man of the people. Then, in England, we&#39; know that the Duke of Wellington, the hero of Waterloo, was chased through the streets of London, and had his house mobbed; indeed, on the very steps of Parliament House he was struck a blow by some ruffian in the crowd. There was much in what the Duke of Wellington did with which I do not agree, but he had done well for England, and yet he did not escape the jeers and shafts of mischievous enemies. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Peel, when dealing with the corn laws, suffered from the taunts that were levelled at him. And, by-the-bye, Wellington himself was accused of criminality, just . as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> baa been called a criminal in this chamber. Wellington&#39;s name lives, but who was the man who called him a criminal <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> The name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> will live much longer than the names of those who have accused him of criminality. Then what happened to Parnell in Ireland ? When fighting his elections be was subjected to the utmost contumely and abuse, had lime thrown in his eyes, and all the rest of it. Parnell a traitor 1 Parnell&#39;s name lives, and will live when the names of those who met him at Kilkenny arc forgotten, as all ungrateful factions ought to be forgotten. And what about my other compatriot, Henry Grattan ? After he had given up the best years of his life to his country, an ungrateful mob conspired to throw him into the Liffey,&#39; and his blood flowed in the streets of his native town. Last of all comes Washington, the father of, his country, who widened the horizon of human freedom the world, over. Did he escape? No. This reminds me of the honorable senator who is still out of the  chamber, for, as shown in George Trevelyans history, a clergyman of the day, named Odell, called &#39;Washington a perjurer and a liar&#39;. Then there was Mazzini, the Italian patriot, who had to .live for years in the cellars of Marseilles and elsewhere. Go down the .whole list of patriots the world over, and we find them suffering at the hands of the ungrateful, malicious, or short-sighted section of the community, who are not blessed with any charitable instinct, and who, by their taunts and actions, make a hell on earth for the great ones. This <inline font-style="italic">has</inline> been the experience in every age and clime; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is only enduring again what every worthy man of the past has had to endure for carrying out the dictates of his mind and the prompting of his conscience. </para>
        <para>Until now, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> never came under the breath &#39; of suspicion ; but a Judas has come down upon him, and has exclaimed &#34; Away with him. He stands condemned. Off with his head.&#34; Again, let me say, there is no First Offenders Act in the Judas code. For what would they take off the Prime Minister&#39;s head f For doing exactly what Labourites in the Old Country have done, for advocating precisely what they are advocating to-day. For this, Mr.&#39; Hughes is to be tumbled into a traitor&#39;s&#39; moral grave, while his compatriots in Great Britain are honoured and exalted. I ask whether honorable senators, opposite are not ashamed that they stand behind such a damnable doctrine. In the Old Country, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henderson</inline> and every Labour supporter stand firmer in the esteem of Labour Democrats than they ever did before on account, amongst other things, of their advocacy of conscription. But in Australia-, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and those who support him. are to have their heads cut off. It would be a baseborn  Democracy that would tolerate such a condition of affairs. We stand here to ask the Democrats of Australia to wipe out of political existence the men who dare to punish  us  for the thoughts that we entertain, Demo.cracy will not submit to that. The Official Labour .junta is like a crooning witch outside her cave, with an immortal and implacable grievance against mankind, sawing the air in every direction with her bony hand and vicious claw, and looking for fresh victims. The Labour leaders are first picked off. From their covert security in the Trades Hall, the cowardly members &#39; of the junta, backed up by honorable senators opposite, snipe the erstwhile leaders of the Labour movement. Why do they not come out into the open and say that every man and woman who voted for conscription should be expelled from the party, and branded as we have been branded? Because they know they would be wiped off the political landscape. But, in their cowardice and malice, from their dug-outs in the Trades Hall, they snipe the leaders of the Labour movement. We are here to shed a ray of sunlight on their murky surroundings. </para>

            <para>- I am telling honorable senators what we did in the Western State, where the elements composing the Labour party are just the same as the elements to be found elsewhere. Why were we given a free hand there? Because of the share we took in beating down the opposition which existed to a proper course of conduct being adopted by this young nation. The result waa that the Western State swung itself behind the Labour Government. But, in the Eastern States, men were expelled even for voting for the referendum. If I understand anything about a Democracy, it is that, if it does not give its units the right to think, to act, and to speak as their consciences dictate, it is not a Democracy at all. I do not understand a Democracy if a man must act as he is told, and must speak as he is directed. Yet that is precisely what members of the junta have sought to do on questions outside the solemn compact into which we entered with the electors. I am here to oppose that sort of thing. If there are any true friends of the Democracy of this country, they are to be found amongst those who were recently expelled from the Labour movement. As one eminent writer hae observed, &#34; Every true Democracy has within it the seeds of its own decay.&#34; Every Democracy has within it the spirit of faction and the spirit of selfishness which pave the way in the end for the incoming of the dictator. In endeavouring to secure for the people liberty to think freely, we are acting as the best friends of true Democracy. We may be beaten, but that does not matter. Now that we have had our say, and are prepared to proffer our swords to the Democrats of Australia, we do so in the hope that we shall be returned triumphantly to push forward a policy which will save this country. Under the system of voluntarism, I have seen some families denuded to the last man, whilst others have held back. As one who is pledged to a policy of equity, how could I witness that sort of thing without a protest ? Never would it occur with my vote. . </para>

        <para>But, apart from that consideration, what I have in my mind is what I am entitled to give this adopted country of mine. Here we possess the most glorious form of freedom to be found the world over - a freedom which has been purchased so cheaply that we do not value it. In my belief, that freedom is now menaced and imperilled. It is because of my desire to hand down to the unborn generations of the future the freedom that we enjoy today that I am acting as I am now, irrespective of consequences. Those unborn generations of Australia are the speechless participants in our actions. We are as much the custodians of their liberty as we are of our own; and if, by any act of folly or cowardice, or by reason of our failing to live up to the traditions of our forefathers, we allow that liberty which is ours in this glorious Australia to be handed down in light-weight fashion, lessened or impaired, future generations will remember us only with shame and regret. I say that we are proud of our forefathers. What section of our forefathers do we hold in dearest esteem ? That section in every land, within&#39; and without the Empire, which has fought against the foes of freedom. But the greatest fight for human freedom has been put up by those men within the Empire of which we form a part. What gives us a glow of pride and pleasure to-day, when we read those stories of the stalwarts of the past, is the independence they manifested right down through the ages in the effort to get that greater measure of human freedom which they themselves never lived to enjoy. They battled again and again. That proud, uncaged spirit of our forefathers was flung again and again against the ramparts of opposition, and finally we had ushered in that glorious freedom that we enjoy to-day. </para>
        <para>Let us keep our manhood in Australia, when 10,000, or 20,000, or 50,000 men would decide the battle in Europe, and Australia alone will be at fault. It is for the purpose, then, of putting in a word for the unborn generations of this country, which has served me so well, that I have shaped the course that I have travelled since this war began. For doing so I have been subjected to no end of imputations and to base insinuations, such as always emanate from base minds. But to those who know me best my reply, like that of my leader, is :. &#34; There stands my blameless record of twenty-five years in the cause of Labour.&#34; And that record will stand against all these base accusations. </para>
        <para>I have, perhaps, unduly prolonged this debate, but I thought it my duty to enter it for the purpose of trying to induce some sweet reasonableness to generate in the minds of members of the Official Labour party opposite. I have endeavoured to show them that we are here, where we stand to-day, on account of the love we have for freedom, to express our thoughts. For that they have persecuted us. But in this election we shall go out on every platform and meet every imputation, every misrepresentation, and every lie. We shall try to chase down every untruth; but we know that falsehood flies, while truth comes lagging after. We shall have a big battle, but, with the object of preserving this free Democracy of ours free to the full, and unimpaired - with the object of handing it on to the generations to follow - we have torn ourselves asunder from the strong party with which we were so long associated, and are prepared to encounter all the violence of the tempest wherever opposition is launched against us. Here we stand to-day, true Labourites, true Democrats, true Australians, anxious that the Empire shall win this war ; anxious to see Australia put her shoulder under the burden, in the final effort, so that victory may at length rest under the banners of the Allies; anxious that we shall have human freedom, that Australia may be able to hold up her head as a participating nation, and. that no country will be able to say to her, &#34; You have not done your share.&#34; We feel certain that, as the result of our appeal to the country, we shall be returned to power, and that the people will thus proclaim to the world that &#34; Australia will be there.&#34; </para>

          <para>- I - I shall come to that in a moment. When the Senate adjourned on Friday afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and I signed a joint cablegram to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy,</inline> not knowing whether he had left the hospital in Tasmania, or was likely to be- able to get here this week or not. The latest information we had received was that he was progressing very well, after undergoing two serious operations, .and we asked in this message whether it was possible for him to leave Launceston for Melbourne by Saturday&#39;s steamer. On Saturday morning we received the following urgent reply from his son: - &#34;Absolutely impossible <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> leave hospital at present juncture. Letter following.&#34; Later in the day we received another cablegram, apparently signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> himself, and authorizing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> as leader of his party in the Senate, to obtain for him a pair, if possible. When on Friday afternoon I referred to the difficulty of getting pairs for two absent senators who were sick, I was under the impression that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> was paired with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;loghlin,</inline> but learned later that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie had made an offer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that he would pair <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy.</inline> During this afternoon&#39;s discussion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> by way of interjection, what authority he had for saying that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> wanted &#34;a pair. So far as I know, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> gave a very fair authority when he read to the Senate the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> to the then Whip of this party, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready.</inline> on the day after the historical Caucus meeting, from which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> walked out and formed his National Labour party. That statement appeared in the newspapers as coming from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> and it was to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> was unable to attend the Caucus meeting on the previous day, but that he was with his party in this crisis. That was quite sufficient to justify the belief that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline> if here, would vote with his party on such a critical division as we expected would be taken to-day on the motion to extend the life of Parliament. </para>

            <para>- If If that is the action of the late Whip, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> it is something else to put down to his credit. I have no wish to say anything cruel or bitter about the action of my late colleague who resigned his place in such peculiar circumstances last week. Naturally, I am deeply pained. It was the shock of my seventeen years&#39; political life when I was told, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> of his resignation at 2 o&#39;clock or a little after on Thursday afternoon. When he took ill at the luncheon table that day, he recovered an hour or two afterwards, and was in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> room. I was there sympathizing with him. He said he did not feel at all well, and had been working too hard, and I reminded him that I had told him a long time before that he was overdoing it. He suggested that he might not be successful at the coming election, but he never said a word to make me think that he intended to resign. It was a remarkable thing that somebody knew two or three days before that he was going to resign. </para>

            <para>- The The Government asked us on Friday afternoon to meet at &#39; 11 o&#39;clock to-day - a most unusual day and hour - to discuss the motion to extend the life of Parliament. Up to that hour it was currently supposed, and reported every day in the press, when the newspapers were counting heads, that all the senators on the Government side would vote for the motion. I do not know what right the papers had to take that for granted. There appeared to be no chance of the motion being carried, as the Senate was then constituted, until Senator Ready handed his resignation in on Thursday afternoon, and his place was filled with such lightning celerity on Friday morning by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle.</inline> There was another change, however, between Friday and to-day. No doubt every elector in Tasmania will be pleased at the action Senators Bakhap and Keating have taken, giving the people, as it does, an opportunity to pronounce judgment, and will commend them for having broken away from the rest of their party on this question, contrary to what the newspapers generally anticipated. But I believe that those two honorable senators, like myself, would have welcomed another method of obtaining a decision on the circumstances surrounding the whole of our proceedings during the last few days. Tasmania contains two very Conservative newspapers - the Launceston <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> and the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> - that have always been opposed to the Labour party, and have been, and still are, strong supporters of the Liberal party. On Saturday both referred in strong terms to what had happened. The <inline font-style="italic">Mercury,</inline> especially, declared that the part, played by the Premier of Tasmania and the Prime Minister brought discredit on the State. Whether a Royal Commission was appointed, to consist of a Judge of the Supreme Court, trained in the taking of evidence and able to judge its value- </para>

            <para>- E - Except for the first three or four years the honorable senator and I have been opposed to one another, but we have always been able to say that we fought each other fairly. The whole of the circumstances surrounding the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> without first consulting his colleagues and the immediate filling of the vacancy by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> appeared in the Conservative newspaper in Hobart to have such a peculiar look about them that they came out on Saturday with a very strong article demanding that there should be some sort of inquiry. It would have been better for the Government if they had consented to the appointment of a Royal Commission. I came here this morning not knowing that the Government were going to announce that they proposed to have an election, and it was my intention to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> whether he had read the leading article in the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury,</inline> which really imputed improper motives to the Prime Minister and to the Premier of Tasmania, and whether the Government, in view of that leading article, would reconsider their decision and agree to appoint a justice of the High Court as a Royal Commissioner; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> caught the eye of the  President  first, and moved the adjournment of the Senate, and on his motion this debate has proceeded so far. When we have a Supply Bill before us there will be further opportunities of discussing many other phases of the question. I merely rose at this stage because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> had made reference to our demand for pairs for the sick Tasmanian senators who were unable to get here, and because those two senators had offered certain explanations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> said that he had not been asked for a pair. As Government Whip for the first Deakin Government he knows that it is not usual for a senator to ask another to pair with him. The usual course for the honorable senator wishing to get a pair is to go to the Whip. </para>

            <para>- I d o not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> actions were in the last few days. They were so peculiar that I do not think we can take them into account. I do not propose to say anything more unkind about them than that, though they were very inexplicable to me. If there was one person in the Senate to whom he should have divulged his intention to resign it was myself. I was the only other one of the four Labour senators in Tasmania able to be in attendance, and I had many private conversations with him during the last week or two, at which he often stated his fear that his chances at the next elections were not too good, and that he did not feel very well; but he did not hint that he intended to resign his place in the Senate. I accompanied <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to the Commercial Travellers&#39; Club on Thursday, about 1 o&#39;clock. We went there to endeavour to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> but we were told that he was out. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> returned to Parliament House, but I waited at the club until 2 o&#39;clock, -hoping that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> would come in. I thought that, perhaps, he had gone out to see his doctor. It was on the previous day that he had become ill. However, he did not return, and I came back to Parliament House about 2 o&#39;clock. Just before I got here <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> had spoken to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> on the telephone, and I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> said that he would let <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> know within an hour whether he would be able to vote that afternoon. However, a few minutes later <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> telephoned to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> and said that he had sent in his resignation. </para>

            <para>- T - The circumstances are remarkable. The Premier of Tasmania hurried away from the east coast to Sydney to meet the Prime Minister there, and came back with him to Melbourne on the Wednesday, and was with him on that day in Melbourne. The s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> was to have left Melbourne at 3 o&#39;clock on that afternoon, but was detained for some little time. I had it on fair authority that she was detained for the Premier of Tasmania. He had not finished his business whatever it was, and he rushed down to the. steamer at the last moment. He left Melbourne on the very day that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> was ill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> resignation was not announced to the Senate until after the dinner adjournment on the Thursday evening. The  President  told us that he got it at one minute after 6 o&#39;clock, and that he had to wire it to the Governor of Tasmania. Consequently it could not have been in the hands of the State Governor until well after 6 o&#39;clock on the Thursday evening. Yet that very night the Executive Council of Tasmania met and appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> to fill the vacancy. The remarkable despatch with which all these things were done lends colour to the statements of numbers of people that something very unusual has occurred, and for that reason it would be a good thing if an independent Commission, free from any party influence - a Royal Commission consisting of a Justice of the High Court - investigated not only the whole of the circumstances of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> resignation, but also the charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson.</inline> I say it would be a good thing, because in these times every one seems to be viewed with suspicion, and the motives of those who ask for an independent and unquestionable tribunal to investigate any and every circumstance surrounding the whole of the business cannot be impugned. That is why in the interests of Tasmania I should like to see a Royal Commission appointed as another method of testing these accusations. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ready</inline><inline font-style="italic">is</inline> to make his own statement in the press of Tasmania, I understand, and until that statement appears I will  say  no more, except that the whole business seems very strange, and in the interests of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ready</inline> - if he is innocent - perhaps more than any other man, it is desirable that inquiry by a Royal Commission should be held. </para>

            <para>- Their actions took them out. We do not bother about them. Notwithstanding all the virtues said to be possessed by the gentlemen who have left the Labour party, I have no doubt that the party will continue to do the work which it set out to do many years ago. The development  to-day  must have come as a great surprise to the Government. The gentlemen who manoeuvred to bring about the result which they thought they had obtained on Friday found themselves obliged to-day to immediately move the adjournment of the Senate, although on Friday they deliberately decided to call the Senate together this morning with the express intention, I have not the slightest doubt, of gagging through, willy-nilly, the motion for the prolongation of Parliament. </para>

            <para>- No doubt the Government would have had a  job  to do so. The statements that have been made during the last few days will come as a great surprise to the electors, because after, all the people, taken in the lump, are fair and desirous of doing the just thing, as they want a fair thing done by them. But although they may forgive politicians for the ordinary political manoeuvring to attain the objects they have in view, I am confident that the statements made in the Senate last week staggered most electors in the Commonwealth. It has been said during the day that the people will take very little notice of the charges levelled against the Government because of the fact that one individual went into a private room and had a confidential conversation, and subsequently went to two other persons in turn to have further confidential conversations. But the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> are, on the whole, neither discredited nor denied by the gentlemen who have interested themselves in trying to ridicule the importance of what the honorable senator said. I believe that I am as fair as most men, and have a desire to find out the best in men and give them credit for their good points rather than their bad ones. But the people of the country have been watching with suspicion the men who are the main-springs of the present Government for quite a long while. Some honorable senators criticise us for belonging to a junta, but they belong to a worse one, comprising a few men, whom some honorable senators opposite have been fighting all their lives. Like a number of other people, I will not base my judgment merely on what was said during the last few days, but will look for further guidance from the doings that preceded the latest sensational developments. As the Leader of the Labour party I regarded <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> with great admiration. I knew he was a man who might show an opponent a sharp point, but I never expected that he would go to such lengths as he has gone during the last twelve months in his dealings with men who have been associated with him for the length of time mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> He was one of the last men I should have expected to do things which would sever his connexion with the Labour party ; he was one of the last men I desired to do such things, and while he was absent in the Old Country I was constantly defending him against people who had doubts as to what he would do on his return to Australia. I did not believe that he would ever endeavour to enslave the young men of this country by imposing on them the yoke of conscription. &#39;I believed his statement in the House of Representatives before he left Australia that he would be absolutely opposed to sending a man out of Australia to fight against his will. </para>

            <para>- I am sorry that I do know that. Those speeches have been made since he assured honorable members in another place that he would never send one man out of Australia against his will. I never thought that the present Prime Minister would turn his back on the principles of a lifetime. It has been stated that the gentlemen who have left the Labour party did so because they were required to do something to which they were not pledged, that did not appear in the Labour platform, and was not in accordance with the spirit of the Labour movement, but was being enforced by a secret junta since the war. The whole history of the Labour movement refutes that statement. There is the fact that when the Defence Bill was being put through Parliament, members of the Labour party fought against a clause which the Government of the day desired to include, providing for compulsory military service anywhere inside the Empire. </para>

            <para>- With all due respect to the Minister, there was some such proposition in the Senate, because speeches against compulsory military service outside Australia are on record, and I believe I am right in saying that the Labour party forced the Government to take that clause out of the Bill, and leave it as it stands to-day. That being the case,&#34; what is the use of any member who belonged to the Labour party saying there is nothing in the spirit of the movement to show where it stood ? The whole history of our movement, the whole spirit of it, hag been against that sort of thing. There is no doubt about it. When this question came forward the leaders of the Labour movement watched the happenings from day to day, and when they read the utterances of some of their public men, was it any wonder that the organizations began to doubt and fear that some of their representatives might not be as solid in the interests of the movement and of Australia as they were expected to be ? They met in conference on very many occasions, not especially to discuss this particular matter, but to deal with their ordinary routine business. This subject of conscription became pressing, and they were never backward in expressing their views upon it whenever an authoritative Labour body met in conference. Let there be no mistake about that. There are on the other side of the Senate to-day gentlemen who sat in conference, and voted against conscription at the Hobart Conference. They voted without any protest of any kind, so that the resolution opposing conscription was carried without a dissentient voice. In the face of all this, what is the use now of turning round and accusing members on this side of doing something that is not in the interests of &#39;the Labour movement ? The other day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> said we were lying with our ears to the ground, listening to the murmurings of discontent from the people who belonged to our organization. Well, I have been in the Labour movement as long as most honorable senators, and I want to make it clear that I am fighting now, as I have always fought, against conscription. Outside the Parliament I have occupied more important positions in the Labour movement than probably any other honorable senator, and I am entitled, therefore, to talk with something like authority as to what this movement means. I resent very keenly indeed any aspersions cast upon the organizations that made it possible for the laws of Australia to be so democratic. Though we were charged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> with having our ears to the ground, I want to point out that for quite a long time before this question became acute I was fighting against it in the organizations. During that time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> was fighting for conscription. He made no secret of it. He did not wait for the organizations to talk, but was out on his own account advocating conscription while I was fighting against it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> talks about all the craven hearts on this side of the Chamber, and, in reply, may I remind him that there are many senators who all their, lives have been courageous enough to fight in the interests of those who were most oppressed in this country? </para>

But, as I have already said, I have always been against conscription. Because he went to his own State, and fought against it there,  he claims that he converted his organization. </para>

            <para>- Yes, and when there is a difference of opinion on an important question, the issue is threshed out among the members. Then, when a decision has been arrived at by a majority vote, there is a solid fight by all its members, irrespective of what individual opinions may be. We could not run an organization without adopting this course of action. Members of the Labour movement do not necessarily see eye to eye with one another on all subjects. We have differences of opinion, but we have sense enough to know that these have to be settled inside our organizations, and then we must fight loyally side by side to accomplish the object aimed at. I have done that times out of number, and so has nearly every other member. I do not mind these differences of opinion at all, so long as I have my say, and if the majority are against my view, well, I know I can accomplish nothing on my own, and so I accept the decision. This does not deprive me of the opportunity of fighting inside the organization for my view, and, perhaps, later on of accomplishing what I desire. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has spoken of the want of courage of members on this side, and, in reply, I quote as a typical instance the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> who went to the West, and fought his organization there. They gave him a free hand, and he came over to Victoria, and fought against conscription. He then went back during the campaign, and fought in Western Australia against it. I venture to say that when the history of that campaign is written <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> attitude will be in striking contrast to the actions of some of the people on the other side. The charges launched against the Government, and the reception of those charges by the Ministry, will not be judged merely by what was said last week. One of the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> was very misleading, to say the least of it. He said that we met here in a room, and, after hearing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> without a protest, we went, on our knees almost, and asked him to go to the organizations. That is absolutely wrong. I addressed some words to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and other members said something similar. As nearly as I can remember my words, I said, &#34; If you want to do that you will have to go to the organizations, and I do not think that you have a hope.&#34; There was the situation. I knew that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had no chance of doing what he desired. When he came back he thought that he had the whole country behind him, because a few daily newspapers in Australia were giving him a lot of space, and publishing a number of erroneous things as to public sentiment here. Then the fight started. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> came out as a most virulent advocate of conscription. We have been charged with saying nasty things about him and others who fought us. I believe that I fought the issue pretty fairly. I used the arguments which I thought would convince the people. I did not think that abuse of anybody would have much influence in that way. But that cannot be said of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> I believe that everything which has been said about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and the people who accompanied him in the first place was warranted by what he had said about them. The fight got very warm, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> could find a new cablegram at almost any minute of the day, and pull it out of his pocket to show that General Haig or General Robertson had stated that they wanted so many men. One day the number was 5,000 a month, and another day it was 16,000 a month. When that plan did not act, the cable was set to work again, and General Birdwood was prevailed upon to send out a despatch imploring the Commonwealth to send so many thousand men. People doubted this kind of message, because it did not coincide with what we knew were the real facts. The fight got still warmer. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> found, from the reception which he and the advocates of conscription received all over Australia, that lie was not going to have the cake-walk he anticipated on his return from England, and so he began to use another joke. A man named Reginald Turnbull was put up in a place called Wedderburn to write a letter stating that something had been written to him by Lieutenant Jacka, V.C., at the front. Some person wrote a letter saying that there was no such man living in Wedderburn. A challenge was issued that the conscriptionis&#39;ts could not produce the man, and he has not been produced to this day. Next, an alleged cable was received from Jacka himself. All this kind of thing has led up to the present situation. The people of Australia are by no means clear in their minds that either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> or the gentlemen who are following him now, and who were responsible for this kind of thing, can be safely trusted with the control of the interests of the Democracy of Australia. There is the whole position. These questions, and a great many more than I have mentioned, in addition to the charges which were made last week, will be considered by the public of Australia. </para>

I entertain a very grave suspicion of a man or a Government who would be guilty of allowing these cablegrams to come through, and to be published in this country; of a man who would be guilty of writing a circular advocating his own view to the soldiers at the front, and who would allow a General to do the same thing, and to interfere in politics, where we all understood a soldier was not to interfere if he was acting in an official capacity. </para>

A man who would be capable of doing these things and suppressing the messages which our people wanted to send, or a Government which would tolerate that sort of thing, can blame no persons who entertain very serious doubts about their integrity. The people of this country, desirous, as they are, of doing the fairest thing both to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and to his followers here, will call them to account for all these most suspicious circumstances. Those people gloried in a fight while standing shoulder to shoulder with us; but what did they do when they got to the other side ? They turned round, from the late Leader downwards, and every time they called us sneeringly a junta, and yet we were the same body of men whom they had worked with for years. -There is no difference in the movement. </para>

            <para>- I dealt with the circumstances before the honorable senator came in.  If  he had been here, I think that he would have allowed, if it was possible for him to be fair, as I believe it is, that I put up a pretty reasonable case for the stand which I and others on this side are taking. When this section broke away from the Labour party, they thought they could save Australia, but they found that, after all&#39;, another disappointment awaited <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> He thought that all he had to do was to hold up his hand, and that we would follow him to the death, the lot of us; but only a remnant of the party did. He found that he could not govern the country, and that he had to fall on the necks of all the Tories of Australia, and get them to help him. I do not think that there is any man who is more capable of setting out what coalitions are than the honorable gentleman who now has the honour to be Prime Minister of Australia.&#34; I believe that a great sage is credited with saying, &#34;Oh . . . . that mine adversary had written a book.&#34; The Prime Minister wrote a book, and a part of it is devoted to coalitions.

            <para>- I am older; but I believe that I could enjoy this incident even now if I saw it. Most of the farmers round this little village owned a lot of cattle, and many of them owned bulls. A few boys used to go out a couple of miles on one side of the town, and two or three boys would go out a couple of miles on the other side of the town. Each party would take a bull out of a farmer&#39;s paddock and drive him towards the town, and of course when the bulls met there- would be some trouble. This incident occurred just about the time when the fields at Broken Hill were discovered - that is before the railway went through. Everybody was trying to get rich quickly by carting produce of one sort or another to Broken Hill. Teams were in great request, and several men who could drive horses and afford to buy them, went up there and drove loading from Terowie to Broken Hill. A noted conductor of oxen came from the North and tried to get a team with which to take loading from Terowie. As he could not get the bullocks that he wanted, he bought those in our town that had been fighting each other all their lives. But although he got them under the yoke, and as far as Terowie, they were so accustomed to fighting - like the members of the Ministerial party - that he could not get them to Broken Hill. Honorable members opposite set out to win the war, and arranged a coalition between life-long enemies, but they have not got even so far as Terowie. To vary the metaphor, they have fallen at the first fence. Other honorable senators have spoken of the rush that there has been for the spoil, the fight between the old political cormorants of both parties. It took six or seven weeks to arrive at the decision  that  in the new Administration there should be six Liberal portfolios, the remaining posts going to the Labour members of the coalition, who, nevertheless, claim to be governing Australia. The country is really under Tory rule. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> are all members of the Ministry, and the records of this Parliament and of the State Parliaments show that these gentlemen have always been the strongest opponents of political sentiment, and have always, by voice and vote, tried to stifle the views of the advanced speakers of Australia. When it became a question of choosing delegates to represent Australia at the Imperial Conference, the Tory elements of the Administration came to the fore. Fancy <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, who was responsible for the Victorian Coercion Act, and who tried to suppress the railway men of Victoria, representing the Australian Democracy ! Fancy <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest doing so I We are told by one of this- morning&#39;s newspapers that while we shall have three delegates at the Conference, only one of them will be allowed to vote, and we may be sure that if any kudos is to attach  to the voting, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> being in a minority, will not be the one who will vote; it will be one of the two Tories who will do so. As to the winning of the war, I, like other Australians, wish to see the war won by Great Britain and her Allies, and I think that we can do best by letting the people be convinced by what they hear and see of the need for action on their part. I may be asked, &#34; What have you done in the way of urging young men ,to enlist for the front?&#34; I frankly admit that I have done nothing in that way. My reason is that the great organs of this country, which are&#39; responsible for the dissemination of news and information, have put clearly before the people the circumstances of the case, and it is&#39; for them to do as they think right. I have not) gone on the platform to ask another man to do what I have not done, and I have no sons at the front, having none of an age to serve there. </para>

            <para>- We do thank you for what is now proposed, but I would remind the Senate that we asked the Government to do this last week, and had Ministers been anxious to go to the country, they would have taken the opportunity then to propose what they now propose. We asked that the House of Representatives and the retiring half of the Senate should be sent to the country at the same time, to lessen the expense df the election, and to give the people an opportunity to choose a Parliament in which it would have confidence. I trust that in the future there will be less vituperation in political discussions. Some of those opposite did fine work when members of the Labour party, and I have no wish to detract from the credit due to them, but I remind them that they will never obtain the confidence of the people by throwing mud on those who represent the people. There mav have been a time when it was possible to gain votes in that way, but the Democracy is now too well informed to be deceived, and in future political parties will obtain power, not because of their ability to throw mud, but because of their legislative and administrative actions. Those who think that they will be returned to the Treasury Bench by besmirching others will be disappointed. I trust that in future the tone of political discussion will be more reasonable, and that the members of this party will be regarded as being as capable of carrying on the Labour movement as any of those who have left it. The movement will go on in spite of the defection of honorable senators opposite. The Labour party may be out of power for a year or two, but it is as certain as that the sun will rise to-morrow that the representatives of the people will again be in the ascendant, and top the poll, dominating and guiding the destinies of Australia. </para>

          <para>.- I think those who have had the pleasure, as I venture to say it was, of listening to the speech of the honorable senator who has just resumed his seat, will agree with me that it stands out in sharp contradistinction to the other speeches to which we have listened from honorable senators opposite. It was a speech from which many of us will differ, but, at any rate, it was free from vituperation. It was an earnest effort to deal with facts, circumstances, principles, and movements.  Although I say we may differ from the conclusions at which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> arrived, we must recognise that his was a serious contribution to the debate. I have to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> also for one statement which he made. He admitted frankly - and the honorable senator is always frank - that the question of no-conscription was not a definite plank of the Labour platform. But the honorable senator said that it was in conformity with the spirit of the movement. That settles one very important point. The gentlemen who have been expelled from, or forced out of, the Labour movement, have now the assurance of a high official in the movement that they have not broken any specific plank of the Labour platform, but that, in some way or other, they have violated that intangible, mysterious, and indefinite thing called the spirit of the movement. I propose to quote from the same book and the same author as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> has just quoted from with so much pleasure and satisfaction. I find these words in this book - </para>

        <para class="block">Here we have a statement in this hook, which is quoted from time to time by honorable senators opposite. They have accepted it as their bible, and have carried it from platform to platform, and when they have been at a loss for an argument, they have gone to this book to draw inspiration from it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> has said that no specific plank of the platform was broken by those who advocated conscription, and we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> assurance that the pledge relates only to the platform. We come, then, to the statement that it is the spirit of the movement that has been violated. When we come to deal with the spirit of a movement, we are dealing with something upon which no two men are likely to entertain exactly the same views. If I speak of the spirit of justice, my honorable friends opposite will say that they also speak of it; but they interpret it in an entirely different way. No man here will for a moment deny that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> in interpreting the spirit of the movement on the subject of conscription as he did, believed that he was acting in accordance with the spirit of right and justice. No man present will venture to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> in his advocacy, of conscription, was not animated in the same way. These are two members of the same movement, and yet they put an entirely different interpretation upon the spirit of the movement, and their honesty and courage cannot be impugned. What happened ? Some body outside, that has been called by some persons a &#34;junta,&#34; and that is by others worshipped as the guiding force controlling the Labour movement, says, &#34;Unless all belonging to the movement accept the interpretation which we place on the intangible thing we call its spirit, they commit the unpardonable sin.&#34; There never was an attempt to exercise a more diabolical tyranny. One set of men interpret for the guidance of all others the thing which they call the spirit of the movement. We have to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> for having made clear beyond dispute the sin those gentle men have committed who were expelled from the movement to which they had been loyal for so many years. </para>
        <para>I wish now to make a brief reference to the controversy which has been raised by the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson.</inline> This is the only point I shall put for the consideration of honorable senators: This is a matter in which four men are concerned. These, and these alone, have made statements. One has made a statement which amounts to an accusation against the other three. The other three deny that statement. Passing from that, let me say that, in my judgment, acts speak louder than words. I propose to test the veracity of the statements that have been made by that simple test. I ask any honorable senator here whether, if I went to him and levelled a deadly insult at him, his attitude towards me the next day, and the day after, would be the same as it was before I had insulted him. - I go to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKissock</inline> or to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> and launch a deadly insult at him. Is it possible to believe that either of them would treat me next day as he treated me before I insulted him ? That is a question which honorable senators can answer for themselves. I venture to say that there is no member of the Senate who, if I insulted him to-day, would to-morrow meet me on the same footing as he did before I had insulted him. We have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> stating that he was insulted by the  President  - for it is an insult to suggest to any man an improper course of action. </para>

            <para>- But I am going to offer it, and it is that the less frequently the honorable senator makes explanations the better for himself. In view of the admissions - I say again, the admissions - made by the honorable senator that there was a point - some point - at which it dawned on his mind, and he came to the conclusion that a sinister movement had been set afoot, I wish to know what was, then, the change of attitude on the part of the honorable senator towards <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce, Mr. Hughes,</inline> or the  President.  If any one came to me now and insulted me, would I meet him to-morrow as if nothing had happened ? You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President, Senator Pearce,</inline> and the Prime Minister can say whether there was any change in the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson.</inline> If there was not, then you must come to the conclusion either that the charges have been trumped up at the last moment, or that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> could carry a deceitful and false face, pretending he was your friend, while all the time he was preparing to strike you down in the eyes of the people of the country. That is all I have to say on that point. Feeling as I do that, whatever may have induced <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> to take the course he has, it is part and parcel of a deliberate attempt to pursue the Prime Minister of the country with vendetta to which no Sicilian would have yielded. I am amused at the frantic effort made by some honorable senators opposite to remind us that we on this side are not altogether in unison on certain matters. Do they think, when they remember the purpose which brought us together, that reminders and taunts of that sort will shake our allegiance to our common cause - the welfare of this country. It is not necessary to remind us that we are not altogether in unison. I have been an opponent of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> for twenty years, and I have keen recollection of times when I have smarted under his tongue and treatment which I considered not too generous. I dare say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in turn can remember times when he has nursed a grudge against the Liberals. What does it matter about Labour men or Liberals to-day, when we are faced with a great and common danger. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is free &#39;to say that he entertains all his Labour principles as I am to say that I have not forsaken any Liberal principle; but when a national danger threatens, we can surely agree to leave, our domestic policies in the domestic cupboard, and address ourselves to the greater issues, which we can only ignore to the detriment, the danger, and, possibly, the extinction of this nation and the Empire. Let me assure my honorable friends opposite that there is no need to remind us of the points on which we differ, because, every time they do so, they bring clearly before us the points on which we are in agreement. We are reminded that we are not a united party, and on many matters we are not; but I can assure my honorable friends that they are doing more than anything we can do to unite this party - that by these constant vitriolic and contemptible attacks on the Prime Minister, they are raising, not only here but outside, the sporting spirit of the community, who recognise that what is wanted is the head of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> on a charger, and it is for that his enemies are dancing. I am mistaking the temper of the people if I assume for one moment that there will not, as a result of this, be a declaration that honorable senators may use fair political weapons and beat the enemy as they can ; but that  those honorable senators are making it clear to-day that the Prime Minister is the victim they are seeking - that honorable senators are saying, &#34;Give us that, and all things else shall be added unto us.&#34; The country recognises the object of those who are opposed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> They may say they left the Prime Minister because of his advocacy of conscription. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, it</inline> is not true. Those gentlemen did not leave the Prime Minister for that reason, as all the records show. If it was because of his advocacy of conscription, why did they not leave him when he first advocated it?. Conscription could never have been submitted as an issue to the people had not my honorable friends opposite supported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in what he was doing. The question of conscription was naturally brought up in the party room and discussed there, and those opposed to it had it in their power to say to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> &#34; We do not believe in it, and we will not go with you.&#34; They knew that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> advocated conscription then; and why did they not leave him ? Later on, when the Bill came here and to another place, did my honorable friends vote against the Government ? Not a bit of it. There were eight of them who did so, I believe, after having pledged themselves to support the resolution arrived at in Caucus. When the proposal came here, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> said that he was not only going to consult the electors, but was going to advocate it, did they leave him then? No. They did not then know what the verdict was going to be, and they would not run away from a leader who might possibly be a victor. They, therefore, waited for the result of the ballot; and then their organizations got to work, and honorable senators left <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> - not because of conscription, but because the organizations had told them to do so. </para>

        <para>Just one word more. I regret having to refer to this matter, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will pardon me for doing so, in view of the fact that he himself has previously referred to it. I am now speaking of a conversation 1 was privileged to have with that honorable gentleman and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap.</inline> 1 desire, first - and I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will not misunderstand me - to express some surprise that this conversation was ever referred to in the Chamber. I say at once that there was absolutely nothing in the conversation - my two honorable friends will, I believe, support me - which might not have been related here. But there has been an accepted code that conversations entered into by honorable senators, no matter how innocent or trivial those conversations mav be, are not to form the subject of discussion here. I, therefore, express some surprise that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> should make any reference to it without, at any rate, first asking me how I felt on the matter. </para>

            <para>- I quite .accept that statement, but still I think there is a possible danger if, for any reason, there are too frequent references to conversations outside. If such should become a habit, intercourse outside the chamber will be rendered absolutely impossible. As to the conversation, I say at once that the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> so far as my &#39;recollection goes, is entirely accurate; it is certainly so in substance. There is one other matter, and I refer to it because honorable senators have been saying that the action taken by the Government in proposing, instead of proceeding with business, to consult the electors, is due to the discovery that two honorable senators, who ordinarily support the Government, are not certain, apparently, to do so now. It -is assumed that the speeches of Senators Bakhap and Keating gave them some warrant for imputing that .the action now proposed by the Government was taken in consequence of the views which those honorable senators entertained. </para>

            <para>- There was not a single word uttered at that interview, either by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> which could be construed, even by a Philadelphia lawyer, into a statement of how they were going to act in regard to that motion. Therefore I parted from them without being in any way able to form a conclusion from what they had said. But there are other means of forming a conclusion. Up to the time they spoke here I did expect from them a vote which would have given the Government a majority  in this chamber. I argued, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has argued this evening, that it was quite reasonable that I should regard them as supporters of the Government in the case of a party vote. </para>

            <para>- On Thursday night. I then argued, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has argued to-night, that the long association of these gentlemen with the party to which I belong was some reason upon which I could found the hope that they would vote with the Government. In addition, I had bo recollect that they were members of the party which had brought this alliance into existence. I thought that these gentlemen, who are largely responsible for my being where I am bo-day, would  not a fortnight after the Government was formed &#34; .throw me to the dogs.&#34; I knew there were doubts in .their minds, but still I thought that when it came to the real test they would not desert me. There was a third reason which induced me to think that we should have them behind us. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> informed me on Thursday night that he would be leaving for Tasmania on Friday afternoon. I ventured to point out to him that if he did so it was improbable that he could return in time to record his vote. Still he informed me that it was his intention to go. I have not spoken to him since, except to pass the time of day. The next day, however, I learned that he had not left for Tasmania. Was it strange that I assumed that he had remained here to help the Government out of the hole in which otherwise it would have been placed 1 I may have entirely misjudged the position, but I want to say that until these gentlemen spoke this morning I had come to the conclusion, based on the facts I have related, that in a critical matter involving the whole policy of the Government, I could look to them for the votes necessary to insure the safety of the proposition. </para>

            <para>- I am speaking with the wealth of that experience to back me up. It, therefore, became apparent to the Government, not that we could not carry the proposal to prolong the life of this Parliament, but that, after having carried it, we should be landed - where ? We might manage to struggle oh for a month or two, or perhaps for three months, but we could not pass a regulation without being challenged. An accident to one of our members in the way of detention from the Senate, and the whole business of the Government would be frustrated. </para>

            <para>- I venture to differ from the honorable senator. When this Chamber resumed its business on the formation of the new Ministry I endeavoured to make my speech as unimpassioned as possible, and asked honorable senators for their co-operation. I told them that without it the Government could not carry on. What took place for a few days I thought was the natural effervescence of spirits bottled up. I did hope that after having fired off their animal spirits honorable senators would have turned round and said, &#34;Now we will lift the Government business along.&#34; But day after day has made it plain that honorable senators opposite intend to give no quarter. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> does not often speak, but when he speaks his speeches are very useful. Senators Barker and Gardiner have both stated that they will give the Government no quarter. We know the nature of the opposition we have to face. While I thought before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> spoke that we could get the motion through, it now appears that the only result would have been to land us out pf one difficulty into another. From my experience, gained in that memorable session in the other House, and knowing the character and capacity of honorable senators opposite for mischief, it was impossible to suppose that we could carry on either with profit to the country or with credit to ourselves. This brought us to the one conclusion submitted to the Senate to-day, that the only  solution of the difficulty was not to tamper with it longer, but to remit the issue to the electors. </para>
