                        <para>- I desire, with the indulgence of the Senate, to make a short statement regarding a matter which concerns the conduct of the business of Parliament. In the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 30th August there is a long article under the heading of &#34; Commonwealth Extravagance,&#34; which purports to set out details of largely increased expenditure for the current financial year in the various Commonwealth Departments, including Parliament. With the statement regarding other Departments I have no official concern, and desire to make no mention of them beyond saying that if they are no more accurate than the statement regarding Parliament they would be a fitting subject for amused contempt rather than serious consideration. </para>

                            <para>- It also tries to convey .a very unfair impression by asking the question, &#34; Why were the salaries of Ministers increased ?&#34; As a matter of fact, the salaries of Ministers have not been increased by even a farthing; they , are exactly the same as last year. The slight difference shown in the amounts set out is due to the fact that last year some of the portfolios were vacant for several weeks. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    <para>The general suggestion in the statement, plainly, is that a larger amount has been provided under . each item for the current year than was provided last year. The fact is that in no case is the provision made on the Estimates for the current year greater than that made for last year, with the exception of a very small increase under the item &#34;Printing.&#34; The apparent increase is produced by comparing the amount spent last year with the amount estimated for this year. And this, I think, it will be admitted, is a most unfair comparison. </para>
                    <para>Pour of the items are what are known as &#34; Special Appropriations.&#34; These amounts are specified in the  Acts  providing for the services, and are not strictly part of the votes of each year. </para>
                    <para>The amounts set out for 1917-18 for (1) Ministers&#39; salaries, (2) Senators&#39; allowances, (3) Allowances to members of the House of Representatives, and (4) Public Works Committee, are the amounts provided for under the Acts dealing with the matter, and the full amount is not necessarily spent during the year. </para>
                    <para>The less&#39;er expenditure in some items last year is accounted for by the fact that last year the House of Representatives was dissolved, which, of course, meant that no allowances were paid to the members until the election had taken place. Also, a senator, who was contesting a seat in the House of Representatives, resigned, and for some weeks his seat as a senator was vacant, and no allowance had to be paid. The Public Works Committee has not been appointed since the dissolution, and consequently no fees have been payable to its members. Further, the expenditure under certain contingencies votes cannot be computed with certainty. For example, provision has to be made for necessary expenses in case a Select Committee is appointed by either House. If no such Committee is appointed, the whole vote is saved. </para>
                    <para>I would not have referred to this matter but for the fact that there is apparently in some quarters a desire to continually misrepresent Parliament and to distort its proceedings and every fact connected with it, seemingly with a desire to mislead the public. It is important that the proceedings of Parliament, and all facts connected with it, should be accurately placed before the people, whom Parliament represents and who are chiefly concerned. That is why I have deemed it expedient to correct the gross misstatement of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> at the earliest opportunity. </para>

                    <para>I may say, with regard to this and the other Bills, the preliminary stages of which have been so promptly dealt with, that they in no sense involve any principle, but are intended to make certain necessary amendments of the law, and in the case of this particular measure, to place the Treasurer in a position from time to time to pay into the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Trust Fund such sums of money as may be available in the Treasury. This Bill conveys authority to appropriate &#163;10,000,000 for this purpose. The Invalid and Old-age Pensions Trust Fund was established some years ago, and moneys paid into it can be withdrawn only for the purpose of paying invalid and old-age pensions. The fund was originally established in order that Commonwealth surplus revenue might be paid into it, instead of being paid to the States under section 94 of the Constitution. Although the necessity which arises under the Constitution has passed away, the practice still continues of paying sums of money from time to time into this fund, which may be called the banking account for invalid and old-age pensions. I do not think that I need say any more in submitting this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. There is not likely to be any disturbance in the direction either of modifying the pensions or repealing the Act, so that Parliament must appropriate money for the purpose. There are two alternative methods which might be adopted. The Government might seek an appropriation from time to time sufficient to meet current needs, or one appropriation might be authorized to cover a larger sum, which, on being paid into the Trust Fund, could be drawn upon from time to time, as the Treasurer was informed as to payments necessary. This Bill will give a general authority, which can be acted upon from time to time as the circumstances of the case require, rather than placing upon Parliament the obligation of making specific appropriations as the money is needed. </para>

If this course were not adopted, the Government would have to ask Parliament to approve of the appropriation of the amount necessary to cover payments, we will say, for the next three months. What is here proposed is to do in a wholesale way what every one knows must be done, and what every one is willing should be done. The Bill is merely asking Parliament to give the Government in this matter a large authority instead of a number of small authorities. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not desire that the passage of this Bill should be delayed, but it is a little difficult to understand why we should be asked to appropriate so large a sum as &#163;10,000,000 for invalid and old-age pensions, when present requirements for the year amount to no more than &#163;3,830,000. The Invalid and Old-age Pensions Trust Fund was established for the purpose of banking our surplus revenue, but it is somewhat peculiar that the Senate, which is the States&#39; House, should apparently be overlooking the rights of the States. We are here dealing with surplus revenue, which belongs to them. It is not that I do not approve of the banking of that surplus revenue for this purpose, but it seems odd that while the Treasurer should have &#163;10,000,000 of , surplus revenue to pay into the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Trust Fund, he should at the same time be borrowing in the London market to enable the State Governments to carry on their public works. No doubt during war time everything is assumed to be for the best, but representatives of the States should be told why they should appropriate surplus revenue to an amount sufficient to meet the demands upon this fund for three years, whilst at the same time we are borrowing money in the London market, at a high rate of interest, to be handed over to the State Governments to enable them to carry on their public works. </para>

                            <para>- It was said generally all over Australia. Now, when the National Government brings in a Bill to secure to the old-age pensioners their pensions for the next three years, doubt is actually expressed from the other side as to the wisdom of tying up a certain amount of money when there is no surplus shown by the Treasurer. The payment of the pensions of the industrial heroes of the past is the first call upon this nation, and I congratulate the Government  upon having introduced the Bill, which I am sure every member of the National party will whole-heartedly support. It seems strange that whatever objection is raised to it- and I did not think there would be any - has come- from the ranks of the Official Labour party. </para>

To say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> in his few remarks, raised objections to the Bill is quite an act of deliberate misrepresentation.

                            <para>- I would much rather have it from a Minister holding a responsible position than from one of his followers. During the election there was, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> says, a good deal of concern in certain quarters about the intentions of the Government party towards the old-age pensions. One Liberal morning newspaper of Melbourne, supporting the honorable senator and his party, published an article dealing with the amount paid for old-age pensions, and pointing out the enormous saving that could be made in the case of the maternity allowance. The honorable senator may forget these things, but in times of excitement, such as a general election, when an official organ of a party - and you can scarcely call any of the big morning newspapers of Melbourne and Sydney anything else than official organs of the Government party - publishes articles actually threatening, by the way they are written, the very existence of matters upon which we are all agreed, alarm is created in the public mind lest a change of Government may mean the loss of the old-age pension. I shall be pleased to have from the Minister an assurance that this Bill is not a mere pretence - that the voting of a large sum of money, extending over a long period of time, is not a device to enable the Government to interfere in any way with old-age pensions. When I see the Government asking for three years&#39; appropriation, I am impelled to ask the reason. I am told that it will expedite matters. But we get through the business so rapidly in this chamber that there is not much reason for trying to make it go through more rapidly. Are the Government making preparation for a&#39; very long recess <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Is it their intention to &#39; make the old-age pensions secure for such a considerable time that the needs of the pensioners will not necessitate calling Parliament together? Had not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle&#39;s</inline> speech set me thinking, I should have been prepared to let the Bill go through without debate. But when he plumes himself on the fact that it is a guarantee given by the Government, the old saying, &#34; Beware of the Greeks when they bring gifts,&#34; comes to my mind. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> takes it as a guarantee that the Government are going to stand by the old-age pensioners, I am perfectly justified in asking the Minister in charge of the Bill to give us the official guarantee of the Government that they will not interfere in any way with old-age pensions for three years. </para>

                            <para>- If there was some misgiving created in the minds of electors as to the position in which the old-age pensioners might find themselves, should the National Government gain a majority, it was only reasonable, seeing that the electors read statements made by leading lights amongst the National candidates, not only during the campaign, but for several years prior to it, on that very subject. </para>

                            <para>- He is now associated with those who, at that time, were fighting the Australian Labour party, and though he may not designate the party on this side as the true Australian Labour party, that does not alter the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle&#39;s</inline> political, associates of to-day are those who were then fighting the Australian Labour party, and were opposed to the establishment of the Federal old-age pensions scheme. I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> to carry his memory back a year or two, to the time when one of the M misters whom he. is now supporting&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jensen),</inline> just on the eve of an election,. when it was too late efficiently to answer his charges, circulated the belief that the old-age pensions would be endangered if the Liberal party got a majority  at  the elections. Does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> remember that incident? And yet to-day he is one of the most loyal supporters of the Ministry which includes that gentleman amongst its numbers. Possibly members of all parties at such  a  time make statements for party purposes, which, perhaps, they do not implicitly believe in. I repeat that if any anxiety existed in the minds* of a large number of electors that the old-age pensions system would not be absolutely safe if the National party came into power, that anxiety was engendered by the utterances of some of the leading lights of Liberalism as well as by statements in the National press during the last campaign. In some parts of Australia a few candidates probably did make such statements, but, speaking for myself, I did not, because, in spite of what some of the Liberal party have said, I do not believe that any party is courageous enough to face an election and intimate that, if successful, the old-age pensions system would be interfered with. With many of them I believe it is a question of letting &#34; &#39; I dare not &#39; wait upon &#39; I would.&#39; &#34; I believe there are some who would like to do this, especially when supported by influential newspaper backing, and when we remember the articles Chat were written during  and  since the election campaign, pointing out how the National Government, with  a majority in both Houses, should practice economy, and how this economy could be effected by doing away with the maternity bonus and by cutting down the old-&#39; age pensions, it is not unreasonable to expect anxiety in the minds of pensioners that the success of the National party would mean some interference with the pensions scheme. Statements of this kind were made very frequently. Like other honorable senators, I have no desire to delay the passing of this Bill, and certainly I should not have spoken but for the very palpable attempt made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> to make political capital out of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> utterances. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> having, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> pointed out, declared that the Government is not to be trusted, and that any assurance is not worth the time taken to utter it, has pleaded pathetically for such an assurance from me with regard to old-age pensions. I am always anxious to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> wishes, and I do give him that assurance, not in the belief that he will accept or act upon it, but in the belief that other people whom he has been endeavouring to persuade into an opposite belief, will accept this assurance that the Government , will not interfere with the old-age pensions scheme. Then if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is not prepared to accept my assurance or that of my colleagues, perhaps he will be inclined to regard more respectfully an assurance from one of his own colleagues . When the Bill was under consideration in another place and was being denounced as unnecessary, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest ventured the opinion that the money would be a guarantee that the pensions would be paid, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs</inline> replied, &#34;That is nonsense. You would pay it anyhow.&#34; I am quite content to take <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs&#39;s</inline> assurance, and I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will also accept that clear recognition by one of the leaders of his own party that nothing is further from the thoughts of the Government than to neglect to give effect to the existing law. </para>

                    <para>We have heard references to official journals. If there is one official journal in Australia it is the newspaper known as the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> - a paper which has not a body or soul to call its own, but which acts under orders. It distinctly pointed out that the old-age pension would be jeopardized if the National party were returned to office. That statement appeared in the official paper, official in the sense that it dared not print a line except under instructions to give effect to the policy preached by the spokesman of the party outside. </para>

When it suits the honorable senator he refers to that newspaper as the official journal of this party. If it should ever happen that I, as a party man, had any claim on ah official journal, I should expect it to give effect and support to the policy of the party. But it is quite clear in this matter that that journal was advocating something for which this party does not stand. The party is saying here, as it showed at the election, that it is not out to lay iconoclastic hands on the old-age pension. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to say a few words in reply to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle.</inline> I am sorry that he went out of his way to misconstrue the few remarks I made. What I put to the Minister was only a fair thing. I do not believe in a Bill appropriating &#163;10,000,000 being put through without somebody saying a word. In my opinion, the Senate has never justified its existence ; and certainly if we go on passing Bills in a sausage-machine way, and without comment, as we are doing to-day, it will never justify its existence. I repudiate the assertion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> that I am in any way interfering with, or delaying, the passage of this measure, or with the appropriation of this money. I asked one or two pertinent questions, and received a reply. I repudiate any assertion that either I, or. any member of my party, said that this Government, if elected, would lessen or do away with the old-age pension. I knew that they would never do it, that they would not dare to do it. I feel quite convinced that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> only rose to say something nasty - to assume something which I never said, which I never attempted to say, and which I never would say. </para>

                    <para>I anticipate that this measure will have the same happy despatch as the last one. In the Freight Arrangements Act, power was given in connexion with vessels owned by the Commonwealth to convey Australian produce, but obviously that provision only permitted the boats to carry cargo from Australia. It did not cover the contingency of the boats returning to Australia with cargo. Consequently, if the terms of the existing Act were to be complied with, the vessels would have to return to Australia in ballast, which, of course, is an undesirable thing to do. What is proposed in this measure, therefore, is to legalize the practice of these boats doing as boats run by commercial companies would do, and that is to make the best arrangements they can for carrying freight from point to point, whether in or out. </para>

                            <para>- The primary purpose of these vessels was to further Australian interests by handling Australian produce. But it follows that if a vessel! carrying Australian produce from here to an oversea port has to come back empty, it is going to cost twice as much to ship Australian produce as it would if she could earn a back freight. Unless my honorable friend means to say that there shall be no imports into Australia, that the vessels shall not bring back even corn  sacks,  it follows that he -is on the horns of this dilemma: He must ask that the outward produce shall bear the cost of a double voyage, or he must consent to the vessels earning something by bringing a freight back. </para>

                        <para>. - I would not have risen to speak on this Bill but for the remarks of the Minister. I understand that the present Ministry is very proud of the fact that these ships are earning very big profits. I question whether the first object with which they were purchased is being pursued. I question whether they are not now steaming about the wide waters of the whole world, seeking cargoes at a high price, and not coming to Australia as often as they should. Nobody, so far as I know, has had any information regarding their movements. We have been told that the profit on the purchase money is very large, and that very remunerative freight arrangements are being made. I heard the other day that one or two ships of the fleet had been chartered for bringing goods from New York. I cannot see why, if a ship leaves here with Australian produce for the Mother Country, a return cargo cannot be obtained from a nearer port than New York. </para>

                            <para>- It may be that priority is being given to Australian produce, and that the ships are to the fullest extent carrying to the Mother Country the stuff which we so badly want to get away from Australia. But from several things I have heard, I am rather inclined to believe that priority of freight for Australian produce is being diverted, and that the primary object of the manager of this fleet is to make money. I submit that it is the duty of the Government to do everything possible to transport overseas the many products which we have accumulating here. To my own personal knowledge, owing to the scarcity of freight, the War Office will not order next season a good deal of the Australian produce which it ordered last season. I would urge upon the Government the wisdom of considering that the management of these steamers should be based on priority of carriage to Australian produce, and that they should not be sent from port to port all round the world in order to earn money out of the products of other countries. The Minister in charge of the Bill has not vouchsafed any information as to what these vessels are doing. I have heard statements made in several quarters to the. effect that they are primarily out for profit rather than for carrying Australian produce overseas.I maintain that they should be employed for the purpose for which they were purchased, and that next season the Government should consider whether some of these vessels ought not to be engaged to carry that freight without which the country cannot procure orders. </para>

If they are unable to get freight in the United Kingdom, why should they not go to New York for it? For all we know to the contrary, these vessels may have been used in transporting to the Continent of Europe the huge fleet of aeroplanes which arrived there only a few days ago. To me, this Bill does not appear to vest in the Director of Shipping sufficient powers. I would like the Vice-President of the Executive Council to make it quite clear that it is competent for that officer to engage in the carriage of general cargo as well as in the carriage of produce. </para>

I hope that I shall yet see them in possession, not merely of cargo vessels, but of passenger ships. I know that the Commonwealth line of steamers has already carried other than Australian produce, and I believe that this measure is intended to validate that act. I congratulate the Government upon their socialistic experiment, and I hope that it will be extended still further. </para>

                            has suggested that it would be better if the Minister made it clear that the Commonwealth line of steamers are authorized to carry general freight. I take it that this Bill will empower them to carry any kind of freight. To my mind, the word &#34; produce &#34; employed in the Bill is used in a very broad sense. But whilst I welcome the measure, I do not think that the remarks of
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline>
                            have received the amount of attention to which they are entitled. He has probably voiced the opinion that is held by a large number of persons in Australia - the opinion that, as far as possible, these , vessels ought to be used for the purpose of carrying Australian produce from our shores, and of bringing back from overseas the goods that we require here. &#39;&#34;Many persons feel strongly that these ships may be used for general freight-carrying purposes when they might be better employed in transporting produce from Australia.

The Australian public does not read the Budget-papers. It merely knows, in a general way, that a certain number of vessels were purchased for the Commonwealth by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> when he was the. Leader of the Labour party, and that they were probably purchased in opposition to the wishes of a number of persons who to-day are supporting him. However, I have no desire to make party capital out of that circumstance. The ships are here, and I believe . that their purchase has been justified. But it would be well if the public were informed of as many of the facts connected with their purchase as the Government deem it desirable it should know. </para>

                        <para>. - In the handling of these vessels it would be well for the Government to put Australian interests first. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> who recently returned from Great Britain, must have learned that the influence of the big shipping companies in England to-day is intensely powerful. The influence, of combines has been one of the dead hands of this war in many respects. In Australia the people will naturally see many things in a clearer light than they can be seen by the people of Great Britain. If, under this Bill, there be any intention to neglect Australia in the handling of our Commonwealth steamers, the Government will be well advised to view the entire business from an Australian stand-point. The war may continue for a considerable time, or it may end suddenly. For a long time I have been hopeful that it will end suddenly. But &#34;hope deferred makes the heart sick.&#34; So far as business relationships between Britain and Australia are concerned, it would be well for the Ministry to hold up the Australian end of them. The interests of Britain are so essentially the interests of big concerns that she has scarcely looked outside of them. When these vessels were purchased, no more ships could have been bought in the Old Country, because the authorities there would not have released them. These facts being known to the Government, it would be well for them to see that Australian business interests are their first concern. If the British Government had despatched ships to Australia for the grain that we have here, there would not be the prospect of a food shortage in Britain that exists to-day. I repeat that it is the duty of the Government to press forward Australian interests in such a way that the people of the Old Country will know exactly what we desire. I trust that we shall put clearly before the British authorities the reason why these Australian ships should be engaged in Australian and British interests,- as viewed through Australian glasses. The fact that the very existence of our producers depends upon their being able to get their products to the markets of the world as expeditiously as possible should cause tha Government to recognise the necessity that exists for using these ships in Australian interests. </para>

                        <para>. - It seems to me that, in a measure, we are losing sight of the fact that we may secure all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> desires by sending Commonwealth vessels on round trips. To-day the building trade of Australia is almost stagnant because it is almost impossible to get supplies of iron from the Old Country. But &#39; it is possible to get them from America. Why, then, should not an Australian vessel carry Australian produce to England, sail thence to New York, and there take on board a cargo of any material necessary for our requirements, and bring it back to us? </para>

                            <para>- Not necessarily. There are many things . made in America that we require. We know why we cannot obtain them in England today. It is because many of the factories there are engaged in the manufacture of munitions. Take the case of galvanized iron, as an example. To-day its price is 400 per cent, higher than it was prior to the outbreak of the war. If that price were reduced to our own people, would it not be in the best interests of Australia ? </para>

                            <para>- At the present time we cannot obtain the sheet-iron to galvanize. But some honorable senators apparently think that it would pay better for our Commonwealth line of steamers to carry wheat to England and to return empty to Australia. For my own part, I believe that those persons who are charged with the management of these vessels are business men. We may be disposed to think that, because there are freight rings, they are always in operation, but honorable senators should bear in mind that the Commonwealth owns these vessels and has the right to direct where they shall trade. If by going to the United States they are able to secure for us goods which we could not otherwise obtain, they will be serving the best interests of Australia. This Bill may serve to enlarge the sphere of operations of our Commonwealth steam-ships, and so demonstrate, what was doubted to some extent at the time they were purchased, that the possession by Australia of her own steam-ships may be in the best interests of the Commonwealth, just as the possession by a State Government of State railways is in the best interests of the State. </para>

                        <para>. -  I point out that, even though the suggestion that these boats are being badly handled had substance in it, it would still not be an argument against the passage of this Bill. If these vessels go from Australia to Southampton, Liverpool, or London they must return in ballast, or with goods, and if they bring back goods we cannot legally carry on our accounts unless we bring the goods for nothing. If it be the desire of honorable senators that these ships should bring back goods, the obviously sound thing to do is to legalize the charging of freight on those goods, rather than to bring them back for nothing. With that explanation I can confidently  rely  upon the support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> for this measure. </para>

Though I do not know the gentleman who is intrusted with the management of these vessels I have confidence in his management. If his action be open to criticism, which I do. not admit, it is still necessary that we should pass this Bill to make legal the freight arrangements for carrying back cargo by these vessels.

                        <para>. -  I do not think that any one objects to legally authorize the management of these Commonwealth steamships to charge freight. I see no objection to the Bill on that account, but I want to say that the country is not informed as to what is going on in connexion with these ships. We do not know whether they are being run as a purely commercial speculation, and to make as big profits as can possibly be made in these abnormal shipping times, or whether the principle that is guiding their management is that o.f giving priority to the &#39; shipment of Australian produce. I wish to urge the Government to give that priority to the shipment of Australian produce. Naturally, a shipping manager desires to earn as big a profit as possible, and naturally, also, it is very pleasing to a Treasurer to be able to say in an annual statement that an expenditure of &#163;1,000,000 or &#163;2,000,000 has resulted in so much profit. My purpose is only to direct the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> to the fact that the original object for which these ships were purchased was to take Australian products to the Mother Country, get back as quickly as possible, and take some more. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is merely to remedy what may be regarded as a bookkeeping technicality. Under the Sugar Purchase Act, an arrangement was made between the Commonwealth Treasurer and the Commonwealth Bank by which the Bank should advance money for the purchase of sugar, and charge interest upon it ; but, at the same time, the Bank agreed to allow credit for any money which it held on Government account under other headings. Under the agreement, the Bank would charge interest only when the Commonwealth owed the Bank more than the Bank owed the Commonwealth. In essence, it is not proposed to disturb that arrangement, but it is proposed for the purpose of the book-keeping of the Bank, and also to meet Treasury audit requirements that, to the extent to which the sugar account is overdrawn, the full amount of interest shall be charged which may be properly debited to it. Having charged the account with that amount of interest, it is paid into the Treasury. This Bill does not in any way affect the arrangement, but is merely for the purpose of enabling the regulations of the Audit Act to be complied with. Every one knows that there are certain restrictions imposed with regard to the Consolidated Revenue Account, which, I suppose, it would not be possible to alter by anything short of a revolution. One is that when money goes into the Treasury, you can only get it out by an appropriation. The arrangement that has been made, and which is a very simple and sound one, has been found open to the slight defect to which I have referred, and which will be remedied by the passing of this Bill. I do not know that I need say any more about the measure than I have already said, except, perhaps, to add that the advantage to the Commonwealth due to the existence of the facilities provided by the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, is an advantage which certain honorable senators may justly congratulate themselves upon. </para>

I should like to discover whether the interest payable by the Commonwealth, and payable by the Bank, balance each other, that is to say, the interest payable to the Commonwealth on the undrawn account, and the interest payable by the Commonwealth on the overdrawn account. </para>

                            <para>- Let me put the matter in this way: Suppose the Commonwealth had to the credit of various accounts in the Commonwealth Bank a sum of &#163;2,000,000. It might or- might not receive interest on that amount. The arrangements between the Bank and the Commonwealth in respect of these balances &#39;are not affected by the arrangement with respect to the purchase of sugar. Whilst in the case I have suggested, the Commonwealth would have a credit in various accounts of &#163;2,000,000, and the sugar account might be overdrawn by &#163;1,000,000, in that case no interest would be charged by the Bank on the overdrawn sugar account. The 5 per cent, interest charge is made only in respect of the amount by which an overdraft on the sugar account exceeds the amount to the credit of the Commonwealth in the Bank under other headings. The Commonwealth Government do not pay interest on an overdrawn account, whilst at the same time it has credit to a greater amount in another account. </para>

I have always understood that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has financed the sugar business on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the only money paid by the Commonwealth Treasurer so far in this connexion has been paid in the shape of duty on sugar imported into Australia. As we shall probably produce more than sufficient sugar for Australian requirements this year, I do not see how it is at all likely that in connexion with this matter the Commonwealth Government will require to draw on any account to the extent of a single penny-piece. </para>

I shall be very pleased when I resume my seat- if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> will explain away any misapprehension I am under ; but I think I am correct in saying that a huge amount was handed back to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company after the whole business  was over. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but the agreement, like many others, has not worked out in the way we anticipated. One can well be proud of having been  a  party to an agreement which could not - have been made but for the existence of a Labour Government in Queensland, and which has enabled the people of &#39;the Commonwealth to have sugar at a reasonable price during the war. </para>

                            <para>- It is reasonable, particularly compared with what other countries are paying. I understand that the Commonwealth Bank advanced &#163;10,000 to finance this deal, while another business account belonging to the Commonwealth showed a surplus. I gather that no interest will be . charged against the &#163;10,000, in the circumstances. That should not be so. If the Bank  is  advancing money to this account, the account should stand by itself, and be charged interest. The fact that other Commonwealth accounts show a surplus is no reason why this particular deal should be let off the payment of a fair rate for money advanced. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> that perhaps not a very  large sum will have to be advanced; and if that is so, there is no reason why we should be legislating here on a matter that is not a business proposition. But, in any case, the sugar deal should stand by itself. </para>

I altogether demur to his contention that the accounts should stand separate. Hundreds of business men have two accounts at the Bank, one in credit and the other overdrawn. It is only fair for one to be taken as a set-off against the other. No business man would agree to the Bank charging him interest on the amount he borrows on one account, while letting the Bank have his surplus in the other account for nothing. The practice set out in the Bill is common throughout the commercial community here, and in other countries. It is the only sound business proposition possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> would be the first to demur, if he was good enough to lend me a pound, conditionally on my paying interest on it-- </para>

                        next point is that, somehow or other, we are undermining the power of the Governor of the Bank. We are doing nothing of the kind. The very practice which the Governor of the Bank has found necessary to introduce is being legalized by the Bill. It could not have been carried through without his approval, because he has control of the method in which his accounts are kept.
                    </para>
                    <para>The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is nob concerned in this matter. Not a single penny of the interest goes into the coffers of the company. It goes to the credit of the Treasury. The Governor of  the Bank is charging interest on any amount overdrawn on the sugar account, quite irrespective of how much the Commonwealth Government may have to credit in other accounts. But when he has collected the interest, he says to the Government, &#34; Because you have a credit on other accounts, I hand this money over to you.&#34; This Bill legalizes the payment of that money into the Treasury. </para>

                        <para>.- Sugar is not altogether a mystery to me, although I do not profess to know everything about it; but I have been in the business twenty-five years, and have had special opportunities of acquiring a general knowledge of every department connected with the production and distribution of sugar in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is quite mistaken in saying that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was allowed a larger profit last year than was provided in the terms of its agreement with the Commonwealth Government. As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth did not hand any money over to the company, but since the company has been managing the business on behalf of the Commonwealth, it has returned to the Commonwealth over &#163;1,000,000. Part of that was used to pay the import duty on foreign sugar, and the balance, about &#163;500,000, was paid into the Consolidated Revenue. The Commonwealth has made over &#163;500,000 out of the Queensland producers of sugar. The Bill provides for the very thing which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is contending for, because proposed new section 4 directs the Government to pay interest at 5 per cent, on its indebtedness to the Commonwealth Bank, and charge it against the sugar account. </para>

                <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to improve the position of those invalid and old-age pensioners who, on account of their dependence on members of the Australian Imperial Force, are in receipt of military allotments or war pensions. As the law stands at present, the amount of the invalid and old-age pension may be reduced if the applicant is in receipt of a military allotment or war pension, and under this Bill it is proposed that an applicant shall be entitled to the amount of both pensions without deduction. As regards an invalid, the fact that an applicant is adequately supported by his children will not interfere with the allowance. I feel certain that the provisions of this measure will insure for it sympathetic support from members on both sides of the Senate. The circumstances rendering it desirable to bring in an amendment of the existing law are clearly known. We are all more or less familiar with cases of hardship due to the reduction of invalid and old-age pension payments because an  applicant is in receipt of a war pension or military allotment, and it is in order to correct this disability that the Government have ventured to present the measure. </para>

I only regret that the Bill has not been made retrospective. I understand that it will operate only from the day it passes, and I would be more pleased if the Government  could  see their way clear to recoup the losses sustained by many people owing to the reduction of old-age pensions. I desire to say also that I noticed, in tha debate on this measure in another place, that the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> claimed credit to himself for having suggested the introduction of this amending Bill. I do not care who gets credit for it, so long as an injustice is being remedied, but I do object to an honorable gentleman of another place trying to enshrine himself in the memories of the public in the way I have indicated. I have looted through <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> records, and I find that the honorable member for Perth only mentioned this injustice in March of this year, and I point out that when the War Pensions Bill was being read a second time in this Chamber I was the first to raise the very point which is now being dealt with in this Bill. Ever since the War Pensions Bill was introduced I have protested against any reduction being made in the invalid and .old-age pensions, and I remember that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> said that if any injustice was done the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act would have to be amended. In season and out of .season I have endeavoured to have this matter remedied. I am glad to know that at last the Government have introduced the Bill, and I hope that people who have suffered losses through the reduction of invalid and old-age payments will be recouped. </para>

                            <para>- I understood the honorable senator was claiming that he had advocated this reform in the press and on the public platform, and all I want to say is that in every election I have gone through I have been accused, and my party has been accused, of a determination, if returned to power, to curtail the old-age pensions . payments, or stop them altogether, and I think this Bill is a fitting reply to such an accusation. I hope also that we shall never hear such charges repeated, because they have been most disconcerting in the past, as, generally speaking, they have been made two or three days prior to an election, so that we have not had an opportunity to reply to them. I hope this Bill will settle that libel for ever. </para>

This measure demonstrates the - necessity &#39; for a National Government in Australia, because the war has been in progress now for over three years, and although complaints were continually arising, no action was taken by the late Government. </para>

                        <para>. - I would like an assurance from the Leader of- the so-called National Government that they will cease to collect from widows and others moneys which it is alleged have been overpaid on separation allowances because the applicants have been in receipt of old-age pensions. A considerable number of such cases have come under my notice, and I would like to know now if the Government are going to do the right thing. The purport of the Bill, I take it, is to provide that those who are in receipt of war pensions will not have payments under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act reduced, but I would like the Minister to give us an assurance that persons who have had their pensions, so reduced will receive the back money due to them. </para>

                        <para>.- I indorse all that has been said by honorable senators in appreciation of the Bill, because we have all had some experience of cases of hardship due to the fact that persons drawing the old-age pensions have been deprived of their right to separation allowances or war pensions through the loss of any member of their family. This Bill will &#39; remove all such cases of hardship, and in future persons bereaved in consequence of the war will not be penalized by the loss of any pension which they may have merited by life-long service to the State. However, I rise to intimate that _ \ desire to submit an amendment of the Bill. In consequence of the splendid progress made by the Senate in dealing with measures, and the unanimity with which honorable senators have suspended the Standing and Sessional Orders to allow this Bill to be passed through all its stages without delay, it becomes necessary for me, in order that I may introduce my amendment, to ask permission of the Senate immediately the second reading is&#187; carried. I desire to have the Bill amended so as to provide that pensioners incapacitated through blindness may be permitted to earn, by their personal exertion, a greater sum of money than 22s. 6d. per week before their pension ceases. This case particularly appeals to me. </para>

                        <para>- I want to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> and the Senate that he is not entitled to move this motion except on notice under standing order 15, which notice has to be given at a previous sitting. The Standing Orders having been suspended to permit of the passage of the Bill through all its stages to-day ; that, of course, has nullified his notice of motion. Therefore, he can only proceed by leave, and, in the peculiar circumstances of the  case, I think that leave ought to be given. Is it the pleasure of the Senate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> have leave to submit his motion without the usual notice? </para>

                        <para>. - I feel under some disability in asking the Senate not to assent to the motion. Naturally any effort put forward on behalf of an afflicted section of* the community is bound to appeal to the sympathies of all men and women. But I should like to &#39; point out to honorable senators that the very action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> discloses that his amendment aims at something other than the purpose for which the amending Bill was brought in. He has selected an unfortunate class of persons, who certainly appeal to us, and that is the blind. But if it is a desirable way to amend the invalid pensions system by picking out one section at a time, honorable senators will see that we could run through the whole category, bringing in the blind cases to-day, the tubercular cases to-morrow, and those troubled with- paralysis the next day. As regards every one of these cases, every honorable senator would shrink from giving a negative vote if taken in detail. I want honorable senators to consider not merely the claims which the blind have on their good feelings. </para>

                            <para>- Oh, yes. I ruled that the honorable senator was not in order in arguing the merits of his proposed amendment; that he could only do  that after receiving the permission of the Senate. Otherwise any honorable senator could evade the standing order providing that the subject-matter of his speech must be relevant to the Bill by saying that he proposed to move an amendment which was not relevant. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is perfectly in order in pointing out as a reason why an instruction should not be given to the Committee, that the case of the blind would be practically on all-fours with the other cases he cited. But he is not in order in arguing the merits of the particular proposal which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has thought fit to present to the Senate. The same restriction applies to a Minister as applies to any member of the Senate. Therefore, while I rule that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is perfectly in order in saying that there is no more reason why the case of the blind should be brought under consideration than the other cases he cited, he is not in order in arguing the merits of the question. I suggest to Senators Earle and Millen that the proper time, if the merits of the question are to be argued, is when in Committee on the Bill. </para>

You pointed out that, whilst be might indicate the nature of his proposed amendment, it was not competent for him at that stage to discuss it. When he submitted the motion for an instruction he did so without attempting to address you. However, I propose to act upon the suggestion which you have given. Whatever may be the rights of an honorable senator at this juncture, it is quite clear that his right to discuss the proposal <inline font-style="italic">ad infinitum</inline> in Committee is unquestioned. As I do not wish to go over the ground twice, sir, I shall refrain from speaking further at this stage. </para>

When you ruled <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> out of order he was merely asking permission to have the matter&#39; brought before the Senate, and now that it is submitted under cover of a motion I think you will see that the whole matter is open to debate.

                            <para>- Exactly. With all due respect to you, sir, I think that you hastily confounded the ruling you gave at a previous stage with the fact that since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> got permission to proceed he has submitted a motion for an instruction. I believe, sir, that on further consideration you will see that we are now at liberty to discuss the matter. I do not wish to speak at any length, but I do not like a suggestion or a ruling to be thrown out&#39; which may be used against us on a more important matter. I propose to debate this matter if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> does not desire to continue his speech. </para>

                            <para>- I am not speaking disparagingly of the Government but pointing out the difficulty of the situation. I recognise that, in all cases where a Government, or any one else, is attempting to grant concessions, or extend privileges to any class in the community, it is a very easy thing for an honorable senator &#39;tt&#62; get up &#34; to go one better,&#34; and that those who vote against his proposal are continually put in a position in which I think they should not be put; but I see no means of avoiding the situation. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> is quite in earnest in this matter. The purport of his proposition, I take it, is that  a  blind pensioner may be allowed to earn more money, and still receive the pension. In my opinion, we should scarcely put  a  limit to what pensioners may earn. I see no sense or reason in restricting the earnings of a pensioner of any kind. </para>

                    <para class="block">I was going to point out that the system of limiting the earnings of pensioners is a mistake, because if a man is earning more money, he is doing more work. If a pensioner is prevented from earning money now, and he were allowed to earn money in the future, he might soon find himself able to relieve the Government of the obligation to give him  a  pension. I venture to say that very many of them, as soon as they became certain that they could support themselves by their own efforts, would no longer remain a burden on the State. The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> is such a fair one that I cannot think of curtailing the opportunity to vote upon it. A little while ago, when it was proposed to grant a pension of only 5s. weekly in Great Britain, many keen business men there pointed out that the adoption of such&#39; a proposal would absolutely- ruin the country. They saw nothing but disaster in it. Yet to-day Britain is spending upon the war, in a day, as much as would suffice to pay of3age pensions for a year. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing of the kind. But just as difficulties were predicted in Great Britain, when the question of pensions was under consideration, so many honorable senators foresee difficulties here. Personally, I see no difficulties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle&#39;s</inline> proposal will merely permit of. an. increase in the amount, which a blind pensioner is permitted to earn. Blindness is a sad affliction, but it is a greater hardship that blind pensioners should be allowed to earn only so much a year if they are to retain their pensions. A similar disability in the case of other pensioners would be a very serious one, and I am strongly of the  opinion that we ought to treat all persons coming within this category in accordance with the increasing common sense of the community. I shall support the motion. </para>

It is not intended to make this Bill retrospective. The Government do not feel called upon to make good any omissions on the part of previous Governments. We think that we are taking a reasonable step forward when we remedy what we recognise as a wrong. The Bill will afford considerable relief to those who will be affected by its provisions. </para>

                    <para>I realize the justice of&#39; a great deal that has been said this afternoon in regard to the granting of national pensions to all invalids and persons who have reached the pension age. But I also recognise that it would be very difficult indeed to convince a majority of the members of this Parliament that such a proposition is a practicable one at present. I quite look forward to the period when it will be adopted, and when we shall not insist upon persons remaining poor in order that they may receive such a reward for services rendered to their country. Hence, in framing the proposed new clause I have chosen to deal with a specific class of cases in which no doubt can exist as to the incapacity or disablement of the pensioner. When a man loses his sight we know that he is invalided beyond any chance of recovery. There can be no suspicion that he is malingering in order to qualify for the pension. The average blind person who has taken advantage of one of the blind institutes of Australia has a considerable love of life. He is able, through training, to enjoy life to an extent which those who have their sight can scarcely imagine. I have attended entertainments, and concerts of these people, and it is quite remarkable to notice, not only their expert knowledge and capacity in connexion with industries such as brushmaking, matmaking, basketmaking, and so on, but also the keen interest which they are able to take, in common with those who have their sight, in many social enjoyments. Other invalids do not require the same amount of money for ordinary expenditure as do the blind. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, he can. The loss of hearing, of course, is a serious affliction, but we know that one man who is hard of hearing is Prime Minister of the Commonwealth to-day. There are many ways in which a man who suffers from loss of hearing may earn his living as well as a man who is possessed of all his faculties. The blind are in a different category altogether, because whilst they are absolutely incapacitated from earning a living in the ordinary way, they are not incapacitated from the enjoyment of many social advantages. As a consequence, they require money for many purposes other than their actual need to live. Yet under the Act they are restricted from earning more than 22s. Gd. per week. </para>

                            <para>- There are&#39; very few in Australia who can hope to attain the position which was held by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> When the blind earn by brushmaking, matmaking,  or other industries up to 22s. 6d. per week their pension immediately ceases. I am not asking the Committee to call upon the Government to incur <inline font-style="italic">Shy</inline> extra expenditure. I know it is not the function of the Senate to do so. But I think we have a right to request the Government to permit the blind to be more productive and to earn more for themselves without being penalized by the loss of their pensions if they do so. I admit that what has been said of other pensioners is quite sound, but in the circumstances I cannot ask that they be included in my amendment. Any law or custom which restricts the productivity of the people is injurious to the Commonwealth. When, therefore, I ask that blind pensioners shall be permitted to produce more, and thus add to the wealth of the Commonwealth, it will be admitted that &#34; I am making a very reasonable request. </para>

What I propose is merely an act of justice to blind pensioners and would involve no financial strain upon the Government. Whilst it would do no injury to any one, it would confer a very great benefit indeed on a large number of very unfortunate citizens. </para>

I have always been at a - loss to know why any restrictions of this character should . have found their way into the Act. The Old-age Pensions Acts were passed, not only in the Commonwealth Parliament, but also in the various State Parliaments, owing to the persistent agitation of the Labour party, to whom the entire credit for this kind of legislation is due. They were passed in the teeth of the strongest opposition from the other side. Though the party opposite and their predecessors held the reins of office in Australia and elsewhere for centuries, it never occurred to them to pass an old-age pensions law until the Labour party, by the pressure they were able to bring to bear upon the various Parliaments, compelled them to consent to this tardy measure of justice to the ordinary worker. </para>

                        <para>. - I was very much struck with the remark made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> some little time since, when he said that in. submitting amendments of this kind it is always possible for some one else to go one better, and that those opposed to the additional benefit suggested are liable to have their actions misjudged. That is an absolutely fair statement of the case. There is always in political circles a temptation to this kind of thing; and it is always possible that persons who feel unable to follow the lead set them by a more venturesome soul are liable to be misjudged; That is the position with which we are confronted today. I can suggest now to honorable senators that if they desired they might out-Herod <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> altogether by covering the whole ground in an amendment, and leaving our honorable friends opposite trembling and paralyzed by the glorious outlook that would be opened up if such a course were adopted; but honorable senators know exactly what that would mean, and that such an amendment would never get through. I have not one word to say against what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has urged as to the position of the blind ; but I could say just as much for others of the afflicted in the community. The honorable senator has shown that in some respects the blind can enjoy life, and are better circumstanced than are many other invalids. He has shown that the blind can take an active interest in what is going on around them. </para>

There is not much enjoyment of life for him. If we take tuberculous invalids, we know that some of them find a difficulty in getting a home to receive them, because of the nature of their disease. If they have knowledge of its nature, as most of them have, and have a regard for those with whom they associate, they shrink from their fellows rather than be the means of spreading their disease amongst those for whom they have some regard. If any invalids are entitled to have consideration extended to them, certainly tuberculous cases should be considered. </para>

                            <para>- There are many other cases. Take the case of unfortunates suffering from cancer. Is no one here capable of putting forward on their behalf quite as strong a case as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has made out for the blind ? Take the relatively large number of people malformed from infancy and doomed largely to rely on the good offices of their neighbours and friends. For each of those cases I could say all, and more than, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has said for the blind. Therefore, when I oppose the amendment it is not for want of sympathy with the blind, but because I take the view that if we are prepared to give money out of the public exchequer for these pensions we should not confine it to one class, but spread it evenly over all classes. Instead of making an exception in favour of the blind, my attitude would be to secure, if thought desirable, a general amendment affecting all these classes, not necessarily going as far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has suggested, but having all the appearance of equity in the sense that it will treat all these unfortunates on an equal basis. I am unable to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle&#39;s</inline> proposal, because it selects only one class. I must ask honorable senators to consider the position of all those other equally deserving sections for whom the honorable senator proposes to do nothing. If we are to consider the prospect of a larger grant from the public Treasury, it should be given by way of an average increase to all pensioners equally distressed. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment for the reasons that I have given, and not for want of sympathy with it, leaving the question of invalid pensions until they can be reviewed as a whole, and not dealt with in this piece-meal fashion. </para>

                        <para>. - It always appears to me, when a member, particularly a follower of the Government, introduces an amendment of this kind, that he is not playing the game, but is scoring off his mates. He is posing as a man who would be more generous than those who put their loyalty to the party and the Government before their personal sympathy and considerations. </para>

Whenever a member on the Government side puts me in the position in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has put me to-day, I am not going to be saddled with the responsibility of explaining for the rest of my political life why I voted against the interests of the blind, even if I was inclined to do so, which I am not. But I see in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> argument a really good reason for carrying the amendment, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has shown that there are even more deserving oases. If this Committee, with its narrow powers - because in this case we can deal only with the matter referred to us by the Senate - carries the amendment, it will be a direction to the Government to bring in a more general Bill, with a larger scope. I shall, therefore, support the amendment, although I do not approve of the conduct of the mover in &#34;scoring off his mates.&#34; </para>

The principle of the amendment might well be extended to a number of other unfortunate classes, and I shall vote for it, in the hope that the Government, seeing a majority on their own side voting with this side to give the deserving blind the right to earn more money, will recognise that it is their duty to give every other section the right to earn more. I object to picking out one narrow section for an advantage, but if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> had widened the scope of his amendment the Committee would have been in a position to extend the benefits to all classes. </para>

If that right is denied to me other steps can be taken. The blind should be given the right to earn, not only &#163;2 per week, but more. If the amendment was made wide enough to give the same right to all other sections I would vote for it, but in voting for it I can still disapprove of the manner in which it has been brought forward by an honorable senator who is scoring off his mates. </para>

He cannot malinger, he cannot deceive the Pensions Commissioner, and all we ask is that persons of that class shall be permitted, if they can be so trained, to earn the small amount of &#163;2 per week. As regards <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> objection to my action, I consulted no one as to the introduction of the new clause.

                            <para>- The honorable senator is quite wrong. Long custom and association have made honorable senators opposite incapable of realizing that other men are free. I am sorry my action has caused <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> displeasure, but I cannot help it. If any other member of the National party thinks fit to introduce an amendment of the law, I will vote for or against it, and take the responsibility of doing so. If it places me in an awkward position with my constituents, that is my look out. The only objection to my proposal seems to be that it particularizes the blind as against other pensioners. My answer is that we are dealing with a special class of invalidity that can be benefited, not by extra expenditure on their behalf, but by giving them the opportunity to produce for themselves. We know that they cannot impose upon the State or the Department, and are absolutely entitled to their pensions. If such persons were trained to some calling, they could improve their own positions, and at the same time benefit the State. When the time comes to include other pensioners I shall be found voting for such a proposal; but let us not refuse to do what I am now asking because we cannot benefit all pensioners. </para>

Under the present Act they may have a home to live in, but, exclusive of that, their income must not exceed &#163;52 a year. I hope to have the unanimous approval of honorable senators by fixing the amount at the moderate sum of &#163;2 per week. </para>

I am supporting the proposal because of my sympathy with the blind. I know honorable gentlemen opposite are equally sympathetic, and to them I would say, Let us take a step in the right direction as indicated, and then we can ask for further assistance to invalid pensioners who are suffering from some other disability. A blind person may not be incapacitated, as far as personal exertion is concerned, as much as a man minus two legs or minus two arms, but I recognise we must make a start somewhere, and I am whole-heartedly with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> in seeking to give further assistance to them. </para>

                            <para>- If I did that, my action would be anathema to the honorable senator. The question of additional expenditure is not involved in the amendment. It is only a provision enabling the blind to buttress their pensions payments to the extent of &#163;104 a year. Under the present Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act a pensioner is entitled to 12s. 6d. a week, and is allowed, by personal exertion, to bring the amount up to about &#163;65 a year, and this proposal, if carried, would make the total payment about &#163;124 a year; but it will not mean payment by the Commonwealth of an amount greater than at present. The only argument from the other side against the amendment is that there are other persons who should receive this assistance. I believe there are; but I am prepared to start with the blind, and include the others later on. </para>
