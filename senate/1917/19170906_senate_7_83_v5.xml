                            <para>- For moving this motion I offer no excuse or apology to the Senate. I doubt if ever a question of greater importance than the immediate settlement of the present industrial trouble was ever discussed by a deliberative assembly. I desire to approach the question with the aim and end in view which I have stated in the motion itself, namely, that the Government should take immediate action to bring about a settlement of the dispute, which not only threatens* our commercial and, industrial life,&#34; but which, if continued, must work havoc with the part that Australia has &#39; so proudly played in taking her share in the conduct of the war. </para>

                            <para>- That is the very reason why I wish to address the Senate, and I hope that honorable senators will approach, the matter chiefly with that point in view. Why there should have been forced upon the unionists by the Railways Commissioners during the time of war conditions so distasteful to them that thousands of skilled workmen have left their employment rather than submit to them, I fail to understand. If it were pardonable in peace time for the Railways Commissioners to take this step, I submit that it was altogether unpardonable for them to do it at the present time. We are not allowed, I suppose, to discuss the actions of the State Government. </para>

                            <para>- To the best of my knowledge and ability, I, will. The trouble in the railway workshops of New South Wales was originated by the introduction of the card system there by the Railways Commissioners. The trouble was not sprung upon the Government and the Commissioners by the unionists in a hasty manner, as from reading the newspapers one would be led to believe. In December of last year a deputation of railway workmen, to whom this card system was being applied, waited upon the Chief Commissioner for Railways, and put forward their objections to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fraser</inline> then withdrew the card system, and intimated to the men that at a more favorable opportunity he would introduce it. He evidently seized what he considered a more favorable opportunity. </para>

                            <para>- I will accept my honorable friend&#39;s date. When it was introduced in March, the decent men in the workshops would not use the card system. First of all, they tried it on those men who by their reputation would be considered the most suitable to work out the card system, but they absolutely refused to accept it. Then they tried it on some&#39; aspiring young men, who also declined to have anything to do with it, as they considered that would be equivalent to spying upon their fellows. </para>

                    <para>The workmen did not suddenly spring this trouble upon the Government. They interviewed the manager with regard to the card system, and wanted to know how it would work out. They asked him if a physically weak man, or a man weak from age, would be expected to dp the same job in the same time as a physically strong man, and the manager said that would depend upon the psychology of the case. The manager was then asked if the cards which he held in his hand were the only cards to be introduced, and in his reply he stated that he had the authority of the Railways Commissioners to say that they could not give any assurance as to what cards would be introduced. </para>

                            <para>- I have obtained the information from a number of men. I hate gone to a considerable amount of trouble to verify it, and I find that what has been told to me by one man has been corroborated by, at least, six more. All this goes to show that the trouble has not been sprung upon the country. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the card system. We have been told that it has been introduced merely to enable the New South Wales Government to ascertain what material and what time have been used in carrying out different works; that the system has been in existence, not only in Government workshops, but practically in all big business places in Sydney, for a number of years, and that no objection had been taken to it. The objection taken by the men to the introduction of this card system on the New South Wales railways is that it would introduce a system of spying. At public meetings which I addressed on this subject I produced one of the cards in dispute, and, in fairness to the Chief Railways Commissioner, I intimated that since then he had said he had given orders that it would not be used. </para>

                            <para>- It is the system they object to. When they asked the manager of the shop if the three cards then in his possession were the only cards to be used, he said he had the authority of the Chief Railways Commissioner to state that he would give no pledges as to the cards to be used. </para>

The Ministry have said through their various mouthpieces that the men may go back to work, and that if they do so, after the card system has been operating for three months, there will be an inquiry into it. On the other hand, the employees say &#34; We will return to work if you appoint&#39; a Royal Commission to inquire into the merits of the card system, and we are prepared to abide by the decision of that tribunal.&#34; If the two parties to the existing dispute each put forward these opposing propositions, and we are unable to find a basis of agreement between them, it is a reflection upon our intelligence. </para>

I dread a strike as much as I dread a bush fire, and if I saw a bush fire within reach to-morrow I would hurry to put it out. The dangers associated with a strike to the industrial community and to the Commonwealth itself are so serious that intelligent men should earnestly address themselves to a settlement of the present trouble. My proposal provides for a just settlement of it. I say that those charged with the functions of government - those responsible for the maintenance of the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth - can well afford to look about with a view to discovering an immediate means of settling this trouble. </para>

On the other hand, the Government affirm that the unionists are in revolt. I wish to say that there are no more law-abiding people in Australia than are its trade unionists.- They have shown their loyalty on the battlefields of Europe. </para>

Something worse than disfranchisement will not be tolerated by organized labour in this country. The statement so frequently made in the press that the strike is a &#34; revolt &#34; is absolutely nonsense. A dispute has arisen between two sections of public employees in New&#39; South Wales - the Railways Commissioners who are charged with the management of its railways, and the employees upon those railways. But that circumstance ought not to be connected with the word &#34; revolution.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- The workers have not allowed it to spread. The sympathetic strike which has followed the claim of the railway employees for an investigation of their case will continue to spread unless measures are taken to prevent it. Unionism has become such a great mateship that the sympathetic strike is always the most difficult to deal with. That men should voluntarily sentence themselves and their families to a lower standard of living for the sake of mates whom they never saw is one of those things that we need to understand if we wish to deal with it. </para>

Every attempt to break up unionism merely serves to make it stronger. </para>

                            <para>- At this time Australia should not be misrepresented on the other side of the world. The men charged with the government of the Old Country should not be given the impression that hundreds of thousands of workers in Australia are disloyal. There is no more loyal Dominion of the British Empire than is Australia, and there is no more loyal section of the people of Australia than are the unionists. That these false impressions should be spread broadcast by responsible men is&#39; one of the saddest features of industrial troubles. </para>

I appeal to honorable senators, and to members of the Government, not to become partisans in this strike, but to lift the Federal Government above both parties, and see whether a settlement cannot be arrived at. </para>

                            <para>- No Government has made an attack upon anybody. The attack has been made, not by a Government upon unionists, but by certain people, venturing to speak for the unions, upon a Government. It is strange, then, that the honorable senator should turn round and assume that, because the Government of New South Wales was doing something in defence of public interests, they should be held up to public scorn as being the attacking party. </para>

                    <para>Let us look at the facts, because I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> as to the importance of the matter. It is an important matter. It is little short of deplorable. It is, indeed, tragic, that at a time when this country is fighting for its very existence, or when it ought to be doing so, it apparently finds its time and energies occupied by a not unsuccessful imitation of what is taking place in Russia to-day. One would think that we were outside the region of possible harm. I say again, that it is little short of tragic, when the fate of this country and of the Empire is still trembling in the balance, that we should find not only large bodies of men foolish enough to be misled, but public men in the responsible position occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> coming here and saying things which can only spur the men on t&#39;o a continuation of their ill-advised action. </para>

I say that any individual who comes forward asking for a peaceful adjustment of this industrial . difficulty, must leave that kind of advocacy outside the doors of this or any other chamber before he can look for a respectful hearing. To denounce, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has done, the representatives of the New South Wales Railways Commissioners as spies upon their fellow workmen, at a time when he professes only to be seeking a peaceful solution of the quarrel, is but an injunction and an appeal to the men to stand firm in the position they have taken up. </para>

                            <para>- I am simply asking whether, because certain men in the Randwick shops had a dispute with the Railways Commissioners there, that is a justification for thousands of men in this State and elsewhere immediately making war, not upon the Government of New South Wales, but upon the National Government, which is charged with the supreme responsibility of enabling Australia to put forward its best efforts in the war, amongst- those efforts being the despatch by transports of munitions and comforts needed for our troops? </para>

                    <para>It is suggested that the Commonwealth should interfere. The Commonwealth Government did interfere some time ago in the coal strike in New South Wales,  aad, as I am reminded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in a strike at Broken Hill. By the action it took there, it secured to the men who struck all they asked for, but the result showed the Government the mistake it made. The Government was entitled to expect that, in return for its action, these law-abiding loyal citizens would at least have given what the Government thought was the equivalent, that is, continuity of service. That was the bargain and that bargain is shown to have been in the minds of those men, but another &#34;scrap of paper.&#34; We are asked now to repeat the sorry experience gained on that occasion. </para>
                    <para>The honorable senator says this matter can easily be settled. Of course it can. It is the easiest thing in the world. There are two ways of doing it, both equally simple - an absolute surrender on the part of the State Government, or for the men to go back and take the work that is waiting for them. It is simple whichever way you put it. </para>

                            <para>- That is what I am wondering. I am marvelling why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> instead of coming here to hurl those opprobrious epithets at those from whom he differs, is not making an earnest appeal to the men to go back now and accept the offer that has been held out to them for many months by the State Government. The address he made here should have been made to them, and not to this Chamber. The honorable senator was very indefinite when I asked him to say in what way the Federal Government could act. He suggested something in the nature of a Royal Commission, and expressed unbounded confidence that the decision of the Commission would be loyally observed. This is interesting. If that Commission decided that the card system should stay, would its decision be accepted ? </para>

That is the sole purpose of its existence. and it is called upon to decide in what way that good government is to be secured. One cannot shut his eyes to the fact that this is not a strike in the ordinary acceptation of the term. It is a distinct challenge. to the properly constituted Government of Australia.

                            <para>- Yes; and, what is much more satisfactory to me, I know where they are now. These undesirable influences secured their way into the innermost recesses of unionism, and seized the opportunity to use their power in a most cowardly fashion, not for the good of unionism, but to give effect to their well-known animosity to the British Empire, and all for which it stands. These men are reckless iconoclasts, seeking to pull down society as it is constituted to-day, and they have found very ready material in trade unionists, by reason of that very loyalty which animates the great body of unionists. These men. have played upon; the unionists, who have practically been made to forget for the time being what they owe to their country, in order that, in their opinion, they may display their loyalty &#39;to the baneful influences in their  midst </para>

                    <para>Just a few words in conclusion. This Government never has, by word or deed, made the slightest effort to, in any way, destroy or disturb trade unionism, and it is not likely to do so. But we cannot shut our eyes to this fact, that, for some years, there has been growing ups misguided as they have been, on the part of unionists represented by their special spokesmen, something like a contempt for law. They would only observe the arbitration law, which was brought in largely at their request, just so long as it  gave them what they asked for. Trade unionists are taking up this posit on to-day: they do not want arbitration, but they want their own way. Just so long as arbitration, or any other institution, will give them their own way, they will take iti; but unless it does so, then so much the worse for the system. The matter has reached such a point now that it is not possible for the Commonwealth Government, nor, in my judgment!, for the State .Government, to recede from the position it has taken up. A challenge was thrown out, and the Government had to do one of two things. </para>

                        <para>. - The closing words of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> proved to me that he has forgotten one very vital factor in connexion with the question for arbitration. He based his remarks on what he said is a fact, and that is that the workers of Australia do not want arbitration, but their own way. I wish to remind the honorable senator that from the establishment of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court until now it is the employers who have been the greatest offenders so far as breaches of awards are concerned. Any honorable senator who likes to look back for the past thirteen years, and. take an account of the awards given by that Court, the number of times that the awards have been broken by the employers on the one side and by the employees on the other, will see that the offences by the employers have been greater than the offences by the employees. </para>

                        has put all the blame, on the men in the railway&#39; workshops at Eveleigh without putting any blame on the Chief Commissioner of Railways. I have studied this question very closely from the start of this formidable trouble until now. There is a factor which is entirely forgotten by those who support the Railways Commissioners, and that is that the men were working under an award. I am credibly informed that a promise was given by the Railways Commissioners that no new industrial conditions would, be brought in during the time of the war.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                        did not refer to that fact; the press of Australia has not referred to it, and that is the reason why we on this side are taking this opportunity to put before the people the men&#39;s side of the , question, which, so far, has not been stated in the press.
                    </para>
                    <para>What is this card system? Senators Millen, Pearce, and de Largie have interjected about the system being in existence in other parts of the world, and in Australia. I am quite prepared to admit that I have worked under a system whereby my work was recorded. On the railways of Western Australia, where I worked for three years and four months, I had to fill in every morning a time-sheet, giving an account of the previous day&#39;s work from 7.20 a.m. till 5 p.m. I filled in that sheet without any supervision from a foreman or a sub-foreman. That system obtains in the Western Australian railway service to-day, and no one objects to it. I did the same thing in Harland and Woolf&#39;s Ship Yard, in Belfast, some years ago. T had to render an account of every hourI had worked, and what particular part of a ship I had been engaged on in connexion with its construction - on the boilers, bulk-heads, decks, hull, and so on. In that great shipyard where, at that time, there were about 17,000 employees engaged there was not a murmur of discontent. </para>
                    <para>But the card system which has been introduced by the Railways Commissioners for New South Wales is an entirely different proposition. Not one of the men who ceased work objected to recording his time and giving a faithful account of his stewardship. But the men do object to this system, which, at Eveleigh, Randwick, and Newcastle, has been the means of appointing 145 sub-foremen, who stand over the workmen watching every movement in connexion with the particular job on which each is engaged. Suppose, for instance, that a workman is filling a barrow with sand. A sub-foreman watches the workman, notes the time he takes to fill the barrow, the time he takes to wheel the barrow to a particular spot, and the time he takes to turn round and return with it. The sub-foreman has a stop-watch. He has his cards with him, and he can so manipulate the stop-watch that the worker does not know in what manner his work is being recorded. </para>

I have worked under supervision, and I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that it is the duty of a foreman to supervise his men properly. I have no objection to being properly supervised, but I have a decided objection to a man standing over me and registering every movement of my hands or feet. , Again, if a piece of steel is placed on a lathe, there is a sub-foreman, and every movement pf that particular workman is observed. </para>

They will not accept any offer from the men. They merely say that the men must do exactly what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fraser</inline> orders. That is not reasonable. I venture to say that the workers of Australia give a good return for a good day&#39;s wage. They are conscientious workmen. It is wrong for any man, be he a Railways Commissioner or a member of a Government, a public or a private employer, to introduce into Australia a system for checking the time of a man&#39;s work which has been rejected in America. We know perfectly well that in the latter country there is a system of speeding up. I believe that it is the most advanced country in the world in that regard, but advanced as it is it absolutely rejected the system which is being endeavoured to be introduced at the Eveleigh Workshops. It has also been turned down in England, and we have proof of that. Why should this trouble be brought on at the present time, when we are struggling with the enemy outside the gate? I realize that as a result of the cessation of work by the railway men at Sydney difficulties have occurred - that thousands of innocent men are unemployed, and that thousands of women and children are suffering. It is our duty to meet these men, if we can, by referring the matter in dispute to some tribunal </para>
                    <para>I want now to call attention to what I consider reprehensible action on the part of the Government in connexion with this strike, There is in existence a duly constituted&#39; Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, the Judge of which is vested with power to do certain things. He could, if he chose, deregister an organization guilty of breaking the law. Now what did this Government do ? They issued a regulation under the War Precautions Act, giving the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth power to deregister any organization that might come out on strike. So far so good. This regulation was issued shortly after the  President  of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court had informed the wharf labourers that they could not have both arbitration and strike. The question was <inline font-style="italic">sub</inline><inline font-style="italic">judice</inline> but notwithstanding this, the Attorney-  General of the Commonwealth had the regulation referred* to passed, and shortly afterwards he approached the Court with a request! to have a certain organization deregistered. It was not right that the Government should have power to use a judicial as well as a political weapon. Is  it any wonder that the  President  of the Court made a protest when the Attorney-General asked the Court to do something which he had the power himself to do under the War Precautions Act? , </para>
                    <para>One or two more words, and I will have finished. I am credibly informed that several telegrams were sent by the secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation in Melbourne to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rowe,</inline> the secretary of the Western Australian branch in Fremantle, but up till a day or two ago he had received only one message, and that waa a telegram &#39; containing the  suggestion by the  President  of the Court that the men should resume work. Why have those other telegrams been hung up? I am also credibly informed that, before the men in Sydney ceased work in connexion with the card system, the National Service Bureau was being organized in Perth and Fremantle. If this is a&#39; fact - and I believe it is - it indicates that the Commonwealth Government and the New South Wales Government knew that something was about to happen, and were determined to have the National Service Bureau in working order to engage &#34; scab &#34; labour to take the places of men who had ceased work as a protest against the card system. </para>

                        <para>. - The speech delivered by the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> made it quite clear that this strike is a mere political move, and - that from an industrial point of view there is no excuse for it. I believe that nine-tenths of the people of Australia - if it) were possible to register their opinions - indorse this view of the present situation. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was addressing himself to this question, I said I would prove to him that the strike was of political origin, and I intend to substantiate my statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> who has just sat down, talked a lot about the condition of affairs in America, a country which he has never visited, but his statements were mere assertions without proof. Some time before the conscription referendum was held, this matter of a general strike was discussed at a conference of the waterside workers in Hobart, and, at the time, one of the newspapers charged that body with an attempt to engineer trouble. Though the organization passed resolutions contradicting the newspaper report, the minutes of the conference show that the press statements were correct, because a three days&#39; discussion did take place, and motions were moved that, in the event of the referendum being in favour of conscription, a cessation of work should be ordered. Exception has been taken to the charge made by the Prime Minister that the present strike is a revolt against the Government.  But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> knew what he was speaking about. No union has gained more from the principle of compulsory arbitration than the waterside workers. Before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> organized them, they were in receipt of a miserable wage, but by means of the principle of compulsory arbitration they have become the best paid wharf labourers in the whole world; so this is about) the last body in Australia that should endeavour to upset the Government of the 3ay, and thwart the will of the people. I find from the minutes of the conference to which I have referred that, on the 24th October of last year - the fourth day of the sitting - the following motion was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> W. Wilson, and seconded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> G. Walsh: - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>That the standing orders be suspended to discuss what course of action this conference will advise the branches to take in the event of the conscription referendum being carried. </para>
                    <para>That motion was agreed to, and this was followed by another motion, submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Wilson,</inline> and seconded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> Barr - </para>
                    <para>That this conference of waterside workers favour a cessation of work if the conscription referendum is carried, or if a Coalition Government should be formed. </para>
                    <para>If that is not  a  sufficient proof that the present trouble has been the result of a political move, right from the time of the conscription referendum up to the present, I do not know what more conclusive argument could be adduced. </para>

                            <para>- But. I am going to let other people know. Though the Hobart newspaper was contradicted the minutes of the conference show that a section of the waterside workers were determined, to bring about a stoppage of work in the event of the conscription referendum being carried or a Coalition Government formed. The matter was not introduced in a haphazard manner, because I find from the minutes that it was discussed on the following day, and this is an amendment which was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward,</inline> and seconded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walsh</inline> - </para>

                    <para class="block">There is not much difference between the two amendments, though both were submitted. The whole trouble, as I have shown, has been engineered as a political move against the constituted Governments of the day which had received a mandate from the country. That mandate unionists have challenged by engineering  a  general strike. As evidencing the candour, truthfulness, and honour of these people, the facts I am quoting constitute the best exposure that one can read. </para>

                            <para>- What are the facts? That a body comprising several thousand men intimated to their employers, the Railways Commissioners, months ago, that the introduction of the card system would not be tolerated under any circumstances short of absolute starvation. The Government of New South Wales, who are responsible for the conduct of affairs in that State, knew that the railway employees would object to the adoption of that system, and fully realized the consequences which would flow from forcing it upon them. I say that responsible officials like the Railways Commissioners ought, at least, to be expected to take note of the conditions under which we are living to-day. Yet, in spite of the fact that we are at war, and notwithstanding their unqualified promise to the deputation referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> that under no circumstances would new conditions be imposed on the workers in Government employ during the conduct of the war, they deliberately insisted upon the introduction of the card system. </para>

                        Largie has said that there is a political move behind the strike. I believe that there is; but I believe that it is a very different move from that which the honorable senator outlined. I believe that it emanated from the Employers&#39; Federation and from the moneyed power of this country a long time ago. Since the members of that organization have a number of honorable senators opposite  in the bag,&#34; and are under the impression that the latter are such useful tools in their employ that they cannot push them too far- 1

                            <para>- When this strike commenced, only a few men refused to work - those directly concerned in the dispute. The Government of New south Wales was then in&#39; a position to say, &#34; These are the skilled men in our employ, without whom the industries of the country cannot be carried on.&#34; Obviously, if &#34;scabs&#34; manned the engines, it would be only a matter of time when all the locomotives would be in the repair shops. It was manifest, therefore, that a few skilled workmen could paralyze industry. Consequently, the Government might well have said to the Railways Commissioners, &#34;This is too serious a matter for us to allow you to jeopardize the welfare of this country.&#34; We all know that the Queensland Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan,</inline> requisitioned for the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins to enable a settlement of the trouble to be arrived at; but the Prime Minister was so concerned about it that he refused the request.

                    <para>But instead of the Commonwealth Government insisting upon a settlement being made on the lines I have indicated, its members, from the Prime Minister downwards, have dubbed the strikers &#34; disloyalists.&#34; The Minister for Defence described them, as &#34;.mutineers.&#34; The Prime Minister stated that he could detect Teutonic influences, at the bottom of the trouble. I say that if there is one section of the community which cannot be bought by German gold it is composed of the workers of this country. I do not think, for one moment, that the German people are so stupid as to spend their money on the workers of Australia in the belief that they will get much out of their propaganda. They would find it a lot easier to bribe people in high places in this country than to bribe the workers. They would find it very much cheaper to bribe the Railways Commissioners than to bribe the men in the whole of the railway workshops of New South Wales. Yet these were the insults which were heaped upon the workers - upon the men who have made Australia a place worth fighting for, and who have all their relatives fighting at the Front. It has been urged that the. men on strike are disloyal to the men in the trenches. I say that for every man  &#39; scabbing &#39; &#39; on the wharfs and in the workshops to-day who is a returned soldier, we can find fifty returned soldiers amongst the ranks of the strikers. Yet the latter are described as &#34; disloyalists &#34;- by the Prime Minister, who has &#34;ratted &#34; on every promise that he ever made. These are the things which our people are supposed to take in silence. </para>
                    <para>No one deplores a strike more than I do. I have been through a number of them, but I would never allow my dignity, or the dignity of any other person over whom I had any control or influence, to stand in the way of averting such a trouble as exists in Australia to-day. I believe that even at this very late hour, if the Prime Minister did what he should have done at first, and said, &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fuller,</inline> we have had enough of this. You take on the service of one of our High Court Judges, and allow him to adjudicate upon the card system,&#34; the men would go to work, as they offered to do. They went so far as to say, &#34; We are prepared, if you will hold up the card system for one week, and in the interval appoint a commissioner to go into the merits of the system, to go to work on Monday morning, and we undertake to abide, during the period of the war, by whatever decision the arbitrator makes.&#34; Could a more common - sense proposal be made? Surely it is time that the responsible people of this country made the New South Wales Government take &#39; on the fair offer of the men. If they had done so we should have avoided all the present trouble. Every one knows what a calamity it is to Australia that all our industries should be hung up, and our ships lying idle in our harbors. That is no good to any one in this country, and it is a state of things that ought to be put a stop to at once. There are only two ways of stopping it. There is the humane, common-sense, statesmanlike way of settling the difficulty which I have indicated, and there is in the alternative the inhumane way by which the Government may, perhaps, starve men into accepting conditions which otherwise they would never accept. These are the two alternatives, and I say that the responsibility is upon the members of the Federal Government, and those supporting them, to make the Government of New South Wales adopt the sane one of them. I have stated the two alternative methods of dealing with the trouble, and honorable senators opposite, and the party they represent, will be called upon some day, perhaps in the near future, to say what action they took in the matter. They will be asked by the electors of this country what they did when the strike was on. They will be asked, &#34; Did you use your influence with the Federal Government to have the strike settled in a common-sense way, with a view to saving the country the loss of millions of money and a vast deal of heartburning and suffering.&#39;&#39; That is all that I desire to say on this question. I have said what I believe should be done, and the responsibility for doing it is on the National Government of Australia, and on no other. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to say a few words on this question.I approach the subject as calmly and deliberately as it is possible for me to do. I feel that speeches such as that just delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> have, not only since the strike occurred, but ever since the beginning of October, built up the industrial unrest and dissatisfaction which has culminated in the general strike with which we are faced to-day. I recognise that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> is quite sincere, but I honestly think that he is misguided, and is making a great mistake. I can picture the honorable senator delivering such a speech as he has just now made to the 150,000 people in the Sydney Domain. . I can imagine I hear his eloquence addressed to the men, and also the influence it would have in convincing them that the National Government of to-day are corrupt, that they are in the grasp of the Employers&#39; Federation, that they are the hirelings of capitalists out to cruel and crucify unionists. </para>

                            <para>- I have had more union experience than the honorable senator. I realize what unionists have done, and appreciate it. They have won their way to such a position to-day that industrial grievances can now be settled in a lawful tribunal by an impartial Judge. There is no grievance from which the workers of Australia are suffering to-day that cannot be equitably adjusted by an appeal to one of the industrial tribunals that have been established for the purpose. When we consider what unionists and their wives and children suffer from an industrial strike we are forced to conclude that such a strike is not merely foolish, but absolutely suicidal. It is destructive of unionism itself, but at a time like the present, when we have all the machinery for the adjustment of industrial differences by lawful Courts, it is absolutely stupid and altogether unnecessary. </para>

                    <para>Let me direct the attention of honorable senators to our position as a democratic people. We are to-day as much at war with Germany as are any of the other Allies involved. We must realize that. We are a thoroughly democratic community, and the Australian line of defence extends from General Birdwood to the nippers at work in the industrial shops of Australia to-day. What would our people think if our 360,000 men came out of the trenches in Flanders to-day and refused to fight? What must those men think when men employed in the workshops of Australia, because of some grievance with the management, throw down their arms and refuse to perform their part in the great conflict for the defence of Australia? I am satisfied that the men on strike do not realize the position, and while honorable senators and other public men make inflammatory speeches to them they will not realize it. It is the duty of every member of the Senate and of every public man in Australia to impress upon the men on strike that they should forbear, and should resort to constitutional tribunals for the adjustment of their grievances. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator quoted the only card he could obtain I say that he was enabled to obtain the one which it was felt carried the most conclusive evidence that the system complained of was bad. There was only one thing in the card quoted to which any one could take exception, and for my part I say that it is absurd to take exception to a man placed in charge of a body of men being asked to place on record, verbally or in writing his opinion  of  the men working under him. Every boss, every sub-manager, every person placed in authority over a number of men, is held responsible for the good working  of  the branch of the &#39;business of which he is given charge. If a man placed in such a position has men under him whose work is unsatisfactory he is held responsible for any failure in carrying out the work expected of him, if he does not report, either by a written card, letter, or report, or by a verbal statement, the fact that some of his men are not satisfactory.  If  any &#39; honorable senator opposite were placed in charge of a dozen, fifteen,  or  twenty men, and found that three  of  them were not doing a fair day&#39;s work, that they were loafing on their comrades, and th,at, unless their comrades did more than a fair thing the aggregate work  of  the gang would not be what it ought  to be, he would find it necessary., even to preserve harmony amongst the men themselves, to report to the foreman or manager of the works the men who were unsatisfactory, if he had not the authority to discharge them. What, would there be wrong about that? </para>

                    <para>Here we have a general industrial rebellion in Australia because the management of one industry thought fit to issue certain regulations for its conduct which were objectionable to some of the men employed. The men concerned do not understand dr realize the enormity of their offence. I say that it is an offence. It is the first time in my life that I have had to raise my voice against an industrial section fighting their employers. This is the first strike that I have known when I could conscientiously stand up and say that it is unjustified, and that it is a crime against the country to attempt to justify it. . </para>

                            <para>- In a great measure the cause of this strike has been the successful effort made by a large  number  of public men and others to give the workers the impression that the National Government are out to cripple and &#39;banish unionism. Over the length and breadth of Australia, without any warrant and without anything to support their argument, without a tittle of truth in their statements, speakers impressed upon the workers that if this Government obtained a majority on the 5th May, it was goodbye to  the  industrial and political liberty which they have fought for and enjoyed so long. That statement is absolutely- untrue. Every member of the National party  would  give an assurance to that effect if necessary, and would certainly resent any effort being made to prevent the industrial section of this country organizing for the betterment of their industrial and political conditions. On the day that the National party interfere with the right of any body of men to organize legitimately for the protection of their rights and privileges, and the betterment of their condition, on that day I shall certainly cease to be a member of it. </para>

                        (Queensland) to follow the bellowings  of the last  speaker,  except to say that his speech forces upon one the realization that there is no worse renegade, and none more bitter, than the political renegade who deserts the Labour party. Men of that  kind, of course, can never aspire to &#39;be like the real Conservative. They can never be the &#34;pure merino,&#34; but they must try to be as like it as they can; and, with that enid in view, the more bitterness they display, and &#39;the more hostility they show to the party that made them, the more they think they are pleasing lie people whose favours they hope to obtain.

I was sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> fell back on the old platitudes of I.W.W.-ism, treachery, and disloyalty, being at the bottom of the trouble in New South Wales. It appeared to me that, after the boosting the Industrial Workers of the World received at the hands of the Prime Minister and his followers at the last election, it would be a grave error, in the interests of Australia, to give it a further boost in connexion with this strike. The Industrial Workers of the World, prior to the notoriety and advertisement given to it by  the Prime Minister and his followers for electioneering purposes before the 5th May last, was relatively an. insignificant entity in Australia, but it got such a boost on that occasion that it has made advancement since. The curiosity of the people has been aroused, and they attend Industrial Workers of the World&#39;s meetings. It now appears that the Government are going to boost the Industrial Workers .of the World further in Australia- because nothing shoves things along in this country like  advertisement  That is why I regret the tenor of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> speech. </para>
                    <para>While we realize fully all. the evils, horrors, and hardships attendant on a widespread industrial upheaval of this nature, the one pleasing aspect of it to me is the disappointment of those who expected the smashing up of this strike at the very earliest stages at the hands of returned soldiers. </para>

                        <para>- It has been expected in Australia for the past two years. I have heard it  in the trains and on the boats, as far up as  the  North of Queensland. I have heard one commercial man say, &#34; Where is this going to end ? What is going to stop it?&#39;.&#39; and I have heard another reply, &#34; The returned soldiers when they come back.&#34; That is the general expectation in conversations of that kind, and I am pleased to agree  with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> that the Government will not get the returned soldiers to &#34; scab,&#34; as has been amply demonstrated during the past month in New South Wales. <inline font-style="italic">We</inline> have the information from Sydney that returned soldiers, to the number of 400 or 500, wearing their medals, have taken part in the strikers&#39; procession. Yet the members of the National party opposite, who profess, to be fair, unbiased, and non-party in a matter like this, are supporting a Government which is responsible for censoring information to the effect that returned soldiers are in any way allied with the strikers or their processions. From the censor&#39;s office in Melbourne, an instruction has been issued to the daily papers to the following effect: - </para>

Yet the party which they support, the party which was responsible for putting them where they are to-day, the party responsible for enticing them away from this party, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, in his recently acquired affluence referred to as &#34; the poverty-stricken Labour party,&#34; has issued instructions to that effect. It is afraid to let the people of Australia know that the returned soldiers are passing resolutions in support of, and sympathy with, the strikers in New South Wales, and taking part in their processions. </para>
                    <para>There is not the shadow of a doubt that the upheaval in New South Wales is &#39;the result of  a deep laid and well organized conspiracy for an attack upon the  fundamental and basic principles of unionism and labour.

                    <para>There is the reference to anarchy again. We had it just now, on the authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> that there were 150,000 people in the. Sydney Domain the other Sunday. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> gives us the same assurance. Are we to assume that those 150,000 people, assembled there that afternoon, were all members of the Industrial Workers of the World? </para>

                    <para>These people have also laid it down that the card system seeks to get the highest efficiency out of the men. That is the most favorable thing that they can say for the system. I put it to honorable senators opposite, particularly those who have passed through various occupations, that if they take any three men, say, Smith, Brown, and Robinson, they will find variations in their work. Robinson is an excellent workman, and would do a certain job in an hour and three-quarters. Smith is not such a good man as Robinson in the application of tools. Although physically he may be just as strong as Robinson, it would take him two hours to do the job. Perhaps a difference of a quarter of an hour is a big stretch to make, but I do so for the sake of convenience. The second man would take two hours to do the job. But the third man, equally well-intentioned and working as hard as, perhaps harder than, either the first or second man, would take two hours and a quarter to do the same amount of work. Is any employer - State or private - entitled to have all his men up to the efficiency of Robinson, the first man, who can do the job in an hour and three- &#39; quarters? If he is, then what is to become of the other two-thirds in the community? Any employer, State or private, will have to be satisfied with the law of averages. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> will find that in shearing and carpentering, and even in shovelling, equally strong and experienced men, working equally hard, do not do the same amount of work. In skilled work like shearing, it is impossible, and it is also impossible in such an apparently simple work as shovelling muck into a truck. Observe two shovellers working alongside each other, equally experienced and working equally hard. One man will do a lot more work than the other man, and with apparent ease. Take two miners working at a face. One man will bore a hole 9 inches deeper than the other, because he is a better man with the hammer and drill, but he does not ask for any more wages. A mining employer is not entitled to sack every man who does not come up to the highest pitch. Nor is the introduction of the card system justified in the endeavour to bring every employee in a factory or institution up to the point of the highest efficiency obtaining there. The idea is unsound. </para>

                        <para>. - I feel rather sorry that honorable senators opposite did not bring forward this question in a more conciliatory spirit. It has been approached in the same old Domain style. It has been approached by honorable senators just as if they were addressing the men who are out on strike? The speeches have been one-sided, bitter, and, if I may use the term, class-conscious. I am not approaching the question with any bias. I have known what it is to be in the same position as are our honorable friends opposite. I am familiar with the contemptible terms which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> used this afternoon towards the men who were turned out of the Labour party, and came over to this side. The use of such terms does not settle or clear up the industrial trouble one way or the other. The point is that in this continent we have what may be called a social revolution. It is of no use to shut our eyes and call it an ordinary strike, because it is more than an ordinary strike. All the constituted authorities in Australia are being defied. All industrial agreements have been broken. All the efforts which have been made to humanize the conditions of the workers, to give  them better hours, and generally to improve their lot, have been thrown to one side, not only during the present crisis, but almost ever since the Conciliation and Arbitration Court was established. </para>

A few moments ago I spoke of a social revolution in this continent. Those who. know the history of trade unionism, and what brought the Labour movement into existence, will not attempt at any time to interfere with the movement or to destroy it in any way, I realize that the talk from the other side is good gallery stuff for our honorable friends. I know* that it will bring rounds of applause to them to say that the Nationalist party are going to destroy trade unionism. But they know that the statement is not true. They know that it is simply gallery talk intended to inflame the passions of the crowd outside. I am nob aware of any State authority in Australia which wishes to destroy trade unionism. </para>

I know something about _ the history of trade unionism in Australia, and no honorable senator on the other side can tell me much in that regard. I know that very few of the men who are now prominent in what is called the Labour movement have ever done much for the cause or suffered for it. Those who came into the Labour movement in latter days are reaping all the benefits gained by the men who were its active advocates in the early days, when it did need some grit to be a unionist, or even to be a leader of unionism. </para>

                    <para>Ey constituted authority, Arbitration Courts have been created. Any body of men can form themselves into a union, and go before the Arbitration Court and get an award as to certain conditions which will put them in a very fair way. The majority of the men who have formed these unions of late years are not trade unionists in the old sense of the term. They simply organized to improve their own conditions, a proceeding which I do <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> find fault with. They came together without any thought of unionism, or knowledge of its past history. They have succeeded in getting almost everything they have demanded until they begin to look upon unionism as a weapon which gives them the power to wrest more and more concessions from employers and constituted authorities. They go to the Arbitration Courts and get improved conditions without ever having had to endure any suffering in the cause of unionism. They have no ideals. They have no conception of the ideals which have permeated the Labour party, or the Labour movement. They are simply actuated by the one thought of getting shorter hours and more money. This agitation has taught young men in thousands to become selfish. It has led them to utterly forget their duty to the State, and to, their employer. </para>

                            <para>- The Arbitration Courts have given the men fairly good wages; certainly higher wages than they had when, they were disorganized. I do not object to that. What I complain of is that, in the past, State and Federal Governments have been too weak to see that the agreements arrived at in the Courts were carried out. The men have deliberately broken their agreements and treated them as mere scraps of paper. If it could only be realized that this legislation is an experiment in industrialism and commercialism both sides would try. to keep. the agreements, and, if necessary, go to the Court later to have them varied in a constitutional way. </para>

                    <para>What has been the history of the Arbitration Court? Almost as soon as agreements have been signed they have been broken. The men want not only the Arbitration Court, but Parliament- and every other power, bent to their will, so that they can have their own way and be right under any set. of conditions. I do not think any honorable senators on the other side will deny that statement. It is one of the weaknesses of the Labour movement. I should like to see the trade unions take a  stand as we did in the early days, and make the men carry out the agreements, even if they should have to suffer under some grievances for a while. It is far better to suffer under a grievance for a time than to break an agreement before it has expired. </para>

I was trying to point out to my honorable friends opposite what I consider to be one of the weaknesses of the Labour movement at the present day.. Unless an honorable compact be honorably kept all this experimental legislation will be more or less a farce.

                    <para>Any one who studies constitutional history, the rise and fall of Governments, or event of social movements, knows that at times all constituted authorities are swept away, and I would impress upon my friends that there is a danger of the same :fate befalling these institutions in Australia. I know that very often it is difficult for leaders to take a stand. I do not say that the men are being led by agitators, for I know that often, it is difficult for them to take a stand and conscientiously oppose what is being demanded by men behind the movement. Many of the men do not think. That is the trouble. They only feel, and because they feel pressure they are disposed to take action. Trouble is also being caused in the movement by the introduction of a large number of young men, who have been brought into the movement because of what it offers them. These are the men who are ruining the movement. They do not think; they have no knowledge, and they act selfishly. T cannot discuss the merits of the dispute in New South Wales, because I am. not acquainted with the technicalities at issue, but I feel that if the Prime Minister, as the head of the National Government, insisted upon constituted authority being observed and agreements kept, so as to insure continuity of employment, he would have the admiration of the public anyhow, and later on he would have the admiration of the&#39; workers themselves. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;,</inline> in his reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> complained that the latter had made a one-sided statement, but after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> &#39;s speech I am inclined to think that honours are fairly even, because, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> urged the merits of the position from one side, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> speech equally represented the view of the New South Wales Government. The Minister also said that one of .the objects of the. strike was to pull down constituted authority; that it was a conspiracy on the part of those responsible for the strike to injure Great Britain and her Allies. It is a pity that this great question was approached this afternoon in a party spirit. When our friends opposite have the temerity to say that all the party bitterness comes from this side, they do not know what they are talking about, because a bitter party speech was delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> and what was practically a party speech was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> himself, and certainly &#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie made a bitter party speech. It does not matter &#39;to me very much which, side is in the right or wrong in this struggle, but I am concerned with the fact that  the people of Australia are suffering today, suffering probably as they have not suffered for many years, and if the  trouble lasts much longer, the industrial, commercial, and social upheaval will be worse than any they have ever been called upon to face. I speak feelingly on this subject, because I happen to belong to a State which is cut off from the mainland. There is no communication with Tasmania except by sea, and only one ship, commandeered by the Government, is conveying passengers and goods to that State. </para>

Surely he ought to recollect that it is not merely <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fuller</inline> and State employees who are concerned in this trouble, but every State Government and its employees and every private employer and his employees. I do hope that it is not too late, even now, for the Government to intervene. </para>

                        <para>. - I would not have spoken upon this motion but for the remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that I am here to represent the employers. I give that statement a distinct denial. I am here to represent the Nationalists who returned me on the 5th May last. I hope that I shall represent them well. I am also here to represent those electors who voted against me, and I shall do my best to see that they receive fair play. I bear no political animosity towards anybody, and if I can in any way assist those who are opposed to me my services will always be at their disposal. </para>

                    <para>I appreciate the motive that prompted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to bring before us this afternoon the question of the urgent need which exists for terminating the present strike, which has been called a disloyal strike. In this connexion we have to recollect that it is a strike against the Constitution of the country. If Parliament is not to be supreme, we shall soon drift into the deplorable state which exists in Russia  at  the present time. The industrial trouble now confronting us is not a strike for increased wages or for shorter hours. The unionists do not plead that their wages are insufficient or their hours  too  long. To my mind, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> touched on a very vital point this afternoon. He spoke of a condition which, I believe, underlies a great deal of the industrial unrest that is now being experienced. He said that if the card system were put into operation, some men who worked better than others would probably be paid more than would others. Some provision  of  that kind in our industrial life is absolutely necessary. Economically, it must come about. If a good man is not paid proportionately to the value of his services he will gradually slow down. Consequently some system of payment by results will have to be adopted - something in the nature of a minimum wage for the inefficient man, and a higher wage for the better man. In the absence of a system of that kind we shall be effecting  a  levelling downwards instead of a levelling upwards. Doubtless the card which was quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> this afternoon was the one to which the strikers particularly objected, -and against the&#39; introduction of which they took such drastic action. That card provides that  a  sub-overseer must report on men who are inefficient. Personally, I cannot see any possible objection to that. </para>

                            <para>- Quite naturally. In the old days when we used to be asked by the trade unions to meet their representatives in conference we frequently declined to do so. That was an arrogant spirit to exhibit - a spirit to which I was opposed. But nowadays the arrogance is upon the other side. The unions refuse to meet in conference the representatives of the employers. It is this spirit of pride which is the underlying cause of much industrial turmoil. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and his friends would only advise the strikers to give the card system a trial for three months, probably the trouble would be ended. </para>

                            <para>- I hope not. I ask honorable senators to put themselves for a moment in the position of a man who joins one of these political unions, because they are nothing else since the industrial side of unionism has been dropped. A man joins one of these political unions, and when election day arrives one of his fellow unionists says to him, &#34; How are you going to vote, mate?&#34; &#39;A man should have the right to decide for himself how he will vote. If he says, &#34; I am not going to vote for the Labour nominee,&#34; he is hunted, and his life is made a perfect hell upon earth. </para>

                        <para>. - Perhaps it is just as well that this discussion should have taken place this afternoon. If every member of the Senate could speak on the motion, I feel that all would avail themselves of the opportunity to express the utmost regret and sorrow that this political cataclysm should have overtaken Australia. I am sure that honorable senators opposite, who have spoken so warmly, and in one or two instances in such a vituperative way, have been honest in what they havesaid. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I should like to allude to a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> which has been indorsed by Senators Barnes and Ferricks in the course of their remarks, that there has been an attempt on the part of the New South. Wales Government to introduce the Taylor card system. This accusation hurled at the New South Wales Railways Commissioners and at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fuller,</inline> the Acting Premier, has been made time and again, but very early in the history of this lamentable strike <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fuller</inline> specifically denied that the Government ever had any intention to introduce that American card system. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fraser,</inline> the Chief Railways Commissioner of New South Wales, has also given the statement a specific and emphatic denial. It may be that some honorable senators, in talking about the Taylor card system, do not realize all that it means. The Taylor system of industrial efficiency and economy originated in America, and is really a system of motion study. The motions of workmen have been studied that they maybe reduced to a minimum, so that with the same exertion the workmen may do a greater amount of work. I admit that the Taylor system is a speeding-up system. I admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, when Minister of Munitions, refused to allow it to be introduced into the munition factories in England during the course of the war. But I again remind honorable senators who have said that the Government of New South Wales and the Railways Commissioners of that State intended to introduce the Taylor system that specific denials of that statement have been made from time to time, and that the only card system they tried to introduce was really a system for ascertaining the cost of the work as it goes on.. I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> during his speech, did not make any reference to the Taylor system, and did not accuse the Government of New South Wales and the Railways Commissioners of that State of attempting to introduce it. Had they attempted to do so, I am sure that the honorable senator would have mentioned the fact as an argument in favour of the strikers. </para>
                    <para>A good deal has been said this afternoon upon the broader matters than the mere dispute between the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales and their employees. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> has, in the course of very weighty remarks, pointed out thatourarbitration </para>
                    <para class="block">Saws have practically broken down, owing, &#163;rst, to the inability of the Government to enforce those laws on one side, and, -secondly, to the manifestly unfair position that the employing world is getting into when one side has to keep a law which cannot be enforced upon the other. Tam quite sure that Senators Gardiner, McDougall, and Grant very greatly deplore the position that unionism in New &#34;South Wales has got into owing to the unlawful start that was made by the railway employees. </para>

                            <para>- I have a. contrary experience.- I know many of. the tramway men who came out on strike. I spoke to some dozens of them, and asked them what was going to  happen  They said they did not know, but that they supposed the union leaders, would have a ballot before they were called out. In many directions I have heard extreme sorrow expressed by good honest workmen, of whom there have been so many in the employ of the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales, that such a huge strike should have occurred over such a small matter. I have heard sympathy expressed by unionists with the New South Wales Railways Commissioners in connexion with their attempt to improve the railway service of the State. As one honorable  senator  has pointed out, the dispute is not in connexion with wages, hours, overtime, privileges, or such conditions of work as the Arbitration Court deals with. It is merely a dispute in connexion with the administration of the railways by the Railways Commissioners, to whom the taxpayers of New South Wales look for the proper administration of their property. I am sure that if Senators Gardiner, Grant, and McDougall, those moderate, sage, and experienced leaders, had had their way, this cataclysm would never have occurred. I deplore the position these fine men have got into owing to the precipitate actions of their leaders. Some references have been made to; meetings in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Sydney Domain. I am sure that at  no  time have there  been  more than 100,000 people there. The Sydney Domain meetings are amongst those things to which people go now on a Sunday afternoon. People attend these meetings, addressed from dozens of platforms, for the amusement to be derived from some of the extreme sayings of the orators. </para>

                    <para>We all deplore the strike, and are sorry that it occurred over such a trivial thing. It has shown that in Australia unionism has in many directions run mad. It has shown that -no law will hold some unionists The strike has shown, if it has shown anything, that there is some necessity to amend our conciliation and arbitration laws in the direction of making men, once they accept a decision, obey the law in some shape or form. I, personally, do not think that we can look for much improvement when one side is determined to succeed, win, tie, or wrangle, and the other side has to, obey the law and pay all fines imposed. I appeal to my honorable friends on the other side, and particularly to honorable senators representing the State of New South Wales, to do what they can to keep Labour on the even keel. Some of the utterances to which we have listened here this afternoon were worthy of the Sydney Domain, to which we go for an afternoon&#39;s amusement. I say deliberately that some honorable senators, in talking about &#34; scabs,&#34; are guilty of having dirty tongues. When there is so much going on on the other side of the world, such expressions should be absent from speeches delivered, in a deliberate, calm, and cool assembly such as the Senate ought to be. </para>
                    <para>I am with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> in desiring to calmly and dispassionately discuss this matter of the industrial upheaval which is running like a bush fire through the length and breadth of Australia. I know something about the sufferings of wives and children, and that they have to go short sometimes even of bread because of the loyalty of unionists to their unions. I agree fully with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that on the whole the Australian working man does a good day&#39;s work for a fair day&#39;s pay. But in saying- &#34; on the whole,&#34; that implies that there are a number who do not, and will not, do a fair day&#39;s work for a fair day&#39;s pay, and desire tq drag down the honest men who wish to give their employer a fair deal, to their own low level. There are rumours all over Sydney to-day about what some men have been doing in the railway workshops in Government employ. Perhaps I could astound the Senate with what I have heard on just as. good authority as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> had for many of the things which he stated here to-day. </para>

                            <para>- One man told me that he went to work in the railway workshops, and that after being there  a  week he was told to slow down, and that he was doing too much work. After a month of it he could not stand any more, and he left his employment. These things have been occurring. It is no wonder that the New South Wales Railways Commissioners wanted to tighten up the administration of the railways in that State. </para>

Your ruling, sir, is a narrow ruling, and I hold that the Standing Orders should always be interpreted to widen, if possible, and not to narrow, our privileges.

                <para>Vice-President of the Executive Council)-  &#91;8.46&#93;.-  I move- </para>
                <para class="block">That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                <para class="block">I remind honorable senators of the somewhat checkered history of the measure.. It was, as they know, the result of a Very general feeling that if there was one subject upon which taxation might legitimately be levied, it was the profits which  were directly a result of the war. That, I take it, was the original conception of the measure. When, however, the obligation arose to look a little more closely into the matter; it was discovered, and I think generally recognised, that it was practically impossible, especially in a country like Australia, to identify with absolute certainty the profits which did arise as a result of the war. The- conception then broadened out, until finally we get a measure to levy taxation upon the excess profits which have arisen during war time. I do not propose to say anything as to these two somewhat diverse principles, but I submit the measure as one which is designed to levy a tax upon profit&#39;s earned in war time in excess of those which were earned in pre-war times. </para>
                <para>The excess profits represent the amount by which the profits arising in a financial year - that is, the financial year covered by the taxation proposals of the measure - exceed the pre-war standard of profits. From this sum there is to be deducted first an exemption of &#163;200. This exemption disappears in the first year when the excess profits reach &#163;600, &#39; and in the second year when the excess profits reach &#163;1,000. It disappears by gradations with which honorable senators who have followed that other interesting measure, the graduated Income Tax Act, will readily understand. </para>
                <para>The profits arising in a financial year where the business accounting period is not coterminous with that year, will- be calculated from the monthly average of profits of each, business accounting period, extending into the financial year. For example, if a business generally balances its accounts on the 31st December in each year, half the profits of each accounting period extending into the financial year will be added together, and taken as the profits arising .within the financial year. </para>
                <para>The pre-war standard of profits may be either a profit standard or a percentage standard. The profits standard is the actual profits of the business, or, in certain cases, the former salary or salaries of the owner or owners of the business. In no case will the profits standard be less than &#163;500. </para>
                <para>The percentage standard is 10 per cent, on the amount of the capital employed in the business at the end of the last pre-war trade year. </para>
                <para>The general scheme- of the Bill is to compare the pre-war profits where they exist with the war-time profits on the  same amount of capital. In order that this object may be achieved, the Bill provides that where more capital has been, used in the war-time accounting period than in the pre-war period, a deduction is to be allowed from the war-time profits of 10 per cent., or the rate of pre-war profits calculated on the additional capital employed. In other words, that is a simple arithmetical calculation by which, where a firm employs more capital, that factor will be taken into- account. Similarly, by another provision, where less capital is employed, a like adjustment will be required. This will leave an amount of war-time profits arising from the use of the same amount of capital as was employed in the pre-war period. From that amount of profits will be deducted the pre-war standard of profits, and the tax will be calculated on the excess, if any, .remaining. </para>
                <para>The Government has included in the Bill provisions under which no- business will pay any tax unless the war-time profits which are to be brought into the assessment exceed &#163;1,000. This is secured by sub-clause 3 of clause 15, which makes the minimum pre-war standard in any case &#163;500 ; by sub-clause 7 of clause 14, second and third provisos, for a deduction from the war-time profits of at least &#163;300 for management by the owner; and, finally, by a fixed and undiminishing general exemption of &#163;200 provided in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub-clause 3 of clause&#39; 7 ; that is to say, a business with an actual pre-war standard of profits not exceeding &#163;500 will always have an undiminishing general exemption of &#163;200. </para>
                <para>Where the profits amount to more than &#163;1,000, that &#163;200 exemption will gradually disappear. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, in exactly the same way. Where the actual pre-war profits exceed &#163;500, but do not exceed &#163;1,000, there is to be an addition to the actual pre-war profits of the difference between that amount and &#163;1,000. In these cases the diminishing exemption of &#163;200 will operate on all profits exceeding &#163;1,000. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In arriving at the profits in both the pre-war and- the war-time periods, the  rules laid down in the Income Tax Assessment Act regarding deductions are to be followed, and I have no doubt that honorable senator? are thoroughly familiar with the provisions of that Act. But in addition to the deductions allowed under the Act, this Bill, in clause 14, allows other deductions of a special character, such as amortization of the value of wasting assets used for the purpose of the business, expenditure on leasehold properties, either to purchase the leasehold estate or to create improvements on leasehold lands, losses due to fire, robbery, or embezzlement which are irrecoverable, either directly or by way of insurance; alterations, but! not additions, te plant, machinery and premises for the purpose of the business which have been charged to the revenue account; all bad debts proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been written off in the accounting period ; and, in the case of a mining company other than one mining for coal, so much of the profits of the accounting period as is appropriated for development or new plant. </para>
                    <para>A deduction will also be allowed of wartime profits tax paid outside of Australia in respect to excess profits, together with Commonwealth and State income taxes paid in respect to those profits. Other rates and taxes paid in Australia axe also deductible. </para>
                    <para>A war-time profits tax was first imposed by the British Parliament by the Finance Act (No. 2) of 1915. Canada was the next part of the Empire to impose a wartime profits tax. In 1916, the Canadian Parliament passed what they termed a business profits war tax. Both in the case of Great Britain and in the case of Canada, experience has suggested, I presume, certain alterations which have been made from time to time. </para>

                    <para>Coming back to the measure before the Senate, all businesses which have made a profit of more than 7 per cent. on capital in any war-time accounting period must pay tax on the excess of the profit over 7 per cent. Whilst the Canadian scheme attains simple and economical administration, and a large revenue, it acts unjustly on those businesses which have not made greater profits during the wartime year, or the profits of which have diminished owing to the war, but are still in excess of 7 per cent. on capital. </para>
                    <para>The Dominion of New Zealand followed with its tax, but imposed it by way of an additional income tax. The tax is 45 per cent. of the amount by which the income assessable to income tax in the war-time accounting period exceeds the average yearly assessable income of any shorter pre-war business period, or 7 per cent. of the capital employed in the business, whichever is the greater. </para>
                    <para>The French Parliament has lately passed a war-time profits tax, with the details of which I need not, perhaps, trouble the Senate. </para>
                    <para>This Bill is modelled on the English Act, but various modifications have been introduced, with the view to rendering the incidence of the tax more equitable. The conditions in Australia are very different from those in England, and the modifications I have referred to have been made to meet those changed conditions. </para>
                    <para>The first profits to be taxed are those which are made by a business after the 1st July, 1915, and the tax will be levied until the 30th June following the declaration of peace. </para>

                    <para>The exemption is limited to the business, and does not extend to any business which supplies anything to, or purchases any of, the products of the exempt business. The clause also provides for the exemption of persons on active service outside Australia whose duties require them to be in any part of the field of operations where there is danger to life. </para>
                    <para>Where a person carries on more than one business, and makes a profit in some and losses in others, he may set the losses against the profits before the tax is1 levied. </para>
                    <para>In the case of new businesses and businesses which have only become profit-earning during the war, provision is made for an increase in the pre-war standard to such an extent as may be necessary to insure the financial stability of the business. Any decision of the Commissioner in this respect is subject to appeal to t&#62;e Board of Referees, whose decision shall be final. I shall refer to that Board later. </para>
                    <para>In the case of new companies the Bill limits the deduction for remuneration of directors to &#163;1,000. This is a very necessary provision to prevent the absorption of profits of these companies by way of directors&#39; fees. In the case of older companies the remuneration of directors, managers, &#38;c, is limited to what was paid in the pre-war years.  </para>
                    <para>The Commissioner, however, has power- to increase the allowance owing to any &#39; special circumstances, or the fact that the remuneration depends upon the profits of the business. </para>
                    <para>The tax is limited to the profits derived from sources in Australia. The Bill contains a provision under which the Treasurer may arrange with the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the apportionment between the Imperial and the Commonwealth Governments towards the sup- &#39; plies necessary for the services of the Crown of the war-time profits tax under the Commonwealth Act or under the Imperial Act, whichever provides the greater amount, and may further agree that in any such case the tax or duty chargeable pursuant to the other of these Acts shall not be collected. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say for the moment that it was so, but I think it is highly probable. As honorable senators know, there are certain businesses which&#39; attract the attention of both the . Imperial Chancellor and the Commonwealth Treasurer. Obviously, if both taxes were levied, seeing that the proposed tax under this Bill for the first year will be 50 per cent., and that the Imperial tax is in excess of that, I think 60 or 70 per cent., it is quite clear that the two taxes would amount to more than 100 per cent, of the amount to be taxed This is therefore a provision by -which the Treasurer of the Commonwealth hopes to obtain some arrangement with the Im- . penal Chancellor by which when deducting the whole of the profits some  fair proportion of it may be allotted to the respective Treasurers of the two countries. </para>

                    <para>The tax will&#39; not apply to profits derived from sources outside Australia, although the control and management of the business may be in Australia. If capital has been withdrawn from the business in .the war-time years it is necessary to adjust the profits of those years in order to enable a proper comparison to be made with the pre-war years. This is done by adding to the profits 10 per cent, of the withdrawn capital, or the average rate of pre-war profits. </para>
                    <para>Provision is made in clause 14, subclauses 10 and 11, for recouping past losses from the -war-time profits. In the case of a- pastoral business, where any profits made in the last three pre-war trade years have been invested in the business and have later been lost owing to the drought, adverse seasons, or other adverse conditions, and any part of the current accounting period&#39;s profits has been applied in extinction of that loss, the profits applied in extinction of the loss and any other loss which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, has been recouped from the war-time profits, shall be allowed as a deduction. That. seems, perhaps, a little involved; but I think honorable senators will recognise that it merely provides in the case of the pastoral industries that if a man&#39;s flocks and herds have been decimated by a year or two of drought, he shall be allowed to recoup himself for such losses out of the profits for the succeeding years before he becomes subject to the tax. </para>

                    <para>In the case of any other business where it has sustained a net loss since the first of the three selected pre-war trade years (in the case of a business adopt- . ing a profits standard), or since the first one of the last three pre-war trade years (in the case of a business adopting a percentage standard), and up to the beginning of the taxable accounting period, and has applied portion of the profits of the current accounting period in extinction of that loss, the amount of profits so applied is to be allowed as a deduction. That seems to answer the interjection made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> a little&#39; while ago. The pastoralist is to be allowed a &#39;little longer period than an ordinary business man in which to set his losses against his profits. Where money i3 borrowed and used for the purpose of acquiring assets, from the use of which profits are made, a deduction is to be allowed of the difference between the interest paid and 10 per cent. In other words, as a man is allowed a 10 per cent, margin, he will also be allowed 10 per cent, upon any borrowed capital. Profits made on contracts extending over a term of years are to be apportioned over the&#39; periods of such contracts. I think honorable senators will see the necessity for this. A man might have a contract running for three years, but the whole of his profits might have been made in one year, so it is proposed to apportion the. profits over the period of the contract. </para>
                    <para>The whole basis of the assessment depends upon the capital employed in the business. Clause 16 deals with this question. The amount of capital of a business is the capital paid up by the owner in money or in kind, together, with all accumulated trading, profits invested in the business, with, the addition or subtraction of balances brought forward from previous years to the credit or debit of  profit and loss  account. Where an asset has been, acquired otherwise than for cash it is to be valued as ah the time of acquisition and treated as part of the capital.. Patents and secret, processes are deemed, to be material assets, and are to be valued as before mentioned. </para>
                    <para>Part VII. of the . Bill deals with the matter of obtaining returns from taxpayers and the making of assessments. The clauses are machinery clauses, and follow the usual lines. They are similar to sections in the Income Tax Assessment Act. Clauses 20 to 25 deal with returns and assessments. </para>
                    <para>In Part VIII. provision is made for the appointment of a Board- of Referees. This Board will deal with questions of fact. The primary decision is given by the Commissioner, but if a taxpayer is dissatisfied with that decision he may, in cases arising out of any of the headings mentioned in clauses 10-12, appeal to the Board of Referees, whose decision will be final. The Board will consist of three persons, and will be appointed by the Governor-General. Appeals on matters of law will be referred to the High Court, the Supreme Court, or a County or District Court), presided over by a Judge authorized by the Governor-General. The Board of Referees have power to award costs and to make regulations regulating the practice and procedure. </para>
                    <para>The Bill contains wide powers for the recovery of the tax. Notices of assessment will be given to all taxpayers, and sixty days allowed for payment of the tax. If the tax is not paid within that time, a penalty of 10 per cent, of the tax is payable in addition. The Commissioner has power to extend the time for payment or to permit payment by instalments. Power is also given to the Commissioner to remit penalties. </para>
                    <para>The Bill also provides that the person for the time being owning or carrying on the business, or acting as agent for another person carrying on the business, may be assessed for the tax. If the business has ceased the tax may be assessed on the person who owned or carried om the business immediately before it ceased. Where a business is transferred to another person the person to whom it is transferred is personally liable to pay any tax which may subsequently be found to be payable if he fails to secure the payment of the tax to the Commissioner. Where a company is wound up the liquidator is required to give the Commissioner notice, and to set aside sufficient to pay any tax that may bo found to be payable. It is further provided that if a business is unable to repay its creditors or debenture holders no tax will be payable. </para>
                    <para>The liability of agents and trustees in regard to the making of returns and paying the tax is fully set out in clauses 43 and 44. If an agent or trustee disposes of any funds in his possession after being informed of his liability for tax and does nob pay the tax, he will be personally liable to pay it. </para>

I submit it as a first attempt to levy taxation upon excess profits as a legitimate source of revenue, though there may be ample room for controversy over the details by which the principle is to be applied. </para>

                            <para>- Since then certain amendments have been made in another place, and these may have affected the estimate. Whilst I would hesitate to throw the slightest reflection upon the estimates made by the Treasurer&#39;s responsible officers, I feel that in breaking new ground, as is the case in this Bill, estimates as to the revenue to be obtained must necessarily be somewhat loose, and that we cannot expect to look with any) degree of confidence upon any estimates until we have had experience of the! working of the measure. </para>

                            <para>-  Certainly  at the expense of the taxpayer. It is impossible for me to say what the cost of collection will be j but, as the work will be carried  on by the officials responsible for the collection of the land and income tax, the additional work will not, in my judgment, involve any serious addition to the cost of the two Departments referred to. There appears to be a desire for information as to estimates of possible revenue and expenditure, and I shall endeavour to place the figures before the Senate during the course of debate. Meanwhile, having done what I could to place an admittedly complex measure before honorable senators, I shall content myself with moving the second reading. </para>

The message was sent direct to the Secretary of State, and the, High Commissioner apparently knew nothing of it. Surely the High Commissioner ought to have been sufficiently informed of what was transpiring on such an important matter between the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State to be able to give clear and definite information upon it to the Agent-General of any State when requested to do so. To me it is astonishing that he was hot able to give the Agent-General for Tasmania exact information. There seems to have been either an unwarrantable delay on the part of the Prime Minister&#39;s Office in sending the cable, or on the part of the British </para>

                        <para>- Immediately on receipt of that lettergram, I visited the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, and inquired whether a cable had been sent to the Imperial authorities In accordance with the Prime Minister&#39;s promise to all the representatives of Tasmania. I learned that the cable had been despatched. I saw a copy of it. It was not sent as a separate cable dealing with this particular matter. The cable containing the offer dealt with other matters, including jams and preserves. The Secretary or State replied to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> in regard to jams and preserves, but omitted to reply to his offer in respect of dried fruit. The officers of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department sent another cable to the High Commissioner the same afternoon, asking him to bring before the Secretary of State the offer in question, and also urging upon him the necessity for an immediate and satisfactory reply. The mistake was made by the British authorities in failing to notice that in the cable there was an offer of 150,000 cases of dried fruit, each containing 56 lbs., and urging the Imperial Government to become the purchaser of it. I understand that an answer to the cable which was sent direct to the High Commissioner has not yet been received. </para>

                    <para>. - I am among those honorable senators who received&#34; a similar lettergram to that which has been quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe;</inline> but I knew something of the circumstances which preceded its despatch. I was one of the Tasmanian members who, in conjunction with a number of fruit-growers from that State, waited upon the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and requested him to offer to the Imperial Government a certain quantity of . evaporated fruit. He promised to submit the offer to the Imperial Government, and I understand that he did so. To that offer no reply has yet been received. The lettergram which I received was probably sent to every Tasmanian representative in this Parliament. I had not been in receipt of it more than ten minutes before I was informed &#39;that the offer of 150,000 cases of evaporated apples had been made by the Prime Minister in a cable which had been despatched to the Secretary of State. The reason why that offer was sent through, the channel I have mentioned is that the Commonwealth Government is in constant communication with the Imperial authorities upon matters connected with the war. It is also in daily, 0* nightly, communication with the High Commissioner in regard to Australian affairs. As the offer in question related to a matter which is connected with the war, viz., the supply of evaporated fruit to Australian troops who are serving abroad, it was embodied in a cable to the Secretary of State.. Naturally, that message was dent in conjunction with other messages relating to war subjects. The message that is despatched to the High Commissioner, either daily or nightly, does not deal with matters connected with the war. The Secretary of State replied to the general message in which the offer was included, and in the course of his reply consented to purchase a certain limited quantity of jam, and made a suggestion with regard to the balance of the jam offered to them. That suggestion the Government have been acting upon since. No reference was made to the evaporated fruit. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> had adopted the course which, in common with other honorable senators, I adopted, and had gone to the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, he would have found that everything that it was possible for the Department to do was being done in the matter. </para>

                        <para>- The High Commissioner was approached through the intervention of. the Premier of Tasmania by the Agent-General of that State, and he told the Agent-General that he had received no message with regard to the offer on behalf of the fruit-growers. I have explained that the Imperial and Commonwealth authorities are in daily or nightly communication with regard to various matters connected with the war. This was one of such matters, and necessarily and properly at the present juncture the communication was direct. Consequently the High Commissioner knew nothing of the offer of the evaporated! fruit, and he said so. I may say that within ten minutes after I received this representation from the fruit-growers of Tasmania I was able to send a reply to the Tasmanian people which, from the information I have since received, I believe was satisfactory. </para>

I quite understand that on the present motion for the adjournment of the Senate I will not bo allowed in any sense to revive the debate which took place on- my motion this afternoon. However, there are one or two matters in connexion with which I desire to make a personal explanation, and which1, I think, I will be in order in referring to. I proposed this afternoon to quote something that was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzpatrick,</inline> a member of the New South Wales Government, but as I had mislaid the newspaper cutting from which I intended to quote, I made the quotation as well as I could from memory. I think I quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzpatrick</inline> exactly, and as I have since discovered the newspaper  cutting, I wish now to give the quotation as it appears therein. Speaking to the men at the Sydney Cricket Ground, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pitzpatrick</inline> said - </para>

Each of these honorable senators, dealing with my references to the card system, said that I had produced what was evidently the worst card in connexion with the system. I say, in all candour, that until 1 o&#39;clock to-day it was not my intention to move the adjournment of the Senate to deal with this matter. The card I produced was re* f erred to because there was a copy of it in the public press, and I was able to get it. I hope that the honorable senators whom I have mentioned will accept that explanation as a fair statement of the reason why I produced that particular card, but I wish to say with regard to the card system that the men on strike are entirely against the introduction of that system. </para>

                <para>I have no desire to further revive the debate df this afternoon, but I now wish to remind the Government of some dangers arising through the strike that is occurring in Sydney at. the present time. I suppose that the Government are aware that there is at present, a strike on in Sydney, and possibly in other parts of Australia. Owing to that strike, the New South Wales Government have brought certain men to work on the wharfs. These men have committed an act which, although, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Sun,</inline> may be regarded as having been done in a light spirit, was of such a nature that it is worth while that the attention of the Government should be directed to it. </para>

We are not now living in peaceful times, and a serious infringement of the rights of people pf other nations  cannot  be thoughtlessly passed over. I ask the Government first of all to inquire as to the truth of the report in this matter.

                        <para>- The newspaper says that this man working on the wharf is worth &#163;100,000. He evidently came to Sydney with the magnificent idea to take the place of the poor fellows who get 9s. 3d. a day. He worked only a week at the wharfs when, according to this statement, he became one of the worst types  of  the Industrial Workers of the World. He&#34; makes a law unto himself, and if he cannot get his own way is prepared to destroy another man&#39;s property. I have said there are two ways of looking at this matter. It may be a hoax on the part of a newspaper . that I have admitted is in no way reliable, or it may be a serious infringement of the rights of a citizen of another country. I value the liberty and rights of our own people too highly to trespass upon the liberties&#62; rights, and protection which, I think, we should extend to the citizens of .other countries. Although the matter may be regarded humorously, I ask the Government first of all to inquire as to the truth of the .statement, and then to consider whether they should not negotiate with the Government of New South Wales to protest against &#39;acts of lawlessness of this kind even by men who are worth &#163;100,000. It is a fair thing that they should see that the people of other countries are protected from the lawlessness and the Industrial Workers of the  World  methods of gentlemen who are at present engaged in New South Wales as strike breakers. </para>

                        <para>- Because of the simple facts of the case. A deputation waited upon the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and asked him to make certain overtures to the Imperial Government. He said that he would do so, and he has done so. He has cabled to the Old Country, not by any indirect channel, but directly, as he was entitled to do as Prime Minister, to the Imperial Minister handling this section of Imperial work which has a direct relation to the war. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has pointed out, though the Prime Minister&#39;s cable dealt with three subjects, the Imperial Government appear to have overlooked one of them, or, and this seems to me a quite reasonable explanation, they were prepared to give a definite answer with regard to two; and were not prepared to do so regarding the third. These matters are not quite as simple as some honorable senators may imagine. If the Imperial Government require a little time to look. into this matter, I do not know that there is any reason to become abusive about it. We are asking them in this matter to do what they have done before in connexion with other products. They have gone out of their way to help the producers of Australia by doing what no one else is prepared to do at the present time, and that is, buying our products from us. </para>

If the matter was so very urgent, why did not the Premier of Tasmania, instead of wiring to London, send his wire here to the Prime Minister in whose hands the matter was? Instead of doing so, he went behind the back of the gentleman who had undertaken to act as negotiator on behalf of Tasmanian interests, and cabled to the Agent-General for Tasmania - </para>

The Premier of Tasmania wired to the Agent-General for that State, who saw the High Commissioner, and then cabled to the Premier of the State that the High Commissioner said, &#34; No telegram has been received from the Prime Minister here.&#34;  I cannot help thinking that that was the only message the High Commissioner was in a position to- send. The Tasmanian Premier did not ask his Agent-General to see the  High Commissioner at&#39; all, but asked him to ascertain from the British Government what had been done. Seeing the channel he adopted, if he did not succeed, that is his own  look-out </para>

                        <para>- The first cable offering the goods was sent some time ago. The absence of an answer to it naturally exercised the mind of the Tasmanian Premier, and he moved in the matter by communicating with his Agent-General in London, who was in no sense a party to the negotiations. This must have been some days ago, and had he then communicated with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> the cable sent early this week would have been sent a few days before. </para>

As I understand it, the Industrial Workers, of the World method is a disinclination to work; but on this occasion these men were not only working themselves, but said, &#34; We are going to make the Chinaman work, too &#34; - a distinct t violation of the principles of the Industrial Workers &#169;f the World. I appreciate the fact that the upholders of law and order have to-day received a very valuable recruit in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> He says that he is against any infringement of the liberties of foreigners and others who visit this country. If he is so great a stickler for their rights and privileges, I am sure he will be equally insistent on the right of our own people to work if they want to. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator is so perturbed at anything which savours of interference with the liberty of a Chinese visitor, I am entitled to his support, if it becomes necessary, in seeing that there is no interference with the rights of any of our countrymen who are anxious to work in Australia. The honorable senator was very concerned about the possibility of international complications over this matter, and suggested the risk of a serious, struggle with the great Chinese Republic. I hope the honorable senator will be consistent. Not long ago certain workmen in this city refused to load a boat going to Java, and a Japanese boat going to Japan. There was every possibility of international complications there; but if there was one silent man in Australia, it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> There was much greater possibility of, trouble through, vessels belonging to friendly nations, one our Ally, being refused the necessary assistance to load in our ports to enable them to sail in pursuance of their ordinary peaceful commercial undertakings, than there is over the incident brought up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner;</inline> but the honorable senator had nothing to say about it. So long as the trouble seemed, to arise from those whose cause he championed, he was indifferent to possible, international complications; but when it comes through some action, alleged or real, on the part of those who are doing the work that his friends will not do, he sees the possibility of international complications at once. </para>

He never thought it worth his while to- bring that matter before the attention of the Senate; but because a Chinaman is the subject of, at most, a practical joke, he comes here as the indignant champion of the rights of people to carry on their lawful occupations. I hope the present  trouble will be speedily over; but if it is prolonged, I ask the honorable senator to remember what he has said here, and in future to stand up for the right of every man, in conformity with the law, to exercise his freedom in carrying out his lawful occupation. </para>
