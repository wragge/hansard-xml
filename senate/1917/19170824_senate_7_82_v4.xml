                    <para class="block">I feel that I am under an obligation to inform the Senate as to the reasons for suspending the Standing and Sessional Orders to enable this measure to go through at the present sitting. I have no desire to pass the Bill through to-day if the Senate is of a contrary opinion; but I moved the suspension of the Standing and Sessional Orders to enable the Bill to go through if, after hearing what I have to say, the Senate should deem that course desirable. &#39; The first reason for submitting the motion for suspension was that, owing to that admirable celerity with which the Senate works we have cleaned up our business-paper. In this regard I may be permitted to say, without making; any invidious distinction, that the Senate is an admirable example to many legislative bodies in this country. Another reason why I submitted the motion was that owing to the fact that we had disposed of the business presented to us there is no other work available today. It is obvious that if we dispose of this measure to-day the Senate can, without detriment to public business, and possibly to the convenience of honorable senators generally, see no necessity to meet next week. </para>

                    <para>This is a very simple Bill, inasmuch as it is one with which we are familiar from having to deal with, corresponding proposals every year. It authorizes the Government to spend the sum of &#163;1,257,000 out of revenue on certain public works which are detailed in the schedules attached to it. I need hardly tell honorable senators that if these works are approved by the Senate it is desirable that the Department charged with their construction should be free to proceed with them at the earliest possible moment. The only point which may occur to honorable senators is the one of policy, and that is as to how far public works should be constructed out of revenue and how far out of loan. But there is no need for the discussion of that point on this Bill. The works now submitted to the Senate for its approval will be constructed out of revenue, and if honorable senators should feel disposed to demur to the constructing of works out of loan the place for their criticism will be, not on this Bill, but &#39; on the Bill in which they will be asked to vote loan moneys for the construction of other public works. </para>
                    <para>The present proposals of the Government, as covered in this measure, involve an expenditure of &#163;1,257,000 out of revenue as against an expenditure of &#163;4,301,000 out of revenue last year. The later proposal to be submitted to the Senate will be one to provide for an expenditure of &#163;2,750,000 out of loan. But, as I have said, that is a proposal which&#39; can, and, I think, should be dealt with on its merits, and does not in any way affect the present one. The public works proposals of the Government for the cur rent financial year amount to &#163;4,000,000, as against &#163;4,301,000 in the last financial year. Even these figures hardly disclose the real nature of the reduction that has been made, because last year &#163;4,301,000 was spent. Honorable senators know from past experience that the amount voted by Parliament, that is, the Estimates, is rarely reached. There is almost invariably some portion of the amount which is unexpended at the end of the financial year. If the experience of the past is repeated it is obvious that the expenditure for this year will show a very considerable reduction on the expenditure for last year. With these few observations I submit the Bill to honorable senators. </para>

                        (New South Wales) &#91;11.151. - I notice an item of &#163;11,000 in the schedule to this Bill to cover expenditure at the Federal Capital. A considerable time ago it was decided to establish the Federal Capital at Canberra. Up to date we have spent approximately &#163;2,000,000 on the Federal Territory. Now, apparently, the total expenditure proposed there for the current financial year is to be cut down to &#163;11,000. If the proposal to construct the Federal Capital at Canberra is to be entirely abandoned by the Government they should be honest enough to say so in a straightforward way. For various reasons almost everything that has been attempted at Canberra has been thwarted, and now a vote of only &#163;11,000 is provided to continue the construction of the Capital. That is very unsatisfactory, to my. mind. I realize the difficulty of removing the Capital from one place to another, but I am not sure that it would not be far better to abandon Canberra as the Federal Capital altogether than to proceed at this snail&#39;s pace with its construction. Honorable senators who have visited Canberra know that a very efficient water supply system has been provided there, a power house has been constructed, and substantial brickworks have been erected. Other improvements have also been made there, but apparently all the expenditure upon these works is to be regarded as only so much wasted money. The public and the Senate are entitled to know what really is the intention of the present Government with regard to proceeding with the construction of the Federal Capital.
                    </para>
                    <para>I believe it is intended to undertake preliminary work in connexion with the establishment of an- arsenal at Canberra, and some expenditure has already been incurred on this account. I should like to say that, while I have no objection to the appointment of a chemist at &#163;750 per year, or to his being provided with every possible office and other accommodation, the first thing the Government should do in connexion with the construction of the arsenal is to recognise that workmen will be required for the work, and that suitable house accommodation should be provided for them. I have previously referred to the disgraceful accommodation provided at the Federal Capital for the men employed in the construction of the power house, and for some who are now employed at the brick works. </para>

                            <para>- I know- there is a vote on the Estimates for the purpose, and I am reminding the Senate that all Governments have failed in the past to provide decent house accommodation for working men employed at Canberra. It is no doubt quite the correct thing to supply a house, which, I understand, cost more than &#163;2,000, for the Administrator of the Federal Territory. It was quite correct, also, to provide up-to-date house accommodation for permanent and semipermanent officials employed there; but I am complaining that the ordinary working men- employed at Canberra have been expected to provide their own house accommodation, although they are only intermittently employed, and are frequently decorated with the order of the sack. That is a kind of thing that should be stopped. If the Government can afford to spend thousands of pounds in providing house accommodation for the Administrator and other officers, why cannot they furnish proper accommodation for the workers employed &#39;at the Federal Capital ? People wonder why workers jib and object to the conditions of their employment. The marvel to mo is that they should be so tame as they are. If they gave more consideration to the matter they would not . work at all until they received better treatment. </para>

I strenuously object to the neglect! on the part of the Commonwealth Government to provide decent house accommodation for workers employed at Canberra. I had some photographs taken of the workmen&#39;s huts there which would form a most interesting exhibition. This Commonwealth is sufficiently&#39; wealthy to provide proper house accommodation for workers at the Federal Capital. Why should working men be singled out for this invidious treatment while the permanent officers employed at the capital are so well looked after? </para>

                    <para>We have received no information from the Vice-President of the Executive Council as to how the vote of &#163;11,000, to which I have referred, is to be spent. I was at Canberra the other day, and it appeared to me that the brick works were closed down, and construction work at the Cotter River dam was stopped. The powerhouse a&#39;pparently has been completed, and we should be told what is t&#39;o be done with this vote of &#163;11,000. Is it  proposed to expend this money on the- construction of workmen&#39;s dwellings at Canberra? I was informed some time ago that plans had been prepared for house accommodation for workers at Canberra, but apparently nothing further has been done in the matter. Unless this money has already been hypothecated, I suggest  that  a large portion of it should be used to provide proper house accommodation for the workmen who will be employed at Canberra later on. The men employed at the Cotter River were provided with some kind of accommodation, but those employed in the construction of the brickworks and the power-house had to provide their own house accommodation, and some of the houses they erected did not cost more than &#163;10. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know of any municipal authority that would permit the erection of such houses as were provided for working men at Canberra. One would think that this was done purposely in order to discredit the Capital site.I do not suggest that that was the reason for the course adopted, but that one would be justified in coming to that conclusion. All previous &#39; Governments have failed in this regard, and it is up to the present Government to see that proper house accommodation is provided for workers employed at Canberra, and especially if it is intended to go on with the erection of the arsenal. </para>

                        <para>. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in moving the second reading of the Bill, said there might be a discussion on the question of policy as to whether money for public works should be provided out of revenue or out of loan. I think that the honorable senator missed the main question, which is whether any money should be provided for new and unproductive works during the war. It seems to me that we do nob realize fully enough that at present we are in a state of war, and may require every single penny that we can borrow or obtain from revenue in order to conduct the war. When Federation was established, we were invited to believe that, by the amalgamation of a number of State Departments, we should be able to save a lot of money, but there has been nothing but squandering and extravagance in expenditure since the Federal Parliament came into existence. We are now engaged in a perfect debauch of expenditure. It is from this point of view that I direct special attention to this measure. We are asked to agree under this Bill to the expenditure of over &#163;1,250,000. I suppose that most of the money has already been spent, bub I trust that we shall be afforded a proper opportunity to go thoroughly into these matters when the Estimates are before us. Why in the name of heaven should we be asked to spend &#163;98,571 on quarantine stations? Why should we have elaborate quarantine stations established in time of war ? I have never had the misfortune to be quarantined myself, but some of my friends who have had the experience have told me that they spent a most enjoyable time in quarantine down at the Heads here. </para>

I am not complaining of the working men wanting a better place to live in, but I strongly object to the building of enormous palaces at Canberra and at quarantine stations, particularly in time of war, when we have to go cap in hand to the British Government to borrow money. </para>

There are a lot of hovels about Melbourne that want sweeping away; they are a disgrace to the place. I will back the honorable senator up in every way in that matter, but it is perfectly ridiculous to build a palace at a quarantine station that is used only once in five or six years, and generally located in very healthy surroundings, forming a sort of seaside resort. </para>

                    <para>Another proposal is to spend &#163;86,000 odd on new post-office buildings. We have many magnificent post-offices already. We have done for many a year with the splendid building in Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, but another one has been erected at the corner of Bourke and Spencer streets at a cost of &#163;211,000. I congratulated the  Deputy  Postmaster-General the other day on actually dwelling &#34;in marble halls,&#34; whereas the poor working man, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> says, has to live in a &#163;10 house. Of course, the postal officials had to walk upstairs in the Elizabeth-street building, but I dare say it did them good, as it gave them a little exercise. </para>

                            <para>- I am simply using it as an illustration of the debauch of expenditure. If the honorable senator will come with me, I will show him the beautiful marble portico there. It is a place fit for the Doge of Venice to live in. The&#39; Senate ought to consider, as a matter of policy, whether the money provided in this Bill ought to be spent at all. I understood that in time of war the only new expenditure should be on reproductive works. New post-offices cannot be called reproductive, especially where we have something already that we can get along with for a time. To build new post-offices and underground telephone wires in these times is simply extravagance run mad. </para>

                        <para>. - I call attention to the item of &#163;25,000 for wireless telegraphy. I could have wished that some small sum up to &#163;500 had been added for the erection of a residence for the radio operator at King Island, if it is absolutely necessary to spend the whole of the &#163;25,000 on radio works in course of erection or in contemplation. King Island is cut off from Victoria or Tasmania except for a small steamer service once a week or so, which &#39; in rough weather often becomes once in three weeks. Unless some provision is made for the erection of a residence for the officer there, I understand that the fiat has gone forth from the gentleman in charge of wireless telegraphy at the Navy Department that the station will be closed down. I yesterday asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy whether it was intended to close the station unless the residents of King Island provided the operator with a residence at their own cost. I charge the officer of the Department who supplied the answer read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator &#34;Pearce</inline> yesterday with absolutely side-tracking the question, because the information at his disposal was certainly not given. </para>

                            <para>- I want to suggest that the &#163;25,000 voted in this Bill is not sufficient, because it is no use erecting a radio station if the man who has to work it has no residence. The residents of King Island cannot have wireless communication with other parts of Australia - and this might be necessary some day for defence purposes - unless the officer has a roof over his head. Perhaps those in charge believe in the sleeping-out treatment to such an extent that they want the operator to camp on the beach. The following extracts from a letter from him show what he has had to put up with: - </para>

He threatened to close down the station if the residents would not find me a house - again, result - offered one 9 miles from station, and another one in the town that was formerly a stable; and the carpenter told me that before he put down the floor he wheeled out 3 tons of horse manure; no windows in the dam place, and no stove for cooking.

                            <para>- I do not know. But if the Navy Department considers the station of sufficient importance to keep open, it should provide the necessary accommodation for the official, or say straight-out to the residents, &#34; We will have to close your station.&#34; All that has eventuated up to the present is the half-and-half sort of threat that I have described. The residents offered a house 9 miles distant, or, as an alternative, a house which had been a stable, and which, according to the letter, had no windows in the adjective place, at a rental of 15s. per week. The station accommodation is a disgrace to the Department, and the official incidentally mentions in his letter that all his furniture is still on the wharf being smashed to pieces. It seems to me that this is a queer way of conducting a business. It is necessary to provide communication for taxpayers who, by their geographical position, are absolutely cut off from the mainland or from Tasmania, except by means of a small steamer about once a week. Sometimes in rough weather they are shut off from the outside: world for two or three weeks. After many representations made in this Chamber and in another place, the authorities consented to give the people of King Island wireless communication. It was obvious, of course, that it would cost too much to lay an ordinary cable. The wireless station was first established, I believe, by a local resident, and subsequently it was taken over by the Commonwealth&#39; authorities. It is now under the control of the Department of the Navy, and the Government would not be extending generosity too far if they erected a small residence at a cost of &#163;200 or &#163;300. </para>

                            <para>- I mentioned that sum, it is true, and I think that, providing the timber could be obtained on the island, suitable accommodation could be secured for about &#163;500, and, perhaps, the Department of the Navy would be justified in limiting it to that amount. At all&#39; events, if this expenditure were authorized, the residents of King Island would then not have just cause for grievance as at present. The position is intolerable, because the man who is getting only &#163;4 10s. a week is compelled to pay &#163;5 5s. per week for accommodation for his wife and family at the only suitable place available. Small as this matter might appear from a national stand-point, it is urgent and important to the few hundred people living on King Island, and I hope it will receive attention. </para>

He thought, however, that he had only to put his case before the authorities to insure further provision, but I understand the inspector has reported against making any additions to the building, The man is compelled, therefore, to suffer inconveniences which ought not to be allowed in a civilized community, and if there are any more such cases - and I suppose there are throughout Australia - there would be justification for spending not only the sum mentioned in the Works Bill, but a considerably larger amount, in order to overcome difficulties of this character. Of course, I can hardly expect that the Minister will be able to give details of expenditure such as this, but I hope he will take a note of the matter and see that proper provision is made for postal officials. </para>

                        <para>. - In reply to the complaint made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> concerning the accommodation for the radio operator at King Island station, I may inform the Senate that the wireless station referred to has a rather interesting history. Some time ago Tasmanian senators made repeated representations, on behalf of the residents of King Island, that the wireless station which was then being worked, not by the Government, but by private persons for experimental purposes, should be taken over and operated on behalf of the people of King Island. At that time the Postal Department controlled radiography, and upon inquiries being made it was found there was no justification whatever for the course suggested, because the estimate of revenue was so insignificant that there would be a substantial loss on its working. </para>

                            <para>- I could not say that, but the King Island radio, as a Government station, was asked for by the local residents, while all other radio stations have been established by the Department without any requests from local residents. Therefore, the King Island station stands by itself. One would naturally assume that when the position was put to the local residents they would realize that as the Postal Department could not be run at a loss, they would be expected to make the best arrangements possible in order to secure the convenience. They continued their agitation through members of Parliament, and at last the Government yielded to pressure, and agreed to appoint an operator. Now, what was the attitude of the local residents ? When the man was sent over to take control of the station, he found that the charge for his accommodation would be &#163;5 5s. per week, or, as an alternative, that he would be expected to occupy a house which has been described in such scathing terms by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe.</inline> These patriotic residents of King Island were anxious for the Government to come to their assistance, but when the Government did appoint an operator they provided for him a residence which has been described as unfit for a human being to live in, and for which they charged a rental of 15s. per week. I think, therefore, that honorable senators, instead of launching their invectives against -the Government in regard to this matter, should direct some of their indignation against the residents of King Island. </para>

                            <para>- My information is that this station stands by itself. There is not a station in Australia upon which there is such a dead loss. If the residents of any rural area desire the establishment of a telephone service they have to guarantee the Department against any possible loss on its working. The least that the residents of King Island can do is to co-operate with the Government by providing the wireless operator there with a suitable residence. The Government cannot undertake to erect a residence for him, because such a work would cost not less than &#163;500 or &#163;600, and would thus add considerably to the already large loss which is being sustained upon this station. </para>

                        <para>. - If no other honorable senator desires to speak, I would like to say a few words in reply to the criticism which has been levelled against the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Grant</inline> asked for a declaration of the attitude of the Government in regard to works at Canberra. He wished to know whether the Government proposed to abandon works there. They do not propose anything of the kind. But they do feel that at a time like the present it is incumbent on them to suspend operations which are not immediately urgent, and from which no advantage can be obtained within a reasonably early period. It is not, therefore, intended to spend money on new works in the Federal Territory during the present financial year. The amount provided is to enable the Department merely to preserve the works already constructed, and to meet liabilities- from the previous financial year in respect  of orders placed, but for which accounts had. not been paid prior to the 30th June last. That makes the position fairly clear, and in conformity with that policy the amount to be expended on public works during the current financial year has been reduced to the smallest possible dimensions, namely, &#163;1,100,000. In regard, to the arsenal, &#39; I would point out that that work is not covered by this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> will have an opportunity of discussing that matter when later proposals are submitted. </para>

                    <para>

                        raised&#39; the question of whether we should spend any money at all oh public works at the present time, and urged that our efforts in this direction should be reduced as far as possible. As a mere declaration everybody will subscribe to that formula;, but it is a little difficult to go with the honorable senator if he means that we should immediately come down as with  a guillotine and stop all &#39;works. There are some works, war or no war, which, unless we are absolutely bankrupt, it will be advantageous to carry through. The Government have not attempted to shut down upon all &#39; works ; but, as far as possible,  they  have endeavoured to dispense with or postpone undertakings of less urgency than those which are covered by this Bill. The honorable senator picked out two instances to support his contention, but I do not think that he &#39;could have been more unfortunate in his selection. He mentioned the works at quarantine stations, and said that surely we could dispense, with them in time of war. I am not aware that infectious diseases pick the time of their appearance to meet our convenience. There is a prospect of these stations being required just as much in time of war as in time of peace.

                    <para>Anothermatter which was referred to by SenatorFairbairn was the General Post Office, Melbourne. This occupies a similar position to that occupied by the works at the quarantine grounds. He spoke of the &#34; marble halls &#34; in the new building, but I would point out that the marble halls are already there. The amounts provided in this Bill are for the completion of works in hand, and for carrying out certain alterations to the old building in Bourke-street - alterations which have been rendered necessary because of the transfer of the main operations of the Post Office to the new building in Spencer-street. The intention is to alter the Bourke-street building in such a way that it will house some, at present, very scattered activities of the Post Office. It is thought that by this means the public convenience will be consulted, and that considerable economies will be effected. </para>

                            <para>asked me a very pertinent question as to the estimated and actual expenditure upon public works last year. I have already said that the amount thus expended was &#163;4,300,000, and that the estimated expenditure was &#163;5,500,000. This year the estimates total &#163;4,000,000. It will thus be seen that there is a very great difference between the amount voted last year and the amount sought to be expended this year. Of the vote last year 22 per cent. was not expended. Although I cannot say that a similar unexpended balance will not remain at the end of the present financial year, it is manifest that if the same ratio be maintained, the expenditure this year will be only a little in excess of &#163;3,000,000. I do not wish honorable senators to misunderstand me. I am not suggesting that that saving will be effected, but it does seem reasonable to suppose that when Parliament is asked to authorize the expenditure of a smaller amount - as it is this year - a larger proportion of it will be spent. But presumably it will not be possible to expend the whole amount during the current financial year. I do not know that any other points have been raised by honorable senators which have escaped my attention, but if so, and I am reminded of them in Committee, I shall endeavour to supply further information. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to direct attention to the fact that there has already been expended on the east-west line more than &#163;6,000,000, and that because of ineptitude, disregard for the public convenience, and inability on the part of the Minister of Works and Railways to settle a trivial dispute, on the eastern section of that line, work there has been suspended. We are informed that the estimated loss on the railway, at least for a number of years after it is brought into operation, will exceed &#163;200,000 per annum. </para>

It is a most extraordinary thing that the Commonwealth is unable to so arrange matters that a trivial dispute must be allowed to exist day after day and week after week. Apparently, the men engaged on the western section of the line are to continue at work until such time as they will complete the gap of 50 miles between the two sections. </para>

The item of &#163;11,087 in the abstract under the head of &#34; Under control of Department of Works and Railways,&#34; is put there for the convenience of honorable senators. It is an abstract of the three items which appear on page 16 under the head of &#34; Port Augusta-Oodnadatta railway.&#34; It does not involve a single penny for the east-west railway. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to direct public attention to what the Government have done during the past few months in order to prevent the employment of labour. I find that Parliament voted for Works and Railways, &#163;5,621; Home and Territories, &#163;11,000; Quarantine, &#163;12,781 ; Lighthouses, &#163;1,000 ; Trade and Customs, &#163;388; Defence, &#163;116,798; Post Office buildings, &#163;35,526 ; Commonwealth Railways, &#163;5,992; Northern Territory, &#163;17,893; and Papua, &#163;285; making a total of &#163;207,284. What is the use of the Senate placing sums at the disposal of the Government unless they are able to organize a staff which can judiciously expend the money? </para>

                            <para>- I am growling because the Government, for reasons best known to themselves, have refused to employ labour and expend money placed at their disposal. The permanent officers must be going slow, either on their own volition or at the direction of the Government, when they refuse to advise the responsible Minister as to how the money ought to be expended. I hope that when the Government next appeal for money they will not show&#39; such a substantial amount unexpended at the end of the term for which it was voted. This is an effort to refuse indirectly to employ the workers of this country. I guarantee that the salary of the Minister and of every permanent officer will go on without the slightest interruption. The bulk of this sum of &#163;207,284 ought to have been expended in casual labour, but for reasons best known to themselves the Government did not so expend it. </para>

                        <para>.- This Bill provides for the expenditure of &#163;1,250,000 on public works out of revenue. I understand that later we snail have a Bill for the expenditure of &#163;2,750,000 out of loan funds on works practically similar to those which we are asked to approve of to-day. I was glad to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> say that &#39;the total amount placed on the Estimates last year for similar services was &#163;5,550,000, and that of that sum only &#163;4,300,000 was expended, showing a financial saving of &#163;1,200,000, which I should describe as very necessary economy in war time, the money being required for more urgent purposes. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately, one is unable to debate in great detail Estimates of this sort.- The proposal before the Committee is that we should pass the sum of &#163;486,679 in respect to works and railways items which cover over seventeen pages of the Bill. I wish to draw attention to two or three items which, in war time, could very well be done without. Some mention has been made of the accommodation for Commonwealth officers at Geraldton, in &#34;Western Australia. Although the sum of &#163;3,000 appears on the Estimates for the work, I understand that the ultimate cost will be &#163;16,000. In roughly scanning over the items which make up this sum of &#163;486,679, I find that approximately half of the amount will be devoted to the erection of new buildings. I invite the attention of the Committee to some of these buildings. I quite agree with much of the criticism passed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> on the item for quarantine, but I cannot understand the reason why, at this urgent juncture, when they are paying 5&#163; per cent, for money in London and issuing bonds at a discount of lj per cent., the Government are proposing to spend &#163;9,000 odd on an animal quarantine station. Surely the provision we have for the quarantining of animals would do to go on with. Such expenditure, to my mind, does not show a due regard for the financial position of the Commonwealth. Under the head of &#34; New South Wales naval expenditure,&#34; there is an item of &#163;2,800 for alterations to stores and paving yard at Darling Island, an item of &#163;5,000 for a new drill hall and offices at Rushcutter&#39;s Bay, &#163;400 for alteration to Naval Staff Office at Newcastle, and similar items throughout the schedule. I direct attention to the buildings at&#39; Garden Island. When the Commonwealth inaugurated our own Naval service, I understand that we took over the very large and commodious buildings which the British Admiralty had built on the island. Surely the storage and office accommodation which was good enough for the British Australian Cruiser Squadron was good enough, and sufficiently complete, for our own Naval Unit. The expenditure upon the Naval Bases will probably come up for discussion later on. There is an item down for the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. I believe that the information available to the Government is that the rifles made at this establishment cost, approximately, &#163;7 each, whereas the estimate of their cost when the erection of the establishment was proposed was about &#163;3&#39; 10s. each. The Government may also have information as to whether the rifles turned out at the Lithgow Factory have been found to be efficient. We are asked to pass these items in a happy-go-lucky way to carry on until next year, without knowing whether the Commonwealth is getting value for the money expended. I should like to remind the Committee of what is going on in England in connexion with buildings required during war-time. At the back of the Prime Minister&#39;s residence, No. 10 Downing-street, they are putting up wooden huts for the temporary accommodation of officials who will be required only during war-time. </para>

                            <para>- While I do not object to the item of &#163;11,000 for works at Canberra during war-time, I agree with much that has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> concerning expenditure there. I think that we must, &#39;at an early date, consider whether we should continue the erection of new Federal buildings here, when that will make it more difficult for us in future to remove the Seat of Government from Melbourne. I was glad to be informed by the Vice-President of the Executive Council that &#163;1,200,000 was saved from the votes passed by this Parliament last year. As we shall be called upon to give our approval to votes totalling &#163;4,000,000 for the ensuing year, I trust that the Government will make an effort to save even a larger sum this year than they were able to save last year, so that they may prove themselves a truly National Government. After all, the biggest question we have to face is the question of finance. I should like to ask whether the estimates of works controlled by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department are those submitted by the officers of that Department? </para>

                        <para>.- I should like an explanation from the Minister for Defence regarding an item of &#163;6,500 to be paid to the credit of Trust Funds - Small Arms Ammunition Account. The Minister might give some information, also, about the vote of &#163;10,000 for the Woollen Cloth Factory. Perhaps he can inform the Committee as to the amount of military cloth being manufactured, and whether it is up to our requirements. If so, we should be told what this vote of &#163;10,000 is for. We might have a statement from the Minister, also, with regard to the Cordite Factory. Then there is an item of &#163;8,000 for the Small Arms Factory. I should like to know what is going on in connexion with this most expensive establishment. We might be told what class of man is engaged there. The vote of &#163;8,000 is set down for additions&#39; to the plant, and we are thus again invited to pile up the capital charge when it is questionable whether this establishment is worth the money which it has cost the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.- With respect to the first item referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> I may say that we have Trust Funds established in connexion with our factories. Those who draw upon our small arms ammunition have to pay for it, and various sums have to be paid into Trust Funds from the Treasury to make up deficiencies in the accounts which occur from time to time. This is explained, for instance, by the fact that the cost for ammunition charged to the various rifle clubs is not the cost to the Government, and the Treasurer must pay into the Trust Fund the difference between the cost to the Government and the cost at which ammunition is sold to the rifle clubs. As regards the Woollen Cloth Factory, I do not think the honorable senator could have expected that, without notice, I should be able to say how many thousand yards of cloth the factory has produced. It has produced a very large quantity of cloth, which, in the opinion of experts in the trade, is the best cloth yet turned out in Australia. The factory is producing sufficient to meet the requirements of the Defence Department, and part of the requirements of the Post and Telegraph Department. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The cloth is also being produced . at the factory at a rate equal to the rate of production outside. The vote appearing on these Estimates for the Woollen Cloth Factory is necessary to cover the cost of additional plant ordered some time ago, and which is shortly to be installed. The Cordite Factory has been very largely extended since the war began, and it has played a very important part in the supply of ammunition during the war. Although, perhaps, it may not be a fair&#39; comparison to make, I may say that, notwithstanding the fact that wages here are very much higher than they are in the United Kingdom, we are making cordite to-day more cheaply than it is made in England. I am in the happy position of being able to tell the Committee that the manufacture of big gun cordite has recently been undertaken at the factory. The vote appearing on these estimates for the factory is &#39;required to pay for the purchase and installation of the plant obtained for the manufacture of big gun ammunition. Only this week the big gun cordite made in Australia was tested with big guns, and proved to be equal to the best big gun cordite imported. In connexion with these items the Commonwealth is certainly getting value for its money, and we have the further satisfaction of knowing that to-day we are in a position to manufacture cordite for big guns, whereas previously it was necessary to import all that was required. With respect to the Small Arms Factory it has to be borne in mind that it is of a very complex character. No one can say that in the past its operation has been altogether satisfactory, but its output has been increasing, whilst the cost per rifle has been decreasing. I do not say that the output is yet satisfactory. As a matter of fact it is not, and I have said so to those employed at the factory. I have been negotiating with them to endeavour to secure a better output. </para>

                            <para>- The cost is very much higher than that for which rifles could be purchased for some time before the war, but honorable senators have to bear in mind that during the first two and a half years of the war we could not get rifles anywhere at any price. When the war began it was not a question of the cost of rifles, because if we did not make them ourselves we could not get them at all. I may say, for the information of honorable senators who have sometimes been critical of delay in connexion with the manufacture of rifles at the Small Arms Factory, that although the British Government placed large orders for rifles with American firms at the commencement of the war, not a single rifle was delivered in fulfilment of those orders until eighteen months after the declaration of the war, although these firms had the rifles and all that was necessary was that they should be altered from one class of rifle to another.. This goes to show that the manufacture of rifles is not the simple .matter that the man in the street sometimes believes it to be. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator may assume what he likes as to the cause. I am telling him &#39;the facts. I am only assuming the cause to be exactly the same trouble that we struck here - the complexity of manufacture, the number of different operations that have to be gone through, and the number of different parts of which a rifle is made up. I do not profess to be satisfied with the way in which our rifle factory has produced in the past. I am endeavouring to get a better system and a better output, and am glad to say that the output shows an improvement every week with some slight lessening of the cost. I hope that will continue, and that we shall get a rifle at a more reasonable cost. The efficiency of the rifle has been very satisfactory indeed.- We have reports in the Department, not only from our own, but from British, experts, on the rifle used in Egypt and Gallipoli. These reports are absolutely satisfactory. There were some reports that were not so satisfactory about rifles that were not sent overseas, but were used in Australia. The explanation is this - there was a first test at the factory, and then before the rifle was sent oversea there was another test made, and all those about which there was any doubt at all were eliminated. The rifles used in Australia had not passed the second test, whereas those used overseas passed both. Some of the former developed faults which were afterwards traced to their cause in the factory. That cause has long since been eliminated, and the rifle to-day is eminently satisfactory. </para>

None of the influences he refers to are at work in my union. There are influences which I am not going to mention, but they are neither American nor German. To brand me as an Industrial Worker of the World conspirator from America is unfair, and it is time the members and supporters of the present Government gave up travelling from platform to platform crying about the disloyalty of the men in the unions. It would suit them better if they made some attempt to settle this industrial dispute. I guarantee that&#39; if they sent

                        and myself to Sydney with full instructions, we would settle the affair in ten minutes. Fully 40 per cent. of the men foremost in this strike supported the Government at the last election. The men out on strike to-day are not disloyal. They are striking against the pernicious, damnable, sweating system that is being introduced into the industrial life of this country. The Government cannot deny that &#39;this is so. The papers do not pub-&#39; list the facts. We do not hear a word about the appointment of eighty &#34; sweat &#34; bosses. Some of the men out on strike today were never in a union; in fact, they repudiated unionism and Labour politics altogether, yet to-day they are out against this system. Any Minister before he accuses me as a member of one of the unions of conduct such as is charged against us by

I resent the assertion that this trouble has been fomented by paid agitators, and that it is in the nature of a revolt against the Government. I maintain that just the opposite is the case.- The trouble - which is purely industrial and nonpolitical - has been brought about by the introduction of the obnoxious American Taylor system into the industrial life of Australia. I am going to show that it had been premeditated by a section of the employers.

                        <para>It had been resolved in the early part of the war, that every effort &#39; should be made by employers of labour engaged in manufactures to keep the wheels of industry moving, and they had a right to expect that the workmen would loyally assist in that direction. Nevertheless, a certain class of agitator had deliberately taken advantage of the Commonwealth being at war to stir up strife, with the result that there had been continuous trouble, many strikes, and the labour market had been practically in a state of chaos. Some of the strikes that had taken place in connexion with the Government and private establishments engaged in the manufacture of articles required for war purposes were a standing disgrace, to those who had formulated them. Manufacturers had been so harassed by the constant demands for altered conditions of employment and increased pay that a number have gone out of business, and very many had put money into the war loans that would otherwise have been used for increasing plants and improving methods of manufacturing. </para>
                        <para>It was frequently said that the only possible chance the people in the Commonwealth had got of preventing terrible trouble coming after the war was in the development of primary and secondary industries. The problems of how this was going to be successfully carried out were difficult to solve, but not insurmountable. Cutting of prices by manufacturers, for various reasons, and paid agitators, had caused trouble. </para>

                        <para>It was not an industrial dispute, but a protest on the part of the Sydney and suburban retail produce merchants against the decision of the Sussex-street merchants to increase the price of Tasmanian potatoes by 15s. per ton on the rates ruling at the beginning of last week. Not a single bag of potatoes changed hands, and retailers pointed out that they will not buy at the price of &#163;6 15s. per ton, the rate demanded for best redskins. They declared the price to be exorbitant, as there was no shortage in Sydney; in fact, there was a surplus. To-day&#39;s arrivals totalled 10,200 bags, while the carry-over from last week was nearly 12,000. The wholesale merchants regard the situation as serious, and some are inclined to think that it will be necessary to meet the retailers&#39; demands. </para>

For weeks, and indeed for months, a pistol was held at the heads of these men. They were told either to take the sweating system or leave it. I do not believe in strikes, but I am not going to stand here and allow any Minister of the Crown to speak about paid agitators fomenting strife when, as I say, all trouble could have been settled amicably by a conference. Forty per cent. of the men in my union, the men who are now on strike, are behind the National Government, and they were behind them on the Referendum. Those men, however, are now out on strike to-day against this obnoxious Taylor sweating system. No private employer would have tolerated trouble over this matter for a week. The men who should be blamed are the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales. This system against which the men protest has been described by the employers as - </para>

                    <para class="block">What is that but a sweating system? The men in the New South Wales Railways have always given the price of their jobs, and they are willing to do it to-day, but Government speed-bosses have been appointed - eighty-five of them, at &#163;250 a year each - and provided with stopwatches to check the men. That is what this system is, and I say it is a crying shame that the Commonwealth Government should stand by and allow this dislocation of industry to take place, when all the trouble could be settled by negotiating with the New South Wales Government, as they would have done with any private employers had they been responsible for the strife. I resent the statement that unionists are responsible. I have been connected with unions in an official capacity for forty-two years. Whenever possible, I go to their meetings now, and I declare they are not agitators or Industrial Workers of the World men. Many of them have been in the Government establishments for twenty, thirty, or forty years. Do honorable senators think they would give up their work, and some of them within two years of their superannuation, without reasonable cause? This is not a revolt against the Government, but a protest against an obnoxious system, and the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales must be held responsible for this industrial upheaval. </para>

No doubt, the Vice-President of the Executive Council does a good deal of mental work. The reason why persons prefer Government to private employment is because the work is more continuous and the pay more certain. Men in . the service of the New South Wales Railways Commissioners, who have been there for a great many years - some of them for twenty years and longer - who have never been known to take a very active part in industrial matters, are not likely to leave their employment without very grave reason. I can scarcely recollect a strike of any magnitude on the New South Wales railways. It should be quite obvious to any impartial observer that a man who has spent a lifetime in the railway service of that State, and who would find it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to obtain employment elsewhere, would seriously consider his position before he took the extreme step of going upon strike. </para>

                            <para>- None whatever. That class of individual is to be found only on the employers&#39; side. The man who thinks that he can easily lead a body of unionists in Australia should take on the job. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> knows that the task is a very difficult one. Every member of a union has one vote, and men do not go upon strike until they have given the matter the very gravest consideration. The New South Wales railway employees did not take this extreme step without first giving it the most careful forethought. To-day, the cost of living is exceedingly high. Within the past few years it has risen approximately 30 per cent. But the men&#39;s wages have not been increased 30 per cent, during that period. Would the New South Wales railway employees throw up their jobs without very serious reasons? </para>

                            <para>- The men employed by the New South &#34;Wales Railways Commissioners were promised that during the currency of the war their industrial conditions would remain unaltered. Yet, despite that promise, the Chief Railways Commissioner sought to introduce into the railway workshops at Randwick a system of costing to which the men were absolutely opposed. The press of this country, with very few exceptions, has consistently and persistently put before the public the Commissioner&#39;s side of the case, and has refused to put the employees&#39; side. One would imagine that the men were opposed to any card system - that they were against it being known how much any particular work was costing. But such is not the &#34;case. As a matter of fact, in all private engineering establishments in New South Wales, at Cockatoo Island, and even in the Randwick workshops themselves, a card system is in operation. But it is not the system which the Chief Railways Commissioner desired to see observed in those workshops. No matter how frequently the press may declare the contrary to be the case, what he desired to introduce was a system of timekeeping which would have the effect of speeding up and dehumanizing the employees in those workshops. In these circumstances the men did the right thing in going out on strike. </para>

                            <para>- Before they went out on strike. Of course, there may be some men who are anxious to go upon strike, but I do not know them. Then the members of other organizations, acting in sympathy with the strikers, also ceased work. That is all right. When Germany began to walk over Belgium, was it not right for the other nations to come to her aid? The Chief Railways Commissioner of New South Wales endeavoured to foist the obnoxious Taylor card system upon the men, and they were quite right in refusing to accept it. Had they accepted it, it would have been merely a matter of time when the system would have been put in operation in other establishments. </para>

It is a system which, if put fully into operation, would reduce men to the position of mere machines. This is how it would work. If, at Eveleigh, it required, say, three hours to do a certain piece of work, five or six men would be put on to that piece of work, perhaps not simultaneously - that would be too glaring - but at different times. </para>

                            <para>- I do not mind relating my experience of this work, to see what the honorable senator thinks of it. At the Central Railway Station, Sydney, where I was employed for some time, every stone on the building was numbered. The first course was numbered &#34;No. 1 course&#34;; the second course was numbered &#34; No. 2 course &#34; ; the third course was numbered &#34; No. 3 course,&#34; and so on up to the top of the building. If a man got the cornerstone that would be numbered 1 over 1; the second stone would be numbered 1 over 2 ; the third stone would be numbered 1 over 3, and so on; so that the man in charge of the building knew, not only who worked a particular stone, but the exact time he took. Let me now explain how it worked out. One man might commence a certain piece of work at 8 o&#39;clock in the morning, and finish it off in twenty-four hours, that is in three days. Another man might commence a similar piece of work a week afterwards, and take twenty-five hours to do it. Another man might take twenty-seven hours, and, perhaps, one man would take twenty -eight hours. Twenty-eight hours might be regarded as rather too long, but no visible objection would be raised to the man who took that time. There are hundreds of stones of exactly the same texture requiring the same amount of work. Another man came round, asked for employment, and got it. The foreman found that the last man who had come on the job could perform the work in twenty-seven hours. Consequently, the man who took twenty-eight hours was noted. He might get a further trial on other work, or he might not. The man who took the longest time on a piece of work was passed out without a comment. That is a card system which, I think, is fairly objectionable. </para>

                            <para>- No. The Taylor card system is even worse than that one. The honorable senator, who has had no practical experience in the way of manual work of this character, will admit that even that card system is a fairly objectionable one, and one which, in my opinion, ought not to be tolerated. </para>

                            <para>- These men went on strike, and were characterized by some very hard names by Labour men, who, since that time, have left the Labour party, and are now sitting on the opposite side. There is a very easy and very effective way of circumventing a card system of that sort, but I shall not go into that part of the business. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rowell</inline> himself can think that out. The Taylor card system would mean that, in the workshops at Eveleigh, Randwick, Newcastle, and Bathurst, men would be put on to do exactly the same kind of work, not on the same day, and not, perhaps, in the same week. Their time would be carefully noted. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It must be remembered that, under the Taylor system which Chief Commissioner Eraser desires to foist upon the workers at Randwick, the men themselves would not keep the time. They would not initial their own cards. They would know nothing about the matter from personal knowledge. The work would be done at each of these four establishments, and the average time taken at each establishment would be recorded. The work might take from three to four hours at Eveleigh. The average time for the work would be, say, three and a half hours at Eveleigh, and then that would be regarded as the maximum time in which the work ought to be done, and it would be put down at that point: Of course, the man who did not) come up to the three and a half hours&#39; limit would stand a very good show of being passed  -out.. Then the average time would be taken at Bathurst, at Newcastle, and at Randwick, with the result that when the figures were all added together the average time for the whole of the establishment might be reduced to three and a quarter hours. That would then be regarded as the maximum time to be allowed or performing that piece of work, and it would go on until only the most expert men could possibly reach up to the maximum amount of output. What would become of a man who was prepared and willing to do a fair average amount of work? Apparently he would be passed out at the earliest possible opportunity. There is no justification for that kind of thing. I am not one of those who would stand up and support any man who simply desired to hang on to his job, Every man should be prepared to do - and I think a great majority of men. are willing and capable of doing - a fair day&#39;s work, but I do not consider that any man should be compelled to do more than he is physically capable of doing. I believe that that is what the Taylor card system - the system which the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales desire to introduce - really is. </para>

                            <para>- I have worked under a card system which was sufficiently stringent for me, and for everybody else who operated under it; but I do nob believe that it is to be compared, perhaps from the lack of opportunity, to what is known as the Taylor card system. If the honorable senator read an account of what that system really is, I do not think that he would for a moment support it. </para>

                        <para>The first experiment be mentions took place in the Bethlehem steel works. A gang  of  seventy-five men were employed loading pig-iron into trucks. Each pig weighed 92 lbs., and an average days work per man was loading 12&#189; tons for 1 dollar 15 cents. Taylor made the handling of pig-iron a mathematical study, and  as a  result of his calculations arrived at the conclusion that loading 47&#189; tons was a fair day&#39;s work for  a  man. Out of the gang  of  seventy-five men one was specially selected  to  test Taylor&#39;s conclusions. </para>
                        <para>He  was  subjected to a psychological process, being impressed with the idea that he was. a high-priced man, and as. such he could earn 1 dollar 85 cents if he would  do  exactly as  he  was told. The man, a Dutchman, agreed, and under the system handled 47&#189; tons per day. </para>
                        <para>Another seven were again specially selected, hut were physically unable to do the task set. </para>
                        <para>On page 59, Taylor writes : &#34; Now one of the very first requirements for  a  man who is fit to handle pig-iron as  a  regular occupation is that he shall be so stupid and so phlegmatic that he more resembles in his mental make-up the ox than any other type.&#34; </para>
