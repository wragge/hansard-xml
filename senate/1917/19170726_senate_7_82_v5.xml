                <para class="block">The reason I am asking honorable senators to reverse a decision with which I concurred yesterday is that further consideration of the proposed new section 7f demonstrates that the insertion of this word would really rob it of all its value. Honorable senators will recognise &#39; that the period indicated in this provision, namely, &#34; since the beginning of the present war,&#34; was a period prior to the passing of the principal Act. Now only on the passing of that Act did an association become an unlawful one. It is quite possible, therefore, that any individual proceeded against under this measure may have been a member of an organization a considerable time prior to the passing of the principal Act, and prior to that association being proclaimed an unlawful one. Under the proposed new section, as amended by the Senate, there would thus be a loophole under which an offender, might possibly escape. In these circumstances, I ask honorable senators not to press the amendment, because under the provision as it stands in the Bill, no injury can possibly result to any man who is innocent of an offence. By deleting the word &#34; unlawful,&#34; I would urge the Committee to restore the proposed new sub-section to its original form. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Committee will not yield to the advice of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. If honorable senators will refer to the previous clauses of the Bill they will find that from beginning to end of it, in almost every sub-clause, the word &#34; unlawful &#34; appears. Upon observing yesterday that this word had been omitted from proposed new section 7f, I suggested to the Vice-President of the Executive Council the wisdom of inserting it there as the governing word in that provision, just as it is the governing word in other provisions of the Bill. The honorable sena.tor accepted my suggestion, and the Committee indorsed his action. To-day he has advanced no reason why we should reverse our decision. </para>

                <para>I contend that that proviso adequately protects every lawful organization in Australia. If the Committee does not insist upon pressing its amendment, it will be quite open to the Government) and to the Governor-General to institute prosecutions not merely against any association or any organization, but against any individual. So far as the individual is concerned, State laws exist which can deal with these matters, but here is a Bill dealing with associations, and setting out to describe a certain body as an unlawful association. Some time ago  wet  passed an Act declaring it to be an unlawful association. I want to insure the continuity  of  the word &#34; unlawful,&#34; because I am very much afraid that otherwise genuine organizations registered under the Commonwealth Arbitration . Acts would be affected. </para>

                    <para>.- The attitude of the Government, after the way in which the amendment was carried yesterday, is surprising. I suppose the Caucus met this morning, and honorable senators opposite are to be compelled to go back on their unanimous opinion of yesterday. I tak.&#34; it that the idea is to make this provision retrospective, so as to bring within the scope of the Bill any person who belonged to the Industrial Workers of the World or the &#34;O.B.U.&#34;- One Big Union- before the original Unlawful Associations Act was passed, up to which time those bodies were perfectly lawful. Many men in New South Wales who belonged to the Industrial Workers of the World previous to the outrages in Sydney were perfectly <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> in their opinions, which are still held to-day by them and many others. Those opinions are expressed by the phrase &#34; One Big Union.&#34; Numbers of them are among the best citizens of this country. Some of them have five or six boys fighting to-day at the Front, and, although they were <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> members of the Industrial Workers of the  World prior to those outrages, they immediately left it when they found out what sort of an association it was. I take it that under this provision those men, should they do anything at all, can be penalized because of their membership of the Industrial Workers of the World prior to the passing of the original Act. </para>

                        <para>- I accept the Minister&#39;s assurance, but I do not believe it myself. I am convinced that the object of the provision is to make the punishment retrospective. Opinions have been given here many times by legal gentlemen that were shown afterwards to be absolutely wrong, and I have often remarked that if all learned men agreed there would be no use for our Law Courts. I do not think the proposed new section should be retrospective. The word &#34;unlawful&#34; should be retained in order to protect men such as I have described. The Industrial Workers of the World itself is a mere nothing. It becomes a menace only when its members resort to the dastardly outrages that they have been guilty of, and with which nobody on this side has any sympathy. If a man gave up associating with those people immediately he became aware of their objects, no law should be passed that would apply the punishment retrospectively to him. </para>

                    <para>. I regret that while I was absent for a few moments yesterday, this matter came up. It was not until I was listening to the debate in another place last night) that I knew &#39;this amendment had been accepted here. I thought then, and still think, that it was accepted inadvertently by the member of the Government in charge of the measure in this place. It seemed to me from the beginning that this section was badly placed. All the other proposed new sections, from 7a to 7h, deal with a variety of matters in connexion with existing unlawful associations, but 7f deals entirely with a distinct matter - a matter of procedure in our Courts, a matter of proof, a matter of evidence. It simply provides that where a prosecution is taken under this Act, proof that the defendant has at any time since the beginning of the war been a member of any association shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary be evidence that he has continued to be a member of that association at all times material to theprosecution. </para>

                        <para>- That means any association. It may be the most innocent association, and instead of this provision operating unfairly upon individuals, it may be their protection. The mere fact that a man claims that he is a member of an association, and shows that he was a member of it at any time since the war - it may not be an unlawful association at all - will be accepted as proof, unless there is evidence to the contrary, that he still continues to be a member of that association, which may be a perfectly innocent one. The provision does not apply to any individual association, but to all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> gave a very good reason why the Senate should accept the position asked for by another place. He pointed out that there are in existence unlawful associations which, prior to the passing of the parent measure, were innocent associations. The proof that a man was, a member of such an association in its days of legal innocence will be accepted as proof that he has continued to be a member of it at all times material to the prosecution. This would work a&#62; hardship but for the fact that  the words &#34; in the absence of proof to the contrary &#34; qualify the section. </para>

                        <para>- The likelihood is that he will have proof. The mere assertion that he was a member of the association prior to the passing of the original Act, when it was a perfectly innocent one, will not be conclusive, because it will be open to him to prove that he ceased to be a member of it as soon as this Bill or the parent Act came into force, or within a month after either event. The proposed new section will not inflict any hardship, and it is not out of harmony with the spirit of the whole measure. As I have said, however, it is out of place, and because the words &#34; unlawful association&#34; are mentioned in every other paragraph of the clause, one would naturally infer that they should appear in this particular provision, but it is not necessary, nor is it right, that they should. </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators will recognise that the position in regard to. wheat production in Australia to-day is abnormal. The great bulk of our wheat has been sold to the British Government, and we have made ourselves responsible for its good order and condition up to the 31st December of this year. Although responsibility for the protection of the wheat will after that date rest nominally upon the British Government, there will at the same time be a moral responsibility upon us to preserve it and deliver it in the best possible condition, which I am sure the people of Australia will gladly accept. </para>
                    <para>With the wheat that is already stacked in Australia to-day, and the crop that will come in in December and January next, we shall have, in round figures, between 5,000,000 and 6,000,000 tons of this product. This represents from four to six times the greatest quantity we have ever had in Australia before. Honorable senators are familiar with the conditions which brought into existence the Australian wheat pool, namely, the difficulty of obtaining ships sufficient to deal with what was then considered an average normal crop. All that it is possible for the combined Governments to do in securing means of transport for the Australian wheat has been done. But, despite the best energies of the Government and their desire to charter all boats that might be available for the purpose, wheat has accumulated in Australia to such an extent that to-day some of that which we have stacked is nearly two years old. </para>
                    <para>In the first wheat season after the drought little or no vermin had to be contended against, and the great bulk of our wheat, after twelve months&#39; storage, was in almost as good condition as it was on the day it was stacked. But0 we must look to the future, and there is no immediate hope that we shall be able to transport the great bulk of the wheat that has accumulated in anything like a reasonable period of time. The mice plague is not the most serious difficulty with which we have to deal in connexion with the storage of wheat. I believe that, with the experience we have gained, we are now in a position to deal successfully with the mice plague. All the best minds in Australia competent to deal with the question have been considering it, and I believe that we can expect in the future to prevent mice getting to the wheat. One of the most difficult matters with which we have to deal in the storage of wheat is to prevent the depredations of the weevil, especially in view of the fact that, as I have said, some of the wheat that is stored is two years old. Owing to climatic conditions the weevil never attacks wheat in some parts of Australia, the reason being that it requires more than 10 per cent, of moisture before the weevil can live in wheat. In normal conditions the moisture in wheat is only a little over 7 per cent. But in some parts of the Commonwealth, owing to climatic conditions, the weevil breeds freely. In New South Wales great difficulty is experienced at the seaport, Sydney.- In Victoria, on the contrary, at Williamstown it has been found possible to keep wheat in good condition for three or four years. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but, owing probably to the position of the wheat stacks and the climatic conditions there, the weevil is not generated as it is in other parts of Australia. In many inland parts of Australia wheat very rarely shows any signs of weevil. </para>

                    <para>But much of the wheat we have stacked is new wheat, and we have to reckon with the fact that we may have to keep it for a very long time. The proposal of this Bill is to erect concrete silos.- Although such silos are used  commonly  for the bulk handling of wheat, this Bill has nothing to do with that question. Being compelled to provide storage for the immediate preservation of our wheat, it has been decided that, as the bulk handling of wheat is likely to be adopted in Australia, the storage provided under this Bill should be of such a character as to be suitable and available whenever subsequently  the  practice of the bulk handling of wheat is adopted. Quite apart from the initiation of the bulk handling system of deal-  ing with wheat, where permanent  structures  are provided for the storage of wheat it has been found that concrete silos are the cheapest and most effective means of Storage that could be adopted. Their depreciation over a number of years is practically nil. The care of the wheat is our responsibility. Owing to the mice plague we have already lost a good deal of money in the wheat pool. This system of storage will also have this advantage, that once the wheat is in the silos it will be impossible for the mice to attack it. A great loss has ensued, not so much from the damage done by the mice as from the re-bagging of the wheat, which has run into a considerable amount. Our only regret is that we did not make this effective provision for storage in the first place, as the cost of the bags themselves would have meant a considerable lump &#39;sum towards the cost of providing permanent storage, which will be wanted at all times. </para>
                    <para> The object -of this Bill is twofold. First, to give power to create a Commission ; and, second, to empower the Commonwealth Government to advance a certain sum to the States for the purpose of erecting wheat storage. </para>
                    <para>The Commission will consist of a representative of each of the four States which are now handling the wheat through the pool and a representative of the Commonwealth. Their duty will be to control the erection of the storage plants to the extent of seeing that they axe made uniform throughout Australia; that they comply with the best conditions and that the work is carried out on a high standard; and, also, to control the expenditure in so far as it will be supervised by the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>The plant, type, and style of the silo is to be approved of and adopted by the Commission . Each State will be advanced money by the Commonwealth up to the value of the work to be done, and subject to its effective control. That is to say, the States will not be permitted to go on their own, as it were. Once a uniform, plan has been adopted, no modification can be made by any State in the erection of the silos unless it has the approval of the Commission. Experience may teach us as we go along that certain modifications may be desirable, but the individual States will not be permitted to depart from the uniform plan unless the alteration is indorsed by the Federal Commission. </para>
                    <para>The silos are to be erected on a 50,000- bushel basis, because it is the- most economical silo to handle, and will give better satisfaction to Australia. But power is given to some States to erect a silo with a capacity of 25,000 bushels, because there will not be sufficient wheat at a particular station to fill a larger silo. It is not an advantage to erect a . 25,000-bushel silo, but rather a disadvantage. In some cases it will be better to erect a silo of 25,000 bushels capacity than to be without a silo. Therefore, there will have to be some very good and substantial reason given as to why any silo with a capacity of less than 50,000 bushels is erected. </para>
                    <para>Likewise, the Federal Commission will have full power to select sites and determine the number of silos to be erected. There may be many cases where, as on tha border, two silos may be wanted so close together as to cost a deal of money, and bring about unnecessary conflict and competition. The Commission will have the power of final decision in regard to all such cases. </para>
                    <para>Under the scheme it is proposed to build one-third storage capacity for the average  normal production of Australia. Now the normal production for the ten years from 1907-8 to 1916-17, excluding the drought year, was about 12.25 bushels per acre. The area under wheat in 1915-16 was 12,483,208 acres; and in 1916-17, 11,600,000 acres. The mean production was 12,041,640 acres. The average normal harvest - that is, the average yield, multiplied by the mean &#39;of &#39;the last two years&#39; acreage - was 147,000,000 bushels. The storage capacity recommended is 49,000,000 bushels. It is estimated that at&#189;d. per bushel the capital cost will be &#163;2,858,333. </para>

                            <para>asked a moment or two ago what is to become of the balance of the wheat. The reason why we have adopted the principle of one-third is that we think it will be a saving rather than a loss that the first third, which can be used in normal times, should be built on strong, solid, and permanent lines. Possibly we shall have to determine in the future how much temporary storage will be required for the balance of the harvest by the number of ships that are available to transport the wheat. Of course, the more wheat to be transported the less storage we shall need, but that storage will have to be of a temporary character. </para>

                    <para>Many suggestions have been made.. For instance, in districts where wheat is not subject to weevil owing to the climatic conditions, it is anticipated that some buildings will be erected. Some persons suggest the provision of concrete floors with a light covering, while others favour asphalt floors, because it is said that mice will not go over tar. There are many suggestions for a cheap form of storage which will protect the balance of the wheat for three or four years. It must be remembered that wheat storage is not required to the same extent in Australia as in America, Canada, or Russia. Probably during this year Russia has multiplied her wheat storage ten times in the midst of the war, but wheat is more subject to dampness and weevil in that country than in some of the sunny parts of Australia. </para>
                    <para>I have been asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> to state the length of time which wheat can be kept in silos without deterioration. On that point I will read an interesting extract from the report of tha Commission on Wheat Storage. </para>
                    <para>Reports as to experience elsewhere indicated that wheat may be stored in silos indefinitely if properly handled, and your Commissioners obtained confirmation of this by cable to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Borden, Prime Minister of Canada, to the following effect :  - &#34;Greatly obliged if you can inform me a; to length of time wheat stored in silos of elevators will keep without deteriorating. </para>
                    <para>To this the following reply was received :  - &#34; In answer to your telegram 27th May good dry grain will keep indefinitely in both wood and concrete elevators. Damp grain arriving during winter will keep until sum&#39; mer; arriving in the spring or summer: will keep for fifteen or twenty days, and must be re-elevated.&#34; </para>

There wil be an elevator leg going up by the side This leg may command one silo or half a-dozen.. The wheat will be put in at the top. The elevator will have a hop per bottom from which the wheat can bt taken out and elevated over the top of the silo. The elevator will practically run automatically by the application oi an oil engine. The men can do other work while the elevator is turning the wheat, and that operation will . prevent the development of weevil. </para>

At the present time it may be an advantage not to erect silos in country districts, because most of the old wheat is lying at the. seaboard. Under normal conditions it may be better to erect more silos in the country districts than at the seaboard, where, as is well known, the old wheat is now in danger. </para>

We still have plenty of wheat in Australia. Notwithstanding all the troubles we have had, the damage to the wheat, though very serious, has been much exaggerated. At least two-thirds of our wheat has hardly been attacked. At Port Adelaide I saw a stack of 1,000,000 bags of wheat which is almost as good as it was when it was brought to the port, which is a good place for the storage of wheat. At Williamstown we have millions of bags of wheat in perfect order. </para>

                            <para>- I know all about Balaclava. I know every part of Australia where damage has been done to wheat. Having had an experience of the mice plague, we would deserve strong condemnation if we permitted such damage to be done again, more particularly as the country which purchased all this wheat has enabled our farmers to have as prosperous a time as they had prior to war conditions. If it were only for the sake of requiting a good turn we ought to make a double effort to preserve every grain of wheat for the British Government and our Allies, who will need it in the very near future. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon,</inline> I may mention that the wheat stacked at Williamstown is nearly two years old. The danger is already there, because the menace of submarines does not make sufficient boats available. It is of no use to delay the erection of silos until the wheat has rotted and is attacked by weevil.

                    <para>The cost . of this undertaking, it is estimated, will represent about $d. per bushel. It is proposed to erect silos in which to store about one-third of the crop during normal years, namely 49,000,000 bushels,,  at  a cost of &#163;2,850,000. This money is to be advanced to the States, and in the erection of the silos a uniform design will be adopted by them - a design approved by the Federal Commission, constituted as it is at present, otherwise the States will have perfect freedom to carry out the work as they think fit. The advances will be made to them subject to a plan approved of by the Federal Commission, and they will be permitted to carry out the work as they deem best. </para>

                            <para>- They will probably pay very little. The Commission have recommended that no profits be made out of this undertaking - that it be run by the nation in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> interests of our rural producers. In the earlier years of the scheme, I can conceive of no simpler way of dealing with the producers than of charging the interest and depreciation connected with it to the wheat pool. If that be done, seeing that two-thirds of the wheat will not require to be stored, the cost to the farmer will probably not exceed one-twenty-fourth of a penny per  bushel. Ah the same time I have no desire to indicate that amount as a precedent in connexion with future bulk handling charges. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, over the entire crop of approximately 150,000,000 bushels. After the lapse of five or six weeks for transportation, the cost of storage would be about a farthing per bushel on the quantity stored. However, the scheme contemplated in the Bill is merely in the nature of a temporary expedient until after the war, when the bulk handling question will have to be seriously faced. </para>

                    <para>I ask honorable senators not to take a small view of this matter. The scheme is devised to apply to wheat that we have already sold - wheat which will be wanted early next year to feed the troops in the field. It is consequently incumbent on Australia to help her Allies by preserving every possible grain of that wheat. Conceivably, some of the States may say that they do not propose to come into the scheme, because future bulk handling will not be successful within their borders. That, however, is not the question we have to consider now. The Bill does not compel the States to come in. But I do say that none of those </para>
                    <para class="block">States which have participated in the operations of the wheat pool, and in the big sales which have been effected to the British Government - especially in view of the fact that Britain is our only possible customer next year - can avoid its obligation in this regard, because by so doing they would be sacrificing the great advantages which they enjoy through the operations of that pool. I ask honorable senators to give this measure their hearty support. Whilst there is nothing grand, new, or unique in it, it will at least be a guarantee to the Old Country that we shall do our best to preserve our foodstuffs for it, it will be honouring the bond into which we have already entered, and at the same time it will be of great assistance to our producers. </para>

                        <para>. - I am not going to indulge in any criticism of this Bill. On the contrary, I intend to assist the Government to pass it without delay, believing, as I do, that it is one of the measures brought forward to assist the Empire in its hour of need. But . the Honorary Minister said a few minutes ago that some of the States would not come into the scheme. I do not understand what he means by that remark. I hope that the time is not far distant when the States will not have an opportunity of refusing to enter into an undertaking of this sort. If they are receiving assistance from the Commonwealth in the storage of their wheat it is bad grace on their part to refuse to come in. </para>

                    <para>Personally, I do not agree with the pro.posal te advance money to the States to carry out this work. I would rather see the Commonwealth handle the whole business itself. I have been given to understand that the scheme for the build-  ing of these silos emanated from an interested firm, which has submitted plans to the Government, and that it is the intention of the Ministry to authorize this firm to build the silos without inviting competition for them. I hope that any firm which may be desirous of assisting the Government in the erection of the silos will be afforded an opportunity&#39; to do so. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sure that every honorable senator hails with considerable satisfaction this practical measure, which has been brought forward in the interests of the producers of Australia. If the silos will be completed before the next Australian wheat crop is garnered, and if the estimate of cost is not greatly exceeded, I cannot see what objection can be taken to the proposal. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Minister was not very clear on the question of finance. The proposal, as I understand him? is to spend, approximately, &#163;3,000,000 for the erection of 1,000 silos, each to hold about 50,000 bushels df wheat. It is proposed that the&#39; Commonwealth shall lend the money to the States, and that the States shall control the business and decide the number of silos that they. want. I also understand from the Minister that . the Commonwealth is to be repaid the money by a charge on the wheat stored in the silos, such charge to be made a charge upon the pool, or, if the pool does not exist, upon the wheat that is there to the debit of the individual farmer. If a charge is made of one-eighth of a Id. per bushel per month, that will mean  1&#189;d.  per bushel per year, and will amount,  a proximately,  to &#163;300,000 per year as rent for the wheat in the silos. This will be a reasonable provision for interest upon the capital cost of silos that do not wear out, and allow a fair sum for amortization. </para>
                    <para>The Bill gives full latitude and power to the Commissioners to fix what rent they like, but, on behalf of the primary producers, I should like to see a maximum rent fixed beyond which the Commissioners cannot go. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not; but I should like honorable senators, in considering the question of financing the scheme, to see if they cannot protect the man on the land from excessive rent charges. After all, the Government have brought down estimates, which I suppose have been carefully gone into, and I am sure the whole question of cost has been carefully considered. I see no reason why a maximum rent cannot be fixed, to prevent any possibility of the exploitation of the farmer in the future. </para>

There should be no difficulty in this country, which has a climate much the same as that of Egypt, in storing wheat for, an indefinite number of years, free from pests. It should be much easier to deal with the wheat expeditiously, taking it from silos and handling it in bulk, than by the expensive process that has now to be followed. The cost of bags alone should be very greatly minimized. </para>

The object is to reduce the number of members on the Commission from seven to three. I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> has an amendment of a similar character, and I cannot understand why seven members should be required on the Repatriation Commission. So far I have heard no argument from the Minister why&#39; the number should be fixed at seven, and I think it would be wise for the Committee to accept the amendment. Should the measure in its operation prove to be hot so effective as desired, it will be an easy matter for the Minister in charge to ask Parliament to increase the number of commissioners. There is also the matter of expense to be considered. I presume the gentlemen to be appointed will not be called upon to act in an honorary capacity. </para>

                    <para>. - I also think it wise to raise at once the question whether members of the Commission are to be paid or whether they are to act in an honorary capacity, because it might make a very considerable difference to the voting on this amendment. Personally, I believe the commissioners should, be paid, although, after listening to the Minister, I may be prepared to alter my views on this point. I favour the principle of three commissioners, even if they are to be paid. If they are to act in an honorary capacity I do not know that it matters very much whether we have seven or three, although I think the balance of advantage lies with the smaller number. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to ask the Committee to consider this amendment not merely as a proposal to substitute three commissioners for seven, but as an alteration which, if adopted, would destroy the whole scheme of the Bill ; though I do not mean to say that it would destroy repatriation. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I will leave for a moment the particular amendment under discussion, and ask your indulgence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> while I make reference to some matters covered by later clauses of the Bill, because this amendment, if carried, would pull out the keystone of the arch. We may proceed in three different ways in the creation of an organization to deal with repatriation. The first is the ordinary departmental method, with which we are all familiar, and under which we would have an ordinary department with its paid officials under the control of the Minister. There is a second method under which commissioners are sometimes appointed - as in the case of our railways, waterworks, and other public utilities - and I cannot help thinking that honorable senators are a little confused, because of their familiarity with commissioners in such cases, and that they&#39; are assuming that the Commissioners under this repatriation scheme would occupy somewhat similar positions. The third method by which we can deal with this matter is by inviting the assistance of private citizens. These are the only methods under which we can carry on the work of repatriation. </para>
                <para>As to the first, method - that of the ordinary Department - I admit it gives what I hold to be essential, namely, parliamentary control, and parliamentary responsibility in the last resort. That, to my mind, is absolutely necessary in connexion with this work, seeing that Parliament will be invited to find the money to finance the scheme. I agree that an ordinary Department will insure this, but it will also leave this important matter entirely to paid officials, and will shut out altogether that association of private citizen life in this country to which I attach much importance. Moreover, I think a large number of people, returned soldiers included, would regard the scheme with some suspicion if we told them that we were going to leave them entirely under the control of an ordinary official Department as it is generally understood. For that reason, I have endeavoured to get away from the departmental method in seeking a satisfactory method of handling this proposition. </para>
                <para>With regard to the appointment of commissioners, I admit at once that in many cases such a course is extremely desirable. In the case of our railways, for instance, we appoint commissioners, who get their sailing orders, and we rely upon their integrity and expert knowledge to manage our railways as a business concern. A definite responsibility is placed upon them, but this could not be done in the case of commissioners for repatriation, because it cannot be said that any one is an expert in this department of our social life. Even supposing that we did find the most competent man in the whole of Australia, we could not lay down any definite instructions for his guidance. We could only say that we wanted him to deaf fairly with our soldiers. We could not tell him how to run the scheme unless we were prepared to face the task of drawing up a complete schedule setting &#39; forth the benefits to be allowed in every case that might be presented. Obviously, that would be impossible, because if we completed a list of benefits to-day it would be possible tomorrow to find .half-a-dozen new and entirely different sets of circumstances. Each case must be dealt with on its merits. </para>
                <para>As I have already pointed out, the effect of the amendment will be to sweep the Minister on one side, and destroy the nexus between the repatriation body and Parliament. </para>

                <para>I want honorable senators to consider what the duties of these commissioners will be. They will not control the Repatriation Department, but will act as an advisory board to the Minister, advising him as to. the nature, extent, and degree of the benefits to be extended to the soldiers. It is because three is too small a number to enable the Minister to surround himself with representatives of different interests or different classes, that seven is the number selected. I think it is the smallest number necessary to make the Commission effective for the purpose for which &#39;it is designed. The alternative is not to have a Commission of this kind to advise the Minister at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton&#39;s</inline> similar proposition sweeps the Minister away from the Commission, and would leave it entrenched in the position of a Board of permanent officials with the power to determine the .character, extent, and degree of benefits to be given to returned soldiers. </para>

                <para>Assuming that the Committee decided upon the appointment of three paid Commissioners, it has to be remembered that they would not be in the same position as Commissioners for Railways, who are placed in .charge of a definite business, and told clearly what is required  of  them. The conduct of the business is then left to their expert knowledge, and reliance is placed upon their integrity. But what is the duty of the Commission proposed to be constituted under this Bill <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It is to consider what is a fair measure - of benefit to extend .to this or that class of soldier. It will not deal with the individual. Its business will be merely  to  lay down the character, extent, and nature  of  the benefits to be conferred under the scheme of repatriation. It will advise the Minister on &#34;these points. </para>
                <para>I think there is great advantage in bringing to the aid of the Minister the views of representatives  of  the private life of the country.  If  the point be taken that we cannot get men of standing to accept these positions unless they are paid, let me at once set the mind of the Committee at rest by  Baying  that I have had the moat gratifying assurances on the point, and amongst them from gentlemen who have stipulated that they would take the position only if it were honorary. Amongst them is a gentleman who is a representative of one of the biggest bodies of organized Labour in Australia. I do not anticipate &#39;the slightest difficulty in securing for the proposed Commission men whose names will not only command the respect of honorable senators, but who will be regarded as fairly representative alike of the citizens and of tie returned soldiers. Let honorable senators consider what demand is likely to be made on the time of the gentlemen constituting the Commission. Seeing that they have merely to lay down the scale of benefits to be conferred, I say that if at the beginning they sat three days a week for a month, one meeting a month afterwards would be sufficient. They will not be administering a Department, and will not be dealing with individual applications. The administration will be in the hands of the Minister, and  it will be the duty of the State Boards to deal with the individual applications. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to include two, and I think that would be a very fair proportion. It is not to be supposed, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> reminds me, that the other members of the Commission will be in opposition to the representatives of the returned soldiers. There is a double advantage in having returned soldiers on the Commission, since they may be expected to represent to some extent the soldiers&#39; point of view, and will be of value in a greater degree because the soldier will have the assurance that there are men on the Commission specially qualified to understand his position. </para>

                <para>I again remind honorable senators that the Commission will not run the Department. It will be the duty of the Minister to see to the administration of the scheme, and the actual dealing with applications will rest upon the State Boards. The proposed Commission will be merely a Board of Advice, and honorable senators will agree that the Minister will require all the advice he can possibly get for the successful carrying out of the repatriation scheme. For these reasons&#39; I ask the Committee to leave this matter as it stands in the Bill at present. </para>

                    BOLTON (Victoria) &#91;4.59&#93;. - I can assure honorable senators that in supporting the amendment I am not acting in any frivolous or factious spirit, but with an earnest desire, at the inception of this great undertaking, to assist the Government to secure such conditions as will promise the greatest measure of success.
                </para>
                <para>In the Bill as it stands the provision to give effect to the reliance of the Government upon voluntary effort is, in my view, an inherent weakness. They have already accepted full responsibility for it. This reliance upon voluntary effort is calculated to create the impression in the public mind that the Government are not really in earnest over this matter.- It must be obvious that the success or failure of the scheme must depend largely upon the central Commission, which will have the responsibility of creating the whole of the machinery of administration. </para>

                        <para>.- It will be charged with the preparation of the regulations, and these will form the machinery which will govern the administration. The members of this Commission must be men of ability, and should have sympathetic experience, knowledge, and understanding of the subject.

                <para>In my opinion it will be quite impossible for an honorable senator, such as the Vice-President of the Executive Council, to devote the necessary time to the work of  Chairman  of the Commission to enable him to do justice to the importance of that work. It will need the whole of the time and energy of any man. If it were proposed by an individual, or by a corporate body, to build a bridge across a swiftly-flowing and turbulent stream, they would not invite an expert financial man, a statesman, or a politician to&#39; design the bridge. They would invite some one able to form a reliable opinion of the weight the bridge would have to carry, the strain which the material of which it was constructed would bear, and the design of the piers necessary to carry the load even when the stream was flooded. I say that the men who&#39; are to create the regulations or machinery to give effect to this tremendous undertaking must be men in a position to devote the whole of their time to the work, and must have a personal responsibility to the Government and the country, and not men with only a superficial or casual interest in the success of this great movement, giving to it only occasional attention. </para>

                <para>I do not see how we can hope to secure, men who have the necessary time and experience to take up the work of this very difficult position as honorary members of a Board. It must be remembered that the men with whom we propose to deal are men who have been down to the very depths of hell. &#39; By the protection of Providence they have been able to stagger out of that hell, but shattered in body and soul, and with their minds in anything but a fit condition to consider matters. The Minister spoke of beginning the work of repatriation in the United Kingdom. He talks of registering men in the United Kingdom or on board ship on the way back to Australia. The men in such circumstances will not be in a mental condition to . consider what their prospects are likely to be or what are their inclinations. </para>

                <para>Let me say what has been the practice adopted up to the present time. When a man arrives1 here from the Front he reports to head-quarters, and receives permission to go to his friends for a fortnight or three weeks. I have experience of what happens to the men. I have seen 600 or 700 of these men, war worn and weary, coming down the Bed Sea in the heat. I have noticed them in the evening turn their faces in a south-westerly direction, and line the bulwarks of the ship to get the first glimpse of the Southern Cross above the horizon. Honorable senators should have heard the ringing cheer that went around the ship the first evening they saw the Southern Cross. As they caught the first glimpse of the shores pf Australia the joy exhibited by the men was something wonderful. And as they arrive in their own town or seaport where their relatives and friends meet them, I contend that if any form of restriction or discipline is imposed the authorities will take on a very serious responsibility. </para>

                <para>Sentaor Lt. -Colonel BOLTON. - The questions of pensions, amelioration, and repatriation cannot, in my opinion, be separated. After the returned soldiers have been with their friends for a fortnight or month, and have had time to settle down and think calmly and collectedly as .to their future, they may have to report to the military authorities. A Medical Board will have to say whether a man has to go into a hospital or not. If a man has to go into a hospital he will still be under the authority of the military people, and, if necessary, should be tenderly cared for and treated. If, however, he has not to go into a hospital it will be a question of pension, amelioration, and repatriation. That is the point where I think the men should be dealt with. It is the regulations which the Commission will have to administer. I heartily support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - We must all look at this proposal from the point of view of how we can do the best for the returned soldiers. The question is whether we are ito have a Commission of three or seven members to assist the Minister in the administration of the Act. The idea of the Minister is to select honorary commissioners of various social standing, and two of .them to be returned soldiers, so .that every shade of .opinion will  be available to guide him in his administration. That is, I think,, a very wise provision indeed. I expect that one of the commissioners will be chosen because .of his knowledge of land masters, and possibly another commissioner may be selected by reason of his knowledge of business matters, so that when any body of soldiers require to be settled on the land he will be able to give expert advice on the subject. An architect or an engineer, of course, must be employed to build a bridge; but the best person to say &#34;who is the right man to employ for that purpose is, as a rule, a business man - that is the man indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> scheme. With most directorates cases of that sort arise. A board of directors never think of building a bridge as indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton,</inline> but, after making full inquiries, they are the best men to advise as to who should be employed. That is the class of men whom I would trust in the interests of returned soldiers to do the work. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Minister&#39;s suggestion ought to be adopted. We are only proposing to tentatively try this measure, and, as we go along, we shall acquire experience and learn how to do things better. I think that the system of a Commission with State Boards is likely to produce as good results for the soldiers as any scheme which could be suggested. The Minister seemed to be hesitating about having honorary Boards in the States. I think that in the other States he will be able to find a class of men who will know the local conditions and will be just as patriotic and as willing to help as men here. I hope that he will stand firm on these points. </para>

I believe that we should pay the men who are to hold these positions, because hitherto the administration of a great fund in the hands of honorary commissioners has been entirely unsatisfactory. </para>

                <para>Not long ago a deputation waited upon the Minister here and placed before him some figures. I read the report in a Sydney newspaper. The figures were not made much of at the time, but in my opinion they show that the persons who have been administering patriotic funds up to date have acted in a very poor way. The amount collected to date has been &#163;2,559,738. The disbursements to soldiers and dependants have amounted to &#163;590,974, and other payments have come to &#163;769,839, leaving a balance in hand of &#163;1,198,925. </para>

                <para>I want this fund managed by three men who will be in practically the same position as the Judges in the High Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has asked if I would not want a representative of Western Australia. I would not want any State representatives. I want the three best men to be found in Australia, even if they were all to come from Western Australia. This is a national matter,&#39; and although the Senate is a States house, it does not matter to me where the commissioners come from. It is a business transaction pure and simple, and the services of the three best men ought to be secured. We do not want offers from any men. We need men who have had some experience and possess business and financial knowledge. The land shark has been using his claws in New South Wales. The State Government are challenged for having paid huge sums for resumed estates, and one member of Parliament, who is a farmer and a member of the National party, says that the returned soldiers who go on this land will have a harder battle to fight than they had in Gallipoli. Unless the Government secure the services of men who will stand to their guns staunch and true they will find the same ravages creeping into the administration of this fund in its early life. Good men should be picked out and paid a fair salary. No man should be appointed because of his patriotism. My complaint is that there is no patriotism to be found among these people. Patriotism is only to be found in the lower classes of the community. I have in my pocket a newspaper report of the case of a certain person who desired to be appointed on the Executive Committee of a fund suing the aged and almost blind father and mother of one of our soldiers for rent. They applied to the Lord Mayor&#39;s Patriotic Fund for a sum to pay the claim. The controllers of the fund &#39;never pay the full sum asked for rent, because they hold that there should be patriotism exhibited, and that the landlord should be willing to forego a portion of the rent. The parents of a soldier, the father being eighty years of age and the mother seventy years, were to-day actually forced to apply to a patriotic fund for money to pay the rent owing to a champion of the soldiers and an officer of a society for the assistance of soldiers&#39; wives and dependants. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I do not say for a moment that they would apply that treatment tlo all persons, but there is a probability of it creeping in at any time, and that is what I wish to prevent. There are some returned men who are well qualified to creditably fill the proposed positions. But they cannot do so unless they are paid for their services just as they were paid when they were at the Front. My desire is to assist the Vice-President of the Executive Council in his laudable effort to do the best that he can to secure the efficient administration of this scheme. </para>

                    <para>. - From the moment that this Bill was presented to the Senate there have been undoubted manifestations of a desire on the part of honorable senators to make the scheme for which it provides a thorough success. We all admit that, in dealing with the question of repatriation, we are treading an unknown region. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, I presume, has given this matter more attention than has any other member of this Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> has also given it much consideration. If I desired advice upon military matters, I would probably pay a great deal of heed to the opinion expressed by the honorable senator. But this is not a military matter, and though <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> knows a great deal more about military questions than I do, I am not prepared to credit him with the possession of a very large knowledge of repatriation matters. It will be admitted, I think, that the Red Cross Association of Australia has done excellent work up to the present time. Here is a body of men who are giving freely of their time, money, and abilities to a great cause. </para>

We ought not to make a party issue of this matter. I do not say that the Government scheme should be adopted in every detail, but in respect of great principles, such as the appointment of the Commission which it is proposed to create, I do think that it ought to be. </para>

                        <para>- The representatives of Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, and New South Wales would require to come to Melbourne at least once a month. Presumably they would expect their expenses to be paid, as well as a daily allowance while they remained in this city. Now whilst I have no objection to their expenses being paid, I am strongly of opinion that the expenses of seven honorary commissioners would amount to more than would the salaries of three paid commissioners. Personally, I am quite prepared to leave this matter in the hands of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. We can get at him occasionally, and ascertain from him how matters are progressing; but if this question is relegated to a Commission, whether it be honorary or paid, it will, to a certain extent, be removed from the control of Parliament). For that reason I am not in favour of the creation of a Commission, either honorary or paid. I think that the Minister can administer the scheme just as efficiently as can any body of men who may meet occasionally in Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>- Conceivably the scheme may cost considerably more. For my part I do not mind how much it costs. We cannot possibly do too much for those who have gone to the firing line. But I am deadly hostile to the appointment of an honorary Commission. Such Commissions are more expensive than are paid commissioners; they are exceedingly unsatisfactory, and they practically shoulder no responsibility. The Government have been exceedingly ill-advised to ask the Senate to agree to a proposal of this character. </para>

                <para>But apart from the central Commission which it is proposed to create, another Commission or Board is to be appointed in each State. I do not know whether it is intended that the members of those Boards shall fill honorary positions or whether they shall be paid. Men who are prepared to carry out work of this kind without direct payment do not appear to me to give that satisfaction which is given by men paid straight out for their time. We have no fault to find with the members of the Inter-State Commission so far as I know, even though, they can take no other contracts during the period of their appointments. They are being paid, and have security of tenure. </para>

I am decidedly against the creation of an unpaid Commission, but if this body is to be created it certainly ought to be paid, in fairness to its own members and to the returned men. </para>

                    (Tasmania) &#91;5.371-1 can quite understand the anxiety of honorable senators to arrive at the soundest and most advantageous conclusion concerning the appointment of a Commission and the establishment on a sound footing of the principle of the repatriation of soldiers, not only because it is going to be a very big undertaking, but also because it is a question on which we have no precedent to guide us.
                </para>
                <para>The main question of repatriation must be considered in the light of the fact that the soldier has rendered to the nation a service for which no monetary payment or no effort of repatriation can possibly recompense him. The main payment which a soldier receives for the service which he has rendered to His country is undoubtedly his country&#39;s gratitude. While we establish a system for the repatriation or reward of these men, we have then to provide for a system by which the utmost liberality and consideration will be given, considering at the same time the financial possibilities of the nation. Even if the nation were to impoverish itself in the effort to repatriate or reward its soldiers, it could not adequately reward them by any monetary effort. </para>
                <para>The question is how this task can best be effected. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> advises that the matter should be left in the hands of the Minister. That is absolutely impracticable. The Minister would have to be surrounded by officers in the different States, who would advise him and administer the Act in their States. It is impossible for the Minister individually to administer such an Act in one State alone, let alone in six. As the Minister has to have certain advisers, it is the duty of Parliament to decide upon that system of advisory tribunal which will administer the Act in the best way, and render the greatest assistance to the Minister, with the least cost. I realize that the debate is hinging around another amendment- </para>

                    <para>- That being so, the Senate must realize that- if they decide upon a paid advisory Commission it becomes a permanent tribunal, and must consist of men with a fixed tenure for a certain number of years at a certain salary. We cannot disguise the fact that in all these matters we must pay for brains. We must have intellectual ability, and pay for it. Whether three or seven are appointed they must be men of marked ability, and be appointed for a given number of years at a given salary. </para>

                <para>On the question of whether there shall be three or seven commissioners there hinges also the question whether they shall be .paid or honorary, which leads me to direct the attention of the Senate to the fact that if they are honorary the Minister may discontinue the tribunal within a month of its establishment, -while if they are paid we shall have set up a body which cannot be discontinued for a number of years. The honorary Commission which the Minister intends to establish will hold office at the pleasure of the Governor-General in Council, which, of course, means the Government. If, after a trial of that Commission, it is found to work unsatisfactorily, the Minister can immediately with draw its .commission and appoint a permanent Board from the best of its members or from others. </para>

I use that expression, but I am not sure whether it is an honorary capacity or not, because every man in the community owes a certain duty to the nation at the present time. If these men give the whole of their time, because they cannot do anything else, to the work of repatriating the soldiers, they will be giving nothing more than they have the right to give. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that. They will probably have to be the secretaries of organizations, or retired business men, or the secretary or other officers of the Returned Soldiers Association. They will have to be men who could give the time, but I believe that from that class you will get men of the necessary ability, with financial training, and sympathy towards the soldier. That sympathy is the first necessity, and I think every man is sympathetic towards the soldier. At the same time, each commissioner must have the capacity to realize accurately what the nation can do towards the repatriation of these men. My experience in Tasmania has led me to assume that we may anticipate a very effective response to the Minister&#39;s appeal to such men to take up this duty. I do not think there will be any difficulty. </para>

                    made a statement regarding the collection of patriotic funds which I do not like to let pass, in view of the very valuable services which have been rendered in an honorary way in my own State. I do not know what paper he quoted from, but it showed that the administration of these funds costs
                    <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7</inline>
                    for the distribution of every
                    <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5.</inline>
                    I do not know whether the whole expense of entertainments, and so forth, organized for patriotic purposes, is included in that calculation, but cases have come under my notice where attempts to organize different functions to raise patriotic funds have resulted in a very small net return, and such cases would swell the cost of administration* if they were included. I venture to say that in Tasmania the distribution of the patriotic funds does not cost&#189; per cent. So far as I can learn by pretty close association with them, the distribution of the Mayor&#39;s Patriotic Fund, the Disabled Soldiers&#39; Fund, and several others, has been very satisfactory. The honorary assistance rendered during the war by the citizens of Tasmania has been decidedly satisfactory.
                </para>
                <para>We are in this matter in a difficult position. We have the right to demand from the citizens of this nation certain honorary assistance at this time. The occasion is not like anything else. We could not, for instance, ask a Commission to report on the Northern Territory, or render some other service to the people, in a matter in which they were not partisans, for nothing. In a matter like this the work would be a labour of love, and I would be surprised if we could not find a number of men willing to render voluntary service. I know cases like that referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> will crop up, but we must not expect everybody who offers voluntary assistance to be of the same calibre as the people referred to by him. </para>
                <para>I intend to support the Bill as it stands, because I want to give it a fair trial, and if experience shows that it is not satisfactory, it will be an easy matter to correct the fault. </para>

There will he no difficulty  in  proving whether it is a success or not, because the scheme will be in operation for a great number of years. At present we are  in  the experimental stage, and I do not think it is advisable to launch out on a scheme which will tie us down to a definite proposal for  a  certain number of years. If experience shows that we cannot get whole-hearted and patriotic voluntary assistance in the administration of the Act, we can then  revert  to the system of administration by , paid officials. </para>

                    <para>.- I am  not  so much concerned about whether the commissioners are to be paid as I am about the system which is most likely to be efficient. If the commissioners are to be paid, their numbers must necessarily be limited to two or three, and, therefore, it will not be possible to have the same wide range of selection as in the case of honorary commissioners, who may be chosen from the different States. Gentlemen so appointed will bring to the councils of the nation the experiences of their own State in regard to land settlement, industrial legislation, and many other matters, and therefore there is less reason to fear. any failure in regard to the scheme than would be the case by the appointment of a paid Commission of, say, three men. No matter how careful we may be in the selection of three commissioners, or how much we may desire to give them fair remuneration, we could not expect to get men capable of controlling a scheme of this kind for &#163;1,000 a year. There are men with such experience who would be able to make more than that amount in a fortnight in private life. I believe, however, that men of exceptional ability will be prepared to offer their services and advice to the States free, and 1 think the Senate should adopt the Government&#39;s proposal. I realize, of course, that we could not expect &#39;these men to continue their arduous duties for all time in an honorary capacity, but while our legislation along these lines is in the experimental stage we might fairly expect this voluntary assistance from public-spirited men of experience. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> and other honorable &#39;senators have referred to the paying of travelling expenses. I presume it is not proposed to tie down paid commissioners to an office in Melbourne. </para>

They could not be expected to carry out their duties without travelling and investigation. This is an entirely new scheme; the road we are travelling is unknown to any of us. </para>

                    <para>.- I rise to support the scheme as laid down by the Minister, for I consider that in the management of a proposal affecting the whole of Australia, and under which every case for repatriation will have to be judged on its merits, a Commission of seven men will not be too large. I trust that one Commissioner will be selected from each State, because by his more intimate knowledge of conditions in his own State he will be able to make valuable representations to the Minister. We should try to secure the best value for our money with the least possible expenditure, and from the economic point of view I am satisfied that a Repatriation Commission of honorary members will serve our purpose best. To suggest that honorary commissioners will not perform the duties of the. office as sympathetically as paid officials in the interests of the returned soldiers and their dependants is ridiculous. I have had some experience, though it is no.t extensive, of repatriation work in Queensland. I think that honorary commissioners are likely to be more sympathetic to returned soldiers and their dependants than paid officials would be. My, experience of the work of paid officials is that after a time they become less sympathetic than they might be. Speaking from the point of view of the returned soldier, and as one who has been in contact with a great many returned soldiers during the last year, I can assure honorable senators that the returned soldiers will not feel that they are likely to be in any way badly treated should the administration of the repatriation scheme be left, to a certain extent, in the hands of honorary workers. We have a Repatriation Committee in Queensland that since its establishment, has done very fine work indeed on behalf of the returned soldiers. If the facts were secured from that State, I think it would be shown that the percentage of returned soldiers in need of assistance or employment there is very much lower than in any of the other States. The whole of the work of repatriation in Queensland is done, and done well, by honorary workers. Similar work is being well done in all of the other States by honorary workers, and, in the circumstances,I see no reason why, in the establishment of the proposed Repatriation Commission, the Government should be invited to make a few big fat billets for certain people. With respect to the suggestion by one honorable senator that we should have three returned soldiers as Commissioners- </para>

It must not be forgotten that two sections of the community are concerned in the repatriation scheme. First, there are the people who are providing the money for repatriation, and, second, the returned soldiers and the dependants of soldiers who are to benefit under the scheme. The people who are finding the money for repatriation have the same claim to be represented on the Repatriation Commission as have those who are to receive benefits under the scheme.

                        <para>- I hope that when the scheme is brought into operation, and paid officials in connexion with it are appointed in the different States, every effort will be made to see that the services of returned soldiers at present working in connexion with repatriation schemes are retained, and that if additional appointments are necessary they will be made from the ranks of returned soldiers. I realize that this is merely a machinery Bill. ,If it is found, that the seven honorary commissioners proposed by the Government do not carry out their duties in a satisfactory manner, and it is considered that the work can be more efficiently carried out by paid officials, I shall be prepared to support an amendment of the measure to provide for a paid Commission. At present I believe that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is proceeding upon right lines, and that the right class of me,u will be found willing to offer their services for this important work. I am prepared to support the clause providing for a Repatriation Commission consisting of seven honorary members. </para>

                    <para>. - I am entirely at one with the Vice-President of the Executive Council with respect to the Repatriation Commission. In speaking on the second reading of the Bill, I indicated that I thought that, in connexion with the State Boards, a different course would have to be adopted. I differ from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> who has expressed the opinion that the Repatriation Commission should consist of representatives of the different States. It seems to me that the honorable senator has overlooked the fact that the functions of the Commission will differ entirely from those of the State Boards. The Repatriation Commission should be representative, but not necessarily representative of the different States. I think that it would be rather a drawback that it should be representative of the different States, because it will from time to time have to consider matters referred to it from the State Boards. I take it that the work of the Commission will largely be to review the work of the State Boards. We have been told that the returned soldiers are to be represented on the Commission. If there is a representative of the landed interests on the Commission, he will know what class of land is suitable for the settlement of returned soldiers. A representative of the financial interests, in conjunction with the Minister, will consider the appropriation of funds for the purpose of repatriation. The Commission must be representative of interests rather than of States. The work of repatriation must be dealt with, not as a State matter, but in a broad, national sense, and the Repatriation Commission should be representative of the elements most useful in the constitution of such a central body. If later on&#39; it is found necessary, as the result of experience, we can alter these proposals, but at present we are sailing on an uncharted sea, and must adopt the course which at present appears to us likely to satisfactorily meet the circumstances which we believe will arise. When we remember the large and varied interests that are concerned, I think it would be a grave mistake to reduce the number of the Commission from seven to three. </para>

                <para>The Commission will have to consider where men are to be placed, and will have to review the representations made to them by the State Boards with respect to individual men. This is the only provision of the Bill which brings the Minister into actual contact with expenditure under the  scheme.  So far, it is not proposed that the Minister shall have any power in controlling the State Boards. </para>

                <para>The Vice-President of the Executive Council is, in my view, rightly desirous of invoking the assistance of voluntary workers. He has selected this plan because of what he has seen taking place in the administration of Red Cross and other patriotic funds which have been raised. He recognises the good work which has been done. He is really in a better position to judge in this matter than are honorable senators. &#34;We ought, at this stage at any rate, to accept his proposition. I do not think that three paid men would administer this fund more effectively than would six men together with the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- I listened very attentively to the Minister&#39;s speech on the second reading of the Bill, but I did not glean from him that the administration of the fund is to escape from his hands. He will be the administrator, but he will take into counsel six gentlemen. So far as it was foreshadowed by the Minister, the proposed Commission is an excellent one for the purpose. I do not agree with the idea that its members should be drawn from the different States, because State representation can reach the Minister through the State Boards. Hereafter, I may perhaps take exception to the constitution of the State Boards, but at the present time I will decidedly support the Minister&#39;s suggestion. </para>

                    <para>. -  When I moved my amendment, I did not expect the debate to range so far as it has done. The Minister said that the amendment if carried will remove the keystone of the arch, and so destroy the whole scheme. I cannot see how. if the Committee decide in favour of a Commission with three men, the whole scheme of the Government will be destroyed. I believe that three men could do the work as effectively as the seven men whom the Minister suggested. </para>

My only desire was to remove what I thought cumbrous kind  of  machinery. Later in the Bill the question of payment or non-payment of the Commissioners could have been raised; but whether the Commissioners are paid  or  not, my contention is that three are quite sufficient, lt has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> and I think by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain</inline> also, that an honorable senator on this side has suggested that there should be three returned soldiers appointed to the Commission. &#39; No such suggestion has been made from this side, but I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> intends to move an amendment to the effect that the returned soldiers should be represented on the Commission. Whether the Commission is to consist of three or seven men, I consider that a returned soldier should be there to represent that section of (he community. </para>

                        <para>That, in the opinion of the Senate, if the consent of the Imperial Government can be obtained to the action being taken, it is desirable that a High Commissioner for Australia should be accredited to the United States Government at Washington. </para>

                    <para class="block">Notwithstanding the importance of this motion, I do not intend to occupy the attention of the Senate for any length of time, because I hope that I shall never be one of those who desire to unnecessarily stress the obvious. </para>
                    <para>About two years ago my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> spoke very ably in this Chamber of the necessity . for the Commonwealth being represented at the capital of the United States of America. So ably did he address himself to the question that I felt constrained to support his remarks, and it was not long afterwards that we discovered that our words had found an echo in the somewhat distant territory of the United States itself. Many American publications gave considerable prominence to the somewhat cursory remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and myself. Beyond all doubt they most enthusiastically welcomed the proposal that the Australian Commonwealth should be represented by an accredited diplomatic representative at the capital of their country. </para>
                    <para>At the time that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and myself spoke on this matter, it cannot be said that America was overwhelmingly popular in certain parts of the British Dominions. Many writers in publications which saw the light in the Dominions of the Empire as well as in the Mother Country, thought that America should have addressed herself to the considerations arising out of this great world war in the fashion which commended itself to them. Because America did not do that, they thought fit very frequently to abuse  President  Wilson, the great representa.ive of the people of the American Republic. It strikes me now - as it struck me then - that many of these journalists, notwithstanding that it is part and parcel of their profession to keep in touch with the difficulties which arise in foreign countries, were scarcely aware of the difficulties surrounding  President  Wilson. They were somewhat oblivious of the fact that he had to walk exceedingly warily. But now many of them have, to a large extent, swallowed their words - smothered their writings - and have joined in the general chorus of acclaim to that great mau who represents the governing and executive power of -the greatest of English-speaking peoples. It must not be forgotten that in this Empire of ours, there are fewer English-speaking people than there are in the great Republic of the United States. If we exclude from the calculation the black population of the latter, it must be confessed that there are more white English-speaking people in the United States than there are in the British Empire. </para>

                            <para>- And as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> reminds me, English is the official language. As illustrating the change of opinion which has come over journalists,, cartoonists, and artists, I may say that I saw in one of the most topical Australian . publications a cartoon which depicted the whole of the cartoonists and artists of the English-speaking world meekly approaching  President  Wilson, hat in hand, and saying, &#34; We take it all back.&#34; In other words, they were represented as being ashamed of the way in which he had been lampooned for lacking a correct knowledge of the broader phases of this great conflict. When time has allowed international rivalries to lose their fine edges, I venture to say that  President  Wilson will be acclaimed by posterity as one of the greatest men of all ages, because by coming into this struggle in the way that he did, by exhibiting: tact, consideration, and a proper perception of the great interests of humanity he has established the moral strength of the cause of Great Britain and her Allies beyond all cavil. </para>

                    <para>I do not think there is any member of this Senate who will commit himself to the statement that our High Commissioner, who is accredited to the  capital  city of our own Empire, is unnecessary. I venture to say that the status of Australia has been improved,, and that knowledge of its resources and of the possibilities of its - future have been more amply disseminated throughout the world because of our representation by the able gentlemen who have filled the position of High Commissioner in Loudon, than they have by any other means. Now, if it is necessary in the interests of Australia that she should be represented at the Capital of the Empire, which has a population of only $7,000,000 of white people, it is equally essential that she should be represented at the capital of the United States of America, in which country there is a population of 100,000,000 of English-speaking people. </para>
                    <para>There are very many reasons why  the  friendship of America should be most assiduously and carefully cultivated by us. It is unnecessary to enumerate all of them. But one of the most important functions of the High Commissioner in London is to advise the Australian Government from time to time regarding the state of the financial market. Now, I think it is pretty evident that one of the results of this war will be the constituting of America as the great financial reservoir of the future. We see now that the Allied countries need &#34;to have recourse to America for financial assistance almost monthly. We know, too, through the great Liberty loan which was floated the other day, that ample means exist in America to permit of generous assistance being afforded ~~to Great Britain  and her Allies.  That assistance, I am happy to say, is being accorded day by day. </para>
                    <para>In passing, I may mention that the United States has a very long Pacific coast line, and undoubtedly many of the great interests of the world will have connexion with commercial and maritime supremacy in Pacific waters. I think it was an instinctive perception of this circumstance, and also a full recognition of the additional fact that the American people are in every sense of the word our kinsmen, which prompted Australia to give such a hearty welcome to the American Fleet when it visited our waters a few years ago. That welcome was very much relished by the men of the Fleet, and was particularly favorably commented upon by the people of the United States. But in these days of national materialism 1 suppose 1 shall be asked to lay particular stress on the material advantages that will follow our being diplomatically represented at Washington . </para>
                    <para>I am quite aware of the fact that my proposal will be regarded as a rather startling departure. It will probably be said that we are a-unit of the King&#39;s Dominions and have no right to separate diplomatic representation. I do not regard that point as at all important. We are within the Empire. We are proving in every way  that  our affection and regard for the Empire are matters of the most substantial .kind ; we are demonstrating that! the ties which unite us to the Mother Country - although not enforced by anything in the shape of a constitution setting forth Imperial rights over us - are very vital forces* indeed. I venture to say that if the Australian Parliament, by resolution., respectfully requests the Imperial Authorities to give it permission to be represented by a High Commissioner at Washington, no difficulty whatever will be put in our way. The obstacles which some people may think would attend our diplomatic representation at. Washington are more apparent than real. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Malley</inline> may speak quite as enthusiastically of Australian things in America as he did- of American things in Australia, and, if so, I will be quite satisfied with his utterances. America promises to be the financial centre of the world after this war, and probably before it is concluded. The energy and enterprise of the American people should particularly commend themselves to Australians, for it is those qualities which we have been in the habit of priding ourselves upon emulating and possessing. </para>

                            <para>- It may be so. Without reflecting in any way upon the undoubtedly great abilities which have been displayed by many diplomatic representatives of the Empire in the capitals of the various countries of the world, I will say that in many respects our diplomatic representation has shown considerable short-comings. Even as America is likely to become&#39; the financial centre of the world, so it is going to become the nerve centre of the world in many other respects. During this war, I say, without fear of logical contradiction, that the most authentic information of European, and even the world, happenings has been found in publications issued in the United States of America. </para>

                            <para>- That may possibly have accounted for a little freer expression of opinion in America than in British countries; but, item for item, tile news to be discovered in American publications would give any reflective politician a better opportunity of judging world happenings than anything he could derive from the press of his own country. The news of the Russian revolution broke upon an astonished people in Australia. It may have been anticipated, to some extent, in the Home country, but in Australia such a thing as an immediate Russian revolution during the progress of the war was not looked upon as even remotely likely. </para>

At any rate, some months before the Russian revolution there waa to be found in an important American magazine an article setting forth the likelihood of that revolution, and describing almost in detail the lines upon which, it actually afterwards transpired. I have read in American publications articles dealing with the European situation, the progress of the war, and the difficulties which our .Empire would be called upon to face, of the most conclusive and informative nature, which no responsible politician could peruse without having fresh light thrown upon the subjects that he was compelled from time to time to consider and discuss. An Australian diplomatic representative, dwelling in Washington, would be able to give the Government of the Commonwealth far more authentic and satisfactory information regarding impending world happenings than it would be likely to derive from any other source. </para>

The fact remains that an American magazine was able, at least two months before it happened, to give, almost in detail, the lines on which that revolution would progress. </para>

                    <para>Australia is undoubtedly associated with future happenings in all countries washed by the Pacific Ocean. We rate the strength of the American Republic at a very high standard, and hail its advent into this struggle as our ally as something which compensates for the slackness in Russia caused by the state of revolutionary flux into which that country is plunged, we hope, temporarily. If the advent of America into the war redresses the balance which was depressed against us by the paralysis of Russia, by admitting that fact we bear tribute, consciously or unconsciously, to the great material might of the people of the United States. I am not speaking of their moral force, or of what posterity will undoubtedly acclaim - that the American people did not come into this struggle to seek conquest, or from any lust of power, but to maintain the liberties of mankind. If they are going to be, as I am sure they will be, such an important factor in this struggle, they will, I hope, be an equally important factor in maintaining what ought to be the dominant note of all transactions connected with the Pacific, namely, peace. Australia is, next to America, both numerically and actually, the most important country peopled by whites with a Pacific sea-board. It is) therefore, obviously essential for Australia to cultivate the most friendly relations with America, and to be represented at the American capital in such a way that its Government will have early and confidential information of anything important likely to transpire in America, or in European or other countries with which American representative wen may be in touch. By establishing diplomatic representation of the Commonwealth in the United States, we help to establish a chain which will put the Australian Government in touch with the events of the world as it has never been in touch with them before. </para>
                    <para>It is said from time to time that very little is &#39; known of Australia in America. I do not subscribe to that. I believe the American people are very well possessed of information regarding the Australian Commonwealth, and, beyond all doubt, all public men representing Australian interests, and visiting America, are most hospitably received and entertained. I do not think one dissentient voice of importance would be raised in American public life if it were cabled to the United States of America to-morrow that the Senate of the Australian Commonwealth had adopted a resolution in favour of the Cow monwealth being diplomatically represented at Washington. I feel sure the United States would open its arms to our representative .and receive him with  a  most fraternal embrace. </para>

The mistake made in the case of the American Colonies is not likely to be repeated, and anything that savours of its repetition is likely to be harmful to the Empire. Therefore, any enlargement or broadening of the Commonwealth Go?vernment&#39;s  policy  such as may be effected by this motion will not be regarded by the Imperial authorities as detrimental to the interests of the Empire, but will rather most honestly recommend itself to them. </para>

                    <para>America was unfortunately lost to the British Empire about a century and a quarter ago, but in another sense she may come within the friendly circuit of English-speaking nations once more. She has entered the war as our ally, in defence of those ideals which are ours. She has proved herself possessed of the same conception of the liberties and rights of mankind as are the people of the British Empire, and it may be there is no need for any aspiration in the direction of bringing the English-speaking people of the United States once more within our fraternal circuit, seeing that realization has been reached by American assistance to our arms. There is need for the removal of those aspersions, which, in some quarters, still remain as a consequence of what took place a century and a quarter ago. It would be expecting too much to assume that members of the English-speaking race in the Home Country were always well received and well regarded by the people of the United States of America. There is not the slightest doubt that a very considerable number of English-speaking people in the Republic looked upon the average Englishman with a certain amount of dislike, regarding him as the representative of a <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> that had acted in a particularly inimical way to the interests of the early American colonists. I am hopeful that recent events in connexion with this war will remove that feeling, and I have no doubt that this motion will be taken as an indication on the part of the people of Australia of a desire to assist in engendering a better understanding between all sections of the United States of America and the people of the Motherland. Australia can render great service to the Empire by doing something in this direction, and, as the population of the United* States of America is likely to increase within the next century to something like 200,000,000 of people, there will be an increasing need for the representation of Australia at the capital of the great Republic. Indeed, it is inevitable that Australia, with an increasing trade volume with the United States, should be represented there. </para>
                    <para>There is talk, I understand, of the Commonwealth being represented in the countries of the East; in foreign territories inhabited by people who do not understand our language, and who do not even belong to our race. I emphasize the fact that, on the other side of the Pacific, there resides a population of 100,000,000 who speak our language, whose civilization, to the extent of 70 or 80 per cent, anyhow, is our civilization; whose outlook on life is ours, whose philosophers pursue the same line of thought as ours, and whose atmosphere is more akin to the national atmosphere of Australia than it is to the atmosphere of the Motherland. </para>
                    <para class="block">In these circumstances, surely, we must do our best to recognise, not only the practical needs of the situation, but the value of the sentiment embodied in such a motion as this.- </para>
                    <para>If it is good to have a High Commissioner representing Australia at the capital of the Empire I urge that it is equally necessary for this country to be represented at the capital of a Republic numbering 100,000,000 of English-speaking people. The United States of America is likely to become the strongest financial country in the world  after  this war; so, on financial grounds, we ought to be represented there. On the ground, also, that, to a certain extent perhaps unconsciously, we allied ourselves with that campaign of vituperation which was indulged in against President Wilson - and which the march of events has shown to bc wholly unjustified - we ought to be diplomatically represented at Washington, so that in the future there can be no misunderstanding between two great English-speaking peoples. We ought to be represented at the capital of that great and glorious American Republic, in which, if I may be permitted to paraphrase Bulwer Lytton, &#34;the antiquated institutions of European countries must, as we have done, earnestly seek their model, or, tremblingly, foresee their doom!&#34; The United States of America are progressing on the lines which the Australian Commonwealth must inevitably follow. Their interests are not divergent from ours, and, because of the racial and practical considerations involved in the progress of the two countries, I urge the Senate to adopt the motion which I have placed upon the notice-paper. </para>

                        <para>. - I have pleasure in seconding the motion. This matter was referred to previously in this chamber, but the action which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> now proposes to take was not then contemplated. It was discussed somewhat loosely before this war commenced, and, if now carried to this conclusion, it will have very much more value on that account. The subject was approached on that occasion apart altogether from the war, or the share which America is now taking in this great conflict. We debated it purely  from the stand-point of any advantage that would accrue to this country by the adoption of some such action as has been suggested. </para>

                    <para>It has been said that the appointment of an Australian representative at the capital of the United States of America will infringe all the usages of diplomacy; but I would point out that, while, under the existing arrangement, Australia is indirectly represented at every foreign court - including Washington - by an Ambassador, the United States of America is not content to have her interests in Australia safeguarded by her Ambassador in London, but is directly represented here by a Consul-General, and Vice-Consuls in every one of the States. While at present we may be conforming to the usages and customs of diplomacy, Australian interests are, to some extent, .prejudiced by the present arrangement regarding representation. It might be said that the motion will be a departure from the usages of the past; but I would prefer- such usages to be broken rather than that Australian interests at Washington should suffer. I support the motion particularly with the view of having our interests directly and sympathetically safeguarded. </para>

                        made reference to the  visit of the American Fleet to Australian waters some years ago, and of the welcome then accorded to- the naval representatives of the United States of America. That visit, I remind the Senate, was made for a very distinct and avowed purpose: We desired a closer friendship with the people of&#39; the United States of America, and the American Fleet was invited to our shores for the purpose of assisting in the insurance of our protection, and of making this island continent better known in America. During the recent . discussion upon conscription I heard some foolish men, who had seats in this Parliament, refer to the future of Australia, and assert that the Commonwealth could stand alone and fight her own battles against all comers. It was only quite lately that these foolish men gave voice to this equally foolish notion. We invited the American Fleet here some years ago for a well-understood purpose.
                    </para>
                    <para>While we have a population approaching 5,000,000 of people, charged with the government of an island continent, and while we have the British Fleet to protect us, it was then thought wise to have the goodwill of the American people, together with whatever aid its Fleet might give in a time of emergency. We spent something like &#163;100,000 upon the reception to the naval representatives of the Republic, in order to make our position here m&#39;OTe secure, perhaps, than it was. By passing this motion we shall be but taking a further step in the direction in which we advanced when we invited the American Fleet to visit Australia. </para>
                    <para>The motion proposes a closer friendship between the people of this continent and those of the same blood and speech who hold the United States of America to-day. There is no reason why a closer friendship should not be cultivated between these people. The affinity of blood and speech is one of the strongest of ties. It is quite true that it may lead to family quarrels, but blood is thicker than water, even in national affairs. The population of the United States of America possess the same ideals as ours, and are developing the huge area within their control under difficulties similar to those which we have to face to-day. They are trying to advance along the sinuous road of human progress, laboriously working their way up hill to a higher social level, just as we are doing here, and in all the circumstances it is only fitting that our people should seek a closer friendship with the people of the United States of America for our mutual advantage, if for no other purpose. We&#34; are entitled, by reason not only of the area and resources of the continent we occupy, but of our population, though it is comparatively small, to direct representation at Washington. Nations comprising far smaller populations than the population of Australia - such as Servia, Portugal, and the small independent State of Hayti, in the Caribbean Sea - are represented there. I could name a number of other nations representing a smaller population and controlling a smaller area than that of Australia which are to-day represented at Washington, </para>

                            <para>- That is so. &#39; Their importance is such that we may find in them a .sufficient ground for taking action in the direction indicated by the motion. The figures indicating the balance of trade between Australia and America are interesting and illuminating. They show that whilst America has been willing to sell commodities upon a continually increasing scale to us, for some reason or another she has nob been equally inclined to buy our commodities. A reference to the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Y ear-Book</inline> will show that during the period covering 1892 to 1895 3.8 per cent, of our total imports came from the United States of America. In 1912, 12 per cent, of our total  imports  came from America; and in 1915, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> 14 per cent, of our total imports were received from that country. I remind honorable senators that 14 per cent, of our total imports represents more than our import* from all other .countries put together, with the exception of the United Kingdom  and British Possessions. &#39; The lesson to be extracted from these figures i&#163; that in, a steadily-increasing ratio, during the last thirty years we have been buying from the people of the United States of America. The tendency has been in the other direction when we come to consider the purchase of our products by the people of the United States of America. During the period covering 1892 to 1895, America bought 3.8 per cent, of our exported products, but in 1909-13, after thirty years&#39; trading between the two countries, she bought proportionately less from us than she had done thirty years before. </para>

                            <para>- I see from the record that ti at is so, and gold figured largely. What is the inference to be drawn from these figures indicating the balance of trade between the two countries ? It is that for some reason or another the people of the United States have been enabled to unload their produce here far more successfully than we have been able to unload the produce of Australia in America. This, I think, may be admitted to be due to some extent to a want of knowledge on the part of the people of the United States of America of Australia and her resources. </para>

                    <para>No systematic effort has been made tlo let the American people know what we can produce in Australia. It is true that agents representing the different States have been sent to the United States at different times. I believe that New South Wales had a direct commercial agent in the United States, but it is not) unreasonable to assume that he was more particularly concerned about what New South Wales could sell to America than about what Australia as a whole could send to that country. He might from time to time lend a helping hand in making known the products of Australia as a whole, but his first and always important concern would be to see that whatever New South Wales could produce should find a readier sale in America than . the products of any other part of the Commonwealth. The other States of Australia have not been represented in America to the same extent as New South Wales. This shows the vital necessity for Australia, as the Americans say, &#34;to get a hustle on,&#34; if we desire that our products and resources shall be known in that great consuming country, with its 100,000,000 of people. </para>

We should have some person there to represent not one particular area of the Commonwealth, but the interests of the Commonwealth at large. On the ground of the balance of trade, in order to make Australia- better known in the United States, and particularly following the example of the United States in the appointment of Vice-Consuls in every State of the Commonwealth, we should move in the direction indicated by the motion. </para>

                    <para>It is an old maxim that trade, like water, will find its own level, but whilst that may be so there is such a thing as pushing trade. Although they are vastly superior in industrial methods to the people of any other country , the American people find it a most valuable aid in pushing their trade with the world to have men representing  them  abroad, tlo make known to every nation what the United States can produce. They have had their representatives in every country and in every State of the Commonwealth, whilst we have been represented only in a perfunctory way in the United States. f am not to be understood as suggesting that the advantage of the proposal will be all upon one side. So far from that, I agree with the mover of the motion that the appointment of a special representative of the Commonwealth at Washington would be mutually advantageous. I believe that the United States would stand to gain as much by the arrangement as would Australia. It would be an advantage to the United States tlo have here in the southern seas a friendly nation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roosevelt</inline> has referred to this country as &#34;the Giant Commonwealth of the &#34;South.&#34; There is no reason why we should not strengthen the ties which at present connect this Commonwealth of the South with the greater Commonwealth of the West, especially in view of the fact that we are people of the same blood and speak the same tongue. </para>

They have Possessions very close to our shores at the present time. The northern portion of this continent is closer to the American Possessions in the Philippines than are the Possessions of any other friendly nation. If at any time America desired a haven of refuge, coaling stations, trade advantages, or a friendly theatre for  her activities in the Pacific, she would find it in Australia if we took the initial step to bring about a condition of closer friendship with her. She has cast the Monroe doctrine deliberately to one side. She has entered into the sphere of world politics, and is now one of the strongest arbiters among the nations. It has been plain during the present war that there was no other country in the world whose friendship was so much courted, whose opinion was so much canvassed, as was thai of America. The Allies and their enemies alike took care that the latest information should be given to the American people, and their friendship was sought with greater earnestness than was the friendship of any other neutral nation. In view of the magnitude of the resources of our countries, their great area, and the fact that their populations are of the same stock, it is the most natural development in the world that our people should seek a closer .co-operation and a stronger bond of sympathy with each other. </para>

                    <para>We in this country are in a most dangerous position should a drawn battle be the result of the struggle in which we are at present engaged. I have repeatedly asserted that there is no part of the British Empire that is more perilously situated than is Australia unless we are victorious in this war. We secured possession of &#39;this continent some 130 years ago, and have made a marvellous advance in its colonization and reclamation. I suppose we have a better record to our name in the matter of colonization and reclamation than has any other population of the same number in the whole history of mankind. During this period, short as it has been inhuman history, we have had &#34;a very good time,,&#34; to put the matter in plain and homely language. We have been developing our destiny according to our own ideas untrammelled and unhampered by the happenings in any other part of the world. There have been upheavals in other parts of the world whilst we have been pursuing our lonely course, but they have not in the least interfered with Australia. The vibrations of the titanic struggle of the Peninsular War never reached these shores, nor did the Crimean War affect us ; But the present war did. Why? Because we realized at last that, though the Empire, of which we fora? a part, was vitally concerned in past wars, in this country the danger was approaching much closer to our doors than ever it did before. Why is it that we enjoyed this security? We enjoyed the security because the British Fleet has kept sailing round our island continent all these years, warding off all danger from us. </para>

                            <para>- Very well, sir, I will leave the matter at that. All that I want to emphasize is that this country has been lying under the shelter of a Power of greater strength than we ourselves could maintain, and that if that Power is threatened we shall need to look in another direction for a Power to take its place. I mention the terrible, the unthinkable, contingency of this European war ending in a draw. What will it mean to Australia if the British Fleet is withdrawn? As an alternative to its withdrawal we will find some help and succour in the carrying of this motion. That is the reason why I refer to the subject. I think that the reference is of value, because, if the war were to end in a draw and the British Fleet had to retire from these waters, a single shot would not be fired on our behalf, and Australia would have to stand alone. Are we not entitled, therefore, to look in another direction for help, comfort, and safety? That direction is where our friendship lies - the United States of America. </para>

                    <para>As regards our social ideals, why should we not cultivate a fuller knowledge? Of the numerous difficulties which confront Australia  at the present time, I have only one to mention, and that is the settlement of our population in the dry areas. That one alone should prompt us to keep in very close touch with the United States of America to-day. Up to a few years ago, the United States of America had only 5,000,000 people beyond its 197th parallel. Drawing a straight line down the continent, there were on one side 5,000,000 people, and to the east side of the line about 80,000,000 people. In Australia we have dry and arid districts. If we want to make this arid soil productive, and capable of bearing a population, we shall need in turn to look to the country from which we get the most and best information.

It teaches us the fact that it has successfully brought under cultivation, in its western zone, by means of artificial water, nearly 9,000,000 acres of land.

I &#39; believe that we cannot depend upon our case being adequately represented at Washington unless we have direct representation. &#34; I could enlarge considerably upon the necessity for appointing a representative, but I feel that the Senate is in a sympathetic mood, and is anxious that Australia should have the great benefit of competent representation at Washington, just as Washington has direct representation here.

                    <para>I wish to refer to a statement made this afternoon by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline> It was a statement of such serious import that I make no apology for correcting, at the earliest possible moment, the figures he gave. He quoted the figures from a paper, and therefore the main responsibility does not rest with him.  His  statement was that in connexion with the patriotic funds it was taking <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7</inline> to distribute <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5.</inline> Whether these are the exact figures he used or not, the proportion of expenditure was greatly in excess of what would appeal to one as being fair and reasonable. I have obtained the figures for various funds, and without giving honorable senators the details, for there are very many funds, I find that the expenses occasioned by the disbursements are less than 3 per cent. That is the average for eleven of the funds. There may be one or two other smaller funds of which I have not particulars, but as regards those eleven funds, which include all the large recognised funds throughout Australia, the cost of administration is 2.8 per cent. These figures, which I believe may be accepted as satisfactory, are certainly very much in contrast and conflict with the figures given by the paper from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> quoted to-day. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to bring under the notice of the Senate what appears to me to be an &#39;unsatisfactory state of affairs in the Pensions Branch of the Treasury Department, particularly so far as Queensland is concerned. I have received some particulars of the case of a man named Robert S. Webb, and I have no reason to doubt that the statements supplied to me are absolutely correct. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webb</inline> complains that he enlisted at Toowoomba on the 24th April, 1917, and was discharged from camp on the 28th June, 1917, as medically unfit, owing to an internal strain contracted in camp. He is 44 years of age, and married, with, one child5&#189; years old. He gave up his employment to enlist. He is now stranded and penniless, as he has received no pension or compensation from the Department. I contend that a man who enlists in the service of his country, and is injured in camp, has earned a pension. By enlisting when he did he endeavoured to do what he could on behalf of his country, and the fact that he got wounded in camp and not at the Front entitles him, I think, to the same consideration as a man who has gone to the other side of the world to fight. </para>

                    <para>I wish also to bring under the notice of the Senate the case of Trooper H. Lane, late of the 2nd Light Horse. He was invalided back to Australia from Gallipoli on account of a wound in the hip. He embarked in November, 1915. The medical officer reported favorably to Melbourne on the man&#39;s case, and he was passed as fit to return to duty. He reported himself at Camp Head-quarters, Enoggera, on the 17th January, 1916. He was then medically inspected at the camp by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Douglas,</inline> Australian Army Medical Corps, who rejected him as unfit for service on account of his wound. He was discharged, and joined the recruiting staff; his application for a pension being refused on account of his employment as a recruiting sergeant. In May, 1917, he interviewed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cornell,</inline> the pensions officer, and stated that he was willing to go back to the Front. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cornell</inline> sent him to the 6th Australian Garrison Hospital, Kangaroo Point, for the purpose of being examined by a Medical Board. The result of this examination was that Trooper Lane  was again rejected for active service. He states that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cornell</inline> then offered him a pension of 7s. 6d. per week, which he refused, as he considers that he is justly entitled to more. </para>
                    <para>In addition to these cases I have had numerous cases brought under my notice where men have been treated quite differently by the Pensions Office in Queensland. I know of one case in particular. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that these cases in particular have been brought under the Minister&#39;s notice. The Pensions Office in Queensland, to my mind, is not being conducted as it should be. I know of another case, in which a man was granted a pension, and subsequently obtained employment. After the lapse of a very brief period, however, he received ah intimation to the effect that his pension had been cancelled because he had secured employment. Yet in another case a man who has been granted a much bigger pension is still earning a larger income, and, apparently, is none the worse for his adventures abroad. </para>

                    <para>Mon should not be deprived of their pensions by reason of their employment in civilian life. Those pensions have nothing whatever to do with returned soldiers&#39; incomes. They are merely rewards for services which have been rendered. To my mind, the pension system should be put on. a proper basis, so that differential treatment may be eliminated. But if one man is going to receive 30s. per week by way of pension, and another man has to be content with a smaller sum, groat antagonism will be aroused, and a severe blow will bo struck at recruiting. I do hope that, so far as Queensland is concerned, an. inquiry will  he  made into the way in which pensions are allotted, with a view to preventing preferential treatment. </para>

                        has brought forward some matters which are certainly of interest. But, while he was speaking, I interjected, asking him whether he  had put those matters before the Minister. He replied that he had not. May I suggest now that he should do so ? In the first place, I think that the Minister has a right to be informed of cases which come under the notice of honorable senators, and which seem ito demand attention. If the facts are as he stated, I say unhesitatingly that the man who was injured in the Australian Imperial Force Camp, and was discharged before embarkation, is entitled to a pension. He stands in exactly the some position as does a man who has &#39;been abroad, and who has returned wounded. Therefore, it is simply a case of that man presenting himself before the proper authorities, and, if the facts are as stated, he will be entitled to his pension. Regarding the other case cited by the honorable senator, I know nothing of it personally, but I will see that the honorable senator&#39;s statements are placed before the Treasurer, who controls pensions, and also before the Minister for Defence, and I will invite them to inquire into the matter.

                    <para>During the course of his remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> suggested that there should be an amendment of the Pensions Act. I would remind him that in introducing the Repatriation Bill I outlined an amendment which will go a long way in the direction he&#39; indicated, though not, perhaps, all the way. On that occasion I pointed out that many men who - are incapacitated, and who know that their pensions  aTe  liable to revision, are disinclined to endeavour to improve their earning capacity, because they fear that as that earning capacity goes up, their pension . may go down. I indicated that the pension law might be. amended in that respect, and in such a way as to provide that after the expiration of six months their pensions could not be altered except in an upward direction. </para>
