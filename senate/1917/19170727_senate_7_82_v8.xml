                        <para>I have read <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall's</inline> remarks in the Senate yesterday regarding the issue of passports to women, and am in receipt of the letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Freeman</inline> which you forwarded. In that letter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Freeman</inline> makes certain statements which were not before the Department when her application was previously under consideration. The papers at that time disclosed no facts amounting to specially urgent reasons for an exception being made to the rule which prohibits (except in eases showing exceptional strong reasons, such as of health, or urgent domestic necessity) the travelling of women through the danger zone; but the assertions now put forward are such that I have decided to give consideration to the new facts stated. The officers in Sydney will be instructed to make inquiries, and I shall apprise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougallso</inline> soon as I have considered their report. </para>
                        <para>With regard to the honorable senator's remarks generally, it is incorrect to say that ladies are permitted to visit Great Britain for pleasure purposes. All cases of ladies who, from their application, appear to, or who may, have special justification for visiting Great Britain at the present time, are submitted to me personally, and have been the subject of very close and anxious consideration on my part. But you can assure the honorable senator that no discrimination whatever was made ' between classes of people, and certainly no passports have been granted when the object of the visit was believed to bo mere travelling For pleasure. </para>
                        <para>The case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Holman,</inline> to which special allusion is made by the honorable senator, ' affords no illustration of a departure from our rules. The facts are: <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Holman</inline> applied for a passport to Great Britain; her application was strongly pressed, but, in view of the Secretary of State's instructions referred to, I declined to authorize the issue of a passport to England. <inline font-style="italic">At</inline> that time there were no restrictions on women travelling to Ceylon, and when a request was made to me to issue pass- ports to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Holman</inline> and her sister for Colombo, I saw no reason why they should not be granted. The responsibility for the extension of her passport beyond Ceylon does not rest with this Government. </para>

                            <para>- There is no ground for the suggestions. The position is that there is a prohibition against the issue of passports, ' except in very special circumstances, to ladies wishing to travel through the danger zone. There is no prohibition against ladies going to Ceylon. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Holman</inline> applied for a passport to Colombo, which was granted to her, as it would be to anybody else who applied. That was not one of the prohibited places, and any woman is entitled to put in a similar application. </para>

                        <para>. - In moving the second reading of this Bill yesterday, the Honorary Minister gave to the Senate the assurance that it is not to be considered as the first instalment of the bulk handling system. Having had that assurance, I  wish to know whether he is of the opinion that the States arc going to continue the Pool system when we have returned to normal times in Australia? But, whether he is of that opinion, or not, I predict that when Australia does return to her normal conditions, the Wheat Pool will be a thing of the past. </para>

                            <para>- I venture the opinion that, within four months of this day, under normal conditions, the new wheat crop of Australia will be in progress of being harvested. I predict that, if this Bill should be passed through all its stages here to-day, very few of the proposed silos will be fit to be occupied before the new crop becomes available. If, however, the new crop should be available to the silos, I hold that i't would not only be folly, but sheer madness, on the part of the Government to put into a silo one grain of the wheat which is already stacked. Why ? Because a large part of that wheat will have been in stack for two years, and the greater portion have been stacked for one year. We are told that, after, wheat has been in stack for two years, it more or less deteriorates in' value. To put old wheat into the silos when new wheat was available would, I repeat, be nothing short of madness. Therefore, the stacks now in existence the bulk of the wheat has already been sold to the Imperial Government - will have to remain where they are, whether silos are built or not. </para>

                            <para>- I am telling the honorable senator what I know is an absolute fact;. If I cannot believe what I have seen with my own eyes, I am not going to believe any other authority. I know that in some districts there are wheats which, if put in normal condition in a bottle and sealed, weevil will make its appearance in the bottle. Irrespective of what the Honorary Minister has said, this can easily be put to a test at any time he likes. He must recognise that, if wheat stacks two years old are likely to be attacked with weevil, it will be a thousand times better for the wheat to remain in stack than to be put into a silo. Why? Because, if the stacks are attacked by weevil, then, in the breaking down of the stacks, the weevily portion can be dealt with separately, and the other wheat can be dealt with on its own ; whereas, if the old wheat is placed in silos, and has to be aerated, as the Minister explained yesterday, I venture this opinion that, if the wheat is attacked by weevil in the silos, the second state of the wheat will be a long way worse than its first state. By the revolving of weevily wheat through a silo, not only would you have one corner weevily, but you would have weevil throughout the silo. No one recognising these facts would think of putting the old wheat into the silos. </para>

Wheat can be stored in bags and preserved for a lengthened period, so long as they are protected from the weather. I venture the opinion that if it had not been for the mice plague we should have seen nothing of this Bill. The Assistant Minister does not deny that statement. I tell the honorable senator that, before the ink of the signature of the Governor-General assenting to this measure is dry, the mice plague of 1917 will be a thing of the past. This is not the first time that Australia has been visited by a mice plague. Twenty-three or twenty-four years ago we suffered from such a plague. The mice were so bad at that time that they were even eating live pigs in their sties.

Once that . plague disappeared there were no mice to be seen for quite a number of years. I. believe that when the present plague has run its course Australia will be free from the mice plague for a number of years to come. When "the first plague occurred some people in South Australia, being under the impression that there would be a regular recurrence of the plague, had their sheds protected by the erection of mouse-proof fencing. This was simply done by putting up plain iron fences around the bottom of the sheds. This made the sheds absolutely mice proof. As there was no reappearance of the plague the fences were kept in order only for a few years, and most of them were not in a condition of repair when the plague reappeared this year. This is characteristic of the Australian people. </para>

                    <para>We have had experience of many droughts in Australia, and when one overtakes us we say that we shall be able to combat a drought should one overtake us again. Our experience, however, has been that, when a drought does overtake us, we are just as unready as ever to deal with it. Perhaps it is just as well that our people should be so forgetful of these things, as otherwise they would be in trouble all their lives. Before I left South Australia on the last occasion, to attend the Senate, I met a gentleman who is a resident of one of the mice-infested districts of the State, and he gave me his assurance that there is now not a mouse to be seen in the district. This is a sign of the disappearance of the present plague. It is not remarkable .that the mice plague should have caused greater ravages to our wheat than upon any previous occasion, because this year we have had greater stacks of wheat for the mice to work upon. This is no reason why the Government should introduce panic legislation involving the expenditure of £2.850,000 for silos to protect wheat against the ravages of mice. This is asking intelligent men to do an unreasonable thing. Let me tell honorable senators that much of the damage that has been caused to our wheat, as a result of the mice plague, is due to the fact that our wheat has been protected from the weather by roofing nailed to the stacks, and not by roofs independent of the stacks themselves. Under the system of roofing which has been adopted as soon as the  mice attacks the stacks they take away the support of the roofs. The stacks sagging because of the ravages of the mice cause the roofs to sag, and so make channels which, in wet weather, run the water into the wheat. The best way in which to save the wheat as much as possible is, therefore, to immediately remove the roof of a stack which has been attacked by the mice. If the stacks had been protected by the erection of independent roofing the damage done by the mice would have been unimportant. </para>
                    <para>I agree with the Honorary Minister that there  is much greater danger to Australian wheat from the ravages of the weevil than from the mice, but  I do not agree with him that it is possible to prevent damage by weevil by the establishment of silos. The very last thing that should be done is to put old wheat j.J.to the silos. Let me remind hon.orable senators that if the ravages of the mice nad not, been so serious as to justify the statement that our wheat stacks have suffered from, a mice plague, the agents, who have control of the wheat, would have been responsible for the whole of the damage. As it has been accepted by those, in authority that the damage has been caused by a plague, the agents have been relieved of responsibility for that damage. If the Commonwealth Government now propose to come to the assistance of the agents by the expenditure of £2,850,000 on the erection of silos, I say that the protection of our wheat could be secured for a very great deal less than that sum by the erection of shelter sheds with roofs independent of the stacks. Such sheds would be all that would be necessary, and they would last practically for all time. </para>

                    <para>I should like to point out that the wheat held in stacks by the Pool amounts to no less than 145,000,000 bushels. By the time the proposed silos are erected, we shall have reaped another harvest from what, it is admitted, is likely to be a normal crop, and this will give us another 145,000,000 bushels. That being the case, before the new crop is harvested we shall have sufficient storage accommodation for only one-third of that crop, without providing storage for a single grain of the 145,000,000 bushels of wheat already in the hands of the Government. If we adopt the bagging system for two-thirds of our wheat production, and silo only one-third of it, obviously the cost of the dual system will be much greater than that of a single system. That fact has been pointed out to the Prime Minister by the Farmers and Settlers Association of South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, they will cost a great deal more than they would in normal times. Yet to-day there is an enormous quantity of iron belonging to the Wheat Pool which' for a tithe of the expenditure proposed could be put into roofs over our wheat stacks, thus preserving the grain just as effectually as it can be preserved in silos. Fort this reason I think that the Senate should reject the Bill and impress upon the Government the wisdom of expending this money in the erection of rain-proof sheds throughout Australia. If the measure be carried, South Australia has emphatically declared that she will not adopt the system of bulk handling. </para>

                            <para>- It will not be the law. Only yesterday the Minister stated that any State will be at liberty to decline to come into the scheme. I trust, too, that the Commission to be appointed under the Bill will be authorized to empower any State to expend its share of this money, to be advanced by the Commonwealth, in structures other than silos. I am quite aware that the measure provides that a State may erect temporary structures. That provision, however, is absolutely worthless, because no Commission would sanction advances to a State for the erection of temporary structures. The structures must be of a permanent character before any State can hope to secure assistance from the Wheat Pool. Then clause 8 of the Bill provides that the money shall be spent in the erection of silos. It is obvious, therefore, that a State which does not favour the silo system will not be able to participate in this scheme. </para>

                    <para>I trust that if the Bill gets into Committee the amendments that have been outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rowell</inline> will be adopted. If I for a moment believed that this scheme is a practicable one, I should be the very last to offer opposition to it. But any honorable senator, by devoting half-a-dozen hours of his time to an investigation of our wheat stacks, can conclusively prove that where wheat has been protected against the weather, and has not been attacked by mice, it is in as good a condition to-day as it was two years ago. I do not ask for any greater evidence than I can see with my own eyes. If honorable senators choose to do so, they can soon convince themselves that wheat can be preserved just as effectually under an iron roof as it can be in a silo, and that Australia is, therefore, not justified in sanctioning the expenditure of £2,850,000 upon the erection of silos for this purpose. I hold in my hand a letter from the representatives of all the farming districts of South Australia, stating that some amendments should be made in the Bill in the direction I have indicated. That communication: states - </para>
                    <para>The money apportioned to South Australia should be spent in the erection of further rainproof sheds, which can be made mice proof when required, and which experience has shown meets the requirements of this State. </para>
                    <para>That letter is signed by Laurence O'Loughlin, H. D. Young, John E. Pick, Peter Allen, Wm. Angus, David James, and W. Miller, and, to my mind, it ought to speak most eloquently to honorable senators. Its signatories are all men who have made a life study of the wheat business, and they recognise that grain can be preserved in a rain-proof shed quite as effectually as it can be under any  other system. I repeat that the ravages caused by mice to our wheat stacks would have been infinitesimal if the roofs over those stacks could have been kept intact, and the stacks themselves had been protected from the weather. It was the fact of the roofs having to be removed, thus permitting weather ' influences to operate, which was responsible for the major portion of the damage that has been done. </para>
                    <para>I believe that the Honorary Minister, on reflection, will recognise, that if the course which I have outlined had been followed, 75 per cent, of the damage sustained by our wheat stacks this . year would have been obviated. That being so, I fail to see how he can ask Parliament to sanction the expenditure of such a large sum upon the erection of silos to provide storage accommodation for only a small portion of our wheat crop. I say, unhesitatingly, that if weevil attack grain in a silo, and that grain is going to be aerated, the sooner it is taken out of the silo the better, because the moment that wheat is revolved the weevil will be distributed throughout the whole of it. At the present time, however, if weevil attack our wheat stacks, the affected grain can be isolated, and the sound grain treated  independently. That fact is indisputable. In the circumstances, I hope that Ministers will pause before asking the Senate to pass this Bill. I shall certainly oppose it. </para>

I realize that, to some extent, South Australia cannot very well come into line with the other States upon the question of the bulk handling of wheat. But, judging from the honorable senator's remarks, and from the speeches which have been made elsewhere, South Australia is not by any means free of dangers that are ahead. Speaking in the other branch of the Legislature, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton</inline> referred to various stacks in South Australia, notably to one at Glencairn South, where he affirmed that stacks had been built from 20 to 25 feet high. </para>

I recognise that we cannot possibly couple this scheme with the question of the bulk handling of wheat, and I sympathize with the Honorary Minister in the embarrassing position that he occupied in introducing this Bill. But I think that every honorable senator will admit that1 the scheme which is embodied in the measure represents the first instalment of the system of the bulk handling of wheat. So far, Victoria is the only State that has gone into this matter in a systematic manner </para>

It is true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> says, that there are not many weevils in them yeh, or not many signs of weevil, but directly the warm weather comes in, not only will those stacks in South Australia be attacked, but. the 4,000,000 bags that have such a handsome appearance at Geelong may be seriously affected also by the pest. The Geelong stacks consist of bags that have been sent from various parte of the State, but the wheat has been re-bagged and re-stacked to a great extent. Let there be no mistake about it, when the warm weather comes the weevils are going to make their appearance, and "unless we take means beforehand to cope with those destructive vermin we shall lose millions of pounds' worth of wheat. </para>

                            <para>- The greatest opposition to the bulk handling system has come from farmers who profess to know all about it j but I notice that the very men who were so much opposed to the system some years ago are most in favour of it now. In Victoria the farmers as a whole are now sympathetic towards bulk handling, because they see that it is not possible to produce wheat satisfactorily, and to an advantage, if the present system is continued. The only improved method that commends itself to them, so far as safety is concerned, is the bulk handling system. The Minister, no- doubt, had in his mind when he moved the second reading of the Bill, the idea that something must be done, but he did not indicate whether he intended to treat the wheat in the way I have indicated, and it seemed to me that the reason why he did not express his views <inline font-style="italic">\o</inline> the Senate on that question was the fear that he might create some panic and anxiety in the minds of producers that all was not well with their wheat. If we can point out some way by which we can save their wheat during the years to come, and safeguard their interests, it is our duty to do so. Honorable senators can point to no other method by which that can be done. It may be suggested that we can build sheds and put the wheat1 in them, but that will not save it should the weevil attack it. If it does, they will find that they have in those sheds in a year's time nothing but husks. </para>

                        <para>.- Whilst the Senate will always pay attention to men in the wheat trade, and try to gather from them the prevailing opinions of those interested in the business, I cannot altogether agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon's</inline> forecast of the future results of the Wheat Pool. If I thought the Pool was to become a thing of the past, and the Government was to have no hand in the wheat trade of Australia in the future, I question very much whether we should be justified in making the preparations that we propose to make with the £3.000,000 mentioned in the Bill. </para>

                    <para>My own  opinion  is that we are just at the beginning of the organization of our wheat trade, and I have come to that conclusion after having visited Canada last year, and seen the enormous organization of the wheat trade of that country. Until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon, Senator Plain,</inline> and other Australian wheat-growers or traders go to those countries where the bulk handling system is in vogue, they can have very little idea of the want of organization in Australia. Our isolation is making us quite parochial and narrow-minded in our views. That is always one of the evils of an isolated country. Canada is quite close to the United States of America, and practically for trade purposes one nation with them. The United States of America and Canadian experiences are working side' by side, so that everything that is possible and new in the trade is there seen in operation. Australia is the  only big wheat-producing country in the world where the bagging system prevails. We are still where we began a hundred years ago. We have not advanced one step beyond the methods of our grandfathers. </para>

                            <para>- The very fact that we are further away from our market should be an inducement to us to adopt the most economical way of handling wheat. All the members of the Parliamentary party, which visited Canada last year, had ample opportunities for getting information, and I think the testimony given by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Borden, the Prime Minister of Canada, accurately represents the opinion of all the other men interested' in the wheat trade. In the present, measure it is proposed to provide silos for 50,000,000 bushels, and to build elevators with a capacity of only from 25.000 to 50,000 bushels: and perhaps, as our trade is so much smaller than that of Canada, these will be large enough. It is quite possible that under normal conditions this will be sufficient for a number of years to come, because I noticed that Montreal, which is claimed to be the largest wheat port  in the world, had only three big elevators - one controlled by the Harbor Commission, and the other two by the Grand Trunk Railway - and that these elevators had a total capacity of 8,000,000 bushels. I do not know if it is wise .to build elevators with a small bushel capacity; but, if so, it seems strange that in Canada, where the wheat merchants ought to know their business, the smallest elevator I saw was at Quebec, and it had a capacity of 1,000,000 bushels. In my opinion, as far as the principle of bulk-handling is concerned, we may be quite safe in adopting the Government proposal, because we will simply b« following the precedent of all the other great wheat-producing countries of  the  world. During my visit to Montreal, Quebec, Toronto, Calgary, and Winnipeg, I was assured  that  the cost of handling wheat in bulk at the port of shipment was only 1 cent per bushel. I am not in a position to say what the cost is in Australia under the bagging system, but I am quite sure that it must be much more expensive than the Canadian method, and, moreover, the work is arduous and the men engaged in it are properly entitled to good wages. In Canada, all the latest methods for handling the wheat have been adopted. The grain is taken from the harvester in the field, put into a box waggon and carried to the railway station, and by simply pulling. a bolt it is dumped into bins. "Upon arrival at the port of shipment, pneumatic pumps are attached to the railway waggons, and the grain is pumped straight into the vessel's hold at the rate of from 10,000 to 12,000 bushels per hour, so that a vessel mav be fully loaded in a very short time. </para>

They had no idea that our wheat was handled in this way. In the face of the experience of  every  big wheat-producing country in the world, we shall be quite justified in adopting the silo or elevator system for the handling of our grain. </para><para class="block">The mice plague and the weevil pest have combined to force "this matter under our attention lately, and I might inform the Senate that only the other day the New South Wales farmers in conference carried a resolution approving of the bulk handling- system as well as of the Wheat Pool. I cannot conceive that any body of men, who in the past have been robbed of a great deal of the fruits of their labour by the competitive system, should ever revert to the old method for the disposal of their produce. For the first time in the history of Australia the marketing of our wheat has been placed upon a sensible basis, under which the producers are assured of a fair return, and I cannot imagine that they will readily go back to the old system. In view of the probable developments of the wheat trade, these silos will be required for the safe storage of wheat so that it may be marketed at the most opportune time; and the fact that there has been so much destruction by mice of late is sufficient to warrant the construction of silos. If, however, I thought that the farming community would revert to the old competitive method for the disposal of their produce, and allow themselves to be used by those who are able to corner the wheat market for their own advantage, and to the disadvantage of the farmers, I do not know that I would support the measure now before the Senate. This is a most important industry, and it is essential we should follow the example set us by the United States of America, Canada, Russia, and all the other big wheat-producing countries of the world. Wheat-growing and wool production are together bringing millions of pounds into Australia, and it is important, therefore, we should give these industries our very best attention, because for many years after the war our wheat will be  very  much required by Great Britain, France, Italy, and other allied belligerent Powers. According to the best authorities in the wheat trade, there will be a splendid market for many years to come. </para><para>I hope that this measure is intended merely as the first instalment of the bulk-handling system, and that before long we will install the necessary machinery at all our principal wheat centres for the handling of our wheat in the cheapest manner. If this is done, we shall be able to release a large number of workmen from what is at present an arduous occupation, and to find more congenial employment for them in other directions. We all remember the outcry made some years ago against the big wheat sack, and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman</inline> is justly entitled to all the credit he received for the introduction of the 200-lb. bag; but I would say, let us do away altogether with the bagging system, and, for the future, handle our grain by machinery. </para><para>

                        (South Australia) [12.14]. - I can understand the anxiety of the Government with regard to the protection . of wheat at present stored in Australia, and I take it that the erection of silos is regarded as the first step in the introduction of the bulk handling system; but, so far as my own State is concerned, this system is objected to, I believe, by 90 per cent, of the people interested in the wheat trade. I do not think we have had sufficient information to demonstrate that bulk handling can be successfully employed for long-distance carrying. The weevil pest is the principal difficulty. The mice plague, from which we are now suffering, recurs only at intervals : but the weevil trouble is always present to a greater or less degree, and I do not think it has ever been proved that we can carry wheat in bulk from Australia to the Old Country without the cargoes being seriously affected by weevil. I remember, once, when weevil appeared in a cargo of wheat shipped to England, one of the leading merchants who made inquiries as to the cause assured me that it was due to the fact that the grain had been shipped in a somewhat green condition.
                    </para><para>I have no objection to bulk handling and the erection of silos in those States which may wish to introduce the system; and if the Minister will give me an assurance that he is prepared to accept two slight amendments which I have indicated, I shall not have much more to say on the subject. So far as South Australia is concerned, the people interested in the wheat trade will not agree to bulk handling for some years to come. I would like to know whether the Honorary Minister is prepared to accept the few slight amendments I have indicated, It would mean in our State that we could erect sheds with the money so advanced to protect the whole of our wheat. However, it seems that the Government are determined to go on with their own scheme, and I am not prepared to offer further opposition to the Bill. </para></speech>

                        <para>. - The question of temporary or permanent storage has arisen. I wish to make it quite clear that the silos proposed to be erected- can readily be adapted to the bulk handling system, which I believe the majority, if not all, of the States will adopt subsequently. Therefore, it-, will be an advantage to use the silo form of storage. I want to point out again that this storage is not necessary because of the mice. I believe that, as the result of our experience, we now have an effective means of dealing with mice. This wheat has been stored for nearly two years, and, unfortunately, we are not optimistic enough to believe that we are going to get it taken away. It is to prevent the old wheat from becoming weevily and consequently deteriorating in value to a considerable extent that we are so anxious to provide - silos. In my opinion, quite a considerable amount of additional temporary storage will have to-be found before we can get our wheat taken away. But that is no reason why we should waste money by erecting temporary storage. Suppose that the war were to conclude at the end of ' two or three years, what would be' the value of the assets ? We would not get a twentieth part of their value then. Our desire is to lessen the cost, and we believe that the silos will return to us their full value. Suppose that the war should continue for five years, I have no hesitation in saying that the silos, under proper care, will not have depreciated by ½ per cent. Therefore, we shall have the full asset for another purpose. </para>

The facts as to the condition of our wheat are well known in the Old Country, and that has been very helpful to us in disposing of our products. If a report goes to the Old Country that the wheat we have here at the present time is depreciating, what hope shall we have of selling next year's crop? To-day we have only one customer for our wheat. The British Government must buy our wheat for the Allies, otherwise we cannot sell it. If the news is conveyed to the British Government that the wheat we have already sold them is rapidly deteriorating, and that some of it will be of.' <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> value to them, what a cheek we would have to ask them to buy our wheat in the future under such conditions !

                            <para>.- I think that the representatives of South Australia ought to have a little co-operative meeting to see what it wants. This paragraph was put in the clause at the suggestion of a South Australian and . with the approval of the Prime Minister. We made this concession to South Australians, who evidently desired to do something in that direction. </para>

                            <para>- I am pointing out that what South Australians in an-, other House fought for and won, South Australians in the Senate are attempting to destroy. It is a very sound proposal. In my opinion, as I said yesterday, one-third storage is not going to be sufficient for the protection of our wheat, and other additional storage, which may be of a lighter character, will, in selected places, have to be adopted on account of the difficulty of transporting the wheat. This paragraph simply enables the Commission to arrange with the Governments of the respective States for the erection of such other temporary structures as may be found necessary. We estimate that at the end of January or February next there- will be nearly 6,000,000 tons of wheat in the hands of the Pool. We perceive the position in regard to shipping. If it is apparent that the shipping difficulty will continue, and that we cannot transport wheat, this provision will enable us to call a conference of the States, and perhaps to arrange to spend another million on the erection of temporary storage, which subsequently would be of no use for wheat.- If such temporary storage were used for three or four years, it would become a second, or third, or fourth class asset. The State would receive little or no money for the material. That is really the difference between silos and temporary structures. The charge for a silo can be, extended over a period of fifty years. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that the charge to the farmer will be practically nothing for the first few years. The storage in the silos, which will be of permanent construction, will probably bo charged over the whole crop, and not merely over a third, because each farmer's lot cannot be separated. 1 want to charge collectively the Australian, Pool with' as much per bushel on all their wheat as will cover the interest and whatever depreciation may be decided upon as sound. Honorable senators know what the depreciation in value of the silos is likely to be. It practically means that we shall have little more to pay than the interest on the total cost. I have no hesitation in saying that it will be the lightest storage  charge ever made in any part of the world. </para>

                            <para>- This Bill will not create the management. In all probability the ultimate management will be taken over by the Wheat Board. Subsequently it is intended, should the pool system die out, that each State should assume charge of its own wheat, and take over the responsibility for the debt. This scheme is intended to cover the war period. I believe it is essential to the success of the Pool. </para>

I remind him that should his amendment be carried, it will have the effect of altering what is practically a contract between the Commonwealth and the States, and will make it necessary to return the measure to the House of Representatives. The matter is urgent, and we desire to go on with the work.

The object of this is to prevent any contract being drawn up in such a way as to  give a preference to any one holding patent rights. I happen to have before me an advertisement published by the Victorian Government calling for tenders for the erection of silos, and this is one of the conditions laid down - </para>

                            <para>- I should, like to make the matter quite clear. Under the tender system, all firms, including those who have patent rights, will be able to tender. But in calling for tenders, we do not say that the silos must be constructed in accordance with a particular patent. To do so would make it certain that the work must be given to the holders of that patent. All persons are asked to submit tenders, and those possessing patents will have the same opportunity as others. </para>

                (South Australia) [12.40]. - In my opinion, the system proposed by the Government for carrying out the repatriation scheme is the right one. I have listened with attention to the debate upon this clause, and it has appeared to me that some honorable senators seem to forget that the practical working out of the scheme will be largely in the hands of the State Boards. The amendment proposes . the reduction of the number of members of the Repatriation Commission from seven to three. I think it is better that there should be a Commission of seven members, and that, there should be a representative of each State on the Commission. It may be somewhat) expensive to bring representatives from the different States to carry out the work of the Commission- but -it will be a council of advice to the Government, and I think that it would be better that each State should be represented upon it. The able-bodied amongst our returned soldiers will not require charity. What they will probably look for is to be replaced in the occupations which they followed before they went to the war. I agree that everything possible should be done for those who are wounded or mentally afflicted. In my view, a very small percentage of the men will be willing to go upon the land if they have not been on the land before. As a producer, and one who has worked on the land all his life, I think the best means to be adopted to settle returned soldiers on the land would be to place them on small dairy farms from which they might derive some return almost as soon as they started work. I intend to support the clause as it stands.

                    <para>. -  During the early part of this discussion I intimated that I favoured the creation of a central Commission consisting of three paid men, rather than a Commission of seven, . who would act in an honorary capacity. When I made that statement, I had not heard the declaration of the Vice-President of the Executive Council on this question. Having listened attentively to what he said, I am now convinced that the functions of the central Commission will be very different from what I had anticipated. I was under the impression that that body would be responsible for giving effect to the repatriation scheme. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, however, has explained that it will merely be an  advisory body called in to assist him in administering the scheme whenever he may require such assistance. In view of his statement, I am no longer prepared to support the creation of a central Commission of three members, nor can I favour the appointment of- paid members. In view of all the circumstances, I do not think that seven commissioners would be too many to appoint, and I am inclined to think that they should act in an honorary capacity. I am also satisfied, after mature reflection, that the Minister will be able to secure, in an honorary capacity, the services of persons whose services would not be available if they were to receive payment for them. I take it that the Commission will hold its meetings in Melbourne. That being so, I should be glad to see one of the leading business men of Australia appointed to it. Obviously he will require to be a man either from Sydney or Melbourne. </para>

The services of such a man could not be permanently secured for any payment.

                        <para>- I have no intention of reflecting upon them. - I merely say that the type of man I have in my mind can be most readily secured either from New South Wales or Victoria. The proposal of the Government will afford the Vice-President of the Executive Council an opportunity of securing on this Commission the services of one of the ablest business men in Australia. A great deal has been said to the effect that there is too much red-tape about our Government Departments, and that they are not conducted on business lines. The Government proposal will enable the Minister who is in charge of repatriation matters to secure the services of one of the ablest business men in Australia in an honorary capacity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> certainly delivered a very admirable speech on this question, and one which, I am sure, was of great assistance to honorable senators. However, I chiefly rose to put  before the "Committee the reasons which have influenced me to reverse the vote that I had intended to cast upon this ma'tter. </para>

                    <para>. - When progress was reported yesterday, I was referring to a suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">-Senator Fairbairn</inline> that only the services of gentlemen acting in an honorary capacity, and influenced by patriotic motives, should be accepted on the central Commission which it is proposed to appoint. Under this Bill we are asked to determine the procedure to be adopted for the repatriation of our soldiers, of whom I hope at least 300,000 will return. Now it is proposed to appoint a Commission to assist in the administration of this scheme, and the necessity for appointing only business men to that body has been strongly stressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas.</inline> He has affirmed that we should secure only the services of men who have made a success of their businesses, and who have established a great industry. By virtue of that circumstance, he claims that only such gentlemen are qualified to act on the Commission. I do not know how many businesses <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has built up in Australia. I am not aware that he is at the head of any great business, but I do know that he is a member of this Parliament, and, in that capacity, is assisting to determine the destinies of Australia. He was elected, not because he has been a successful business man, but because he is possessed of a fund of common sense. Now, if men can be returned to the National Parliament who have not proved great successes as business men, surely it ought not to be impossible to find gentlemen who will be willing to assist the Minister in charge of this Bill to give effect to this repatriation scheme, who have not been successful business men. </para>

                        <para>- No. I am merely replying to a chorus of statements by honorable senators opposite since I submitted my amendment. They have pinned their faith to the appointment of only business men to this Commission. Whilst I would welcome the presence of such men there, I am not prepared to admit that they are the only persons qualified to act upon that body. We must not confine our search for men to assist the Government in restoring our returned soldiers to civilian life, to that particular section of the community. Yesterday the Vice-President of the Executive Council stated that several business men had offered their services on the Commission. I understood him to say that he had been offered the services of the head of the greatest Labour organization in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Then this Bill can be of no importance whatever, notwithstanding the statements made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council when moving its second reading. I imagine that any gentleman who is the head of a Labour organization will have quite enough to. do if he focusses his attention upon the affairs of that organization. Similarly, a successful business man will be sufficiently occupied in looking after the business which he has built up. It is not likely that he would allow the time that he devoted to this Commission to interfere with the success of his business, and to allow it to fall into decay. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the Committee will disabuse its mind of the idea that the Commission can do successful work only if composed of men who have been successful in business. Whether the Commission consists of seven or three, I will welcome on it the best brains that can ,be obtained in Australia ; but there are in Australia men who have not been successful in building up big businesses, but are yet capable of carrying out this work. The Minister laid emphasis on the necessity of making the commissioners honorary; but for some time past there has been a Repatriation Committee, one of whose members has been acting in an honorary capacity to the extent of two guineas per day. That is more than £12 per week. </para>

                        <para>- But the point is that they are allowed expenses. If a Commission of seven is appointed, and the suggestion of honorable senators is adopted that there should be a man from each State, they will get expenses, and a very big expense indeed will be incurred under the cloak of " honorary services " - I had almost said honorariums. Let us be honest and say that so many men - seven, five, or three - shall be appointed; but that they shall be paid. I think they should be paid well. The work is too important to allow men to divide their time between it and their private occupations. They should centre their minds on it. The Minister said they would be engaged only in an advisory capacity, but the Bill is not definite in that regard. If. that is the intention of the Government, they should state it in the Bill in black and white. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator knows perfectly well that he is not working for nothing.  He is too wide awake for that. He can also bring to his assistance, as a staff, officers from other branches of the Commonwealth Service. I think a few can be spared from different Departments. The Commission itself should be permanent, should be paid, and should not consist of so many as seven. We shall get more benefit from a Commission of that nature than from a casual one, as is suggested in the Bill. It is imperative that a returned soldier should be on the Commission. </para>

                    <para>. - I have not heard one sound argument why the Commissioners should be paid. It is very inadvisable to increase the number of paid officials, for I have, a horror of the paid bureaucracies that are springing up in the Commonwealth . One of the most serious dangers of a democratic community like this is that it cannot have its affairs run without men being paid. I am astonished at the source from which the amendment has emanated. We can find the very best examples of voluntarism and self-sacrificing work in the very movement ' that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> at present represents. It was built up by those who gave their time and money, and many of them their lives, for the Labour cause when it was on a voluntary basis ; and the curse of it, and this has brought it to its present position, is the number of paid bureaucracies that are running it in every State. The same applies to other institutions. We should limit the choice of the Minister to a very great extent if we agreed to the appointment of paid officials. There are at present 'quite a large number of excellent men in every State well fitted to fill positions on the Commission, and also on the State Boards. Quite a number of them will be willing and pleased to give all their abilities to the work of looking after the affairs of returned soldiers, and I think they would do it in a much more humane and better spirit than would paid officials. From my own experience in many movements of a voluntary nature, I have found that where you have a good committee you will always get the best work done. I am anxious to see this great work of repatriation well carried out. At present, there is a great deal of empty sentiment and a great deal of fatherly talk about returned soldiers that is quite unnecessary. There is a great deal of gallery business at the present time, both in regard to returned soldiers and to the general public; and I am most anxious to see this important subject put on a permanent business basis. By that I do not mean a cold, commercial cent, per cent, basis, because I want to see it carried out with all the humane feeling that a man would naturally have towards returned soldiers. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. The Minister has already expressed his willingness to include two returned soldiers. That is a very fair proportion on a commission of seven. Those two will be quite able to represent the feelings of the returned men, and the other five will be able to look after the affairs of the public, who, after all, are the main persons concerned. All the work that has been done voluntarily during the war has shown that this work can be done well on the same basis. I know that in -many instances voluntarism has been more or less a failure ; but in a case of this kind, with a definite work and a definite object, and with a limited number of men to deal with,' there is no reason why it should not be a complete success. Throughout the Commonwealth it will be found that the institutions which have been best looked after are those which' have a voluntary council <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> committee. The sooner we recognise that our country demands the best we can give it, whether we are paid for our services or not, the better it will be for the nation. If the Government stand firm in this matter, I am sure the clause will be carried as it stands by both Houses, and the Commission and State Boards will be constituted of business men with financial and organizing ability, who are only too willing to give their services voluntarily for the benefit of those who have gone forth from this country and sacrificed their all in its defence. I have seen so often the dangers involved in the appointment of paid officials that I shall enter my protest every time against any proposal to increase their numbers. </para>

                        <para>- They are getting quite strong enough. The voluntary system in this case will give the Minister a much wider field of choice, because there are dozens of men throughout the Commonwealth eminently suited for this work who would not take it if the positions were paid. They would not neglect their businesses to take the work on. As the Minister said, men of that kind could meet in the afternoons or evenings, and do the work in a business-like way, and do it, too, much more humanely than paid officials would. I have a dread of the paid official system, and would not have it mixed up with the returned soldiers. I quite understand the position that the representatives of the Labour party opposite take up; but I should like to appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> and those associated with him not to press the paid business too much, and to look where they are at present. I think they will then recognise that the sooner we have the system worked by men who are willing to give their best to the community, the better it will \ for the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>: - I am sorry I was misunderstood by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll</inline> when I spoke on this subject yesterday afternoon. He represented me as saying that the three members of the Commission should be returned soldiers. I did not say anything of the sort, and I was very glad to find, on getting my <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof this morning, that what I did say reached uie official reporter at the table. I find that he recorded exactly- what I said - that there were returned soldiers, to my knowledge, who were capable of undertaking these positions. I say that now. I had eight long weeks on the water when returning to Australia with a returned  Colonel, who  was a business man, and would suit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> right up to the  knocker. He carried on a big business himself, and would be able to take a position of this kind admirably. I have seen others, but I am not putting in a word for any particular person in making these remarks. I understand that one honorable senator said he would like to see two returned soldiers on the commission, and that the Minister had agreed to this course. That was the first I had heard of it. If returned soldiers are to be appointed, how are we going to get representation of the States? I want to see the Returned Soldiers Association represented, but I would not like that body to have a majority of representatives. I believe in having paid men, and if we can get the best men to pay them well. If it were not for payment of members I would not be here, because I could not afford to travel frequently from my State to the Seat of Government. I do not want to create paid positions, but my experience in the administration of the Commonwealth's affairs is that the best results will be obtained by adopting this course. I represented the trade unions on one of these voluntary committees, so I know a little about the subject. I would rather see paid officials administering the fund, and believe it would be done better by them than by voluntary commissioners. </para>

I am pleased now to know the figures were incorrect, but on my return to New South Wales I shall take an opportunity of getting them verified or denied by that paper, which is read by thousands of the working classes in the community. </para>

I know very well that we can get honorary workers to undertake almost any work - or rather they would attempt to do it.

                        <para>- Perhaps they will not be administering it in the sense of actually disbursing the money, but they will stand in the relation of an advisory board to the Department, which will be guided by their counsel; and in the last analysis the commission will really be responsible for what the country may get out of the expenditure. It is not fair to the people that an honorary board of three or seven gentlemen should have the handling of the many millions of pounds that will be deposited in the Repatriation Fund, and we could not expect them, as honorary commissioners, to do justice to their duties. On the other hand, if men are paid, and paid well, we shall have a right to expect their best services, and to claim the whole of their "time for the  duties  imposed upon them. Honorary commissioners will, in all probability, have business concerns of their own to look after, and if any one of them be called to account for his stewardship, he will be able to say, " Well, I had my own business to attend to, and I could not be expected to give all my time to this scheme; I know mistakes have been made, but these could have been avoided if I had been able to devote the whole of my time to the duties." In a matter like this we are all in a more or less uncharted sea, and we can only hope for the best possible results by obtaining the best men. </para>

                <para>I am not particularly anxious that returned soldiers should have representation on the Commission - not that I do not think we could not get men of proved capacity among them. I do not think that at all. What I am concerned about is that we should get the best possible men for the position, and if returned soldiers are not directly represented they will be represented indirectly as members of 'the Returned Soldiers Association, which body will take good care to place their views before the Minister responsible for the administration of the scheme. I urge the Minister to reconsider his decision, and not expect that honorary commissioners will be found to do this work satisfactorily. </para>
                <para>We were reminded by an honorable senator who is not now in the chamber that the movement represented by members on this side of the Senate was itself largely built up by the honorary efforts of men who started our organization. We admit the truth of that; but, after all, it was only because there was no other course open, because at that time there was no money with which to pay these honorary workers in the inauguration of our movement, but the position was remedied directly funds became available. The Government is no more entitled than is any outside body to expect service on "the nod." The country that expects work to be done for nothing will get results akin to the results of those who, in the past, did the legislative work of Australia for nothing. All these things seem to me to point very strongly to the unwisdom of the . proposition put forward in this clause. I hope that if the larger number is retained the Minister will reconsider the idea of expecting the commissioners to work for nothing. I trust that they will be paid, and paid well. </para>

                <para class="block">These classes have nothing whatever to do with the principle of repatriation. If it is thought that the community owes some obligation to them the proper way to meet that case is by an amendment of the Pensions Act, which already makes provision for them. If that provision is not considered adequate enough, I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> that he should move to get an increased pension allowance for them. I ask the honorable senator to recognise the difference between the work contemplated in this Bill and that work which is very properly carried out by means of the Pensions Office. For  that reason I cannot accept the amendment. I am appalled already at the classes of work which will fall upon the shoulders of those who have to administer this measure. If they are also to be charged with looking after, not only the immediate, but very remote, dependants of the soldiers, it 'will make the task simply impossible. It will complicate the scheme to such an extent that il will break down. </para>

                    <para>.- I intend to support the amendment. I do not think it is desirable that the law under which this system is to be established should be of a hard and fast character. I do not suppose that the repatriation trustees' would entertain the idea of taking upon themselves the responsibility of repatriating tire mothers-in-law and distant relatives of soldiers who have served in the war. But I can foresee cases where it will be very necessary that they should have that .power under the law. There is no obligation on the part of trustees to extend to all these people the advantages of repatriation, but certainly the trustees should have the power under the parent Act which we are now considering to take into consideration certain cases of very great hardship. In my speech on the second reading I cited the case of a widow who sent four of her sons to the Front. One son has been killed ; two sons are already wounded, and another son is about to go into action. Surely if that woman should require assistance - and I have no doubt that she will - the trustees ought to have the power to say that she has rendered such services to the nation by the voluntary sacrifice of the sons, who were going to bring to her in her old age luxury and comfort, that she is deserving of some consideration other than the hard and fast pension which is allowed. </para>

                        <para>- I know that disability, but this clause does nob say that the trustees shall do so. It simply empowers the commissioners to make recommendations to the Governor-General for regulations so that they may grant assistance. Everybody agrees with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> and myself that the widow has as much right to be considered as the children, or that the mother of children has as much right to be considered as the widow or the children. If it is a good thing to have the clause in the Bill it will be equally good to have it amended in the way which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> desires. The adoption of the amendment would be no detriment to the Bill, and would not give rise to the grave results predicted by the Minister. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the amendment will be carried. We have heard something about the necessity for humane treatment, and surely honorable senators will not overlook the case of the wife of a man who has laid down his life on the battlefield in defence of the Empire! Under the clause, as drafted, the wife is entirely ignored. If it be right that the children should be looked after under this scheme, it is surely right that the mother of those children should be looked after. Whilst the men are fighting the great battle for the defence of the Empire, their womenfolk are, in my opinion, fighting a much greater battle. They have to suffer anxiety and suspense. They dread the sight of a postman or a telegraph messenger lest he should be bringing to them a message conveying the sad tidings that husband, father, brother, or son has been killed "or wounded in action. I think that the Repatriation Commission should be charged with the work of looking after the mother of the soldier's children as well as after the children themselves. The acceptance of the amendment would secure consideration for the other dependants of dead or incapacitated soldiers referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton,</inline> and it would be an improvement upon the Bill. </para>

                    BOLTON (Victoria) [3.18]. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council referred in a light and jocular manner to the  genealogical tree of the dead or incapacitated soldier. The vein in which he has chosen to approach the subject does not indicate that he regards the purpose of the Bill in any very earnest spirit. If that is the Minister's attitude upon this question of repatriation, it gives but poor promise of what ia likely to be done under the operation of the Bill. Many of the dependants of dead or incapacitated soldiers, and, possibly amongst them grandfathers, sisters, nieces, and others referred to, may be unable to earn a living for themselves, and may have been dependent on the earnings of the dead or incapacitated soldiers. The Minister's jocularity is entirely uncalled for, and is not in good taste.

                    <para>. - I accept in a becoming spirit of humility the rebuke which has fallen from the honorable senator who has just resumed his seat. I hope in future to profit by his lectures as to the proper deportment of a member of this Chamber. I should like honorable senators to bear in mind the possibility of creating very serious trouble if we do not lay down a clear line of demarcation between repatriation and pensions. No one can have any personal concern in this matter. I am as anxious as is any one else to treat in the most liberal way possible those who have rendered services of incalculable value to the country. If we are to consider individual cases we shall not establish the scheme on firm ground. It is necessary that we should adopt a definite principle. I have endeavoured to adhere to the principle that, in our repatriation scheme, we should deal with one sphere of work, and by means of pensions we should deal with another. If there is to be overlapping it will lead to endless complications. A pension is provided for the widow of a soldier killed at the Front, and if honorable senators think that it is quite insufficient, surely the common-sense proceeding is to increase the amount of the pension, and not to ask that another Department should be called into existence to supplement it. Between the War Pensions Act and this Bill every possible case for assistance will be met. My object in asking honorable senators to vote against the amendment is not to exclude from consideration the dependants of dead or incapacitated soldiers referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton,</inline> but to preserve the distinction between pensions and repatriation, to prevent the overlapping of work, and two Departments dealing with the same individuals. </para>

                    BOLTON (Victoria) [3.22]. - I have already said that, in my opinion, the matter of repatriation cannot be separated from the matters of pensions and amelioration. When the Repatriation Commission come to put this measure into operation they will certainly find that to be so. They will discover that this Bill will embrace pensions, amelioration, and repatriation.

                    <para>.- I support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton,</inline> because, if the widow or other dependants of dead or incapacitated soldiers are forced to rely on the pensions granted them, in .many cases they will have to struggle along on a mere pittance. If they received assistance under the repatriation scheme they might be able to start in business on their own account just as would the returned soldier, and might be able later to flourish and enjoy some of the good things of life. I do not see why widows and other dependants of the soldiers should not receive as generous treatment as the soldiers themselves. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham-</inline> when he says that the biggest sacrifices made during the war are those made by the womenfolk. I think that the repatriation scheme should embrace ample provision for them. I hope that the amendment will be accepted. </para>

This proposal is part of the scheme that is founded on an effort to combine the assistance of' private citizens with an official Department. I admit that it is an experiment, I admit that it is an innovation, but I ask the Committee to recognise that it is part of the scheme,, and that by passing this clause they will be giving an opportunity to that experiment to demonstrate whether it is a practicable one or not. There is no precedent to guide us in this matter. It may work out unsatisfactorily; on the other hand, it may not. It is an expedient which seeks to combine two desirable elements, and I appeal to honorable, senators to let that experiment demonstrate its worth by actual work. </para>

                    (South Australia)  [3.33]. -  To my mind, if it be necessary for seven persons to be appointed to the central Commission, it is equally imperative that seven members shall be appointed to each State Board. These boards, I presume, will be composed of men who possess a knowledge of the land and of various trades.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline>
                    has submitted a proposal to reduce the number of members of these boards from seven to five. But in view of the fact that seven members are to constitute the central Commission, and that the State Boards will not have less work to do, I shall support the Government on this occasion.

                    <para>. - It appears to me that, owing to the application of motive-power to production, the people of this country are now able to produce, not merely sufficient for their own requirements, but sufficient to keep a large army in addition. The proposal now before the Committee is not one to repatriate returned soldiers, but to provide substantial positions for persons who are not prepared to come out into the open and battle for themselves. I venture to say that this is a proposal to foist upon the taxpayers a considerable number of men who would not give one moment of their time to any private citizen without being paid for it. Yet some honorable senators seriously expect them, in discharging the duties of the proposed State Boards, to give &gt; their services gratuitously. Instead of the arrangement being an economical one, it appears to me to be an effort to foist a considerable number of men on the already overburdened taxpayers of this country. Apparently the Minister can do nothing, even of the most trivial character, without the aid of a board. He seems to have entirely lost all the vigour and vim which he possessed a few years ago. It is now proposed .that we shall have, not merely a central Commission, meeting in Melbourne, but a board sitting in each State. In addition, there will be a permanently paid staff to carry out the instructions of these boards. The position reminds me of a story I read in regard to a lot of flies hanging on to a cow in a meadow, and holding corroborees and Parliaments of their own, without doing any good or useful work. One day the cow Tolled over and crushed them. Similarly I think that the taxpayers of this country will one day roll over and crush this multiplicity of boards. The Vice-President of the Executive Council is possessed of more than sufficient ability to carry out this work unaided. He has done nothing else now for a considerable number ' of months. It must be remembered, too, that he will not be called upon to attend to the details of the scheme. He will have at his disposal a paid staff of clerks, both in Melbourne and in each of the </para>

If the Vice-President of the Executive Council is determined to adopt the "go-slow" policy of the Industrial "Workers of the World, his proper course is to invite applications for the positions, and to appoint men who are capable of filling them. But there is no occasion for him to do that. The honorable' gentleman is quite able to look after this matter himself. If he is not, he can appoint more men. </para>

If these men would only go out and take a hand with the plough, there would  be  no occasion for the working man to labour more than four hours per day. </para>

If they are not going to do any' work we will cease working ourselves; we will put in only three or four hours a day, and let these men go out and find food for themselves." Then these people will be in a position of the flies when the cow rolled over, and will be squashed out of existence. </para>

The net result of the honorary system is that somebody else has to do the work, and the honorary people get the honour and glory of it.

                    <para>.- I should like to support my colleague, Sen a-  i  tor Bolton, on this occasion, but cannot see my way to do so. I look on the State Boards as being of even more importance than the Federal Commission. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> desires to get the most efficient board possible, so as to safeguard the interests of the soldiers or their dependants in every possible way, but that cannot be done merely by appointing a salaried board, as is proved by the history of the closer settlement movement in all the States. That matter has been controlled and supervised by a salaried board in every State, and iu every case to date the system has absolutely failed to solve the problem of land settlement. Victoria has suffered as severely as any, and a  Royal Commission was recently appointed to investigate its closer settlement policy. That was an honorary board, of which I  was a member. I gave two solid years to inspecting every estate minutely, and taking evidence from every settler regarding his financial position and surroundings. The result was that in order to save the settlement of this country we had to write off a huge sum. We realized that it was better to do that, and save the settlers and make them contented, rather than load and crush them as in the past, The closer settlement policy of Victoria is to-day on a basis such as never existed before, and the settlers have some prospect of making a comfortable living, and a home for their families, which in the past many of them could not do. I can name men in this State, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Manifold,</inline> who would make splendid members of an honorary board. I could also name others of equal integrity who would rather submit to have their heads chopped off than deceive returned soldiers. If an honorary board is created of men of the capacity and integrity of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Manifold,</inline> the future of these settlers can be safely left in their hands. If, however, the Government have to call for applications for paid positions, so many applications will be put in, and so much influence will be brought to' bear" that valuable time will be lost, and men may be selected who have not had the necessary experience, although desirous of doing their best in the interest of the soldiers, and the whole business will fail. If we are going to follow a system that is likely to break down our closer settlement policy in the future, we shall be doing a great injustice to the future generations of this State. That is what I wish to avoid, and that is why I am not voting with my colleague on this occasion. If the boards are reduced to five we shall not get so many men with wide experience, and there is always the risk that illness may reduce the number of those who can attend to two or three. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the amendment. At Canberra, we have an area of about 900 square miles of land, which up to date has not received the attention, in connexion with the proposal for repatriation, which I think it is entitled to. I have made application for, but have not yet received, a report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allen,</inline> Fruit Inspector, New South Wales, or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> the Commonwealth Analyst, as to the quality of the soil, which I believe is suitable for fruit-growing and other purposes. From my own personal knowledge of the country, I know it is in many respects as good as, and I have no doubt in some respects superior to, some of the. land that has already been bought. </para>
