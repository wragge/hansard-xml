                        <para>-(By <inline font-style="italic">leave).</inline> - Honorable senators are aware that for many months I have not been in my place in. the Senate, and had I followed the advice  tendered to me by the medical authorities I would still be absent. But in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>  a day or two ago appeared an article containing such insinuations, and such a reflection upon myself, that I felt that, no matter what the consequences might be, or what risks I might run, I was in duty bound to come here to-day and offer a few words in reply. Honorable senators, I am sure, are well aware of the reasons for my protracted absence. I was absent for quite five months before the recent political turmoil occurred, before the new Parliament was elected. That I wag absent during the Whole of that period is a matter which causes me very sincere regret. But in extenuation of my Absence I can only say that had I been here it would have been quite impossible for me to have taken that part which I should have liked to take, and that part which I felt I was able to take, if in a humble capacity, at all .previous elections during the last fifteen or sixteen years. </para>

                    <para>On Friday last the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> published a statement under a heading -which was so unfair, so untrue, and, in my opinion, bo vindictive that I would not have been doing justice to myself or to my colleagues had I refrained from appearing here this) afternoon and offering an explanation. The article is headed &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long&#39;s</inline> Disappearance; The Mystery Unveiled; A Secret Commission.&#34; It begins - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>Later, this passage occurs, and this is where, perhaps, the sting of the whole criticism appears - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It will be remembered that, at the time when the Labour Opposition in the Senate proved an obstacle in the way of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> departure for London to Attend the Imperial Conference, the Labour party suddenly found that, through the resignation of ex-Senator Beady and the absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline> both of Tasmania, it was without its much-boasted majority. Honorable senators, of course, will see that in this article I have been directly connected with the happenings in the last few days of the life of the previous Parliament, when rumours were afloat that bribery and corruption in respect to certain individuals were rampant. I cannot be expected to remember just what happened for a month previous to the dissolution of the last Parliament ;  but, if my memory is right, I think that when I left here on the 7th or 8th  February there was not any mention - I speak subject to correction - of the formation of a Coalition  Government.  It -was never mentioned that there was likely to be an effort made to_ extend the life of Parliament. Certainly I could not be expected to know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> was likely to resign, or that my old colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> was likely to be also suffering from a very severe illness. I. left  Australia perfectly   innocent,  if I may put it that way, of any knowledge that there was likely to be a crisis, and I give my honest word that I. knew nothing of an election in Australia until early in April, I believe, on the 6th or 7th. Prom the 8th March to the end of that month I was in Java, where a person never sees a newspaper printed in English, and consequently for whatever information I could get concerning Australia I had to rely upon the newspapers which were sent to me, and  those  newspapers containing a report of the crisis did not reach me&#39; until some time in April, I believe on the 7th or 8th. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>On Sunday last I wrote a letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> with the idea that it would appear in Monday&#39;s issue. It did not appear in that issue, for reasons to which, of course, I cannot take exception. There might have been many reasons which prevented the letter from appearing on that date. But it did appear in Tuesday&#39;s issue, and in a very much mutilated form. It was not a very lengthy letter, and I propose, with the permission of the Senate, to read it. I  need  hardly point out, sir, that, like yourself, I have been for some years a member of the Joint House Committee, and that it was compelled, by constant complaints, from members of Parliament, to remind members of the reporting staffs of thai conditions under which they -were permitted to enter Parliament House. As you, sir, pointed out, we never in any  way  curtailed, or desired to curtail, the privileges of members of the press already in existence, and governed by definite regulations. Like yourself, sir, and other members of the Joint House Committee, 1 have been persistently  boycotted  by the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> But I did not worry, because,&#39; like all members of this Parliament, I have the benefit and the  protection  of a very complete parliamentary record. Therefore, I was indifferent concerning the attitude of the press towards me in respect of the performance of what I believed to be my duty. I addressed the following letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper, expecting to see it published in Monday&#39;s issue; but it did not appear until Tuesday; and, as its full contents were not published, I ask the indulgence of the Senate while I read it - </para>
                    <para>To the Editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline></para>
                    <para>After more than two years&#39; boycott by members of your staff, I find a reference to myself in the columns of Friday&#39;s issue. That such a reference should be couched in vicious terms embodying a contemptible insinuation, was, perhaps to be expected, when it is remembered that I was associated with certain other representatives of the Federal Parliament on the Joint House Committee when that body found it necessary, more than two years ago, to remind members of your staff, as well as the employees of other newspapers, that certain regulations governed their admission to Parliament House. Ever since that time, I; as well as other members of the Joint House Committee, have in your reports been ignored; but, as all members have the benefit and protection of an official report of parliamentary proceedings, I was not in the least concerned as to the attitude of press representatives. I should have continued that indifference to either their silence or attacks; but the reference to myself and my recent absence from Australia appearing in Friday&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is so unfair, untrue, and so obviously malicious, that I am compelled to offer a few words in reply. You describe my absence from Australia as &#34;Mysterious disappearance at a time when my presence meant so much to my party.&#34; In regretting that absence sincerely, may I point out that, in consequence of a most serious illness, from the effects of which I have not yet recovered, I took no part in the deliberations of the Senate for four months prior to leaving for the Dutch East Indies, and no crisis occurred in Parliament until nearly one month after I had left; and, although considerably out of touch with what transpired in Parliament during the past ten months, I venture to say that, prior to my departure, I do not think there was any serious talk of a Coalition Government, and certainly no mention of the prolongation of the life of Parliament. I left Melbourne by steamer so that I might get as long a sea journey as possible - members of my family and friends were there to see me off. I remained four days in Sydney, leaving that city under similar circumstances; Brisbane the same; and, before leaving Melbourne, I discussed my proposed trip with at least two of my Tasmanian parliamentary colleagues. I also wrote to at least twenty political and personal friends in that State, telling them of my intended tour, and of the fact that, while on that tour, I was undertaking a little official work for the Commonwealth Government. And, when I say that, included among those to whom I wrote was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dwyer</inline> Gray, editor <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post,</inline> Labour paper, Hobart; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. B.</inline> Watkins, manager of that paper; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Mooney, secretary, A.W.U., Northern Tasmania; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. M.</inline> Cunningham, secretary Tasmanian Miners Federation, Zeehan; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> Skillern, secretary Miners Association, Gormanston, the public will understand how much shrouded in mystery, was my departure from Australia to the East. They will, I hope, also understand how &#34; justified &#34; was the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> reference to myself in the issue of your paper under consideration - a journal that, for several years, was not fair enough to notice my presence when in my place in Parliament, or interested enough to record my departure, or inquire as to my destination. May I say, in conclusion, that similar criticism to that of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> appeared simultaneously in other Melbourne newspapers, the language being identical, and thus showing perfect harmony among those who, no doubt, felt it to be their duty to supply their respective papers with &#34;copy&#34; with what they agreed to term &#34; The &#39;mysterious disappearance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long.&#34;</inline></para>
                    <para>Yours, &#38;c, 19.8.17. j. j. Long. </para>
                    <para class="block">As I have already said, that letter appeared in an abbreviated form, though I admit that the real points which I was anxious to have published did appear. </para>
                    <para>May I now be allowed to say that my departure from Australia was not enshrouded in mystery, or governed by mystery in any sense of the word. I left&#39; in the most public manner, because I had no reason whatever to hide the fact that I was leaving; though I admit that my departure was, perhaps, somewhat hurried to fit in with the arrangements for a steamer passage to the Dutch East Indies. My departure was not governed by any improper consideration. I deny that absolutely; and I hurl any such insinuation back in the teeth of those who made it. When I mentioned to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that I proposed going down toNorthf olk Island, or perhaps to Java, on a health trip, and that probably I would be away for some little time, <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> was then good enough to say that the Government had thought of sending some one to Java on a very special and important mission, the nature of which I am unable to tell the Senate. If this is to be made known, the responsibility must rest upon the&#39; Minister for Defence, as the representative of the Government at that time. The Minister told me that, if I thought I could undertake the work required of me, it could be arranged that I should be intrusted with the duties. When I was informed of the nature of the inquiries, I readily consented, and resolved to discharge, as well as I might be able, the obligations that might be imposed upon me. Whether I have done that, time alone can determine. </para>
                    <para>I want to emphasize, however, as strongly as I am able, that I. take full responsibility for whatever suspicion - if I may put it that way - may attach to me for having left Australia at that time, and for having been absent during the elections; but I can say, honestly and sincerely, that no attempt, good, bad, or indifferent, was made by the Minister for Defence, as the representative of the Government, to suborn either my vote or my influence. I repeat, that I alone was responsible for my absence at &#39;that time; and I must throw upon the Government the responsibility of making known to Parliament and the public the nature of the special mission upon which I went to the Dutch East Indies. There was never even a suggestion that I- should in any way. hy my presence or absence, assist the Government at that time. He and .other honorable senators know that immediately on my return here I took my place amongst the members of the party to which I have been attached all my political life and that I am still amongst them. In conclusion, I have merely to add that no attempt was ever made to alienate me from them, and no inducement would ever be sufficient to compel my allegiance to any other party, other than that which, in my opinion, ever since it took an active part in the political arena, has done so much to advance the interests of Australia. I thank you, sir, and the members of the Senate, for having afforded me this opportunity of explaining, perhaps somewhat disconnectedly, the reason of my absence from Australia during the past six or seven months. </para>

At that juncture the Prime Minister and myself were anxious to obtain certain information, particularly from the Dutch East Indies - information which we had been unable to secure through the ordinary channels. When </para>

                    <para class="block">
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline>
                        mentioned that he proposed to leave Australia on a sea trip, and intended visiting Norfolk Island, it occurred to me that it was my duty to place that fact before the Prime Minister and to discuss with him the advisableness  of asking
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline>
                        to undertake the inquiries which we wished to have made. I did discuss the matter with the Prime Minister, and after discussion we both agreed that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline>
                        was fitted to make those inquiries, and that he was a suitable person to make them. I saw the honorable senator again, and asked him whether he would be willing to extend his trip to Java and the Dutch East Indies, and whether he would make the inquiries which the Government desired to make. He agreed to do so. I informed the Prime Minister of his decision, and afterwards a commission was issued to  him through the Prime Minister&#39;s office and by direction of the Prime Minister. I endorse what
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline>
                        has said in regard to this matter. So far as my knowledge goes his statement is absolutely accurate. Neither myself nor
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline>
                        discussed the political aspect of his trip. No suggestion was made by me of any political motive behind the proposed commission, neither when
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline>
                        first intimated his intention of going abroad, nor when I conveyed to him the Prime Minister&#39;s wish that he should accept the commission, nor has such a suggestion been made since the honorable senator&#39;s return.

                        <para>. - As I was not present during the second-reading debate on this Bill, I desire to say one or two words concerning it. I do not know whether I shall be in order at this stage in reminding the Government and the Senate that promises made, and obligations entered into by State Governments, when the proposal to construct the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway was introduced, have not been fulfilled. No attempt has been made to fulfil them, although many honorable senators, including myself, voted for the construction of the line on the strength of those promises. The Government of South Australia has made no attempt to alter the gauges of the State lines linking up the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta rail- way from their existing gauges to . the standard 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. gauge. The. Western Australian Government have so ; far made no attempt to broaden the gauge of the line from Kalgoorlie to Perth. There appears to be no intention on the part of the State Governments concerned to make these necessary alterations of gauge, and if the line to which I refer is to be of any use for strategic and military purposes, the Federal Government should consider the desirability of making the suggested connexion between Tort Augusta and Broken Hill. </para>

                            <para>- I know that representatives of South Australia in the Senate did make such a promise on behalf of that State, and thus induced me to vote for the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. The Minister for Works and Railways should clearly intimate that if the Governments of the States concerned do not intend to fulfil the promises made on their behalf the Federal Government will have to consider the necessity of connecting the line with the eastern railway systems in the way I have referred to. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> when Prime Minister, had surveys of a strategic line carried out by a qualified engineer, and if his ideas in that connexion had been carried out, the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway would be linked up with Broken Hill, in New South Wales, and by that route to Queensland, as it should be, for strategic and military reasons. If the State Governments concerned are unwilling to carry out their promises, we should give effect to the proposal to make the connexion between Port Augusta and Broken Hill, so that, should the necessity arise, men and munitions may be transported between the States more easily than is possible under existing conditions. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> that the Bill deals with the machinery to enable us to manage and control railways already constructed, and under the control of the Commonwealth Government. It is not my purpose to go into the history of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, which has been referred to only in general terms during the discussion of the measure, and which may be dealt with by this Parliament at any time. This Bill provides for the appointment of a Railways Commissioner, who is given powers, almost equivalent to those of the Public Service Commissioner, for the control of his staff, and for the fixing of rates and fares. It does not deal in any way with any agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and State Governments. I feel confident that when the war conditions now existing are at an end, and the financial position is easier, the agreements referred to will be carried out by theState Governments concerned. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think that honorable senators on this side will offer any objection to the passage of this Bill. We welcome its &#39;introduction as a means of making it easier for returned soldiers to secure employment in the Public Service. Whether it is a good thing or not to offer greater facilities for employment in the Public Service to returned soldiers than  to  the ordinary private citizen remains to be seen. The measure will exempt returned soldiers from the time-limit of service applicable under the existing law to temporary employees. I never could understand why that time-limit for temporary employment &#39; was agreed to. I think that it should be abolished, but this Bill does not deal with that matter except in so far as it may affect the employment of returned soldiers. There are men fitted for the positions which they occupy in the Government Service, who, although they are not permanent employees, have occupied similar positions for years. Under the existing law they are given employment in one Department for six months with, a three months&#39; extension, when they go out, and are given nine months&#39; temporary employment in another Department. Then they get back to the Department which they left on the same conditions. Many of these men are good accountants, bookkeepers, and clerks, and are well fitted for permanent positions in which they might do useful work but for the operation of a section of the Public Service Act which should never have been passed if the desire was to consider efficiency rather than patronage. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>One objection I have to the Bill is that returned soldiers are to be permitted to sit for examination for admission to the Public Service only up to fifty years of age. I believe that this provision&#39; will debar some men who have been good soldiers at the Front from an opportunity to enter the Service. They told a lie about their age to get away, and are strong and sturdy and passed all medical tests. I knew an ex-member of this Parliament who lost his life on the battlefield. He celebrated his fifty-second birthday on the troopship going across. I know another man there sixty years of age who walked 300 miles in one of the recruiting tours in New South Wales. I saw him in France when I was there, going good and strong. If that man comes back, he cannot get a job in the Commonwealth Service under this Bill, although he is quite able to perform the duties of any branch of the Clerical Division. Before he left to tramp to Sydney, he held a good position as bookkeeper on a station. He is an experienced accountant. There are plenty of other men of that description whom it would be an injustice to shut out. If a man goes to the war at forty-five years of age, and the war lasts seven years, he may come back competent, strong, and sturdy, yet, under this Bill, he will not be allowed to sit. for examination, which means that he is barred from the Public Service. I hope &#39;that provision will be struck out altogether, so that the reference may be to returned soldiers generally, no matter what their ages. </para>
                    <para>The Bill will give the greater opportunities to those who return earlier in the war. That is one of the effects which I particularly want to point out to the Government as likely to operate harshly. The Government cannot employ all these men. There are about 16,000 employees in the Public Service now. We have already 26,000 returned soldiers, so what are we going to do with the other 300,000 if we get them all back again ? We cannot treat them all alike by giving them positions in the Government Service, and therefore the Bill gives greater opportunities to those who return earlier.I do not know how that difficulty is to be got over, nor do I offer any suggestion to get over it. That will be a matter  for   consideration later, but, of course, the Government cannot entertain the idea  of  giving employment in the Service to the whole of these men. They will have to find other means of providing for them. I have my own ideas in that regard on the question of fostering industries, but I cannot go into details on that subject now. </para>
                    <para>I object to the provision regarding examinations, which are to be &#34;by the University or other bodies.&#34; I would strife out the examination altogether, and let a man prove his fitness as he does in any private employment. Let the Commissioner give him an opportunity to prove that he is able . to do the work. Men of fifty or sixty years of age returning from the war cannot sit for an examination like a youth fresh from school. Even if they were able to do so before they went away, it is not fair to ask them to do so when they return, suffering, as I have seen many of them, from shell shock and other injuries. There are plenty of positions in the Service that a man could fill, even if he could not read or write, better than the best Rhodes scholar. My idea is that the qualifications required under this Bill should be that the man has gone and done his duty. We must give returned men every consideration, no matter whether they are able to sit for examinations or not. There is plenty of work, such as that of watchmen, cleaners, and others, for which a man need not sit for examination. Why should cleaners in the Railway Service have to be examined in this way? What is wanted in those jobs is muscle and grit, and not a knowledge of Euclid, although that is a good thing for a mechanic to have. Most of these men will be employed in positions where an examination is absolutely unnecessary. I should like to see the clause struck out, and applicants employed on their merits. </para>
                    <para>The Bill will do an injustice to a number of men already in the Service who have sons at the Front, or whose sons have lost their lives there fighting the good fight. If preference is to be given to returned soldiers, these will be denied further employment in the Government Service. The returned soldier does not want that sort of thing. The man who has gone out to battle as he has done wants no advantage over his fellow man, who has done in another way, perhaps, as much as he has. Hardship will be caused to many in the Public Service to-day, and to many who have been in the Service in the past, and are looking for reemployment as temporary hands. I intend to move in Committee the insertion of the following new clause: - </para>

                            <para>- All those little things can be provided for by regulation if the Bill does not cover them. There are plenty of men in the Service, and even in this building, who have done their utmost to get away. Some have been rejected nine times. Surely the Minister does not think it fair for them to be discharged to make room for others, after they have done their best to serve their country? That is the class of man I want to save. I have been in communication with some members of the Returned Soldiers Association in New South Wales, and they say that they would like some provision of this sort inserted. They do not want any advantage over men who have been rejected. They want advantages over the slacker, and ought to get them. They rightly want advantages over those who absolutely refuse to serve their country, but stand back and let others go to the Front. I have no hope of the clause I intend to move being put in the Bill, but it is an honest attempt on my part to do something to assist those who would have gone to the Front if they had been allowed. </para>

                        <para>.- As this is a Bill in which I have been greatly interested I welcome it very much, and congratulate the Government upon its introduction. The league with which I have had the honour to be connected in Queensland, and which consists of a very large number of returned soldiers, has for some time been very dissatisfied with the conditions regarding the employment of returned soldiers in the Public Service. The restriction that returned men were only to be employed as  temporary hands in most cases appeared to us to be a very unfair one indeed. I believe that when it becomes known that the Government is again proving itself to be a truly national Government this measure will be welcomed. </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion this Bill will do a great deal of good so far as Queensland is concerned. I believe that when it is made public that the. Government intend to give preference to returned, soldiers, and to see that they are properly treated, a very good effect will be produced. I sincerely trust that a great many firms and employers will follow the splendid example set by the Commonwealth. A little while ago a vacancy occurred on the staff of the Toowoomba Municipal Council. Applications were invited in the press to fill the position of, I think, inspector. When the applications were considered&#39; by the council a returned soldier was turned down and another man was given the position. The effect of that decision was to cause a great deal of discontent amongst the returned soldiers in Toowoomba, and I believe among all the members of the Returned Soldiers Association, and &#39; at a meeting held in that town various motions were passed deploring the action which the municipal council had taken. I hope th&#39;at when employers of labour, municipal councils, and so forth see that the Commonwealth Government is giving preference to returned men they will follow that good example. I quite agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> said regarding the holding of an educational examination. I consider that a hardship will be inflicted upon returned men if it is made necessary for them to pass a clerical examination in subjects with which they would not be called upon to deal if employed under the Commonwealth Government. After a man has been away from school for some time he is inclined to get stale on certain subjects, and therefore it is not so easy for him to pass a clerical examination as it would have been when he was quite fresh from school. I sincerely trust that unfair restrictions will not be placed upon returned men by asking&#39; them to pass difficult examinations when they seek to enter the Public Service. </para>

                            <para>- I congratulate the Government upon the inclusion of that provision., I think it demonstrates once more that the Government does intend to do all it possibly can for returned soldiers. Regarding the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> on the question of preference, my view is that if preference to returned soldiers is to apply generally throughout the Commonwealth Service less hardship will be likely to arise amongst members of that Service than would be the case if certain men were picked out, described as slackers, and dismissed, their places being filled by returned soldiers. It is impossible to point to any  man as a slacker until the full circumstances of his case are known. This provision, I take it, is intended to apply generally. I think that we can leave it to the good sense of. the Commissioner to see that a fair thing is done; but if, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> suggested, certain public officers are to have the finger of scorn pointed at them, and to be described as slackers, a great many acts of injustice will be done. Nobody has less time for what is called a slacker than I have, but from my association with the recruiting movement I realize that it is very hard in some circumstances to define exactly what a slacker is. Without making some inquiry I would not feel justified in describing as a slacker a single man who had not gone to the Front. There are plenty of cases where a married man is as much a slacker as a single man. Some married men have less responsibilities than have single men. In my opinion, if the provision regarding preference to returned soldiers generally is left as it now stands, less hardship is likely to occur than if the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> is adopted. I again congratulate the Government upon bringing forward the measure, and upon once more showing that it is determined that the men who fight for Australia shall have a fair chance in the Public Service when they return from the Front. </para>

                    <para class="block">So far so good, but it has been pointed out to me by those who should know, and I believe it has been pointed out to the Prime Minister by the Commonwealth Public Service Clerical Association, that there is a danger of doing injustice to men in other branches of the, Public Service. I am glad to see that an attempt is being made to provide for the returned soldier in this regard, but if this provision  is enacted it has been pointed out to me that many officers, who have been debarred by various reasons from serving in a combatant capacity, have rendered invaluable service to the country in their ordinary avocations. There is no one who can question that. Again, many of the officers who may be affected by the enactment of this provision are already represented at the Front by a son or a brother.  Although they have not gone themselves,  for financial, medical, or other reasons, still their son or other relative is there. There is just a danger of this provision operating unjustly. I am also informed that if it is enacted the avenues of future, advancement of these officers will be complicated by the appointment of returned soldiers to positions carrying high seniority. We know, of course, that a pro-, mise has already been made, and one which I hope will be kept, that the positions of public servants who enlisted would be retained for them, and that their right to seniority would not be impaired. On the return of these men no one can object to their stepping into the positions which they would have held had they not gone to fight the country&#39;s battle. There are other public servants who, although they could not go themselves, have sons at the </para>

                            <para>- I am not dogmatic, but I think that there may be an occasion when the rights of such men may be interfered with. The honorable senator knows perfectly well that my sympathies are with the returned soldiers, but in extending to them the justice which they deserve we ought tq take care not to do an injustice to officers who, through no fault of their own, could nob go to the_ firing line, but who are represented there by a member of their family. There is also&#39; a danger of young officers from eighteen to twenty-one years of age being affected. Many of these young men volunteered, but owing to some defect or other their offers were not accepted. It was to this phase of the measure that I rose to direct attention. To. the Bill generally I shall give support, but in endeavouring to legislate for the class of men who have won distinction and deserve special legislation we must proceed very warily, and see that we do not do an injustice to public officers who, through no fault of their own, could not go to the Front. I should like to hear from the Minister, in his reply, whether or not the positions of any officers in the category I have mentioned will be in any danger from the passing of this measure. </para>

The Bill proposes <inline font-style="italic">to give to</inline> returned soldiers the right to enter the Public Service without submitting themselves to that examination which is required of other candidates, and, personally, I confess I agree with that view of the situation, because hitherto some examinations have been valueless once an - applicant has secured employment. I do not know if it is wis( to allow the Public Service Commissioner to set the examination for the admission of returned soldiers, without submitting it to Parliament for approval, but that is not a very serious matter, and. I feel that I can trust the Commissioner. I have no objection to the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Well, the honorable senator appears to know a good deal about cold-footers. As I have said, I have no objection to preference being shown to returned soldiers, provided no serious injustice is done to other civil servants. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> and other honorable senators who have spoken have already pointed out the possibility of an injustice being imposed upon certain individuals already in the Service unless we can insure careful . administration of the measure. Can we absorb very many returned soldiers in the Service without impairing its efficiency or inflicting an injustice upon others? We may, I think, presume that the Service is already fully manned, and, if so, is it intended to &#34;scrap,&#34; in order to make room for others, some of those who have passed the necessary examinations, and have faithfully performed their work? </para>

                    <para>I agree with the sentiment expressed by some honorable senators this afternoon that not very many returned soldiers will desire that any injustice should be placed upon civil servants merely for the purpose of giving employment. If it is the intention to provide only for vacancies as they arise in the Clerical or General Division, then I am afraid th&#39;e measure will not give employment to very large numbers of returned men. It may be, therefore, that a great deal more is expected of the measure than will be achieved. I presume that other honorable senators besides myself have received a circular pointing out that promotion may be denied to men who have already qualified and served their country well by the appointment of returned soldiers in the manner prescribed by this Bill. There is . a possibility, it is thought, that if men come in under a &#34; toned down &#34; examination, they will prevent many of those already in the Service from getting promotion, for which, perhaps, they have been working for a considerable time. </para>

Hundreds of thousands of men were in some kind of employment before they left, and I take it that the great bulk of them will desire to go back to their former occupations. Unfortunately, many thousands will never come back, so there will be so many more vacancies to &#163;11. </para>

                    <para>I am in entire agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> references to the set examinations for entrance .to the Civil Service, particularly in the General Division. I have personal knowledge of the case of a man doing outside work in the Telegraph Branch of the Postal Department for eight or nine years..  His  particular duty was to dig post holes, at which he was particularly efficient, but simply because he could not pass a certain educational examination he had to leave the Service, and frequently it took two other men to do the work upon which he had been engaged. Examinations for the General Division ought to be more in the nature of practical tests. I know of another young man who got almost the possible number of marks in examinations for handwriting and arithmetic, but bel cause he could not pass in a certain class of dictation he failed, although he had obtained 200 marks more than the successful candidates. </para>

                            <para>- I acknowledge that the Minister is correct, but I am pointing out that if the old set standard for examinations were retained in the Bill before the Senate the effect would be, to cause inefficiency. I am rather glad that the entrance examinations are likely to be toned down, particularly in the educational test for the General Division. I have known men to continue in the Service for years as temporary hands, and to discharge their duties to the complete satisfaction of their superior officers. But because they could not pass an examination they have been turned adrift, and I have been credibly informed that in some instances it subsequently took two men to do the work which one had previously performed. </para>

                    <para>In regard to temporary officers, the Bill makes it appear that! a returned soldier, having been admitted to the Service as a casual hand, may possibly be retained permanently.

When once a soldier has gained admission to our Public Service,, why should he be granted different conditions from those which govern his fellow employees ? </para>

                    <para>I repeat that in many cases the examinations for admission to certain branches of the Service are a farce. They involve too much theoretical, and too little practical, work. I wish to give our returned soldiers every reasonable opportunity to enter our Public Service. But I do not believe that they themselves desire to be granted such an unusual preference as will put them upon a pedestal apart from everybody else. By all means let them enter our Public Service so long as they are reasonably qualified to perform the work that will be required of them. But when once they are there, I feel sure that they do not wish special conditions to be extended to them. I do not think that the Bill will find employment for a great number. For the strictly Clerical Branch of the Service it seems to me that an examination is required which&#34; will guarantee the competency of successful candidates. But for admission to the General Division I do not think that an educational test is necessary. There&#34; it is more a matter of practical experience. </para>

                            <para>- Some of them are. I know a young man who was in the Government Service in Melbourne, and who is now at the Front. Upon his return, I feel sure that he will be more qualified than he was when he left Australia, and I hope that he will then be restored to  at least as high a position as that which he relinquished. He has been awarded the D.S.O. for his acts in the field in connexion with fitting up telephone and telegraph wires. Such men will not require any special advantages to be conferred upon them when once they have entered the Service. I hope that officers &#34;who are already in our Commonwealth Service will not be subjected to injustice. in order that others may be put in their places. I trust that men who have faithfully served the Commonwealth for years, and who have wives and families to maintain; will not be turned adrift. Our returned soldiers, I believe, will be quite satisfied to fill vacancies as they occur. Whether or not good results will flow from this Bill will depend largely upon the way in which, it is administered. If it be administered judiciously, with a view to giving our returned soldiers a preference without inflicting injustice upon others, it will, doubtless, do some good. But if men who have loyally served the Commonwealth for years are treated unjustly, the measure will recoil on the heads of those who contribute to that injustice. </para>

                        BOLTON (Victoria) &#91;4.27&#93;. - I think that some honorable senators are unnecessarily alarmed regarding the injustice which may be done to members of our Commonwealth Public Service. The chivalrous character of the men who volunteered to fight, and if need be to die, for their country, is a sufficient answer to the implied accusation that upon their return to Australia they will desire to displace any man in a billet in order that a job may be found for one of them, and particularly will they be averse to displacing men with wives and families dependent upon them. Then I would point out that we have a Public Service Commissioner who is responsible for the efficiency of the Commonwealth Service. We naturally expect that he will pay due regard to these conditions. I agree with
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline>
                        in regard to the age limitation of fifty years that is imposed by the Bill. I think there will be many returned soldiers to whom light employment in our Public Service will be a great boon - light employment of the character, perhaps, that they could not obtain outside of it. Keeping in mind the close scrutiny - which will be exercised by the Public Service Commissioner in regard to the work ing of the various Departments, I , think that the Government may safely eliminate the provision in the Bill which imposes upon returned soldiers desirous of entering the Commonwealth Service an age limit of fifty years.

                        <para>. - I cannot: refrain from expressing some surprise at the nature of the discussion which has proceeded thus far on the Bill. Every honorable senator who has spoken has expressed a very warm and sympathetic regard for the principle, of preference to soldiers; bub the moment it is proposed to grant that preference, they take exception to it. They point out that by granting a preference to soldiers, we may be imposing a disability upon somebody else. I wish to say, at once, that we cannot grant a preference to certain persons without placing a handicap on others. Honorable senators, therefore, are called upon to say whether, when they promise a preference to returned soldiers, they really mean it or nob. If that is their attitude upon this question, I wish to make it quite clear that it is not mine. When I spoke of a preference to soldiers, I meant giving them something substantial. </para>

                            <para>- No. The ordinary citizen who is employed on the temporary staff of ourPublic Service is not dismissed; his term merely expires. In such cases, it is proposed to say that, no matter how qualified he may be for his position, he shall no longer be retained in the Service. We have to make it quite clear whether we are handing to our returned soldiers an empty phrase or not. I listened to a great deal of discussion upon this Bill, and, amongst other things, I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> say that if we grant this preference, we may impair the efficiency of our Public Service. I think it is quite possible that, to some minor degree, the efficiency of the Service may be impaired; but we might have had no Public Service at all but for the action of these men in fighting for this country. If the officers of the various Departments have to work with a little extra energy as the result of what we are now doing, it will do them no harm, and it is only what they owe to the men who have fought for them. We ought to extend a preference to our returned soldiers, because the men who have stayed at home for three years have had the first preference to all the jobs which our soldiers have left. It is only fair, therefore, that we should grant our returned men the first opportunity of entering the door of public employment. Some very hard things, have been said here because private employers have not kept their pledges to those who have enlisted; but we have no right to point the finger of scorn at them unless we set an excellent example ourselves. By giving effect to the provisions of this Bill, we shall be breaking no contract with anybody. We shall merely be doing what we ought to do, namely, setting an example to the private employers, and to public bodies throughout Australia. I hope, therefore, that in its vital principles the Bill will not be impaired during its progress through Committee. </para>

                        <para>. - When the Vice-President of the Executive Council, in his speech on the second reading of the Bill, made a passing reference to this clause, I asked by way of interjection whether it would apply to manual workers, and the honorable senator answered that it would largely apply to them. In the circumstances I propose to move the addition of the following new sub-clause : -  4b. Any such person so employed in the Public Service, shall receive payment at a rate not less than the rate ruling outside the Public Service for work of a similar nature. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish it to be inferred that I charge the Government with any desire to exploit the returned soldiers; but I do say that in some avenues of private employment endeavours; have already been made in that direction. Applications have been called for light jobs such as that of a liftman and the words &#34; returned soldier preferred &#34; have been used in the advertisements. In one case which occurred in  Brisbane,  when  a  returned soldier replied to the advertisement, he was informed- that  the wages to be paid would be from 30s. to 35s. per week, and that this amount, supplemented by his pension, would bring his total emolument up to a living wage of about <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> per week. If my amendment is accepted it will be made clear that it is the intention of the Government to pay returned soldiers at least the rate of wages ruling outside the Public Service. In view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> reply to criticisms of the Bill during the second-reading debate my amendment should meet with the concurrence of the Government. With the best intentions it is possible for anomalies to creep in, and a returned soldier may be engaged upon manual work in the Public Service at a rate considerably less than that ruling outside for the same class of work. Some time last year an anomaly of this kind was brought under the notice of some honorable senators. It appears that some men  engaged in laying down cables in conduits for the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department were paid 8s. 3d. per day, while men engaged at the same work of digging up the road, on the other side, by municipal councils and shire councils, received 10s. per day. We endeavoured to rectify that anomaly by making representations to the Postmaster-General. He shielded himself behind the Public Service Commissioner, and the Commissioner in turn shielded himself behind an award of the Court. He said that an award had been given fixing the wages of these men at 8s. 3d. per day, and he took up the view that in the face of that award they could not be given the wages paid by local authorities for the same work. I welcome the intention to employ as many returned soldiers as possible in the &#34;Public Service, because I have grave fears as to the good effects that are likely to follow the repatriation and other schemes for their benefit. I regard the problem of dealing with the returned soldiers .as one of the most serious which will confront the Commonwealth. We shall have to deal with a large number of men, many of whom will be physically disabled and mentally upset. It will take a long time for them to overcome their mental disturbance and physical defects, and we know that men who have had three years&#39; experience of the soldier&#39;s life will find it difficult to again resume a continuous (avocation. I have said that I have grave doubts as to the good effects likely to follow from the repatriation schemes, despite the good intentions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and the elaborate preparations he is making, and under this Bill we shall have a number of returned soldiers in the position practically of permanent unclassified men in the Public Service, whose interests we ought to consider. In my view, despite Arbitration Court and Wages Boards awards, there can be no justification or defence for paying returned soldiers engaged in manual occupations at a less rate of pay than that ruling outside the Public Service for similar work. We should in the Public Service set an example to outside employers. </para>

The Government should be the model employer, but in many cases it is not. It requires a lot of prodding in many cases to secure conditions of employment in the Government Service that will be equal to those outside. While I make no general and sweeping charge against private employers concerning their treatment of returned soldiers previously in their employ, I do say that many private employers have been guilty of a grave dereliction of duty in this regard. </para>

I have already described the course which is  taken in securing the services of returned soldiers for light jobs, such as those of liftmen and watchmen. The pay offered is from 30s. to 40s. per week, and it is offered as supplementing any pension which may be received from the Defence Department. </para>

Why should a soldier&#39;s pension be considered as supplementing the wages paid to him for services rendered I think the amendment I suggest is sound, and will set an excellent example to employers outside who, be -they many or few, are not now doing the fair thing by returned soldiers, and are not fulfilling the promises they made to men when they enlisted. I find that my amendment should be submitted as an amendment of clause 7, and I shall, therefore, postpone moving it until we come to deal with that clause. </para>

                        <para>. - If the honorable senator wants to effect that amendment, there is a rather better way of doing it, but I ask the Committee to leave the clause as it stands, because men who enlisted were presumably not more than forty-five at the time, and this age limit gives an ample margin of time from the present until they reach fifty-one. If the war should continue longer, as it unfortunately may, there will be plenty of time for Parliament to review the position. There is another three years to run before that would become necessary, and there is no need to open up another possible trouble by altering the age now. The Bill does not mean that a man must apply immediately he returns. He may apply some years afterwards. </para>

It should be remembered that the clause allows as long as twenty-six years in which to apply in the case of those who are now twenty-five years of age. If the war continues for another three years, we can review the provision in the light of experience, if we find it necessary. </para>

                        <para>. - It would perhaps be better to strike out all the words referring to the age limit. I agree that if we are going to give preference to soldiers it should be a genuine preference. A man who went to the war when fifty years of age, or more, may not come back until the fighting is finished, which may not be for a. long number of years yet. He will have to live when he comes back, and will probably prefer work in the service of his country at a fixed salary to having to try to secure employment outside. I am sure that the fact that he made a mistake about his age when enlisting will be overlooked in most cases, but it is best to have no age limit. Some people expected the war to end in three years, but the Germans appear to have taken on war as a permanent national industry. They are determined to fight for expansion, and the Allies are determined to fight them, if necessary, for an indefinite number of years to come. We cannot, therefore, say within measureable distance when the war will terminate, and so cannot tell what age some of these men will be when they return . </para>

In the case of some who go abroad, their services will be very quickly forgotten when they return, unless they are buttressed by an Act of Parliament. That has been our previous experience.

Many men over the age before they started have&#39; done yeoman service at the war. A man who is good enough to fight for his country should not be debarred from preference. The Bill is to give preference to soldiers. Therefore, let us give it to all who have fought for their country, and not to a section. It would be a crying shame if a man of sixty were debarred from taking a position in the Service if he returned well and able to perform the duties. </para>

                        <para>. - It is about time we faced this question of age in a straight out way.. Apparently it is quite correct to throw  the  manual worker on the scrap heap when he is rendered unfit, through age and strenuous service to his employer, but the civil servant is kept in his employment until he reaches a fixed age. I do not object to that, but the man who has gone abroad to fight, and in some cases been wrecked physically, should be entitled, in addition to his small war pension, to the reward attached to the light positions which are available in some Departments, irrespective of his age. The time may come when he &#39; will be no longer 1 able to follow even some qf the light occupations which the Service is alleged to offer. I do not know many of these so-called light occupations, but there may be a few of them. If we are going to refuse men employment merely because of their age, it is time we commenced at the top of the tree, instead of always working from the bottom. Let us start at the top, and discharge everybody when he reaches a certain age, or refuse .to discharge anybody on account of age. The very time when a man will want to come into the Service is when he has been discharged by a private employer. When his private employer tells him that he is no longer required is the time when the Commonwealth, out of its unlimited resources, can afford, in addition to paying him a pension, to maintain him in some light position. I take the Bill to mean that when the period of employment for any temporary men in the Service expires, then, irrespective of whether they are ill or otherwise, and no matter how competent they may be, their employment shall cease, and the positions they hold be given to returned soldiers. In many cases a great deal of hardship will be inflicted by this provision, but tha* appears to me to be quite inevitable. I hope that the Minister will not persist in opposing the amendment, but will agree to give in this clause, as well as in others, a real preference to returned soldiers, not for a day or two, but for as long &#39;as they may live. </para>

                        <para>.- I think that the Minister went rather out of his way in designating this amendment as a placard, because I can assure him that it did not strike me in that light. I have listened very carefully to this discussion. Some statements have been made which I think point clearly to  the  fact that returned men who come back a year or two over fifty years of age will not be on the same plane, and have the same chance as men under that age. The object of striking out the age limit is to give to all returned men an equal chance. The Public Service Commissioner, of course, would have a discretionary power, and I should think tha* it would be used in a common-sense way. If an applicant1 were too old, the Commissioner would have the best reason for refusing to give him preference. To me the amendment does not seem to be in .the nature of a placard, but to be fairly reasonable. </para>

                            <para>- No. I point out that, unless the amendment is made, there may be a number of returned men - perhaps not many - between the ages of fifty and fifty-five years who would be excluded from any preference simply because they had reached the age limit, but to whom even the Minister would desire to give some preference. I do not believe that there would be many cases of this kind, bub I think it is a certainty that there will be a number of cases where, in the absence of the amendment,  men &#39; would be excluded from the Public Service simply because they happened to be a little over the age of fifty years. If the limitation is struck out, it will leave a discretion to the Commissioner,&#39; who can be trusted to exercise common sense. I do not see any reason for the objection raised by the Minister to the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- The &#39; amendment necessarily appeals to one&#39;s sympathy. On each side we are anxious to do the best we can for the returned soldiers, but it seems to me that the amendment, if made, would mix up things a bit. Parliament lias enacted that sixty-five years is the age up to which the public officers shall be allowed to remain in the Public Service. It is a provision of which I have never been in favour, because it is a most unjust one. There are thousands of men who are better public servants at sixty-five years of age&#39; than they were previously, owing to the knowledge they have acquired, and the grasp of things they possess. It is a loss to the Commonwealth that these public officers should have to retire, but that is the law. It is proposed now to enact that men may apply for admission at any age because they are returned soldiers. In my opinion, we should allow such men to apply for admission up to the age to which public servants are allowed to work. At the present time there are hundreds of public officers who, when they reach the age of- sixty-five years, have to be turned out, although many of them have sent three, or six, or seven sons to fight the enemy. Such a man when he reaches the age limit, in spite of the sacrifice he has made for the country, is turned out of his position, and perhaps a returned soldier is put in there just as though the Public Service was a charitable institution. We all know that a number of men have gone to the Front whose age is rather doubtful. It seems to me that the amendment, if carried, will complicate the thing, and instead of helping returned soldiers will do them harm. I suggest&#39; to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> that he should proceed on sensible lines to amend the clause. </para>

                        <para>. - The discussion forces upon one a realization of the difficulties which will be met with hereafter. The Minister characterized the amendment as an absurdity. He pointed out that a public servant at the age of sixty-five years has to retire, but in spite of that provision in the law, here is an amendment which proposes that a returned soldier shall be engaged in his stead. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> painted the picture of a public servant who, although he had sent five sons to the Front, would have to retire from the Public Service on attaining the age limit of sixty-five years, and a returned soldier would take his place. I have already called attention to the case of a man who had five sons at the Front and five more at home, and who was dismissed from a temporary position in the Government Service, or, to use the Minister&#39;s terms, not re-engaged, in order to make way for a returned soldier. </para>

                            <para>- Where is the difference in the application of the amendment? To be consistent with the principle of the Bill the Minister should accept it. It would not be wise, I think, to lay down a hard and fast rule that each returned man should be taken into the Public Service. In Queensland it is not compulsory for the State Government to put into operation the provision as to retirement, but it is a very handy power for the Government to possess if, in their opinion, a public officer at the age of sixty-five years is no longer capable of performing the functions of his office. If they consider that a public officer of that age is doing good work it is not compulsory on their part to retire him, so that there is nothing absurd about this amendment. It is not in the nature of a placard, but is in conformity with a provision in the Bill, and will meet cases of injustice that have occurred to my knowledge. To be consistent the Government should accept the amendment, which I intend to support. </para>

                        <para>. - In my opinion the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was inconsistent with this Bill. Having regard to the provisions of the Public Service Act the Bill is worth nothing at all. I thought it was a Bill to deal with returned soldiers. The greatest blunder I see in it is the proposal to retire public officers at. the age of sixty or sixty-five years. A man has not lost all his faculties when he attains that age. It is ridiculous to require men who have served the Commonwealth for perhaps forty years to get out when they reach the age limit. In New South Wales I have known some boilermakers and carpenters who have had to retire from the Public Service under this absurd regulation go and get employment with private firms, who were glad to have their services. I have never been in favour of an age limit, as I think it is a scandalous provision. I expected that this Bill would make some alteration in that regard, and that is why I support the amendment. If, however, the amendment is defeated, I shall move for the insertion of the word &#34; fifty-five.&#34; I shall do all I can to assist returned soldiers. &#34;Undoubtedly the Government will not be able to employ all of them, and the early comers will receive a preference. I wish to give , a preference to all our returned soldiers, if possible. </para>

                            <para>- The  Chairman  put the question so quickly that I think it possible that several honorable senators were misled. I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> desires to shelve any amendment by a side issue, but rather that it should be defeated or carried on its merits. During the discussion on the Bill several honorable senators expressed the opinion that it would be better to bring the Bill as regards the age limit, into conformity with the Public Service Act by fixing the age at sixty-five years, and possibly they inadvertently omitted to look at the amendment, and did not realize that, if they wished to give effect to their intentions, it should have been withdrawn. </para>

The subject was thoroughly debated, and, as I understood it, the question was whether we should retain the clause as it stood. I am assuming that the vote just recorded was an indication that . the Committee was prepared to accept the clause. If that is not so, I do not want any technicality to stand in the way of the Committee expressing its judgment, but there is nothing to show that the Committee is otherwise than satisfied with the clause as it stands. If, however, that is not so, there is an easy way out of the difficulty, and it is in conformity with our Standing Orders. </para>

Employees in the Public Service are paid rates of wages fixed by the Arbitration Court, and even if there were in office some wickedly disposed Government desirous of sweating a returned soldier, this could not be done, because of the decision of the Arbitration Court, which is the first buttress for Commonwealth; employees. In addition to that, it is provided in the Statutory Rules 1916, No. 309- </para>

                        <para>Notwithstanding anything contained in this regulation, if the rate of pay prescribed for an office named herein is less in any case than the rate determined by an Arbitration Court or Wages Board to be paid for similar employment in the locality of employment, salary cor responding to the latter rate may be paid in such office, upon approval of the Commissioner, instead of the salary prescribed herein. </para>

                    <para>That means that if the schedule rates are lower than outside, the higher rates are to be paid. Under these circumstances it does appear to be unnecessary to seek to put in any special provision for returned soldiers, seeing that they come under the beneficent operation of regulations and the protection of the Court. </para>

                            <para>- So many strange things happen in Queensland that I cannot accept that as an instance. I do not know the local circumstances. But here we have our own Arbitration Court, our own Public Service Act, and we have regulations to deal with these matters. To me it does not seem desirable that we should make a regulation which will apply only to the very small number of persons who will be recruited from the ranks of our returned soldiers. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> probably has in mind returned soldiers of impaired capacity, who are in receipt of pensions, and who may be asked to accept a salary which, in conjunction with their pensions, would constitute a living wage, but which without them, would not. I do not think that he need have any apprehension on that ground. Where a returned soldier derives an income from a pension, that income will not be affected. The Act prescribes that he shall be paid a certain  rate of wage, and he will be entitled to that wage, irrespective of whether he enjoys a pension or not. </para>

But an anomaly undoubtedly exists to-day in the Commonwealth Service, because&#39; in the case of work carried out under the day-labour system &#39; by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, the conduit workers received less than the ruling wage. They were paid only 8s. 3d. per day. </para>

                            <para>- It was largely pick and shovel work, and while the local authorities were employing men on one side of the street, and paying them 10s. per day, the Commonwealth was employing men on the opposite side of the street upon similar work, and paying them only 8s. 3d. per day. The system which prevails now is a pernicious one, and one which ought not to be allowed to operate in the case of temporary employees. I cannot understand what objection the Vice-President of the Executive Council can entertain to my amendment. If he thinks that its adoption would duplicate safeguards, would not that be a good thing? My proposal would prevent manual labourers in the Government employ from being subjected to injustice. The sooner our returned soldiers are absorbed into civil life after their military discharge, the better it will be for all concerned. The amendment is designed to cure an evil which has arisen in the past. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall support the amendment. I do not think we can lay down too many safeguards so far as those who are engaged in manual labour are concerned. It is apparently a revelation to the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the Commonwealth Government does not observe the awards given by the various State Arbitration Courts. I may tell him that some time ago an instruction was issued to the Director of Public Works in New South Wales to secure a number of bricklayers for Canberra. </para>

                            <para>- They had not. As a matter of fact, I was very glad to assist in removing one of them. When I brought this matter under the notice of the Director of Works in Sydney, he refused to pay the train fares of the bricklayers from Sydney to Canberra, although  it was part of the award of the State Arbitration Court that for distances beyond 25 miles from that city such fares should be paid by the employers. It was also part of the award that the men should be paid for the time occupied in travelling to and from their work to Sydney. The same award further made provision for the payment of a nominal sum for tent accommodation. But the Director of Works, acting under instructions from Melbourne, refused to sanction these payments. The claims of the men were brought under the attention of the Minister for Works at the time, but he declined to countenance them. </para>

                            <para>- Later on, the Minister was displaced from office, as I think he deserved to be. Apparently, it is quite right to pay the expenses of permanent officers, but bricklayers are in an altogether different category. Have not bricklayers to maintain wives and families, just as have permanent officials? To this day the bricklayers of whom I speak have not had the award of the State Arbitration Court observed by the Commonwealth. The amendment seeks to prevent either the present or .any other Government from taking advantage of a position of that kind, and consequently I shall support it. </para>

Grant</inline> for the sample case which he has brought forward. If the effect of the amendment would be &#39; what the honorable senator claims, it is well that the Committee should know it. In the particular case championed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> these are the facts: There is a Wages Board in Sydney which deals with the bricklaying industry, and which has laid it down that men working within a certain radius of that city shall be paid the standard wage and a travelling allowance to and from their work at the week-end. </para>

I now mention it myself. I say that there was trouble there two years ago, and I have stated the nature of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> was a member of the Senate at the time, and there was in office a party at all times more than careful to consider the interests of unionists. Can honorable senators believe that any injustice would be done to those men under that Government? If there was any injustice done them let <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> go back to his constituents and tell them that, knowing that an injustice was being done by the Government which he supported, he did not say one word about it. </para>

When the honorable senator tells us that thirty-one members of this Chamber, knowing that an injustice was being done, failed  to secure justice for those concerned, he supplies an indictment against his party as weighty as could be put into words. </para>

I have shown in answer to honorable senators opposite that those in the employ of the Commonwealth Government are amply protected by the. Commonwealth Arbitration Court, by our law, and by the schedule of rates I have read. Further, it is the practice of the Government that where awards of the Arbitration Court or Wages Boards and the Commonwealth law does not apply, to adopt the ruling rate of wages in outside employment. These cases are very rare, because I think there is no State in which there is not now some tribunal appointed to deal with the question of wages. I do not think it necessary or desirable to include in this Bill a special provision with regard to the wages paid to the percentage&#34; of returned soldiers who will be employed in the Public Service, and if any provision of the kind be inserted it should apply to the whole of the Service. </para>

The honorable senator, though perhaps not intentionally, has misled the Committee in his references to the bricklayers employed at Canberra. The fact is that the Commonwealth Government refused to pay those bricklayers the same wages as private employers were paying in New South Wales. They paid them 13s. 6d. instead of 14s. per day.

                        <para>- The award rate was 14s. per day. I brought the matter up here, and saw Minister after. Minister in connexion with it, but there .was always the same stereotyped reply from the Home Affairs Department, and the Government would not rectify the injustice. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has said that I was lacking in my duty if I did not refer to the matter here. I did refer to the matter, and protested against what was being done. After <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> was returned, the men concerned got hold of him, and he brought the matter up also. But the fact remains that we could never get the Commonwealth Labour &#39;Government of that day to observe the award of the Arbitration Court in New South Wales. </para>

The purpose of my amendment is to provide that the Commonwealth Government shall pay to any returned soldier whom they may employ in a temporary capacity wages at a rate not less than the rate ruling for similar work outside. Many instances might be given to show that the Commonwealth and State Governments do not pay wages in accordance with awards of Arbitration Courts and other tribunals. I contend that where the rate of wages ruling for outside employment is higher than that of ,an award under the Public Service Arbitration Act, the Government should be compelled to pay returned soldiers whom they employ at the higher rates ruling outside for similar work. I am not prepared to leave the matter to the Public Service Commissioner, or to any Government or Minister, however well intentioned. </para>

                            <para>- If the Arbitration Court fixes a rate equal to that ruling outside for similar work. I have already given an instance in which the award of the Court was 8s. 3d. per day for conduit workers, for pick-and-shovel work, whilst the ruling rate paid by local authorities for the same work was 10s. per day. We could not get the Postmaster-General to pay the ruling rate to men in the employ of his Department. The question I ask by my amendment is whether the Government will lay it down in this Bill that the rate of wages paid to returned soldiers in the employ of the Government of the Commonwealth shall be not less than the rate ruling outside for similar work? </para>

                        <para>. - If I understand the effect of the amendment aright, it would introduce chaos into Commonwealth employment. We may have twenty or thirty ordinary citizens engaged upon a work under a Commonwealth award, whilst men doing the same class of work for a local authority on the other side of the road may be receiving a higher rate of wages. If a returned soldier is put on to the work being done by the Commonwealth employees, it will be necessary, under the amendment, to pay him at the higher rate paid by the local authority. This could only have the effect of creating discontent amongst the other Commonwealth employees. Surely, when we have established an Arbitration Court to fix a fair rate of wages for Commonwealth employees, if they are not satisfied with the wages paid them, their proper course is to have the matter referred to the Court, and so get their grievance rectified, if they have a grievance. To try to rectify it in the round-about way suggested by the amendment would only create disturbance and discontent in Commonwealth employment. I do not think it will be found that a returned soldier employed by the Commonwealth will expect to be paid at a rate in excess of that received by other employees in the same Service. </para>

                        O&#39;LOGHLIN (South Australia) &#91;6.0&#93;. - At first, I was inclined to consider that no injustice would be done to returned soldiers admitted to the Public Service if they received the ruling rate of wages in the Service. I was impressed by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline>
                        argument that their interests would be amply protected under the Public Service Arbitration Act. But, in contradiction to that, several honorable senators have given concrete cases to show that public servants have not been paid a rate of wages equal to that paid in outside employment for similar work. In the circumstances, it seems to me that if we desire that returned soldiers employed by the Commonwealth shall receive the ruling rate of wages for the work they perform, we should make provision for it in the Bill, and I shall therefore vote for the amendment.

                        <para>. - There is one phase of the question to which I think no reference has yet been made. A great many of our returned soldiers will be, to a greater or less extent, incapable of an ordinary day&#39;s work, and all provisions such as that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> will tend only to prevent the employment of these men in the Public Service. I am well aware that if the door were left wide open to pay men at rates of wages in accordance with their capacity, there would be great danger that the position might be abused by Governments and by private employers: but we ought not to forget that employment, even at a rate somewhat less than the ruling rate of wages, may be a perfect God-send to some returned soldiers who may be incapable of a full day&#39;s work. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> is quite mistaken as to my views on this question. I have admitted that it would be dangerous to open the door too widely in this direction. But we are not dealing with either a minimum or maximum wage at the present time. We are dealing with the employment of returned soldiers, many of whom will be unable, because their nerves have been shattered, or they have been rendered physically unfit, to do an ordinary day&#39;s work in competition with people who are perfectly sound in health. It is of no use to try to make a rule on the basis of sentiment for the returned soldiers if its application may lead to the result that many of our returned soldiers will be prevented by it from obtaining employment in the Public Service. </para>

                            <para>- My objection is that the adoption of these hard-and-fast rules will shut them out. I am &#34;not disposed to reduce any man&#39;s wages; but I am pointing out that it will be a great hardship to thousands of returned soldiers who might he debarred by the amendment from employment in the Public Service because they are unable to perform the work in which they were usually employed as efficiently as they could before they went to the Front. It should be remembered, also, that if such men are employed at the rates paid to men who can do efficient work, the latter will be discontented; and the returned soldier himself, knowing that he is unable to do as much work as those with whom he is associated, may feel that he is employed out of charity. </para>

                            <para>- When these clauses and amendments relating to ruling rates of wages and Arbitration Court awards are being considered, I should like the Committee to consider the men who cannot come up to the standard. The awards that honorable senators are talking about are given with the object that men shall render certain services. Men who are qualified, and can fulfil the conditions the award demands of them, are to get certain wages in return. That is an ordinary business transaction, but we are dealing now with a class of men who are unable to fulfil all the award conditions. I agree with SenatorFerricks that the awards are very good for the ordinary competent person, but I am thinking of the men who are unable to do much, and appeal to the Minister to give them consideration. This is one of the most serious difficulties that we have to contend with, but I do not wish honorable senators opposite to think I want to cut down wages. I only wish we could frame a provision with some safeguards, but I know the dangers. There are the facts, there are the men, and there are the conditions, and it is our duty to provide for them. We should do all we can for the returned men along common-sense practical lines that will be a real benefit to them. If they can fulfil the award conditions, they will get the award rates, but those who cannot fulfil them have to be looked after. If it were only possible, I should like to see cases of that sort provided for by means of permits to work at less than the award rates. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> has raised a very real point, which we cannot afford to ignore. Every one appeared to approve of the repatriation scheme recently introduced, part of which was to train returned disabled men and provide them with employment, but the amendment would completely cut the ground from under that proposal. Men will return in various degrees of disablement, and we want a scheme by which they can be patched up to help them to do some kind of work in the interests of themselves and the country. The most miserable existence to which they could be condemned would be one of perpetual idleness. If they are able to do any kind of work, it is to their interests and the interests of the community to give them preference in Government employment. If we shut them out of the possibility of getting work of that kind, our repatriation scheme must be a failure. We should also bear in mind that this Parliament has very sensibly placed the question of the fixation of wages entirely in the hands of the Arbitration Court. Quite a number of prominent union officials in the Government Service have assured me that the best thing ever done for the civil servants was to bring them within the scope of the Arbitration Act. Before this was done a great deal of the time of Parliament was taken up in discussing questions relating to the wages of civil servants, and we could never reach finality. Parliament is not at all fitted to deal with questions of wages, yet it is now seriously proposed to revert to that state of affairs. </para>

                        <para>. - I am rather- surprised at the uttei&#39;ances of the last two speakers, who have brought in entirely new matter which is not involved in the Bill or in my amendment. I refer to the question of disabled workers. The private employer outside, to my knowledge, has endeavoured to exploit the returned soldier. I have told the Committee what has occurred in those cases, but I did not know until to-day that the Government contemplated a similar policy. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator knows that that method was exploited in the sugar industry for a number of years. That industry employed so-called disabled workers, and kept up the advocacy for their retention most actively, and bitterly for years. If the Commonwealth Government wants to provide for disabled or partially disabled soldiers and sailors it will have to take up national works, and pub them there to carry out national undertakings in the way of production and manufacture. It must not put them in a temporary capacity in the Public Service side by side with able-bodied men doing manual labour. </para>

                            <para>- But my amendment does not aim at discriminating between able-bodied and aged and infirm workers. I object to that sort of discrimination. If a man is not physically fit, he will not be employed to do an able-bodied man&#39;s work. Other avenues will be found for him. If I am asked what those avenues will be, I say that is the responsibility of whatever Government is in power. The Government will have to launch national industries to employ the disabled or partially disabled returned men at such rates of wage as will give them a fair living, not a living under minimum conditions. </para>

                            <para>- That is as much as I ever hope to get from the honorable senator. He is now &#34; unimpressed,&#34; because two other honorable senators have pointed out specific instances where the direction given in , our law is not obeyed. If he accepts those senators&#39; statements as evidence, what proof has he that if we give the direction  a  third time it will be obeyed ? I dispute, altogether, that those honorable senators&#39; statements are correct; but, if they are, it simply means that, although there was a direction in the law that certain wages should be paid, a strong Labour Government refused to pay them. If we put in another clause to the same effect, will it make things any better ? Is it really thought that because it is said again the Government which would not do the thing a year ago, would do it now ? </para>

                            <para>- It is not  a  question of stopping a loophole. It is not that the honorable senator wants the Government to pay a judicially fixed wage at all. It is not that he wants the Government to observe the decisions of the Court, because that is being done already. What he wants to say is that where some body of men can, by contract or otherwise, compel an employer in the neighbourhood to pay a higher wage, then, although the Commonwealth Government is paying the wage fixed by the Arbitration Court, it shall be quite open  to  discard the wage fixed by its own Court, and to follow the wage which a group of men have compelled a private employer to pay. That is the position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> brought forward to-day an instance in a question which he submitted to me. I did not quite catch the full significance of the case when he was reading the report  of a  telegram from Hughenden - </para>

                            <para>- We have had the same thing in dozens of cases here. We had a notable instance the other day, where a coaling battalion was formed in order to load coal. It promised that it would not strike no matter what happened, that its labour would always be available to load the transports. In consideration of an assurance that right through the period of the war their labour would be available to load the boats, the Navy Department paid the battalion a bonus; that is a higher price per ton of the coal to be handled. But the battalion no sooner got that concession than its members used it as an argument to compel the private owners, to whom they had given no promise as to continuity of labour, to raise the rates which they were paying. The only thing I marvel at is that the battalion did not immediately go round to the Navy Office and say &#34; Now that you have the promise, and the others have not- </para>

I am speaking on this clause because it illustrates how &#39; easily confusion may be caused, as not very many honorable senators will remember that when the principal Act was amended section 70 had another section added to it.

                        <para>. - I quite share with the honorable senator his recognition &#39; of the convenience in the form of presenting Bills with which the older members of the Senate, at any rate, are familiar, namely, of showing in bold type the effect of proposed amendments on sections of the principal Act. I do not know, however, that the practice was invariably followed with regard to Acts which were not under what one might call comprehensive revision, and when the purpose of amendments were obvious. It has also to be remembered that a reprint, covering many pages, of sections sought to be amended might unduly load the printing bill. At the same time, I appreciate the simplicity of the method referred to, and in future, when amending Bills are under consideration, I will see how far we may  be  justified in meeting the convenience of honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>. - It has hardly been the invariable practice of the Senate to receive with amending Bills memoranda showing in bold type the sections of principal Act proposed to be amended. In the early days of Federation this custom was adopted, and it was reverted to more recently. We might adhere to that practice now, because we have been amending our legislation in various particulars very frequently of late, and the consolidated Statutes, which appeared in two volumes and which were published quite recently, are already out of date. </para>

                    <para class="block">I dare say 70a, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> referred, does not even appear in those volumes. It is desirable, therefore, as far as possible, to follow the procedure indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe.</inline> It is not necessary to overload the printing bill. It will be sufficient if the prints which are circulated for the information of honorable senators are confined entirely and exclusively to those particular sections sought to be amended and if they indicate the deletion, addition, or alterations intended to be provided for in the amending Bill. Once an Act has been amended to any extent, it has been the custom to reprint it, with its amendments appearing as an appendix, in the next subsequent annual volume of the Statutes, but such a reprint is only authorized when the amendments are of a serious character, the degree of seriousness being measured apparently by the law officers of the Crown, as sometimes an i Act . has been amended, but the amended Act has never been reprinted. A few years ago - in 1914 - all our Statutes, together with amending legislation, were printed in two volumes, but, as I have already stated, they are now out of date, because a great deal of our legislation during the last few years has been in the direction of amending Acts or Statutes. As a matter of fact, we have had the experience of a Bill being passed and a further amendment introduced before the original Bill received the assent of the Governor-General. </para>

                    <para class="block">I intimated during my second-reading speech why I should like this new clause added to the Bill. I know I will not be successful, but 1 can at all events make an attempt. My desire is to protect two classes of the community, namely, those who have sons at the Front, and those who may have offered but were not accepted for active service. I know very well that in some cases employees whose services have been dispensed with have been able to get back to the Public Service, but when this Bill becomes law there will be very little chance of such men again obtaining employment. I do not want the clause to apply to anybody else. It might be said that we could provide that this should not apply to those who had not volunteered, but that is not my object at all. I want to insure protection for two sections of the public who may be injured by the operation of this Bill, and I think I shall have the cordial co-operation of the soldiers in this matter. I believe in extending to them every preference that we can without injuring others who have volunteered for service, but have been rejected. </para>

                        <para>. - In the first place, I desire to point out that the new clause proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> would be quite useless. It would confer no protection upon anybody. It would not apply to the permanent officer, and could apply only to the temporary employee. Now the Public Service Commissioner does not dismiss the temporary employee, and will not dismiss him under this Bill. What will happen is that, at the end of his nine months&#39; term, the casual employee will leave the Service automatically by reason of the provisions of the Public Service Act. He will then stand outside the door of our public Departments waiting to be re-employed. But we have said that he shall not be re-employed. </para>

My honorable friends opposite take up the position that) they will give the returned soldier preference for a job if nobody else wants it. The insertion of the proposed new clause will not assist matters one way or the other. It is not) even entitled to the dignity of a chip in porridge.

                            <para>- No. Where there are two applicants for a job, and one is a returned soldier, the returned soldier should get it. But there is a great difference between that position and discharging a man to make room for a returned soldier. </para>

I desire to extend preference to returned soldiers, but I do not wish to see injustice done to worthy officials in our Public Service. All that our returned soldiers ask is that when any officer drops out of the Service they shall be granted a preference in the filling of the vacancy. It is a very fair thing that they should be given that preference. But they do not desire to leave it open to the Public Service Commissioner to discharge officials to. make room for them. </para>

                        <para>. - Judging by the reception that has been accorded to Senator McDougall&#39;s proposal by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, we must regard this Bill as being very nearly perfect. The honorable gentleman has claimed that every amendment which has been moved has been quite unnecessary. The Vice-President of the Executive Council also spoke of the difference between the actual discharge of a temporary employee and a refusal to re-engage him. I dealt with that aspect of the matter this afternoon. I then pointed out that, instead of the Public Service Commissioner actually discharging a man, he would refuse to re-engage him. But a case has since come under my notice in which a casual employee in one of our Federal Departments has actually been dismissed. At an earlier stage of the debate I made some reference to this man, who is the father of ten children. Five of his sons have gone to the war., and two of them have been killed there. This man, who was employed as a temporary clerk, has had his services dispensed with in order to make room for a returned soldier. </para>

                    <para>In the &#34; Win-the-war &#34; policy adopted by the Government, I am not aware what you and the Public Service Commissioner, officers holding high rank in the Service, have done towards that end. I feel persuaded that my family contribution will compare favorably with either or any officer in your Department. </para>
                    <para>I have four sons at the front, two of them &#34; Anzac Heroes,&#34; who have made the full sacrifice, a third son wounded in action, and is now in an English hospital, a fourth somewhere in France, a fifth son in England,, conscripted, but exempted up to the last time of hearing;  a  total of five sons already involved; in addition, there is a further liability of haying five other sons taken under conscription, which now appears imminent, and which is apparently the only way. </para>
                    <para>As this is the first engagement I have had under the Commonwealth since I registered for employment on the 15th September, 1908, allowing for transfer from the Census Bureau, having more than once applied in writing on personal grounds to the Commissioner for employment without receiving an acknowledgment, although I have been employed by the State Government for five and a half years, during that time giving effective service, for which I hold first-class references from the different Departments. </para>
                    <para>My sons, in fighting for King and country, and home and freedom, had reasonable expectations that their father would have granted to him the usual privileges allowed temporary officers, including length of service. I know some of my colleagues have been engaged over two years. It will not be two years until the 4th October, 1017,&#34; since Istarted. </para>

                            <para>- There was a reason for the provision, and if the reason was not sufficient there is a proper way for those opposed to the provision to proceed for its repeal. The reason for the provision was brought very prominently before public notice by the fact that people seeking casual employment remained in the Public Service month after month, and year after year, until they became out of touch with outside employment. It was considered that they had practically acquired a vested interest, and in hundreds of cases it was urged that, they had become so used to the routine of the Public Service that it would be a. positive hardship to turn them adrift upon the world when they were practically unfitted for anything else than the job which they had learned in the Service. Parliament, therefore, decided, in the interests alike of  the Public Service, the community, and the casual employees themselves, that there should be a limit of time within which their temporary employment would terminate. I am not saying whether that provision was right or wrong, as that is immaterial to my argument. There it is, and I have given the reasons why Parliament adopted it. I said just now, by way of interjection, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Yates</inline> had been employed for over two years in the Public Service. I may have been wrong in saying so, but he was employed, at auy rate, for over eighteen months, which is much longer than the period allowed by the law. According to his letters, it would appear that he was given notice to quit. He was given nothing of the kind. The period during which he might continue in his -temporary employment had ceased under the operation of the law, but it had been extended in every possible way in order to help him. When the period for which he was last appointed was approaching an. end, in accordance with the usual practice of the Departments, he received an intimation that at the end of the week his services would be no longer required. The period of employment to which, he was en-titled terminated without that notice, but, according to his letter, he was given the notice, and turned adrift in order to make room for a returned soldier. That is an absolute distortion of the facts. He left the Service because the law required him to leave, and having left it, an opportunity was afforded to give preference in employment to a returned soldier, and a returned soldier was appointed to the position. </para>

What has happened is that we have been dodging the law in the past, and not infrequently, under the influence of political pressure. All that is asked is that the law shall operate, and that returned soldiers shall be given the opportunity to obtain these positions which, by the operation of the law, become vacant, but which, if our honorable friends opposite had their way, would become the perquisite of the men already in possession of them. If honorable senators desire that returned soldiers shall have preference only for future positions, and no right to a look in for positions already existing, let them say so. For my part, I hold that, according to the creed of the present Government, and I believe of the people of the Commonwealth, the returned soldier should have a preferential right to all casual jobs which are going. </para>

                        amendment was put, voted with a view to extending the age by five or ten years later on. You, sir, very properly ruled that that could not be done after the Committee had decided that the word &#34; fifty &#34; should remain as part of the clause.. I hope that the Government will give those who voted against the amendment, with the intention of extending the time beyond fifty years, an opportunity to have the matter reconsidered.

                    <para>. - Always when an amending Defence Bill is brought before Parliament it is thought that some danger to our civil lives and occupations lurks behind its provisions, however simple. I did not hear the Minister&#39;s second-reading speech, but I read it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and have gone carefully through the Bill. 1 have found no hidden danger lurking be-&#39; hind it. Many of its provisions ought to have been incorporated in the Defence Act years ago. The clause embodying&#39; the principle of the Military Decorations Bill that had such a stormy passage in this Senate some years ago has my hearty accord, as it had at that time. I was behind the Minister then, believing that it was an evil that anybody should Be allowed to traffic in military decorations. The opponents of that Bill argued that if a man become hard up he. had a right to sell his decoration for anything it would fetch; and the Minister offered to put in an amendment to provide that the Government should purchase the decoration at its face value. That did not satisfy the opponents of the Bill, and it was dropped. It is degrading to see military decorations in pawn-shop windows as one goes along the street; and I shall give my hearty support to the &#39; provision dealing with that question. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The provision for the promotion of officers simply allows a man who has returned from the Front, after gaining rank by merit, to get that rank in our Citizen Forces without further examination. Such , men have proved on the battle-field that they are worthy of promotion in the Citizen Forces. </para>
                <para>Another clause provides for morning drills for senior cadets. During the last election, one of the points I made on the platform everywhere was that if returned we should try to do something to make the training as simple and easy for the lads as possible, giving them the recreation that they should have. A number of drills have been held on Saturday mornings. Many private employers have responded to the call of the Military Department by paying the lads for the time lost. Others have not done so. This Bill provides that, whenever apprentices, leave their work on a Saturday morning to prepare themselves for the defence of their country, their employer must be patriotic enough to pay <inline font-style="italic">them</inline> for the time lost. It will not amount to much in each case. The Minister said it would be impossible for the Government to take it upon themselves to reimburse the lads because of the great difficulties in the way, and I believe it. &#39; The employers should be patriotic enough to do it, and according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> they are doing very well in this country. No business is suffering a loss in its transactions, and  invested capital is showing a good profit everywhere. The employers who do pay the lads&#39; wages should not be penalized on account of those who will not pay. The Bill in that respect has my hearty cooperation and support. </para>
                <para>The only other alteration I see makes provision for the imposition of the death penalty. According to the Minister-, the death penalty is not in our Defence Act for any offences, but is in the Army Act. </para>

                        <para>- I took it, from reading the Minister&#39;s speech, that it did. If we are working under the Army Act, we must abide by its conditions. They may be harsh in some cases; but war is war, and to carry it to a successful issue there must be certain penalties for offences. I see nothing in this Bill that will injure anybody. All its provisions are for the good of the military service, and for the good of the country. </para>

                        <para>-Colonel BOLTON.- I realize that Ministers charged with the control of affairs of State have at present a very strenuous and anxious time, and are entitled to support and encouragement in carrying out their grave and responsible public duties; but it does not follow that a blind support of all their proposals is the best means of assisting them. I should like to make clear my attitude to the Government in general, and this Bill in particular. As a Ministerial supporter during the recent election, I emphasized on all occasions the importance of the first plank - win the war- in the policy of the party, because if we did not carry out our duty in that regard the other part of the political platform would not be considered by loyal Britishers. </para>

                            I am trying to lead up to the subject of the Bill. The win-the-war policy laid it down as the duty of the Government to use the whole of the resources of Australia in men, money and material to assist the British Empire and our Allies to win the war. There was no ambiguity about that statement. It was clear, definite and decisive, implying the organization of national effort for that purpose, and carrying with it the maximum military energy and activity that this country was capable of producing. But under the Defence&#39; Act and this amending Bill we are not applying the maximum of our military activity towards the purpose of winning the war, for which the Ministry are pledged to the people. I shall endeavour to show that that is so, and why it is so, and how in considering the Bill it can be made possible to a very large extent to increase very considerably the measure of our military activity for war purposes. I presume that that is the desire of the Government. I understand that the estimated national expenditure for 1917-18 is something like &#163;97,000,000, or over &#163;30,000,000 more than the expenditure of the last financial year.

                        <para>- I understand, sir, that the amendments in this Bill deal with certain acts of the Defence Department governing the conditions of its members and those employed on training work. I believe that at the termination of the war our ideas on the fundamental principles of naval and military defence will need to be readjusted. In that readjustment, which I feel sure is bound to take place, by reason of our experience gained in this dreadful war, I sincerely hope that the first fundamental change will be to place the military burden for the safety of this country upon the nation&#39;s manhood, and not upon the fragile bodies of our children. Again, we are spending enormous sums of money on matters which may be absolutely useless at the termination of the war. We may find that the hundreds of thousands of pounds which we are spending to-day and providing for in the expenditure for this year will be so many golden sovereigns thrown away on the mud banks of our extensive coast-line. </para>

I have looked carefully at the Bill, and can find no reference in it to section 125 of the Act. I would point out to the honorable senator, too, that he is trying to connect public expenditure with a provision that employers must pay their employees for the time which they have spent on training. That is not public expenditure at all. </para>

                        <para>- An amendment of section 148 of the Act will be found in the Bill on page 15. In introducing these amendments the other day the Minister said he was sure that the Senate would give him power to reward the services of men by promoting them to commissioned rank in the Permanent Forces. That is a very right and very proper proposal. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not know whether honorable senators understand the position. But to me it seems an extraordinary thing that members of the Forces who, on active service, have usually a very safe and very soft job. - that is, the non-combatants - should be rewarded with appointments to positions in the Permanent Forces of this country, and that the men who are doing- all the work and taking all the risks in the trenches - that is, the combatant members of the Forces - should not be entitled to receive that privilege. </para>

                        <para>.- Why should we abrogate the rule that was laid down by Lord Kitchener&#39;s report for non- combatants - that is, ordnance people, clerks, veterinary officers, and horse doctors? It is monstrous that the men who take all the risks, do the most work, and give the best results should get no reward, and that the men who have the soft jobs, as they apparently always have in this country, should get the best of things. Honorable senators apparently do not quite understand the situation. There are quite a number of warrant and noncommissioned officers of the Permanent Forces of Australia who have gone to the Front on active service, and who, by their courage, intelligence, and personality have won high promotion and distinction. These men are to return to Australia and to revert to the rank of sergeant-major. Yet the non-combatants, who have done nothing of that nature, can -come back and be made permanent officers in the Permanent Forces. I do not see how the Minister can justify such a proposal. Here are a few names on a long list of warrant and non-commissioned officers who have distinguished themselves at the front: - <inline font-weight="bold">Major Treacey,</inline> who was a sergeantmajor; <inline font-weight="bold">Major Marsden,</inline> D.S.O. ; and Lt.-Colonel Paul, D.S.O. These men went from here as honorary officers - lieutenants. It shows how fortunate this country was in the class of men it had as warrant and; non-commissioned officers when these sergeant-majors can, on all fours with the most highly trained Forces in Europe, gain great distinction and honour. I think that the country ought to be very proud of them. It is an old British saying that the non-commissioned officer is the backbone of the British Army. It looks to me as if the noncommissioned officer of the Australian Forces is not only the backbone, but the brain, of the Australian Army. Yet these men are not to have the privilege of obtaining a permanent commission in the Australian Forces when they come back from the Front. </para>

It has been introduced in good faith by the Government to improve the Defence Act by making it more in consonance with requirements shown to be necessary by the present war. We welcome the fullest criticism from both sides of the Senate in order to make the Act what it should be I hope, therefore, that the honorable senator will accept my assurance that no criticism will be regarded as unfriendly or that it has been offered in any other spirit than a desire to improve the measure. </para>

                <para>Section 148 of the principal Act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following proviso: - &#34; Provided also that members of the Permanent and Citizen Forces, who are not graduates of the Military College, may, subject to such conditions as are prescribed, be appointed or promoted to be officers in the non-combatant branches of the Permanent Forces, including the Medical, Veterinary, Ordnance, Survey, and Clerical branches.&#34; </para>
                <para class="block">The honorable senator seemed to think that because the words &#34;Australian Imperial Force &#39; &#39; are not there the members of the Australian Imperial Force are necessarily debarred from those positions, but that is not the case at all, because another clause makes provision for the appointment of officers who have served in the Australian Imperial Force to positions in the Citizen Forces.

                        <para>- I will give the reasons. The honorable senator has misread the clause if he thinks that it debars any officer who is suitable from receiving an appointment because he is not now a member of the non-combatant branch either of the Citizen Forces or the Australian Imperial Force. There are many men serving as combatant officers in the Australian Imperial Force who in civil life are medical practitioners. One case well known to me is that of a gentleman who elected to serve, not as a medical officer, but as a combatant. Under this clause he would be eligible for appointment to the non-combatant branch of the medical service, but the clause does not mean that only persons who have served as non-combatants in the present war would be eligible for appointment to noncombatant positions in the Permanent Forces. </para>

                <para>If honorable senators will take their minds back to the groundwork of our Defence Act, and if they will read Lord Kitchener&#39;s report, supplemented later by the report from General Ian Hamilton, they will know that the scheme for supplying officers for the permanent branch of the Defence Forces comprehended the establishment of a Military College for the training of permanent combatant officers. Now it is obvious that, if we are going to staff our Permanent Forces with officers from that college, we must know how many are likely to be required each year, and I recommend honorable senators to read Lord Kitchener&#39;s report concerning the Military College before they come to a decision concerning this matter. If they will do that, they will see the need for a certain establishment of permanent combatant officers, and will realize also that the Military College is based on the principle of taking in so many students each year, in order to supply the requisite numbers. If now we vitiate the principle laid down in that report, and which led up to the establishment of the Military College,  by introducing another method for the supply of permanent officers - that is to say, if officers who have served in the present war are to be eligible for appointment to the permanent branch of the Defence- Force -there will then be two sources of supply. From one we will know exactly how many officers may be obtained each year; but the other will be practically without limit, because thousands of officers have served - and, I am proud to say, have distinguished themselves - in this war. </para>

                        <para>- Well, what would be the result? I remind the honorable senator that permanent officers have also served in this war, and, I am glad to say, many have distinguished themselves. Some have won rank in the Australian Imperial Force far above the Tank they held in the Permanent Forces. Are they to retain that rank, or go back to the rank they held in the Permanent Forces? We have men who were majors in the Permanent Forces, but now&#39; hold the rank of brigadier-general in the Australian Imperial Force. One, who went as colonel in the Permanent Forces, now holds the rank of major-general in the Australian Imperial Force. Will that officer retain his Australian Imperial Force rank? If so, I point out that we will be creating this position in the Permanent Forces. Practically the whole of our permanent officers asked, and, indeed, begged, to be allowed to go to the war, but many were retained in Australia against their wishes, in order to carry on the Work of preparing and training our soldiers. They have done their part, and, because the Government of the day did not allow them to go to the Front, they are still holding the rank they previously held in the Permanent Forces; while brother officers, who were allowed to go to the Front, have risen to the rank of brigadier-general, in the Australian Imperial Force. Are such officers to retain their Australian Imperial Force rank in the Permanent Forces ? </para>

                <para>I sympathize with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton&#39;s</inline> desire to give officers from the Australian Imperial Force every consideration, and I hope he will accept my assurance that I do not regard his criticism as hostile. I again ask honorable senators to read Lord Kitchener&#39;s report, so that they may appreciate exactly the relation of our Permanent Forces to our Citizen Forces. They will then see that the course suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> is full of difficulties, and would, create a crop of injustices. It would open the door to political influence, because a very small section of these officers can foe so appointed. The number of our permanent officers is infinitesimal when compared with the number of officers in the Australian Imperial Force who will be available after thewar. </para>

If the honorable senator will look at these non-combatant positions, he will find that none of them&#39; can be filled by graduates from the Military College. Graduates there do not learn veterinary science, for example. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is for the regimental officers, but I would point out that Australia&#39;s Army is not a permanent Army. It is a citizen force, to be led in time of war by citizen officers. This is what I have had difficulty in getting the public of Australia to appreciate when I have been resisting pressure to send away&#39; permanent officers who are wanted here. The <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> of the permanent officer in Australia is that of an instructor to the citizen officers. That is why we shall have to rely in time of war on citizen officers and a citizen army. The permanent officer has to be an instructor not merely in the duties of a regimental officer, but in staff and administrative duties as well. The training that he gets at the Military College fits him to be not merely a regimental officer for which the training of the citizen officer fits him, but it also qualifies him for staff work and for the administrative work that is associated with it. </para>

                        <para>- The most brilliant staff officer in the Australian Citizen Forces to-day is Major-General White, who passed through the Staff College at Camberley, England. I do not know of a single citizen officer who is doing staff work on General Birdwood&#39;s staff to-day. Whenever it became my duty to appoint a citizen officer, almost invariably the first request he made to me was that he should be granted a permanent officer as adjutant to do his staff work. That request was made because the citizen officer realized that the permanent officer had an opportunity . to acquire training in administrative and staff work which he himself had not. However I shall deal with this phase of the matter more particularly in Committee. I ask honorable senators not to allow their sympathies to cause them to wreck a fundamental principle underlying our defence scheme, without full consideration of its consequences </para>

The idea of the late Lord Kitchener was that these Staff College graduates would first go out as area officers ; that they would then become brigade-majors; and that subsequently they would fill the higher positions of staff officers in the various districts. I ask honorable senators to read Lord Kitchener&#39;s report and his recommendations in regard to the Military College. </para>

I take this opportunity of rectifying that omission. The position in regard to the death penalty is that section 98 of the principal Act says - </para>
                <para>No member of the Defence Force shall be sentenced to death by any court martial except for mutiny, desertion to the enemy or traitorously delivering up to the enemy any garrison, fortress, post, guard, or ship, vessel, or boat, or traitorous correspondence with the enemy; and no sentence of death passed by any court martial shall be carried into effect until confirmed by the Governor-General. </para>
                <para>That shows the class of offences for which the death sentence may be passed. Now, the Imperial Army Act goes farther than that. </para>

                        <para>- It imposes the death penalty for certain offences other than those mentioned in our Act. But there is a provision in our Defence Act which says that the Imperial Army Act shall apply &#34; except so far as it is inconsistent with this Act.&#34; As therefore the Imperial Army Act is inconsistent with our Defence Act to the extent that it imposes the death penalty for certain offences which are not included in our Act, obviously it cannot apply to Australian soldiers. This Bill will not alter that position at all. It will apply the Imperial Army Act in certain regards, but it will always be governed by the provision in the principal Act to which I have referred. I wish honorable senators to be quite clear that the death penalty will not be extended by this Bill, and that the position in that regard will remain the same as it is now. </para>

                    <para>That this Bill be now read a second time, I should like to take the opportunity of saying that I appreciate the readiness with which the Senate on very short notice, and very scanty information, has exhibited a willingness to assist the Government in passing this measure, which is an urgent one in the sense that it proposes to give the Government authority to raise certain sums for purposes which I will indicate a little later. The urgency arises from the fact that the Government have received information from their London advisers that for reasons which are sound and good it is eminently to be desired that this Bill should be proceeded with, if possible, to-night, in order that it may be known within the next few hours that the Bill has passed, so that immediate application may be made for the money in London. No doubt, that advice has been given as the result of knowledge which those at Home possess as to the financial position there, and the Government are accepting that advice as entirely <inline font-style="italic">bona fide.</inline> In the circumstances, we feel justified in asking Parliament to deal with this measure in the shortest possible time. </para>
                    <para>The Bill is the result of an agreement arrived at some time ago between the Commonwealth and five of the States. No doubt, honorable senators remember the general purport of that agreement. It was one under which the States concerned agreed that the Commonwealth should be the sole borrower in London, whilst the Commonwealth, on its part, undertook to raise certain sums to enable the States to carry out their public works policy. On the 6th November, 1915, the agreement made was that &#163;7,450,000 should be provided for the calendar year 1917, but at a later period the State Governments agreed that this amount should be reduced to &#163;5,400,000. The calendar year 1917 is already far advanced, and this Bill proposes to give the Commonwealth authority to raise that sum, and &#163;2,600,000 more towards the amount which the Commonwealth Government have agreed to find for the ensuing year. It has undertaken to find a larger amount for the States for 1918, but authority is sought now to raise only &#163;2,600,000 to place the Commonwealth in a position to anticipate its obligations in respect of that year. It will obviously be necessary for the Government to again approach Parliament for further authority to raise an additional amount which, if the present agreement with the States Government remains in force, it will be necessary to raise to supply the States Governments during 1918. </para>
                    <para>There is one matter in the Bill to which I desire to direct attention. . It will be noticed that by clause 6 authority is given to the Government pending the flotation of the loan, which will follow on the passage of this Bill, to divert certain moneys in the Treasury, being a portion of the amount loaned to the Commonwealth by the Imperial Government, for the purpose of making early payments to the&#39; </para>
                    <para>States Governments pending the receipt of the money which the passage of this Bill will place at our disposal. This is merely a bookkeeping transaction, but it is necessary that the Government should have Parliamentary authority for it. </para>
                    <para>The next clause asks Parliament to approve of the Bill being assumed to have passed on the 30th May. The reason for this is that the authority sought by the Bill has already been anticipated in order to keep the State Governments going. It has been necessary to anticipate this authority to make advances to the State Governments from time to time, in conformity with the agreement. In other words, they have already been paid a portion of the amount authorized to be raised under this Bill. Just how much they have already been paid I do not know at the moment, but it is not very material. The urgency of the measure does not arise from this, but from the necessity pressed upon the Government by their London advisers that they should immediately have authority to place upon the London market an application for this loan money. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable senators on this side do not intend to offer any opposition to the passage of this Bill through all its stages without delay. The explanation of the measure given by the Vice-President of the Executive Council shows that it is absolutely necessary to pass the Bill, and it is one of the proposals which I agree will do some little towards winning the war. Honorable senators on this side will at all times have the greatest pleasure in assisting the Government to pass without delay any measures of this description calculated to help in winning the war. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt that is so, but they stated that they did not need any money coming through Commonwealth hands. Since then the position has altered, and they are now standing in with other States in an agreement which entitles them to an amount which I expect to be able to disclose in a few minutes. Whilst the Queensland Government on the previous occasion intimated that they did not desire financial assistance from the Commonwealth by way of loan, that State was yet a party to the agreement. New South Wales, on the other hand, declined to be a party to it, and her representatives said they would make their own arrangements. They are doing so. I have nothing to say on that aspect of the matter now. The loan money that will be. raised under this Bill will be raised in accordance with the arrangement between the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments, exclusive of the Government of New South Wales. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has suggested, the New South Wales Government have taken their own course, and are making their own arrangements, but that in no sense relieves the Commonwealth Government from their obligations to complete the arrangement entered into with the Governments of the other five States. It is to enable them to do that that this Bill is before honorable, senators. </para>

                        <para>. -  I have some information which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maughan</inline> very reasonably desired to obtain. The &#163;5,400,000 which the Commonwealth has undertaken to find for the States for the present calendar year is made up of the following items. I trust that the smallness of the amount to go to Victoria will not deter any Victorian representative from supporting the Bill, because the figures are those which were arrived at at the Conference. The amounts are - Victoria, &#163;414,000 ; Queensland, &#163;1,735,000; South Australia, &#163;1,385,000; Western . Australia, &#163;1,466,000; Tasmania, &#163;400,000. These figures make up the total of &#163;5,400,000, and, as I intimated a short time ago, the difference between that sum and the &#163;8,000,000 which this Bill authorizes the Government to raise is the amount which we are seeking authority to obtain to enable us to meet our engagements under a similar agreement for next year. We have added 50 per cent. to the amount of &#163;5,400,000  to enable us to meet those obligations, and Queensland will obtain  &#163;2,602,000  out of the amount covered by this Bill. </para>
