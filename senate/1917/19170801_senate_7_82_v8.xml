The rule has been laid down here that questions must only be asked for the purpose of obtaining information, and that the replies must be couched so as to give information only. Following that rule, it is not permissible for an honorable senator to make a statement of fact, or alleged facts,' or anything else, but simply to ask for information. </para>

                            <para>- I will leave that' bit out. Further, in view of the adoption of prohibition by the people of eight out  of the nine Provinces of Canada, either permanently, or for the period of the war and demobilization, will the Government exercise its powers to stop the manufacture, importation, and sale of intoxicating liquors in Australia for the remaining period of the war, and the time of repatriation and demobilization? That is in order, I take it. </para>

I may add that it is practically impossible to fix the price of meat unless the price of live stock is also fixed. The interests of the community in this matter will be most carefully safeguarded by the Government. </para>

            <para class="block">Some reference has been made to patriotic work in connexion with Red Cross and War Chest Funds. No man has a higher appreciation than I of the splendid services rendered in this direction by many large-hearted men and women in this country, and no man knows better than the Minister in charge of the Bill that this patriotic work is something apart and distinct from the ameliorative work and the repatriation of returned soldiers. If the Minister carries out his intention, as. outlined in the Bill, it seems to me that patriotic work will become a national industry, and that thousands of pounds will be expended in printing, advertising,, management, and in other directions. As a matter of fact, we shall be establishing another and an unnecessarily expensive system of raising funds which might very well be undertaken by the  elaborate machinery of the Taxation Department already at the disposal of the Government. The Minister has expressed the belief that if we discontinue this patriotic effort we shall dry up the wellsprings of public generosity. If the Government were to establish one general fund under Government control, the effect would be to create confidence in the minds of the public and to stimulate rather than restrict public generosity. </para>

            <para class="block">I am satisfied that this is typical of thousands of similar cases in Australia to-day, and, therefore, I say that some means should be adopted in connexion with these funds other than that proposed  of placing them in the hands of voluntary committees in different districts for distribution within those districts. The Minister has said that he has a guarantee from a certain man, whose guarantee is worth having, that he will give £10,000 if he is permitted to spend it in a certain district in his own way. Why should this man limit his generosity to those in an area of a few miles in a particular locality ? By the course he proposes to follow he would, I do not say intentionally, but inevitably become a little tin god in his own district That is nob the kind of generosity that u required in dealing with this great national question. What is required is a spirit of generosity as wide as the confines of the Commonwealth itself, and an atmosphere of benevolence as pure and free as the air we breathe. Selfish action such as has been suggested should nob be tolerated in connexion with this great national question of repatriation. </para>
            <para>I hope that in the circumstances honorable senators will agree to set aside the idea of giving local committees power to raise funds to be dispersed in the way proposed in the Bill. My amendment, if agreed to, would make suitable provision for carrying out work of a very important character. The local committees, under my proposal, would initiate the work which has really to be done by the State Boards. These committees, by reason of their local knowledge and their knowledge of individuals and their circumstances, would necessarily be in a position to supply the most accurate information with regard to any case of repatriation. This should be the special duty of these local committees.  as previously suggested, their areas should represent one or more battalion areas of a military district. In these areas there should be some institution or building which would become the centre of their activities. There should be some building in which a paid official would be located to attend to the requirements of returned soldiers and their dependants. These institutions should form a centre for applications by returned soldiers or their dependants in a particular area. Let me invite the attention of honorable senators to such an institution which at present exists in Ballarat. It has leased a building, and has in attendance a paid secretary, who acts as an official medium between the returned soldiers and the citizens of Ballarat and district. As he is a man familiar with the procedure, I venture to say that he attends to hundreds of cases of pay, pension, and amelioration on behalf of returned soldiers and their dependants which require attention and which, but for his services, would not receive the attention they deserve. This institution employs five or six returned soldiers, and is almost self supporting. It has a man in charge of a tobacconist shop, a hairdressing saloon, a billiard saloon, and there is also the caretaker and secretary. All these men are returned soldiers. </para>

I offer a cordial invitation to the Vice-President of the Executive Council to visit the Ballarat Returned Soldiers' Institute, and satisfy himself that it is an important factor in dealing with the returned soldier. If such an institution can be established in one centre, similar institutions may be established wherever they are required. I earnestly ask honorable senators not to give power to local committees to raise and disburse funds in the way proposed by the Bill. In my view, that is the wrong way to carry out this work. I have repeatedly said that the Government should establish one central fund, and that the returned soldier has a right to look to the Government for the assistance he requires. </para>

It is a proposal to strike out words which would enable a local committee, if it so desired, to raise funds, and to substitute words which have no relation whatever to the question of funds. The honorable senator wishes to insert words which set out what shall be the duties of the local committees. </para>

                <para>Let me deal first with the question of funds. I ask honorable senators to recollect that under this scheme the Government propose to take upon their own shoulders the repatriation of our returned soldiers. But even if the Government did that work twice over, there would still be a number of citizens in this country, who, in addition to the contributions which they will make as taxpayers, would be anxious to do something for the returned soldiers in their midst. If the honorable senator really holds the view which he has expressed, he must go to the extent of saying that he will make it a punishable offence for a private citizen to be guilty of anything in the nature of private generosity, in the direction of helping a returned soldier. I do not go so far as that. The Government will take upon their shoulders the financial responsibility of this work, but we will not prevent either an individual or a group of individuals from supplementing that work. I am not prepared to impose a prohibition on any citizen who desires to supplement the efforts of the Government on behalf of our returned soldiers. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator insists upon private contributions being paid into the central fund, he will not be giving a penny to our returned soldiers. He will merely be easing the strain on the Treasury. The Government will find the money for the central fund, and every pound paid into it by private citizens would mean a drain of a pound less upon the Treasury. As soon as the public realized that, what would be the position? They would not contribute at all. There is only one way to open the wellsprings of private generosity towards our returned soldiers, namely, by saying that while the Government will do what is essential in the. matter of repatriation, if private generosity chooses to give an additional helping hand to our soldiers, that helping hand must be given in accordance with regulations. Those regulations are provided for in this subclause which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> wishes to amend. The honorable senator has mentioned some of the disabilities which attach to existing patriotic funds. I am quite aware of those disabilities. That is the reason I have provided that no funds of this kind shall be collected, except' in accordance with regulations. ' We wish to lay it down that no fund shall be started in any district, except with the sanction of the local committee to be created there, and under whose jurisdiction for the purpose of repatriation that district will be. We cannot have a dozen bodies in one district establishing separate funds for the same purpose. In addition, the local committees which undertake to raise these funds, must insist that those funds shall not be expended for the benefit of an individual soldier in those districts, bub shall he available for the benefit of all returned soldiers there. Finally, they must' recognise our audit regulations. With these three safeguards, the disabilities which have hitherto attached to many of our patriotic fund* will disappear. The alternative is to prohibit private effort. Are we prepared to accept that responsibility? I do not think so. It would be repugnant to the good sense of the community, as well as a detriment to the soldier. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> spoke of a gentleman who undertook to raise £10,000, and expressed the- view that that gentleman would be sufficiently patriotic to make the fund available to all the returned soldiers of Australia. Possibly he is correct. But I am not! dealing with counsels of perfection. What would be the position if we refused permission to these persons to raise this £10,000, to be invested in our war loan, the interest upon which is to be devoted to aiding our returned soldiers in a particular district? The soldiers in that) district would lose a benefit that1 they otherwise would enjoy, but no other soldier would get it. On the other hand if we sanctioned such an application we should give a certain measure of assistance to the returned soldiers in that district, without injuring a single soldier elsewhere. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> to get rid of the prejudices which he entertains against the collection of private funds. There is only one or two alternatives before us: either to prohibit private effort or to sanction it under the regulations to which I have referred. </para>

                <para>So much for the words which the honorable senator wishes to strike out. Now as to the words which he proposes to insert. It seems to me that he is now harking back to the proposal which he outlined during the early stage of the discussion upon this Bill. He is seeking to have the original applications of our. returned soldiers dealt with by the local committee in each district.  His  idea was that the whole of these applications should be dealt with by the local branch of the Returned Soldiers' Association. Now there are not many branches of that association in existence yet. But even if they were more numerous than they are, it would not be in the interests of the returned soldiers to have their applications thus dealt with. </para>

                        <para>- It does more. It would undoubtedly express an opinion as to what ought to be done. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> would require the application of a Ballarat returned soldier, for instance, to be submitted to the local body at Ballarat. That local body deals with the application in some way, supplies certain information, possibly makes a recommendation on it. and then , sends it on to Melbourne  to be dealt with. Of course a Ballarat case is not an average case, because Ballarat is so near Melbourne. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton's</inline> proposal requires that a soldier shall be discharged and go back to his own district before he gets in touch with the repatriation authorities at all. That returned soldier is probably two or three weeks in Melbourne before he gets his discharge. He then goes to Ballarat, and is two or three , weeks 'there before he gets  in touch with the local committee. The local committee sends his case to Melbourne for consideration,, which means further delay. </para>

                <para>Contrast that plan with the alternative I offer. Nine-tenths of the complaints that we hear arise between the time the soldier is discharged and the time we get in touch with him with a view to repatriation. I am confident that we can effect the soldier's registration for repatriation purposes before discharge, although there will be difficulties in the  way.  " Tt can be done on the transport, and I believe it could-be done before he leaves England. At any rate it is worth trying. I believe we could get, before he leaves England, information as to what he wants, and his capabilities and resources. </para>

                        <para>- Even honorable senators do that occasionally. We should be helped to this extent, that on getting his registration card in advance of -the man we should have a few weeks to prepare for him. He may say he wants to go on the land, and state his preference for a certain form of holding. We can then get to work, as his gratuitous and friendly agents, and see if it is possible to meet his views. The result in the majority of cases would be that, when he landed here, we could approach him the moment he was discharged, and ask him to look at the proposition which we had got ready for him. That system would eliminate that dangerous period of delay and idleness which to-day is doing more harm to th» returned soldier than any other influence  at  work in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton's</inline> system requires the discharge of the man and his return to his locality before we can do anything with him. </para>

                        <para>- I am saying so. That is the effect of it. A returned soldier belonging to a country town may send in an application with his registration intimating that he wishes to start business or acquire land in that town. Under my system there will be ample time for the central body of the State ibo communicate the man's wishes .to the local committee before his actual return, asking, " What have you to say about this, with your local knowledge and experience?" My proposal will save weeks of time in the average case, and save the returned soldier the deferred pay which he now spends waiting till some one does something for him, and would keep him, in many cases, from developing the habit of idleness. </para>

                        <para>-Colonel BOLTON (Victoria) [3.46]. - My knowledge of the average Australian is that he is fairly independent. The average man 'who returns to this country mentally and physically fit will not want any assistance from the Government at all. I am looking forward to a great number of these people blazing their own track. The Minister's proposal to get the men to register -before they leave England or on board ship will be practically inviting them to lean upon the Government for assistance and wait until the Government do something for them. The Minister's idea of dealing with 300,000 men in this way is extravagant. My idea is that the men should go back to their own districts, and be allowed to feel their feet in their own way. Let them get an idea of what they can do. If they do this, they will probably not want to be tied to the Government's apron strings. </para>

                    <para>. - I thoroughly approve of the idea that some local body should have power to raise funds if they wish, but I should like the Minister to allow the introduction of the words "a State Board and " before the words " Local Committee " in subclause 2. In many States large sums of money have been raised to assist the soldiers, and it would be a pity to prevent a State Board from having power to organize a movement of that kind, especially as such a Board is located at the main centre of population. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause provides for the detailed working of  the  scheme, and gives power to the Governor-General to make so many regulations that, even the suggestion of , <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> could be adopted. I understand that the Minister is not absolutely rigid in his opinions regarding this measure. I believe that the Government are merely feeling their way, bo to speak, and that, if necessary, on a very early date they will be prepared -to so amend the Bill as to make it more acceptable and workable. I do not see very much objection to this amendment. The underlying idea is that the soldier who himself may not feel quite capable of stating his case,, should enlist the sympathy and the active support of the local committee in order to put his application in proper form. To that extent, I have no great objection to the amendment, although, as I said before, there is ample power in this clause to enable regulations to be made to even encompass that idea. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> was very much concerned at the unequal sacrifice made by different people in a community. He cited the case of a poor woman who was prepared to make a weekly contribution as against] the cases of a number of wealthy farmers and land-owners who were not prepared to give any assistance, either direct or indirect, in the prosecution of the war. If he desires to secure an equitable financial contribution from gentlemen of that description, there is only one way in which it can be done, and that is by imposing a straight-out flat rat© on the land values monopolized by them. </para>

                        <para>- I advise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> to read Henry George's <inline font-style="italic">Progress and Poverty,</inline> and supplement that by becoming a subscriber to one of the numerous newspapers published in Australia which stand up for the principle of land value taxation, and then he will not be concerned about trifling inequalities of this sort. On .the contrary, he will see a clear way by which .these gentlemen may be forced to do their  share by direct taxation in support of the returned soldiers. The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> to remove from the local committees the right to make local collections is, I think, a mistake. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> pointed out, it is really not an amendment at all, as it introduces something of an entirely different character. A great number of persons are prepared to supplement the contribution made by the Commonwealth Government for the support of returned soldiers, and why should any obstacle be placed in their way ? I have not heard the full particulars yet, but I understand from the press that the New South Wales Government are prepared to supply cottages for the widows of soldiers free of rent during their lifetime. Apparently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> would prevent' that kind of thing from being done, bo that the widows would be compelled,- out of the money supplied 'to them by the Commonwealth Government, to feed and fatten up the local house-owners. So far as I can see, there is no objection to the State Government doing that kind of thing, and I have no objection to people running socials or concerts, or any kind of entertainment- </para>

                    <para>. - I listened with considerable interest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton's</inline> statement of what he believes will be the working of this clause, and also to the reply of the Minister. It has probably been gathered from the proceedings of last week that the whole scheme of control did not quite suit my ideas. I was, unfortunately, unable to be present owing to illness, but I attempted to get some vital alterations made in the scheme, and my amendments were kindly taken charge of and moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> They were all rejected. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was correct in saying that the foundation of the Bill, as regards the control or management of the scheme, was practically agreed .to by rejection of  a  series of amendments last week. That being so, I cannot quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> that his amendment is an improvement on the clause as it stands. I am inclined to think that he might have put up a better fight on his previous amendment, in which he proposed that the local committee should consist of eight persons, one-half of whom should be returned soldiers. It was dealt with rather hurriedly to-day, but had he put up a fight for the proposal he would have found me voting for it. As the Minister seems determined to adhere to the words of his clause, I cannot support this amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to say a few words about what I consider the most admirable idea of the Vice-President' of the Executive Council, and that is that some one, who I suppose will be called an agent, shall go to the Old Country and come out with the returning soldiers in the transport. There is, however, a good deal in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> said. With an energetic young man on board, there is no doubt that he may hold out such magnificent inducements to the men that he may be able  to  attract into other walks of life a great many who, otherwise, would re-settle themselves in the ordinary way by returning to their friends or going back to their old jobs. I wish to put in a word of caution as to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of  the men. who are to be employed. My idea is that they ought  to  be men of discretion and tact, particularly tact. They must also be men  of  common sense, -who will not overstate facts or paint too glowing a picture. My opinion is, and I think it is shared by most persons in Australia, that the main way in which we must expect to have our soldiers restored to civil life is by their return to their old homes and districts, where they can seize any opportunity  of  settlement that presents itself, or to their former billets. I know that hundreds of billets are being kept open for soldiers on their return. It would be a great pity if, through the energy and enterprise  of  agents on the ship, soldiers were prevented from taking up these appointments on their return. Therefore, I think that there is something in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> said, and which ought to be guarded against. We desire to do the best thing possible for our returned soldiers, and that I believe will be to get them back  to their old positions, because if anything like 50 per cent. of them should require assistance from the Government for repatriation, it will be an undertaking which, in my opinion, is beyond Australia's power to carry out in the way we would like. I am hopeful that not more than 10 per cent. of the men will require assistance from the Government, and then they can be thoroughly looked after. I hope that the Minister will take the greatest possible care in the selection of, and give the most explicit directions to, the officers who are to travel with the returning soldiers to look after them and register them. </para>

                    BOLTON (Victoria) [4.5]. - The Bill refers to patriotic funds, and it would be interesting to the Senate to learn something of the manner in which they are administered. I have with me a copy of a letter dated 18th August, 1916, addressed t'o the Secretary, Returned Soldiers' Association,. Melbourne, and containing copy of a letter which appeared in the Melbourne press. It is as follows: -

You will not have cause to seek far for the cause of my conflict of feeling if you refer to the published return of the fund's operations in the press of yesterday. The total receipts were given as £180,664 15s. 3d., and for its primary objects the amelioration of the condition of our fighting men and their dependants. What do we find? </para>

                    <para>In two years there has been advanced to the dependants of soldiers the munificent sum of £104 12s., <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> £97 6s. per annum, almost enough (with strict economy) to provide for two persons; and against this excess of generosity we catch sight of the item, " Salaries for inquiries, £364 19s. 4d." (presumably into the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the applicants who received the before-mentioned £194 12s.). When we come to the item, " Returned soldiers' account, £127 10s.," our faith is further shaken in the administration of this and other funds which a generous, albeit a careless and uncritical, public have supplied to assist (as they supposed) our defenders and their dependants. Apart from the salaries for inquiries referred to, there yet occurs another small item, namely, " Salaries, staff, £517 10s. 2d.," making a total of £900 in salaries for the distribution of, approximately, £300 in the direct objects of the fund as understood by the subscribers. </para>

Of course, they were receiving an income in the way of interest, but I would point out that the £200,000 donated to that fund was given for the definite purpose of helping returned soldiers and the dependants of those men who are fighting for us at the Front. The fund was not established to produce interest, and so minimize its value as far as returned soldiers and their dependants were concerned. </para>

I have already stated that it is the intention of the Government to start the new organization with  returned  soldiers, and  every  effort will be made to give effect to this promise as part of the Government policy. But' to say that under no circumstances are we to employ officers except from the ranks of returned soldiers might deny to the new organization the particular assistance it needs, and we might be obliged to carry on the work with men who, perhaps, are unfitted for it. I have no doubt that in the ranks of returned soldiers there will be found many qualified men for positions under this scheme, but I do say that it would be a fatal mistake to insist on the employment only of returned soldiers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> might accept .the assurance from the Government that while it is intended as far as possible to apply this principle, it is advisable to leave the Minister in charge of the scheme free to select the best men available. As far as possible, preference will be given to returned soldiers, providing suitable men can be obtained from their ranks. </para>

                    O'LOGHLIN (South Australia) [4.19]. - I intend to support the amendment. The excuse given by the Minister will not. bear examination. It appears to me that out of the 20,000 returned soldiers we will be able t'o get the comparatively small number of officials required to carry out the scheme. The amendment is only a guarantee of the principle which the Minister himself admits, and I think it would give general satisfaction tb returned soldiers, in whose interest the Bill has been drafted. If returned soldiers can satisfactorily fill these positions, they should be given the opportunity of employment.

                    BOLTON (Victoria) [4.20]. - The assurance of the Minister is all very well so far as it goes. We have had a similar assurance before. It has been stated that returned men would be employed in many positions for the carrying out of amelioration and repatriation work, but I assure honorable senators that during the last year or more there has been a very great deal of discontent amongst returned soldiers, owing to the fact that a great many officials employed in connexion with amelioration and repatriation work have been not returned soldiers but men eligible for active service. In the light of what has happened in the past the returned soldiers are justified in asking that such a provision as I submit should be included in this Bill.

                    <para>. - It seems to me that one or two paid positions will be necessary in connexion with the work of each of the local committees. A greater number will be required to carry out the work of the State Boards, and a still greater number for the work of the central Repatriation Commission. I agree with those0 who contend that amongst the returned soldiers it will be possible for us to find men qualified to attend to the details of repatriation. This should be an occupation right into their hands.  We  can be satisfied that they will be disposed, so far as their efforts are concerned, to sympathetically administer this measure. I should personally like to leave the matter in the hands of the Minister who, I believe, will in every case, or in nearly every case, secure the services of returned men to fill the positions which will be created under the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Minister will stick to his Bill. I believe that it is impossible for Australia to do too much for the returned soldier. I am, therefore, anxious that he should have the best assistance and advice it is possible to give him in connexion with any occupation he may undertake to follow. I am satisfied that in the operation of this scheme many of the officials associated with it will be to a large extent advisers to the soldiers in connexion with their settlement in various parts of the Commonwealth. It will be necessary that they should know something about the working of whatever enterprise the returned soldier may desire to engage in. As an illustration, I take the case of a village settlement, which would doubtless be under the control of a local committee under this Bill. The committee will require an officer to take charge of the work, and the right person to appoint to such a position would be a man having a knowledge of irrigation and of fruit culture, or whatever other form of agriculture the returned soldiers might decide to go in for. It would be wrong, in my opinion, to debar experts in such matters from employment under this Bill, and it might not be possible to find a sufficient number of returned soldiers qualified to fill such positions. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>There is another phase of the question to which I should like to direct attention. There are many men in this country who have sent three; four, five, and in some cases, six sons to the Front. They are themselves well up in years, and they may be well qualified to fill one of the positions which will be created by the operation of this measure, and the returned soldiers would benefit immensely from their services. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> would not desire to debar such men from employment under this Bill. Men who may have lost half of the sons they have sent to the Front should not be absolutely excluded by an Act of this Parliament from applying for a position under this measure. We want good men and qualified men for all positions in connexion with the repatriation scheme, and the choice of the Minister should not be restricted to returned soldiers. I am satisfied that no Government would be likely to overlook the special claims to employment of returned soldiers. I believe that if any mistakes are made in this connexion it will be in the direction of leniency to returned soldiers. Men may possibly be appointed to positions under this Bill, merely because they are returned soldiers, and not because they possess special qualifications to fill the positions for which they apply. </para>
                <para>The Minister has repeatedly told us that this matter is largely experimental. We are all well aware of that. The purpose of the Bill is to bring into line for the first time in the Commonwealth all the disjointed efforts which the people have put forward since the war began. </para>

                        <para>- It does not link up all the funds, but it does link up the various repatriation schemes, and for the first time puts the whole matter under Government control. It may be found after experience of the operation of the measure that some amendment is necessary. I have no doubt that Parliament will be prepared to make whatever alterations in the carrying out of the repatriation scheme as may be found to be desirable. No Act of this Parliament should, in my opinion, restrict employment in connexion with the scheme entirely to returned soldiers and debar from employment in connexion with it men, who have sent sons to the Front, and who are almost as deserving of consideration as are returned soldiers, if they possess the necessary qualifications for the positions which will be created under this measure. </para>

Subject to this Act, no person shall, without the approval  in  writing of the Commission  or a  State Board (proof whereof  shall  He upon the person), invite subscriptions  or  organize any scheme for raising money for  the  repatriation of Australian soldiers, or for  any  purpose connected therewith. </para>

My proposal will then empower the Government, without equivocation or argument - if in their judgment it is desirable so to do - to prohibit the treating of Australian soldiers. I have no wish to enter into a general dissertation upon the evils of the drink traffic. Neither is this matter included in any anti-shouting or prohibition question. It is purely a matter of the well-being of our soldiers, and I do earnestly impress upon the Committee the great dangers that will exist when thousands of those soldiers return to the land of their birth, before they have been restored to their duties of citizenship. </para>

But there will be an interregnum before our soldiers can be restored to citizenship, and in that interregnum lies very great danger indeed to them, owing to the mistaken generosity of their friends. </para>

                        <para>- In London today anti-shouting is in full force. The hotels there are only open five hours and a half daily, and spirits cannot be sold between Friday and Sunday. In New South Wales some restriction has already been placed upon the liquor traffic. There, all hotels must close at 6 p.m. during the continuance of the war. None of the limitations that have been imposed, including that in relation to wet canteens in our soldiers' camps, has done any harm.' I ask the Committee not to regard this proposal as an instalment of anti-liquor reform, but to treat it as a protection to the returned soldier against the mistaken generosity of his friends. Already at! wayside ports returned soldiers have disgraced themselves through staking too much liquor - already some scores of them have died as the direct result) of drinking. Honorable senators will earn the gratitude of every mother, every sweetheart, and every sister in Australia if they agree to my amendment, which will empower the Government when peace comes, without equivocation and without argument, to prevent civilians shouting for our returned soldiers if they deem that course to be necessary. </para>

                        <para>- On the point of order I must support the contention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. The amendment has absolutely nothing to do with the scope of the Bill. While a clause empowering the Government to make regulations for the administration of a measure usually has a very wide scope, it would be stretching the imagination to contemplate the granting of such a power as is proposed by the amendment. But apart from the point of order it would be foolish on our part to treat our returned soldiers as so many children. There may be a splendid principle involved in the amendment- </para>

                        <para>- And their freedom if you like. But I wish to point out to the Vice-President of the Executive Council that he has already gone beyond the scope of my amendment. He has included within the Bill provisions for. the establishment of sanatoria for consumptives, for the manufacture of artificial limbs for maimed soldiers, for the acquisition of farms for those who wish to go upon the land, and for setting up in business those who have a preference in that direction. In short, the Bill embraces everything that is intended to conduce to the wellbeing of our soldiers. Now I submit that the question of supplying liquor is a very relevant one indeed to the welfare of our soldiers. My amendment provides for what may occur in the future, and is, I consider, strictly relevant. </para>

If he has any such power, surely he must have power to control the conduct of the citizen towards the returned soldier. The clause reads : - </para>

                        <para>- These are special circumstances, and there must be some reason why those circumstances should affect the granting of this power. The Government seem loath to take power to make provision to protect the soldier in a certain direction where he will be most easily assailed. The clause gives the Government power to do anything " necessary or convenient," and this provision is necessary because of the severe trials the soldiers have been through. </para>

I favour that proposal, as it would increase the powers to be conferred on the Government. A tremendous amount of annoyance has been caused throughout the Commonwealth by the action of the Defence Department in trying to collect from widows and mothers moneys overpaid under the separation allowance. It is true that the regulation has been amended since the first of last month. </para>

                <para>That the following new clause be added to the Bill:- " 21. Widows and invalid dependants of deceased soldiers shall be housed free for life by the Government; other dependants shall be housed free until sixteen years of age." </para>
                <para class="block">I want this clause inserted in the Bill to bring the whole of the States into line. The New South Wales Government have undertaken to house widows of soldiers free for the rest of their lives, and are building houses for them. I know of one case in Victoria where a woman was agreeable to pay a certain amount weekly for the erection of a house, she having the land, but the authorities in this State could not see their way clear to assist her. If the system is good in one State it is good all over Australia, and should be in the hands of the National Government. It is a national duty to make the lives of the widows and dependants of deceased soldiers as easy as possible. I quite appreciate the great responsibility my proposal will throw on the Government, especially in relation to the dependants of deceased soldiers, but I have fixed an age  limit  of sixteen in those cases, so that we may not have here a repetition of what obtains in America today, where dependants of participants in the Civil War are still being kept by the nation. I recommend the Committee to impose the duty on the National Government of making generally a provision that is being made by some States and not by others. </para>

                    <para>. - This is a practical proposal which ought to receive the unanimous sup-  port of the Committee. The greatest inconvenience to which workers generally, and widows in particular, are subjected is the enormous amount of rent they have to find for their landlords every Monday morning. -We have ample land in the Commonwealth. Even if it is nob in the hands of the Commonwealth Government, we can easily secure it, and we can organize and equip a body of trained builders in each of the States who would be' able in a very short time to build standardized houses at a minimum of cost. The erection in all the States of sufficient houses to meet, the requirements of the widows and helpless dependants of deceased soldiers would, I know, interfere considerably with the vested right enjoyed by landlords from time immemorial to extract as much rent, as they possibly can every week from their victims. Honorable senators may consequently feel somewhat timid about agreeing to the proposal, but this is war time, and we should not hesitate to do the right thing by these people. I know from my correspondence that a very large proportion of the separation allowances and allotment moneys paid to the wives and mothers of those at the Front is merely handed over to them to-day, and handed over by them in turn to the' landlord to-morrow. The Committee would be doing the right thing if it agreed to house the widows of soldiers for life, either by paying rent for existing houses, or, preferably, by the erection of new dwellings. I quite agree with the limitation to sixteen years in the case of other dependants. I understand that in the United States of America the number of dependants drawing pensions on account of the American Civil War is still increasing, and that the payments constitute an enormous incubus even upon that wealthy country. We are in a position in this country to treat the widows and dependants of soldiers in the most handsome manner, and ought not to hesitate to do it at once. This is only one Dart of the good work which the Commonwealth can do on their behalf, and I trust the Committee will agree to it unanimously. </para>

There is nothing in the clause inconsistent with the Bill or its purpose. It  is the duty of the nation to provide for these people, and it should not be left to private effort. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator was sitting alongside me. Why did he not support me? The pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will prove that, even then, I did not consider the pension enough. It is the duty of the Government of the Commonwealth to provide for the people mentioned in the proposed new clause. Honorable senators say that this has nothing to do with the question of repatriation, but I contend that it has, because while we attempt to provide for the men who are spared to come back to us, and to restore them to citizen life, surely we are not going to leave stranded altogether the wives and children of the men who will never return ? Those of us who keep our eyes and ears open know that many of the widows and invalid dependants of soldiers who have died at the Front are in very bad circumstances indeed. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, I am taking the proposal as it stands. I consider that it is the duty of the Government to acquire land for this purpose, where it is not given free, under the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act. Instead of buying the land, let the Government take it under the powers of that Act, offer a certain price to the owners, and, if the offer is not accepted, leave the matter of price to arbitration. The new clause is, I submit, well worthy of the consideration of honorable senators. It is not inconsistent with the object of the Bill, and if it is incorporated it will only mete out tardy justice to the dependants of men who have laid down their lives on the battle-field. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not see my way clear to accept this amendment. I feel almost disposed to resent the suggestion contained in the remarks of one or two honorable senators who have spoken to the amendment as if it were a mere question of sympathy or otherwise for these dependants. I submit that it is nothing of the kind, , because if sympathy alone were considered, honorable senators who share my views on this matter can1 claim to have just as kindly a regard for these dependants as those honorable senators who support the amendment. I want to remind the Committee of the position in the United States of America to which reference has been made. The great scandal in America did not arise out of anything which she did for the men who fought for her. It was all done under the head of dependants. It is continuing today, some sixty years after the Civil War occurred. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I ask the Committee, whatever its feeling may be as to what these people deserve, not to adopt this form of giving expression to that generosity. A good deal has been said, especially by the last  speaker,  about the widows and children of those soldiers who have fallen. Children are already provided for under the Bill. * There is ample provision made at the discretion of the repatriation authorities to do whatever they regard as necessary on behalf of the children of soldiers who will never return. When we come to the case of a widow without children we find that she is dealt with under the Pensions Act. If <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> is thought by an honorable senator that the pension allowance to a widow without children is insufficient, the correct thing for him to do is to move to get the allowance increased, and not to call upon a Repatriation Department to supplement work being discharged by another Department. </para>

                <para>Let me now direct attention to  what would happen if the proposed new clause were adopted. First, we should have to find a house for every dependant. Under the Pensions Act today there might be cases where eight or ten dependants could draw a pension in respect to the one soldier. The amounts are small, it is true - it may be only 2s. or 3s. a week - because there is a limit provided in .the Act, but these persons are all dependants, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> now calls upon us to house the lot. </para>

It provides that widows and invalid dependants of deceased . soldiers are to be housed free for life by the Government, and other dependants are to be housed until sixteen years of age. The other day I read to honorable senators a list of the persons who may be dependants, and quite a number of these persons have put in a claim to share in the pension benefit's prescribed by the War Pensions Act. These dependants include wife, father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, stepmother, stepfather, son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, stepson, stepdaughter, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, adopted child, or mother-in-law. An ex-nuptial child also is a dependant. If if is provided that all dependants are to be housed free, it will not be a question of finding one house in the case of a deceased soldier. </para>

There is a limit placed in the Act to the amount they can get, and it is the amount set out in the schedule, plus £52  a  year, but in the proposed new clause no limit is provided, If it were adopted it would mean that any one who. could claim to be  a  dependant of  a  deceased soldier could come along and demand a house. </para>

                    O'LOGHLIN (South Australia) [5.15].  -  This clause does not deal with pensions, but with housing. We know that soldiers' dependants are provided for under the Pensions Act very inadequately, considering the increase in the cost of living since that provision was made. This is a proposal to go a little farther, and provide that the widow and dependants of a soldier shall, in addition to that pension, have a house over their heads. I think that the Minister strains the purport of the amendment when he wants to read into it that it may mean the provision of a house for every dependant of a soldier. I do not read it in that way. All that the Government would have to do would be .to see that the widow and dependants of a soldier had housing provided for them, but not a separate house for each person.

                    O'LOGHLIN.If the Government are prepared to accept the principle of this proposal, and its wording is not quite clear, they can move the postponement of its consideration so that it may be drafted to provide for any of the difficulties which the Minister appears to foresee in its operation. There is no possibility of any of the evils which have arisen .under the American Pensions Act arising under this proposal, because it is limited to the widow of a soldier, and can only last during her life, and as regards other dependants of a soldier until they are sixteen years of age. By no possibility can it be inferred that the provision could be extended, as the American scheme appears to have been extended, so as to last for 100 years.
                </para>
                <para>Furthermore, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has pointed out, this provision is already being made in some States. My contention is that housing should be provided under a national scheme, and nob by individual States,  otherwise it will be found that some returned soldiers' dependants are provided for much more liberally than are others. 1 think that the wish of Parliament and of the country generally is that the most liberal and generous provision should be made for the dependants of our soldiers. </para>

                    <para>. - It was not my intention to speak about this measure at all. The Minister has very properly said that it is a machinery measure, and  that  its result is problematical ; that every provision in the measure, which is no doubt the result of very careful thought, may work well, or may  work ill. But I think it is just to the ( Minister to give him an opportunity of carrying the Bill through Committee in connexion with his scheme of repatriation without any frills. We can very easily be so generous in this matter as to be unjust. I am not in the habib of saying anything simply because I believe it is going to be popular or otherwise. That does nob trouble me. at all. This proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> would open the door to an abuse of the gravest kind. Why should the single women taxpayers of the Commonwealth, many of whom will, because of the slaughter of our manhood in the war, have to remain single, be called upon to house all her life the young widow, without children, of a deceased soldier? Iri what respect is the young widow of a deceased soldier -worse off than a single  woman who has to earn her living in the Commonwealth ? </para>

                        <para>- I venture to say that it is not an irreparable loss, and any young widow would resent such an imputation. It may be not only generous, but just, that we should provide housing accommodation for children the dependants of deceased soldiers, but it should not be introduced as part and parcel of this scheme. I do not care to anticipate the discussion of other business on the notice-paper, but I observe that my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> has on the business-paper a notice dealing with a matter in which in all probability he will secure my support. But because I believe in the principle embodied in that notice of motion, that is no reason why I should approve of an amendment to attach the principle to this Bill. The scheme will entail a great deal of onerous responsibility on the Minister, and in my judgment it would be unwise to attach to it any unnecessary frills. If it is desired that we deal generously with the dependants of deceased soldiers, let us bring forward other measures, or if necessary enlarge our pensions scheme. I for one will- not vote in the direction of asking the women taxpayers of Australia to assist in providing house rent free for deceased soldiers' widows who are without children, and who may perhaps be better able to earn a living than many female taxpayers, seeing that amongst the former .there may be a large number of young women in the prime of life.  </para>

                        <para>- He has not done so yet, at all events, and as this Bill has been drafted to deal out justice to returned soldiers, we might very well also show some consideration for the dependants of those who have given their lives for their country. Every time there was a march-past of our troops we had bands playing, and our streets resounded to the cheers of our citizens. We told our soldiers in so many words that they were heroes, we wished them good luck, a safe journey and speedy return, and individually and collectively we pledged ourselves to do our duty by them and their dependants. The amendment is not asking for too much. It merely makes provision for the widows and, up to a cer-  tain  age, for the dependants of deceased soldiers. In the case of the widow, there is to be housing provision for the rest of her life. Immediately she  marries,  of course, the provision ceases. </para>

                    <para>. - The arguments which have been used in opposition to the proposed new clause carry no conviction to my mind. It is proposed by this Bill to make provision for the soldier when he- returns. The Repatriation Commission will have power under this measure to, advance any sum of money it may consider desirable to a returned soldier in order that he may make a home for himself. What is proposed by the new clause is that, in addition, provision should be made for the widows and invalid dependants of deceased soldiers and other dependants under sixteen years of age. It is not suggested that these dependants should receive a grant of £1,000 or £1,500, which might be given to a returned soldier upon the recommendation of the Repatriation Commission, but that the widow of a deceased soldier, or an invalid dependant, may be given a house rent free for life. The reference by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to a long string of dependants should carry no weight with the Committee, because they would not be covered by the proposed new clause. I hope that the Committee will agree to the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- It is evident that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has been paying very little attention to his work, or he would know that already, in clause 8, provision has been made for practically everything asked for by the proposed new clause. The attitude of the Minister in this matter is, in my opinion perfectly right. I do not find fault with the proposed new clause merely because it is indefinite, and that if adopted it might run the country into a tremendous outlay to provide for the dependants referred to. I am in complete sympathy with any proposal in the interests of the widows and families of deceased soldiers. But this is not the proper measure in which to deal with such matters. In some of the States the State Governments have undertaken to provide homes for the widows or other dependants of deceased soldiers, but if the proposed new clause were accepted it would "mean that the repatriation scheme would be responsible for this in all of the States. </para>

                    BOLTON (Victoria) [5.42]. - I did not intend to say anything upon the proposed new clause, but it seems to me that the definition of the word " repatriation " should be wide enough to cover all activities in connexion with returned soldiers and their dependants, including pensions, amelioration and repatriation. When it is suggested that repatriation can only refer to soldiers returning to this country, I remind the Committee that the Minister has already accepted a provision dealing with their children, so that that cannot be put forward as a logical reason for opposing the proposed new clause. The Minister has said that it is the War Pensions Act that should deal with the widows of deceased soldiers, and in this connexion I might let honorable senators know how that Act does operate. I have had the following letter put into my hands, dated 27th July, and addressed to the secretary of the Returned Soldiers' Association Committee: -

I should like to say that he was a returned soldier, and a member of the Returned Soldiers' Association. He was my sole support, and died at the Randwick Hospital after an operation.  His  body was sent home to me for burial. I am a widow with only£1 per week pension. I should like to know if you can do anything to help me pay this debt, or, failing this, can you recommend me to any of the funds that will deal with this case?

Presumably it is the intention' of the Minister that such pensions shall meet all the requirements of the widows and dependants of deceased soldiers. </para>

                        <para>- The main objection urged by Senators Millen and Newland to the proposed new clause is that this is not the Bill in which provision should be made for the widows of deceased soldiers. We are told that it is the War Pensions Act that should make provision for widows, and the Minister has said that if the pensions provided for under the War Pensions Act are not considered sufficient a movement should be made to increase those pensions. If any member of the Senate came down to-morrow with a proposal to amend the War Pensions Act so as to increase the pensions provided for under that measure, he could scarcely hope to get the first reading of the amending Bill passed during the  rest  of the session. </para>

But whenever an attempt is made in that direction we are told that the change should be brought about in some other way or that the time for it is not ripe. We ought to be quite candid with each other. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council believes that the War Pensions Act does not sufficiently provide for the widows of our fallen soldiers he should bring down an amending Bill. If honorable senators are anxious to do justice to these widows this is the place to give effect to their wishes. This is the only opportunity we shall have of dealing with the matter this session. I do not know whether the Government intend to introduce a Bill to amend the War Pensions Act. This is the place to protect the widows of our fallen heroes. If the children of our deceased soldiers should be provided for, so also should the widows and other dependants. </para>

                    <para>. - There is not an honorable senator who is not in sympathy with ' the principle that is embodied in this proposed new clause. In it I have made a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> attempt to do justice to the widows and dependants of our fallen soldiers. The clause represents an endeavour on my part to make uniform throughout Australia what is already being done in my own State. In New South Wales to-day I can go to the Government and get a home over the head of any soldier's widow. That system should be extended throughout the Commonwealth. But it can be done only by unified action on the part of the National Government, whose aim should be to place all dependants of soldiers on the same footing. Conceivably, objection may be taken to the wording of the clause, but the same objection can be taken to any clause. Scarcely a Bill is ever passed by Parliament which does not require amendment within a month after it comes into operation. It is only by experience of its working that one can discover its defects. I repeat that the clause represents a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> effort on my part to do my duty, and I am content to allow the  matter  to rest there. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. The thing is impracticably. I should have very much liked to have seen an amendment, such as was sought by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton,</inline> made in the earlier part of the Bill - an amendment under which the Commonwealth would be empowered in certain circumstances to provide homes for war widows. But to affirm that the Government shall house all such widows and invalid dependants of deceased soldiers is an impracticable scheme. I do not know whether the clause can be amended so as to make lt optional for the Commission in certain cases to use the money which has been provided for the repatriation of our soldiers, for the purposes of furnishing war widows with homes. If that can be done I shall vote for it. But a proposition which declares that the Government shall house all war widows for the term of their natural lives is simply an impracticable one. The widows of many of our fallen soldiers will probably  have homes sufficient for their requirements. But would they remain in those homes if the Government were bound to provide them with homes? </para>

                    <para>.- I think that the ill-digested proposal which is now before the Committee has pretty well served its purpose. From its many defects, which have already been pointed out, it is quite apparent that it was not seriously placed on the business-paper. Had it been, the mover would have exercised more care in the framing of it. Nobody seems to understand what kind of a house the clause seeks to provide - whether it is to be a dwelling worth £100, or one worth £500. Then I ask whether the house to be provided for the widow of a private would be of the same class as the house provided for the widow of an officer ? Are these houses to be suitable for a big family, or for a small family ? I can only conclude that the proposal represents so much political birdlime, and that it has been put forward for quite another purpose than that of providing homes for the widows of our fallen soldiers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> must admit that he did not give the clause sufficient consideration. </para>

The very gentlemen who now champion it, then formed part of a thumping majority on this side of the chamber, and could have passed it, or anything else which they chose to put forward ; but not. a word of the kind was ever suggested. What faith, then, can we place in a proposal of this character, coming, as it does, from men who are now in such an insignificant majority that all they can do is  to  make a noise ? </para>

No doubt, time will show the necessity for improvement, and the Government will doubtless be open to conviction in that direction. Where the necessity for a proposal of this kind is shown to the Senate, I hope a much more satisfactory scheme will be placed before us. No one seems to understand what this proposal means, or where it will carry us. We are nob told what dependants are to be provided for, and the Government cannot be expected to incorporate so far-reaching a proposition in the Bill on the mere <inline font-style="italic">ipse</inline><inline font-style="italic">dixit</inline> of the mover.

                    <para>. - Whilst I should very much like to assist in giving the utmost consideration to the dependants of Australian soldiers, a very pronounced limit can be reached. The specific aim of the Bill is to repatriate our soldiers, to absorb them again into our ordinary everyday life, and not so much to look after their domestic interests. The new clause proposed has a special social significance. It proposes to give free lodgings to the widows of fallen soldiers, and to their dependants, without number and without stint. Those dependants make a formidable list, for a start, and the honorable senator did not tell us what his proposal will mean to the taxpayers. Neither did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> nor <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline></para>

When the War Pensions Bill was before us, the -position of dependants was specifically considered, and that was the opportunity for honorable senators like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0:Keefe</inline> to show whether the Government proposals were adequate or not. Honorable senators on your left are now making a laudable attempt to introduce into this Bill a proposal absolutely foreign to its purpose and scope - a proposal which should have been put forward on the previous occasion, instead of being the subject of an eleventh-hour conversion, or a death-bed repentance. </para>

                            does not bother now about the burden he would impose on the taxpayers. He did at one time. I do not suggest that he has changed his attitude because he has changed his position from this side of the chamber to the other; but it is significant that when he sat on this side his opinions on that point w.ere totally different. I do not know what has come over him. When war pensions were being considered, he was very concerned about the burden to be imposed on the taxpayers. When he assures the Chamber, on his honour as a senator, that we should adopt this course, I am entitled to examine his reasons from every angle, in order to find out the nature of the change that has come over him. He is not at all concerned to-day about the burden to be imposed upon the taxpayer; but I can refer the Senate to the report of his remarks on the War Pensions Bill, when he had a chance of attending to the wants of the widows and dependants of soldiers. On that occasion, instead of treating the widows with due care and solemnity, he was quite jocular, and referred to " eleventh -hour marriages " - which was a grave reflection on the widows of our soldiers.

He has none now. Why? Surely the interest of the taxpayers should be vital to an honorable senator, whether he sits on your left or on your right. The honorable senator now asks, "What is a million?" and even

                <para>When standing sponsor for a' proposal that goes perilously near transgressing the Standing Orders relating to relevancy, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> should have given the Senate some idea of the financial burden involved, if only for the sake of his colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> who previously was so sympathetically tender towards the taxpayers' interests. What did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> say when the War Pensions Bill was submitted in 1915, or when the amending Bill was going through in 1916? Where was the boy who stood on the burning deck? He was, just like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> not there. By the amending Bill the war pensions were increased by 50 per cent.; but I search in vain through the records of the debates for the words of these new champions of the " eleventh-hour widows " and mothers and dependants of soldiers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> certainly pointed out the imperious obligation on the people of this country to look after the dependants of their soldiers, but he emphasized, at the same time, the need to conserve the interests of the taxpayers. The two things were so finely balanced in his mind, that he adjusted himself in a marvellous way to the occasion, and voted for the Bill. He had misgivings, because he did not like some of the soldiers getting married so hurriedly, and he had a particular grievance against " eleventh-hour wives." But now they can be all eleventh-hour widows without a protest from him. The " eleventh-hour widow " was just the same last year as she is now. The interests of the dependants of the soldier were just the same in 1915 as they are to-day. Why, then, this remarkable tenderness on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> towards the soldiers' dependants? Why his newfound anxiety about the soldier's widow? </para>
                <para>When the War Pensions legislation, introduced for the special purpose of safeguarding the interests of our soldiers, was going through, the honorable senator sought no improvement, but he referred, I am sorry to say, to the " eleventh-hour widow" of the soldier. That, I think, was a grave reflection upon women who married soldiers on the eve of their going away to the war. As regards the taxpayers, when the War Pensions Bill was going through the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> said, on page 5612 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> volume 78 - </para>

                        <para>- No. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> in 1915, said, " Let us lower the burden," but now he says, " Let us raise the burden mountain high." What kind of sympathy is that? Was it the sympathy which was overflowing like the perennial spring? To-day, without any regard for taxpayers' interests, he takes up another attitude. I object to this spasmodic display of sympathy. Sympathy wants to be uniform and consistent. It ought to be universal, like mercy. That is the kind of sympathy I prefer, and I would appreciate far more a man who would come and sympathize with me when I was in a lowly condition, dependent, homeless, and friendless, than a man who would come when I was up in the stirrups and successful. When we find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> making reflections about widows, I cannot understand why widows are entitled now, according , to the honorable senator, to be regarded as dependants, and to merit a free home, if they should live to be as old as Methuselah. I am at a loss to trace this remarkable change of front on the part of the honorable senator. As emphasizing further the sensitive feeling which he had in 1915 for the taxpayers of Australia as against the dependants of the soldiers, he made this weighty statement - </para>

                <para>Turning to another honorable senator, we find that the prime mover of this proposal is silent. The War Pensions Bill went through without a word of comment from the honorable senator. Yet on this occasion he has not vouchsafed  to  the Committee the faintest idea of what his proposal would mean to the taxpayers - a thing about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> was so impatient in 1915. Before we vote on an important proposal of this kind, we are entitled to know what it means. The Minister has told us as nearly as he could ascertain from the calculations of his officers what the Bill in its original form will mean to the Treasury. But along came <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> with his proposal, and we do not know where the outlay will end. It might mean an expenditure of £1,000,000 or £30.000,000. But what is the sum of £30,000,000 to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> nowadays ? It is nothing. This proposal is made simply because those two honorable senators have changed ground in the Chamber. When they were in a position to do things, why did they not act ? The War Pensions Bill went through the Senate while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> was their leader. They had more influence with the Fisher Government than they have with the present Government. Why did they not act then? Why do they exhibit this marvellous new-found sympathy? I would not dream of suggesting that there is any ulterior motive for their present day attitude, such as that there is a general election in the distance. Oh no! - these men tower above such paltry, sordid, mean, contemptible motives as that ! They live on the mountain top. They lived there when they stooped down and tried to cut off my head. </para>

                        <para>- I beg pardon, sir. In 1915 the friends of the soldiers and of their dependants had a chance to act if they never had one before, but they were as silent as a tomb. An Egyptian mummy was nothing in comparison with these bold warriors who now stand forward as the bright champions of the dependants of the soldiers. In 1915 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> did not avail himself of the opportunity to stand here and say to the Minister - " These pensions are insufficient. I shall stop here until I drop from exhaustion rather than see such a glaring inadequacy of provision as this paltry measure go through; I am McDpugall, the champion and the friend of the dependants of soldiers." That is what the honorable senator should have done in 1915 and 1916. He was as silent then as a petrified log, and now that he is in a helpless position on the other side, he wishes to help the dependants of the soldiers. He might as well be beating the air. What is the cause of all this new boiling sympathy ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, an amount is to be provided under the operations of the Bill, but at the present moment I am not entitled to speak on that aspect of the case. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall's</inline> proposal means money. How much, even he is not able to say. It is clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall's</inline> proposal will impose an additional burden on the taxpayers. I do not want it to be understood, however, that I baulk at the prospect - within the limits of reason or even within the limits of generosity - of discharging- the obligations we owe to the dependants of Australian soldiers. My remarks in this connexion indorse the attitude I took up during the debate on the second reading of the War Pensions Bill in 1915. When every mother's son of the advocates of this proposal were dumb, I objected to that measure on the grounds of its inadequacy, and I was gratified in May of last year when the Government brought down a Bill to extend its benefits, my objections to the parent Act being then removed. While both of those measures, which were calculated to compass the scope of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall's</inline> present amendment, were under consideration, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> and his supporters of to-night, so far from urging the Government of the day to make adequate provision, were speechless. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> took the view then that the provision contemplated was much on the extravagant side.

                <para>I am entitled to draw attention to this fact in the light of the new-born sympathy for soldiers' dependants now exhibited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> and his supporters. Two years ago they were as dumb as an Egyptian mummy at a time, too, when they might have achieved something. I therefore ask myself - Whence comes this change of front; this exhibition of the " bleeding heart " by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> for the dependants of our soldiers? I remember, also, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                        <para>- On that occasion the burden of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator OKeefe's</inline> discourse was that the taxpayers of Australia would be saddled with an expenditure that they could not afford by the provision for allowances for soldiers' dependants. To-night, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> appears in a brand-new <inline font-style="italic">role.</inline> He forgets all about the eleventh or the tenth-hour widows, and in this year of grace, 1917,' he wants to get as much as he can for the soldiers' dependants. I repeat that we are entitled to an explanation, although I know it is very much like going to a goat's house for wool to expect an explanation from these gentlemen concerning this <inline font-style="italic">volte face,</inline> this facing north by south, on this particular question. Why has this change come about? As I have already pointed out, two years ago they could have got their own Government to give effect to the policy they are now advocating, and it is quite plain, therefore, that we have to look in some dark, mysterious direction for their change of front, this " swelling-heart " affection which has so lately developed amongst them. Is it because they have changed their position in this Chamber? Of course, I would not for a moment suggest that they were looking for votes! Perish the thought! Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker,</inline> who is yawning- at the present moment, yawned about a dozen times when the Bill was going through, and had not a single murmur of disapproval then. When there was1 a golden opportunity to secure what members opposite are now advocating, his voice was not heard; he was as mild as a cooing dove. I repeat that we are entitled to full revelation from the father of the amendment, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> down to his supporter, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> who swallowed holus-bolus the previous measures dealing with this subject. </para>

I make that statement without fear of contradiction, and I do it with pleasure, because I was a supporter of the Government which brought' in those proposals. The honorable senators opposite were also supporting the Government then, and they did not then object to what they now term the "inadequacy" of these proposals. Is their change of front now due to the fact that they are sitting on the other side in the Senate? I do not know, but they should be called upon to show cause for their novel position. </para>

                <para>We have to consider what will be the effect of the amendment on the finances of the country. When the parent Act, with which I was not satisfied, was under consideration in the Senate, I did my best to improve it, and I succeeded; but the measure, as it passed the Senate, did not satisfy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> on the ground that it would impose too great a burden on pur taxpayers. It appears, however, that he is now prepared to throw the taxpayers overboard, to hang the consequences, and pile up the burdens on the people. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> was so sensational about the interest of the taxpayers in 1915, why is he so indifferent to-day ? </para>

                        <para>-Under the Pensions Act of 1915-16, provision is made for a pension, in the case of a widow with three children, amounting to £3 12s. 6d. per week. If the family is larger, as it may be in most cases, the provision made for the dependants of the deceased soldier must be regarded as very fair indeed. It is easy to imagine, although it may seem somewhat harsh to say so, that with the provision which this Parliament has already made, the widow and dependants of a deceased soldier, in a financial sense, may in some cases find themselves better provided for than they were while he was alive. I do not say that in any 'harsh spirit at all, bub in order to show the effect of the Pensions Act which honorable senators opposite supported, and to which some objected on the score of its liberality. We are giving the dependants of our deceased soldiers treatment more liberal than is provided for the dependants of deceased soldiers by any other country in the civilized world. I supported the War Pensions Act in the first instance somewhat grudgingly, but in the hope that its provisions would be liberalized, and I lived to see the day when they were liberalized by the amending measure which was passed last year. </para>

It is not necessary to remind even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> and his supporters of this. There must be a limit to our liberality and generosity, because of the burden imposed upon the resources of the country. We have legislation which goes a very great length in order to meet the social, domestic, and industrial requirements of the dependants of our soldiers, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> and honorable senators who are supporting the amendment he has moved wish to go much further. They desire to give additional assistance to all the' dependants of a deceased soldier from the widow right down. the line to the mother-in-law, the sister-in-law, and the half-brother. </para>

We meet with people every day who are prepared to be very generous with other people's goods, though not with their own. The honorable senators who are supporting the amendment ask us without rhyme or reason, and without figures or. consideration, to take the serious course of saddling the country with an expenditure bo large that they can give us no idea of what it is likely to amount to. They are asking the Committee to do too much. They make the request because their's will not be the responsibility of financing the proposal, and, let me repeat it, when they had the responsibility they failed to assume it. Now that they are irresponsible they would impose new taxation upon the people of this country, because that is what the proposal they make involves. They shirked their duty when we were dealing with the War Pensions Bill, but I did not shirk my duty on that occasion. . We have been three years engaged in the war, and the case of the dependants of the soldiers was just as urgent in the early stages as it is to-day when we were considering legislation for the repatriation of the soldiers alone. </para>

They turned a deaf ear, and steeled their hearts against the dependants of the soldiers. Now they clamour for more consideration for them. </para>

                        <para>- I say that the finances of the country must be considered. We have been three years at war, and, in addition to what can be extracted from the people by way of taxation, our war bill is in the neighbourhood of £150,000,000. It is quite plain that we cannot go on in this way much longer without taking stock of our financial position. It is much worse to-day than it was in 1915 and 1916, when the war pension measures to which I have referred were passed. Yet we are told by honorable senators opposite, with joyous indifference, that we must go further in .this direction. </para>

                        <para>- So far as the financial aspect of the matter is concerned, we had better wait to see how our existing legislation pans out.- If the provisions of the existing law are found by experience to be inadequate, to leave .the dependants of soldiers less provided for than the dependants of other citizens, to place them beyond the galling conditions of poverty and want, .then no one will be found more eager than I to do whatever may be necessary in order to treat these people handsomely. Unlike these Johnnycome.latelys, who desire to gain popular favour by trifling with the finances of the country, I take up on this measure the stand which I took up in 1915 and in 1916. In view of the fair measures which, according to our resources, we have already passed to deal with the dependants of our soldiers, there is no justification for the amendment. I am opposed to it, and I again request and demand those who are supporting it to explain why they have somersaulted upon the position which they took up in 1915 and 1916 on this question. </para>

                    he has had plenty of it expressed by nearly every one who has spoken on his amendment. But when honorable senators are asked to put that sympathy into practical effect by voting for it, they are not prepared to do so. I rise to bring before the Committee the views entertained on this matter by the returned soldiers themselves. A meeting of returned soldiers was held here to-day, at which resolutions bearing upon this very matter were passed. Honorable senators may have read them, but I wish to put them on record. I find that at a meeting of the Victorian Returned Soldiers and Sailors League, which considered the matter of widows being excluded from the operation of the Repatriation Bill, Sergeant J. W. McKenzie, speaking to his fellow returned soldiers, said: -
                </para><para>Boys, to every soldier I say this : I would sooner see all the boys in the room excluded from the Bill than that the widows of my comrades should be excluded. </para><para class="block">Then ' the following motion was unanimously agreed to: - </para><para>That the Victorian branch of the Returned Soldiers and Sailors' Imperial League enters its strongest protest against the exclusion of the widows of deceased soldiers from the Repatriation Bill now before the Federal Parliament, and urges Parliament to take into serious consideration the injustice thus done to dependants of men who have made the supreme sacrifice. It further requests the Government and Parliament to include a clause in the Bill which will bring soldiers' widows within the scope of the Act. </para><para class="block">I think we are entitled to consider the views of the men in whose interests this Bill has been devised. I do not believe we can have a stronger pronouncement on the matter now before the Committee than that which I have, just read. I have no desire to quote at length from the report of the meeting in question, but it goes on to say that the Association has had communications from Tasmania and elsewhere strongly indorsing its attitude in regard to including widows within the scope of the repatriation scheme. What does it matter what was said or done by any one of us either one year or two years ago? The question which we have to decide is, " Is this a fair proposal in the in- .  terests  of the widows of our soldiers and of their dependants?" If we neglected to make adequate provision for them on a former occasion, rt,hat is no reason why we should repeat our error now. .Let the Minister accept the principle that is embodied in the proposed new clause, let him put it into proper form and place it on our statute-book in the interests of the dependants of our deceased soldiers. </para></speech>

I take back nothing that I said in the speech recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> vol. 78, page 5612, which was quoted by the honorable senator. I ventured to say in that speech that it was foolish for the Defence Department to countenance and encourage hasty marriages by men who remained in camp for only a week or two after they had enlisted, because such marriages must inevitably increase the financial obligations of Australia. Because I expressed that view, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> took an hour in repeating my speech, and, in doing so, mentioned my name about 170 times. I take back nothing that I said on the occasion in question, and, further, I affirm that it does not affect the sincerity of my attitude now. </para>

This wild man from the West, who went all over Australia like a bowling -Dervish, endeavouring to induce the people of this country to send every man to the Front, whether against his will or not, and who wished to create more widows in Australia - this man ventures to come here and chide others with inconsistency. He has declared that some honorable senators are supporting
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline>
                    because of geographical considerations - because they happen to have changed their places. I have not changed my opinions if I have changed my seat. But

                    has, and that is why he could not discuss the merits of this clause, but occupied about an hour in personal abuse of others, and in wearisome repetition. The honorable senator need not worry about geographical changes. I am on this side of the chamber because of my consistency. I did not profess certain opinions to gain' Ministerial office for a few months, and then get kicked out. My reward is the approval of my own conscience. I know that I have adhered to my opinions. But because

                    in the company of his new-found friends and supporters, finds himself with such a large following, he ventures to tell the minority in this Chamber that they must say nothing and do nothing. Even if the votes which I cast two years ago, or six months ago, were wrong, is that a reason why this Committee should continue to do wrong?

                    <para>. - Very briefly I wish to refer to one phase of this question which has already been mentioned. Doubt has been cast upon the practicability of the scheme outlined in this new clause, and in this connexion I wish to mention what is already being done in the State of Queensland. As evidencing that the proposal embodied in the clause appeals to the people as a whole, I may say that in Queensland bands of voluntary workers have been organized, and these have set about the task of erecting homes for the widows of soldiers. One person will donate an allotment of land, a timber merchant will provide the timber, a plumber will furnish the iron, and a painter will supply the paint. Then carpenters, plumbers, painters, and labourers go out at stated periods and erect these homes free of cost. When completed, they are handed over to the widows of fallen soldiers. </para>

                <para>In the course of his second-reading speech upon this Bill, to which we all listened very attentively, the Vice-President of the Executive Council did not attempt to discuss any of its details. He said that at that stage it was quite impossible for him to do so, and that he intended merely to set out the broad outlines upon which the repatriation scheme is to be carried out. He added that he could not even say the' amount of the expenditure that would be involved in it. Yet because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> could not supply all this information, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has found fault with him. To my mind, that was an unreasonable attitude for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to take up. Prior to the honorable senator's speech I was under the impression that this Bill was a non-party measure, as it certainly should be. </para>

                        <para>- Partial provision is made in the War Pensions Act, which many members of the Labour party of that day endeavoured to widen. I challenged <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> just before the dinner adjournment to quote my remarks. He ploughed through <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but did not do it. When the War Pensions Bill was going through, I advocated that when a pension was being paid there should be no discrimination between the widow of a private and the widow of an officer. I said that as 6 feet of earth made the colonel and the private the one size, so the widow of each should be on the same basis with regard to pension receipts. </para>

                <para>The Pensions Bill was a very good first step, which the Labour party can claim credit for having introduced, because, if we are to accept statements made in the Senate, the members of the Labour party forced it from the then Government, but it must not be regarded as the last step. Surely we can progress as time goes on. </para>

Here then is a chance for the Government to put that consideration into practical effeot. We have all read in the columns of the daily press that there are rings or combinations of landlords, particularly in the capitals, and more particularly in Melbourne, who have notified their house agents that they will not have the wives or dependants of soldiers in their habitations as tenants. What is to become of the widow of a soldier if that sort of thing becomes general? What consideration will landlords have for the widow of a soldier who has lost his life fighting 12,000 miles away ? </para>

The opportunity is offered by the Bill and the amendment. I assure honorable senators opposite that I am honestly endeavouring to view the matter on a broad Australian basis of justice, and that I have no party feeling about it. I absolutely resent a measure and amendment of this sort being discussed in the contemptible spirit introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> We should endeavour to view the matter as broadly as possible. I therefore ask honorable senators opposite this question - and if they do not care" to answer it in public, let them put the question to themselves - Is it fair to the widow of a soldier to throw her upon the cold mercy of the world, or of the landlords of Australia? I unhesitatingly say it is not. </para>

                <para class="block">Lynch? Is there trouble in the Fusion that he is afraid of going to the country ? So far as we know, an election is three years off, but if the honorable senator has any inside knowledge, it might account for his curious conduct. Surely we can discuss a matter of this kind now without dragging in an election. What has an election to do with the widows of Australian soldiers ? </para>
                <para>Although I am not a jingo, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is, I flatter myself that I am capable of realizing the seriousness and sadness of the absence of any such provision as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> advocates. Australia owes a clear duty to the widows and invalid dependants and young families of the soldiers who have died abroad, and the amendment must have the sympathy and support of any honorable senator who views the matter on its merits, apart from the party aspect. I am disappointed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> did not at least ask for time to consider the proposal, so that it might eventually be included in the broad scheme which he has laid before the( Senate. He should' have done that as Minister in charge of the measure. </para>

If he could not accept .it, he might have told us as an alternative what the Government propose to do in the matter. If he is not- going to accept it, will he assure us that an opportunity will be given for a further amendment of the War Pensions Act, so that added provision may be made for the widows of soldiers, in view of the greatly increased cost of living which has come about since the last Pensions Act was passed, and the aeroplane heights to which many commodities have soared) If the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment, or if honorable senators opposite are not prepared to sink their party allegiance, and vote as I am sure their consciences and convictions dictate, I hope the Minister will give the Senate an assurance that later on additional pro vision will be made for the widows and dependants of Australian soldiers. </para>

                <para>I did invite suggestions, but surely that does not imply a willingness to accept every suggestion made? Is am prepared to accept any suggestion that' will tend to make the Bill more workable. This amendment is a threefold proposition - that the Commonwealth shall take the responsibility of finding houses for widows, for dependants, and for children up  to  the age of sixteen. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> found some comfort in quoting from  the  report of a meeting of the Returned Soldiers Association held here, but even the resolutions of that body did not ask for housing for dependants. If, therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> finds so much strength and comfort in those resolutions, ho should join me in pointing out  to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> that his amendment goes too far. I demur to the proposition that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> can stand on the declaration of the Returned Soldiers Association one moment, and discard it the next, and I have still to learn that the Returned Soldiers Association will ask for less than what they think is a fair thing. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> will read from the report, a copy of which I have before me,  he  will find that in the minds of the speakers was not the childless widow but the widow with children. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> dealt' also with the widow with children, and seemed to think that she was provided for only in the Pensions Act. But where children are in existence this Bill" makes ample provision. . </para>

                        <para>- It makes ample provision for the children, and where the children are amply provided for, they are no burden or tax on the mother. The only class excluded is the childless widow. That becomes a very simple proposition. When I tried by interjection to convey this idea, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> said the Bill did not provide housing. The honorable senator is wrong. The Bill leaves the repatriation authority to protect' and nurture the children in whatever way is thought fit. It does not tie their hands to say that it shall find a house when a house is not suitable. It may be that a widow with children has a house. Obviously, therefore, the sensible way to help the children there will be not ito give them another house, but to give assistance in some other form. There may also be the case of a widow who, with a pension, is able to rear her children, but who is not in a position to give them the sort of schooling which she would like to give, possibly to send them to a high school. By leaving the Bill as it is now, so far as the children are concerned, the repatriation authorities will not be bound down to the house, but can travel over the whole range of beneficial activities, and they- are charged distinctly with the obligation and duty of looking after the children of incapacitated and deceased soldiers. We come down, therefore, to the widow who is without children. In the vast majority of these cases, the widow will be a young woman. I resent for the second time this day the suggestion that there is any want of sympathy on the part of those who take the same view as I do. We have to deal with the case of a comparatively young woman, who is receiving a pension of <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> a week. Is it intended that we should, in all these cases, provide a house for the woman, or in only some of the cases ? If it is to be done in all the cases it means that the pension is not enough, and ought to be increased. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> put forward a very fair request. Seeing that this is a matter which ought to be dealt with in the Pensions Act, he asked what opportunity would there be of amending the Act. I can promise the Senate that a Bill to amend the Act will be brought down, and although the amendment will not cover  that position, an opportunity will be given to honorable senators to introduce any amendment they like into the Act. I am not taking the responsibility of proposing an amendment, which, in effect, would mean an increase of about 60 per cent. all round in the scale of pensions. If honorable senators are going to start out on a scheme of that kind, they will pass from the principle which I think animated us all, of doing a fair thing to our returned soldiers and their dependants in trying to meet their cases according to the necessities - they will pass from that principle and go into a lavish scheme, which would not only involve almost impossible financial responsibilities, but would, I venture to say, prove; in very many cases, more harmful than beneficial. </para>

Men find themselves back again in employment, not at the salary which they formerly received, but at a lower grade. The Prime Minister has referred to . this matter in very strong; terms. I do not intend to refer to it in stronger terms than he used. I want to see embodied in this Bill in black and white a provision which will compel unscrupulous employers to keep their promises to unfortunate soldiers. I hope that we shall never have a repetition of what we have had here to-night. In all honesty and fairness, I moved the insertion of a new clause; and though you, sir, made a brave attempt to defend me against the abuse of an honorable senator, the Leader of the Senate did not intervene. </para>

                    <para>. - I have every possible sympathy for the point of view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> in this amendment; but I am going to ask him to consider whether it will be possible to give effect to it, even by a provision in an Act of Parliament. Many of these promises were given; there is no record of them, and unless a record was made at the time, I venture to say that one would have very great difficulty in proving in a Court the existence of a promise. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> does mean that this provision shall be retrospective. No language, I think, could be too strong to denounce the conduct of those employers who, giving a promise of that kind, were to an extent instrumental in inducing employees to enlist, and have failed to make the promises good. I see very great difficulty in trying, in an Act of Parliament, to provide anything in the nature of a punishment for such employers. I might tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> that I am now inquiring to see whether it is possible to get an authentic record of these promises, but, so far, the prospects are not at all hopeful. We have had returned soldiers stating that they were given certain promises by their employers. All that I can say about the matter is that I do not believe that any Court, on the evidence brought to me, would sustain the complaints. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I was going to say that there have been good employers and bad employers. Some employers have not only kept their promise, but have gone far beyond it. I have had  very frequent and gratifying evidence of the desire of many employers, large firms and small employers, to go a good deal beyond that which they pledged themselves to when the war broke out. But, nevertheless, there are employers who have not redeemed their promises. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> as a practical man, whether he thinks it is possible, by anything we can put in this Bill, to meet those cases ? And certainly, in the form in which this proposal is couched, I venture to say that it would be so much waste paper. </para>

                        <para>- In some instances that, is so. I had brought before me one case, in which an employer was quite willing, but utterly unable, to redeem his promise, because the commodity in which he was dealing was imported. His manufacturing business depended upon importations, and as he could get no material, not only was he unable to redeem his promise, but he was not able to carry on his business. In a case like this, there was a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> excuse for a failure to redeem a promise. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> therefore, to refrain from pressing his amendment. I do not think that it will do any good, and I suggest that he should leave me free to find out if it is possible to obtain a record of any of these promises. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> also mentioned a case of a Government Department not keeping its promises. If by that he means a Federal Department, and if he will supply me with the particulars, I shall immediately make the necessary inquiries. I cannot believe, however, that any Federal Department is negligent in a matter like this. </para>

                    <para>.- I see no difficulty whatever in requiring employers to register their promises. The proposed new clause will not be retrospective in its effect, and the intention is to deal with unscrupulous employers. I "admit that some employers are honorably fulfilling their obligations, and I think the amendment will do a lot of good, as well as help recruiting, because if men know that their positions will be kept for them on their return, they will have a greater inducement to enlist. I know of three cases in which employees of the Federal Government lost their positions when they were called up under the Military Service Proclamation of last year; but I am glad to know that when I brought the matter under the notice of the Minister, they were replaced. It is a fact, however, that those men lost about two months' work. I will be able to give the Minister, not one, but dozens of cases, in which men have been subjected to this form of tyranny. We shall be doing something' for the benefit of our soldiers if we pass a law calling upon employers to honour their promises to the men who go out to fight their country's battles. </para>

                    <para>.- It appears to me that the clause has been moved for the purpose of killing time, because if a returned soldier does not desire to resume his former employment, the employer will not be exempt, from prosecution by the Government. Then, in the case of a returned soldier, perhaps maimed and on that account unable to follow his old occupation, there is nothing in the clause to release the employer of a promise he may have made. It is unreasonable to insert a clause compelling an employer to redeem a promise irrespective of the possibility that a returned soldier may not desire to follow his former occupation, or be unable to do so. </para>

                        <para>- No ; but wo would not expect a crippled soldier to be asked to follow his ordinary trade. I know a crippled soldier could not work at my trade, and I do not think he would be able to work at the trade which the honorable senator followed. There is an idea amongst trade unionists that unscrupulous employers will be tempted to use returned soldiers to break down trade unionism. Huge stacks of coal have been stored from one end of New South Wales to the other, but I have had an assurance from the Minister that this coal has been stored for war purposes. I am perfectly satisfied with that assurance, and I believe, also, that the men would be satisfied if they knew, but there is a certain feeling of distrust concerning these coal stacks. It is feared that they might be used to injure the cause of trade unionism, and that returned soldiers will be exploited for the same purpose. </para>

But, as I have said, there is a feeling in trade union circles that soldiers may be used to  injure unionism. I do not think they will myself. They are standing loyally by those awards, but they have a feeling that something injurious to them may arise, and I submit this amendment in order to dispel that impression. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been rather surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall's</inline> remarks, as to my mind they throw some reflection upon the returned soldiers. He says that there is a feeling in trade union circles that the returned soldiers may in some way or another allow themselves to be used for the purpose of pulling unionism down. It used to be claimed by my honorable friends opposite that a large percentage of the men who went to the Front were unionists. If that be so, is it conceivable that, having gone to the war and proved themselves fully qualified members of the best and noblest union that has ever existed in Australia, they should turn their backs upon unionism, and lay iconoclastic hands on the unions they helped to support ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> will allow me to say that) fear as to the use which may be made of our returned soldiers is not the reason for the proposed new clause. It is not fear that the returned soldiers will become breakers of unions that is at the bottom of this proposal; The reason for the amendment is to be found in the latter portion of it. It is not that the returned soldiers will be used to beat down wages, because that is impossible since the wages are fixed by arbitration tribunals. </para>

                        <para>- They cannot use the returned soldier to break down wages fixed by an award any more than they can use for that purpose a man who has never been to the war at all. By a conspiracy between employer and employee an award may be evaded, but that is a danger which, if it exists at all, exists to-day, and with just as much force as applied to the workman who is not a returned soldier. The real purpose of the amendment is set out in the last two lines of it. That is to say, that this is a proposal to compel the returned soldier to become a unionist. That is the real purpose of the amendment. The proposal is that we should deliberately rope in the returned soldier, whether he wishes it or not, and compel him to become a member of a union. To agree to the amendment is to say that preference to the returned soldier is a myth, that while we have talked about it it does not mean anything, and that he must become a unionist before he can get any preference. To accept the amendment would be to nullify altogether the policy of the present Government, which is to give preference to the returned soldier above everybody else. Having stated the simple issue involved in the amendment, I leave it to the Committee. </para>

                <para class="block">In speaking on the second reading of the Bill I explained why if is desirable that such a clause should be included in it. It is unnecessary to go over the same ground again. I have no doubt that the Committee will see the wisdom of doing something in this direction. Some of the men are discharged before they should be, and some are not as well equipped to carry on their occupations as they might be. Some of our medical men admit today that we have not got the best scientific methods of overcoming disablement. </para>

                    <para>. - Whilst I have no intention of opposing the motion on this occasion at any rate, it seems to be somewhat unsatisfactory that the Senate should be called upon to adjourn so early in the session when there is business on the paper that can be discussed. I may remind the Vice-President of the Executive Council that I have two motions on the business-paper which I have not the slightest intention of allowing to be completely overshadowed by the forms of the Senate, or the desire of the Government to adjourn from time to time. While on this occasion I shall not oppose the adjournment, I certainly think that these two motions are of sufficient importance to warrant their discussion at an early date with a view to arriving at a decision upon them. I ask for some assurance from the Leader of the Government in this Chamber that if there be not sufficient Government business, to keep the Senate in session honorable senators will, during the next week or two, be afforded an opportunity of arriving at a decision in respect of private members' business. </para>

I am sorry that the Minister for Defence is not in his place, but I am sure the Vice-President of the Executive Council will take a note of my remarks,' and see that they are referred to him. The matter to which I wish to allude has reference to the statement of the Minister in connexion with the Critchley Parker pamphlets. </para>

The other day I asked a question in reference  . to  an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> relating to the high price of onions. I . asked if the Minister controlling foodstuffs had had any warning of the cornering of this product, and he replied, " No." I think that his answer was unfair, seeing that on 16th January,  1917,  I wrote  to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> as  follows : - </para>

                        <para>I have been informed that large contracts arc now being, or have been made, for the exportation to America and Canada of most of our coming onion crop. </para>
                        <para>If this is the case, it will mean that we will have to import onions for  our own  use from abroad.

                        <para>I would suggest that inquiries  be  at once made into the matter, and, if  necessary,  the exportation of our own crop prohibited. </para>

                    <para class="block">Events have since confirmed the prediction which I then made. In a statement which appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> the other evening, a merchant is reported to have said -  " It is not a boom. It is not even abnormal. Prices were much higher some years ago. I think they touched £29 10s. a ton. </para>
                    <para>Fewer onions are held in Melbourne than in any previous years. If more are arriving, they are being distributed as fast as they come to hand. Our export trade to America has been the largest on record. " New Zealand is  a  large consumer. Orders were held up because there was no freight Now that difficulty is being overcome, and we are filling New Zealand orders received as  far  back as May." </para>
                    <para>To the question as to whether a false market existed, he gave an emphatic denial. " Twenty-five to 30 per cent. of the Gippsland onions that are coming to hand,"  be  affirmed, * are rejected, and the remainder are of  pour  quality. The Western District crop is not so large as was expected." </para>
                    <para class="block">My  complaint  is that I was given an-  answer  that was not correct. On 16th  January  I gave  warning  of  what  would  take  place, and  this merchant shows  that  my prediction  was  absolutely  correct. The price of  this  food  product is still  rising. I believe  onions  are now £14  a  ton, and likely to  go  up  further.  If the Minister in  charge  of foodstuffs had taken the slightest notice of my warning six months ago, this would not have occurred to-day. </para>

                            <para>-Colonel O'LOGHLIN (South Australia) [10.5]. - I wish to direct attention to 'the very unfair treatment which the Commonwealth accords to those of its employees who enlist to fight for their country. In South Australia the Government makes up the difference, if any, between a man's pay as a Government employee and as a soldier, and I believe the same rule applies in the other States; but the Commonwealth treats its employees much less liberally and generously. I am officially informed that the Commonwealth employee who enlists to fight for his country has to bear any pecuniary sacrifice involved. If his pay as a Commonwealth servant- is greater than his pay as a soldier, he loses the difference. That is most ungenerous and unfair treatment to mete out. to our soldiers. The Commonwealth should be at least as fair to its employees as the State Governments are to theirs. As the Minister of Defence is not present, I trust the Leader of the Senate will bring the matter under his notice, and under the notice of the Cabinet, so that this glaring anomaly may be rectified. I do not think any one can justify a policy which mulcts a man in a pecuniary penalty for serving his country, when he takes a risk of his life, severs his home ties, and makes other sacrifices. </para>
