Is the Leader of the Senate aware that a question has been asked in another place as to whether it was the intention of the Government to give honorable members an opportunity of considering the advisability of dealing with the term of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins' appointment, and that ah answer was given by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> reflecting upon a recent decision of the Judge and intimating that the House would be afforded an opportunity of discussing the curtailment of. the period of his appointment ? Has the Minister seen that statement in the press, and if so is it the intention of the Government to take any steps to- invite Parliament to deal with the matter foreshadowed ? </para>

                    <para class="block">As honorable senators are aware, the purpose of the Bill is to provide for the appointment of a" Minister controlling repatriation. There can be no doubt, in the minds of those acquainted with the repatriation scheme, that it can only be made effective by appointing a Minister and making him responsible for its administration, in the same way as other Ministers are responsible for the administration of their respective Departments. There may be some criticism concerning the increase in the number of salaried Ministers during a time of war and financial stress, but I would like to bring before the Senate certain facts relating to the increased functions of the Government, largely attributable to war conditions. </para>
                    <para>I have before me some figures showing that the trading functions of the Government directly connected with, and caused by, the war represent a gross total of sales of produce, &amp;c, of £102,317,140, while the increased cost of war services is £47,168,000. ' Everybody knows that these increases must mean a considerable addition to. the work which falls upon responsible Ministers, and, therefore, necessitate an addition to the number of salaried portfolios. I should like to indicate briefly the increased activities of the Commonwealth since the outbreak of the war. In regard to shipping, there has been the provision of freight for wheat, chartering, &amp;c. ; the control of freight rates in Australian waters; the purchase of the Commonwealth Government line of steamers and the management of same; the establishment of a Shipping Board to control all freight matters and the management of ex-enemy and interned ships used for commercial purposes. The wheat scheme has involved the creation and management of the Wheat Pool. On the military side there has been the necessity to provide troops for active service abroad, including their equipment, supply of stores, transport, &amp;c. ; the administration of enemy territory in Commonwealth military occupation, and, in addition to this, there has been the censorship, apart .from <inline font-style="italic">th&amp;</inline> control of news. In finance there has been need to negotiate war loans, provide for increased taxation, income tax, entertainments tax, and control of the raising of money for amusements, the notation of companies, &amp;c, as well as to provide the machinery for war pensions. On the industrial side it has been necessary to take steps to prevent Australian coal' from reaching the enemy or enemy sympathizers, while at the same time not interfering with the Australian trade in coal, as well as the need to control the distribution of coal owing to industrial unrest. It has further been necessary to take steps to prevent trading with the enemy, and to promote Australian trade. In metals we have had to provide for the elimination of enemy influence and the establishment of an Australian Metal Exchange to register contracts and to provide for the encouragement of ore-refining in Australia, and generally to assist the base metal industry. In science, the war has rendered advisable 'the establishment of the Commonwealth Advisory Council, and in regard to produce we have had to create machinery to fix the maximum prices of foodstuffs, create pools to handle certain lines, to establish a Leather Industries Board to insure adequate supplies for military purposes, and to meet the requirements of local manufactures and control the export trade. Then the Government have arranged for the sale of this season's frozen rabbits to the Imperial Government, and have assumed control of sugar supplies. A public trustee has been appointed to hold and deal with enemy property, provision has been made for the suspension and avoidance of enemy patents and tirade marks, and a directorate has been appointed to insure an increase in supply of the material for munitions purposes. Passports have also been dealt with, the Government have assumed control of the wool production, have given assistance to the fruit industry, and arranged for the disposal of jam and canned fruits. In addition, we have rendered assistance in the sale of surplus butter and cheese to the Imperial Government. </para>
                    <para>All these functions have added to the responsibility of the Government, and yet there are people outside who will say that there is no need for an increase in the number of Ministers, or 'that' if an increase is made there should be no addition to the salaries paid. I want to point out, however, that the membership of the British Government has been increased considerably since the commencement of the war, the following appointments having been made - Minister of Munitions, appointed in 1915, at a salary of £5,000 per annum; the Minister of Pensions, appointed in 1916, at an annual salary of £2,000; Minister of Labour, Minister of Food, Minister of Shipping, appointed in 1916, at an annual salary of £2,000 each; Minister of National Service, appointed 1917, at an annual salary of £2,000. In the sister Dominion of New Zealand also, where the amount of work entailed by the war has been very much less than in Australia, it has been found necessary to appoint two additional Ministers since the war began. I think, therefore, there is ample justification for the course that is now being taken. </para>
                    <para>The scope of the duties of the new Minister will be considerable, because not only will he be required to administer repatriation, but he also will be the connecting link between the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of the States in so far as land settlement is concerned. The Prime Minister has already announced that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> the Leader of the Government in this Chamber, will take the new portfolio, and I am sure he will fill the position with credit to himself and the Senate. </para>

If the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has proved anything at all, he has proved too much by the long list, of additional duties quoted as having fallen upon the ' Government owing to the war, and it looks as if not one, but two or three more Ministers are required. </para>

                            <para>- When interrupted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie I was proceeding to show that the Minister for Defence had proved too much by quoting a long list of additional duties, and I. said that there appeared to be need, not for one additional Minister, but for several. I point out that the framers of the Constitution limited the amount of money to be appropriated for the salaries of Ministers, and although there has been a considerable increase in the functions of the Government since then, I think the Government, elected as a Win-the-war Ministry - which implied the necessity for rigid economy - should not, in a time of war, seek to increase the amount of money to be appropriated for Ministerial salaries. That, to my mind, is an objectionable feature of the present Bill. </para>

                            <para>- My colleagues in the late Ministry know perfectly well that the question of pay never troubled me.' But I would remind honorable senators that Australia occupies to-day avery different position from that which it occupied two years ago. Our expenditure is continually climbing. Only a few days ago this branch of the Legislature affirmed that a man who is not earning £50 per year will have to contribute £5 annually towards the repatriation scheme. Yet it is now proposed that the Minister who will control that scheme -shall be provided with a salary of £1,650 per year. There is a logical mind in the community, and we cannot enforce taxation upon people who have not, while increasing the emoluments of those who have, without drawing from the public a judgment which will be unfavorable to us.- I do hope that the Government will postpone the proposed appropriation on behalf of the Minister for Repatriation until after the war. </para>

                    <para>The other day, when we were dealing with a proposal to tax the single men of this community, I expressed the view that the position was not so grave that we could not afford to exempt men who were in receipt of only £156 per year. But the Committee decided that there should be no exemptions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> subsequently moved that single men who are in receipt of incomes of only £100 per year should be exempted from, the operation of the tax.  His  proposal was rejected. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' Barnes</inline> then moved to exempt single men who are in receipt of only £50 per year, and once more the Committee affirmed that the money was needed, and must be paid. Yet, we have now submitted for our consideration a measure connected with repatriation, under which it is proposed to provide a salary of £1,650 per year for an additional Minister. I do not object to Ministers being well paid. They have to shoulder enormous responsibilities. They are frequently criticised unfairly, and held responsible not merely for their own misdoings, but also for the mistakes of their officers. They are in no way overpaid. But I object to the hypocrisy that is involved in compelling a man with no income to contribute £5 a year towards the repatriation scheme, while providing the Minister who controls that scheme with a salary of £1,650 a year. There is nothing personal in my criticism. I simply say that the time is inopportune to increase the pay either of Ministers or of members of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I do not mind admitting that it will be cheap for Parliament to pay any person who is required to render services under that measure, and to pay him well. Quite recently we have passed a Bill under which excess profits made by any person during the war will be taxed to the extent of 50 per cent, during the first year, and of 75 per cent, during the second year. When a new Minister is appointed, and Ministerial salaries are increased, surely it must be admitted that these increases represent war-time profits. I agree that there is not only a necessity for the appointment of an additional Minister, 'but that there is need for the appointment of several additional Ministers. I am in accord with the principle of the Bill, but upon the clause which provides for the appropriation of more money for the Ministerial pool I shall press for a division in Committee. </para>

                    <para>The first of these amendments will, I think, commend itself to the Committee. It defines what is meant by the term " child," which, under the Acts Interpretation Act also means " children." , The second amendment may seem long, but it is, so far as the two first paragraphs are concerned, a mere restatement, in more ample terms, of the definition contained in the Bill as it left this Chamber. The later paragraphs introduce fresh matter, and that is the provision for the inclusion of Australians who have served with the Imperial or Dominion Forces, and also of nurses who have served similarly with the nursing staffs associated with, or attached to, military units of the Imperial authorities, or any of the sister Dominions. </para>

                        <para>.- I should think that it only needs the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> to have this amendment accepted by the Minister. Personally, I think that every member of the Commission should be a returned man. We have sent, or may send, some 400,000 of the physically fittest and best men in Australia to participate in the war; and who shall say that out of that number we cannot find men able to conduct the whole of this repatriation business! Failing that, the representation of the men ought certainly .to consist of two soldiers and one sailor. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sorry that I am not able to accept the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> Both Chambers debated whether the representation should consist of three, and both have decided in favour of two as a -fair allotment, in view of the fact* that the general public interest has to be considered and conserved on the  Commission. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> reminds  me that the House of Representatives' amendment will not prevent the Minister, if it be deemed desirable, appointing more than two representatives, which is the minimum number. No one wishes to decry 'the magnificent work done by the naval branch of the Defence Force; but of the 5,000 men on the water, 3,000 are permanent, and hardly eligible for positions on the Commission. It does not seem reasonable to ask that 3,000 men shall have 50 per cent, of the representation when 370,000 men are concerned. </para>

I should be prepared to accept the representation of one soldier and one sailor, but the Navy ought to be represented, and I shall do my level best to see that it is. We know that, as a rule, there is a good deal of jealousy between the two arms of the service arising from a fear that one may be getting more advantages than the other, and I desire to do away with that jealousy by making their pay equal. v </para>

Although I know that in the Old Country there is a certain amount of feeling between the two arms of the service, I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is quite wrong in suggesting that there is any such feeling in Australia.

                    <para>It is unnecessary, in my opinion, to deal with this question as some honorable senators have done. Every soldier on the Commission will represent every person to whom this repatriation scheme applies,  and the same may be said of any sailor or civilian who may be appointed to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> like every other honorable senator, desires that every possible assistance should be given to our returned soldiers - and sailors, but &gt;we must not forget that there are two classes to be represented on this Commission - the class that is to pay, and the class that is to receive. The representation proposed by the Government is very fair, and I believe that the majority of -the members of the Commission will be chosen from the ranks of the returned soldiers. I have no fear that this Bill, framed as it is, will fail to provide ample representation for returned soldiers and sailors, as well as for their dependants. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that the representation of the taxpayers by the Minister, as  Chairman  of the Commission, should he amply sufficient for their protection, and I favour the selection of every other representative from the ranks of those who have gone to the Front. With the exception of the Minister, members of the Commission should be drawn from those who have been in the fighting line, whether they be nurses, doctors, soldiers, or sailors. I have the suspicion that a number of the seats of this Commission are being reserved for those who have  ' reneged ' ' on the Labour movement. I should like such gentlemen to be effectually cut out. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Foll</inline> appears 1 o . think that if the Commission consisted solely of returned soldiers and sailors, it might play ducks and drakes with the public finances. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not desire, at this juncture, to delay the consideration of this matter. I am very anxious that the proposal embodied in my amendment should be carried out. It is immaterial to. me, how-  ever; whether it is or is not inserted in the Bill, provided I can obtain from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> the assurance that, if a suitable naval officer can be found for the purpose, a naval representative will be  appointed to the Commission. I would remind the Committee that naval men may be left in any part of the world, and that soldiers do not recognise the work that will be involved in returning them. The whole consular system of the British Empire is familiar to the average naval man, whereas soldiers know nothing about it. I shall not press my amendment if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will give me the assurance for which I have asked. </para>

If one of the number is a naval man, so much the better. I cannot go further than that. If any one knowing these men cares to submit the name of a competent person, I will give it the same consideration that I shall give to the names of members of any other branch of the service. </para>

                            <para>. - I made certain quotations from a publication which I thought should not have been censored. Some of the quotations were reports of police court proceedings and other unsavoury details reflecting on Australian soldiers, which I did not wish to give additional publicity to. I was quite willing that those quotations should be struck out of the report of my remarks, and should not appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> But when a motion was brought forward to strike out the whole of the quotations, many of them bearing valuable testimony to the effect which the drink traffic is having on our resources, I certainly objected. </para>

I have no desire to use Parliament as a vehicle for spreading matter which, even though true, reflects on our soldiers.

He practically set up this position, that these quotations should not have been censored, and all his remarks centred on that point. If only portions of the quotations are expunged from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and the rest stand as they are, members of the public who read the report will say, " This is what was censored. What is there in it to justify such a proceeding?" The other portions will appear linked: <inline font-style="italic">up</inline> with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> statement as the parts which were censored. Therefore, he will see, on reflection, that all the quotations should be deleted. </para>

This is the last opportunity that we shall have to deal with the matter, and I. think that it justifies' a suspension of the Standing Orders'. I appeal to the honorable senator not to oppose; this motion. He has given as a reason for his opposition the fact that it is proposed to expunge the whole of the quotations, but I point out to him that if anything less is done a fake impression will be created. I do not think that he wants to create a false impression. </para>

I have no doubt that new members of the Senate understand the reason also, but in order to make the matter quite clear, let me say that the ' object is to leave Parliament in such a position that, should any event occur to necessitate its being summoned at short notice, it will be competent to re-assemble here. </para>
