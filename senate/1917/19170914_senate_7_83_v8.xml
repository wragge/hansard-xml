                            <para>The distance to the Perth station was, approximately, 7,000 miles, while to Sydney <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> America, across which it was presumed the sound waves travelled, the distance was about 12,000 miles. The receipt of messages at this range, it was stated by Commander Creswell, constituted a world's record. He explained that, owing to the effect which light had upon wireless waves, German messages only reached Sydney when they were transmitted at night. The distance to Perth being, however, some thousands of miles shorter, the Western Australian station caught and recorded messages sent out from Germany either by night or day. Commander Creswell added that while these remarkable achievements had become possible solely as a result of the great developments which had token place in the science of wireless telegraphy, an important part was played by the operators, and it was due largely to their skill that German messages were being  intercepted and interpreted by Australian stations. The lecture, which was the -first of a new series arranged by the United Service Institute foT the benefit of officers of the Naval and Military Forces, was well attended. </para>

                    <para>For the benefit of the public generally, we might mention that nine years ago, to be precise, on 15th May, 1908, W. M. Hughes in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Tramway and Railway Record</inline> had these words: - "It is true that the blackleg is free to sell himself to the employer and betray his workmates. The traitor who sells his country fin joys the same freedom. Judas was free to sell Christ, and he sold Him, and  Was  for ever damned in thiB world and the next." In case the public may be puzzled at the above extract, it is necessary to, add that the Hughes of 1908 is the same Hughes who, a couple of weeks ago, instituted agencies for the recruiting of blackleg labour. </para>

                <para>This, and the measure immediately following, are rendered necessary by the peculiar circumstances under which this Parliament met. The original Act for the appointment of Public Works and Public Accounts Committees required the Committees to be appointed during the first session of the Parliament. The first session of this Parliament took place when portion of the old Senate was still in existence, and it was not then deemed advisable, or, indeed, right, to appoint the Committees under the then existing circumstances.

I refer chiefly to the one under which sub-foremen are appointed to report each week what work is being done, the cost of the material, the material consumed, and, particularly, whether any of the members of the Committee are unsatisfactory or surplus. It is an excellent opportunity for the Senate to get exact information from its own members as to the working of the card system. I should not like the whole system to be introduced, because it might bring about a strike, but I should like card No. 6 to be applied. </para>

                    <para>. - This is the pivotal clause of the Bill, and I should like the Minister to explain clearly the reference made to the accounting period, and indicate how businesses would fare which issue their balance-sheets on 30th September, . 1915, which would be a couple or three months after the accounting period fixed. It seems to me that under the clause the fixing of the accounting period would create a good many complications in some cases. For instance, if a business balanced on 30th September, 1915, would that year be the pre-war year, or would the pre-war year be the year ended 30th September, 1914? If so, their would be a hiatus of nine months as between the accounting period and the date fixed for the commencement of the operation of the Bill, namely, 30th June, 1915. I should like some information on this point, so that business people may know clearly what sort of returns they should send in. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that the specific question put by the. honorable senator is whether, in cases in which the accounting period ends on the 30th September, 1915, that period would commence on 30th September, 1914? My answer is that it would date from 30th September, 1913. </para>

                    <para>. - This matter must receive some consideration. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has admitted that there will be a hiatus of nine months in connexion with the balance-sheets of some businesses in the Commonwealth. There are many businesses which issue balance-sheets on 30th September each year, and in the compilation of their returns all of these will be obliged to go back nine months in order to establish a pre-war standard of profits. The nine months between 30th. September, 1913, and 30th June, 1914, will be lost. No account of it will be taken either one way or the other. I should like to see a provision made in the Bill for monthly averages to be taken from 30th September, 1913, to 30th June, 1915. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the Minister has been sufficiently clear on this point. I should like to know whether, in their decisions, the income tax authorities will be guided by the promises which have been made in both Houses of this Parliament during the consideration of the Bill? I am sure that as we proceed with this discussion we shall recognise the increasing difficulties of the measure. We shall certainly realize that one man, in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ewing</inline> - wen if he were the Archangel Gabriel himself - will not be able to lay down equitable lines. It seems to me that regard should be paid by the income tax authorities to the pronouncements that are made by Ministers in both branches of the Legislature. I ask the Committee to consider whether this clause should not be entirely recast. On the admission of the Vice-President of the Executive Council himself, many businesses will have to drop out of their returns nine months of their business operations. The amendments made in another place in regard to the accounting period have tended towards simplicity, but that simplicity has not gone as far as it might go. At all events, this clause will result in losing the standard of profits of many businesses which balance on 30th September each year. The further we look into the measure the more complicated does it become. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable senator has referred to this -clause as another of the complexities of the Bill. As a matter of fact it is as plain as 3. pikestaff. It is not a complexity, but a bogy that the honorable senator has raised. The purpose of the clause is to enable the Department to ascertain what was the taxpayer's pre-war standard of profit. To enable it to do this, it will take the last three balance-sheets upon which the taxpayer has based his income tax returns. It will not ask him to adjust a single figure in those returns. It will merely say to him, " Out of your last three complete years you may select the two years which are best from our point of view, and those two years shall determine your pre-war standard of profits." That is simplicity itself. The arrangement was devised to save the taxpayer from the complexity which would arise if he were required to bring his accounting period up to the date when this Bill will commence to operate. The period referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> as a hiatus might disclose either an increased or decreased profit. It is pure supposition as to which way it would work. While in some cases it might help the individual in others it might injure him. </para>

                    <para>. - In the case of a business which balances on 30th September, 1915, the Vice-President of the Executive Council would go back to the balance-sheet of 30th September, 1914, and the balance-sheets for the two previous years, in order to establish the pre-war standard of profit. It is clear, therefore, that no consideration will be given to the operations of any business which balances on 30th September in any year, in determining the pre-war standard as between 30th September, 1914, and 30th June, 1915. </para>

                    <para>. - I think it would be as well to make this accounting period as elastic as possible, otherwise it may work injury to some individuals. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has already pointed out that it is quite a simple matter for the taxpayer to select any two out of three pre-war years for the purpose of establishing his pre-war standard of profits. But if the taxpayer chooses to go to the trouble of making up another balance-sheet, I think that the Commissioner might very well consent to that procedure being adopted. If the individual were permitted to make up his balance-sheet, and to ignore the regular accounting period, an improvement would be effected in the measure. The same question will arise in sub-clause 12 of clause 16 of the Bill. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council can see his way to make the accounting period elastic, while more work will be thrown on the taxpayer, it may avoid hardship being inflicted upon him. </para>

I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that under another clause of the Bill, if the three pre-war years were years of abnormal depression in connexion with a particular business, those controlling it are entitled to take the. three previous years, so that they may not be unduly burdened by this taxation. What the honorable senator proposes is that if the owner of a business made abnormal profits during the nine months immediately preceding the war, he might include them in his accounting period, in order to raise his pre-war standard of profits, and if he had a bad time during those nine months he could avail himself of the option given him under the Bill and go back to the earlier years. However much an honorable senator may be interested in the business' of particular firms or individuals, that does not seem to me to be a reasonable thing to ask. </para>

                    <para>- I frankly admit that I do not understand this measure, and do not think that anybody else does, and I want some explanation. I had an opportunity of going through the books of one firm, and I find that they made a clear profit of £14,000 in one year, whilst in the next year they made a profit of only £1,200. In this case, by reckoning the accounting period in one way, the business would have to pay this tax on the good year, but by* reckoning it  in another way it would escape on the bad year. I believe  that an amendment of this particular provision was made in another place. One business balancing on the 30th July will have to go back for twelve months and pay the tax, and another business being carried on next door, whose balancing period is different, may escape scot free. </para>

                    (New South Wales - Vice-President of the Executive Council) [11.49]. -A business will not be t allowed to go scot free. The object of  the  clause is to ascertain the profits made by a firm or business -prior to the war, and for this purpose the ordinary balance-sheets of a firm are taken. The war broke out on the 4th August, and, in order to determine what a firm made in pre-war years, we take what the books show that it made in its last financial years prior to the war, and accept that as the prewar standard. The alternative is to ask the business man to revise the whole of his bookkeeping, and draw up a balance-sheet to the 3rd August, though his ordinary practice may be to balance on the 31st December. We give him the right to take the last three years prior to the war, and the option of taking the- two years of those three which best suit him. That, I think, may be regarded as a concession which will more than compensate for any little disadvantage which in particular cases might arise from adherence ito the accepted accounting period.

                        <para>- We should deal with every taxpayer alike. The purpose of the Bill is to discover what were the profits of a business prior to the war. Under this clause, a firm balancing some months prior to the 4th August may be prevented from taking advantage of what may have been a very profitable period in estimating its pre-war profits. If the accounting period were made- elastic, a business would be given the opportunity of including that profitable time in its accounting period. I do not see why there should be any objection to that. I do not think that, because a firm balances its books at a particular time, it should he asked to cut out possibly a very profitable period of nine months and thirty days in estimating its pre-war profits. If the taxpayer, with the consent of the Commissioner, is willing to go to the trouble and expense of making up a balance-sheet to the 4th August, apart from his customary balance-sheet, there should be no objection to his doing so. </para>

                        <para>- In other words, the levy will be upon the percentage standard just as if there are no pre-war profits. I think the Government would be well advised to consider whether, in connexion with fixing the pre-war standard, the balancing day nearest to 4th August, 1914, should be taken. I will leave this point, and will later refer to other parts of the clause. I remind the Committee that there are fifty-five lines of the Bill covered by this clause. I am not clear as to what is really meant by sub-clause 3, and I should he glad if the Minister will explain its incidence. </para>

In moving the second reading of the Bill, the honorable senator admitted that it is an intricate measure, and said that it lent itself more to explanation in Committee.

                        <para>- My colleague from New South Wales has asked the Minister for an explanation of sub-clause 3. That is a fair request, because the whole clause is the most complicated in the Bill, and I do not think it has been suggested that we should hurry in our discussion of the measure. The explanation has been asked for, and I think it will expedite matters' if the Minister will give it. Personally, I have been anxious to see the clause passed, so that we may consider the following clause, to which I propose to move some amendments. I think, also, that an explanation would help as a guide to those officials who will have the responsibility of administering the Act. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that during the discussion of this Bill in Committee there will be no suggestion that any honorable senator has any axe to grind. I am not concerned with one single business that will be affected, either adversely or profitably ; but as one having some experience of the commercial section of this great Commonwealth, I do know that business houses, as a rule, balance at quarterly intervals, either at 30th June, 30th September, 31st December, or 31st March ; or, alternatively, on the 1st of October, January, April, or July. The Leader of the Senate should l._ suggest that there is something behind this action on the part of honorable senators who are criticising the clause. It is clear that there is some anomaly in the Bill. It has been admitted that in the case of a business balancing on the 30"Bh September, that business will have to go back' nine months before it commences its pre-war standard. I say, most deliberately, that I have no axe to grind. Now that the second reading has been- agreed to, I desire to try to improve the Bill; and. - in this respect, before the clause passes, I should like to direct attention to the discretionary power given to the Commissioner. Sub-clause 4 gives that official discretionary power to determine the accounting period in certain cases; and in thirty-seven different places throughout the Bill the Commissioner has discretionary power invested in him in some form or other. </para>

However capable that gentleman may be - and I believe, he is here now - however keen he may be, and however full of knowledge of the whole of our trading, commercial, and manufacturing conditions, if he were the Archangel Gabriel he would not be able to determine, in a manner satisfactory to the commercial community, all the questions that will come before him.

                <para class="block">Committee. No doubt it is far the easiest thing to do to end the discussion and close up Parliament next week ; but I say, with all deliberation, that the commercial community of this country has not had too good a time in connexion with the discretion of the Income Tax Commissioner. Chambers of Manufactures, business men, and Chambers of Commerce, ever since the income tax has been levied, have been protesting against some injustice under that Act. I can quote one injustice in connexion with machinery. Up to now, the Commissioner has in about nine cases out of ten refused to allow more than 5 per cent, for depreciation. It is-quite true that he allows for renewals and repairs, but any purchase of new machinery has to be added to capital. In the case of automatic machinery, such as is used in tin-can making, in confectionery establishments, or in some of the more intricate of engineering work, the Commissioner will not allow more than 5 per cent, for depreciation; and anybody acquainted with manufacturing will know that machinery is not supposed to last for twenty years. This discretionary power to be invested in the Commissioner appears frequently in this Bill. I have with me papers wherein protest after protest has been made by representatives of organizations; but, owing to.: the congestion of war work, these protests have merely been noted; and probably pigeonholed. I am bringing this question up now, so that there shall be no mistake as to what the discretion of the Commissioner means. If it is going to mean, in the thirty-seven clauses where it is given, the same power as it has meant in connexion with the depreciation of machinery, then God help the new industries. Even the State Government will allow 10 per cent., which is a fair thing; but the difference between the 5 per cent, allowed by the Commonwealth and the 10 per cent, allowed by the State is a robbery from the profits which are made by industrial concerns. </para>

                    <para>.- I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> in resenting .the imputation of the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> that there is something behind this discussion. I did not rise to prolong the debate on that account, but to suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that he should submit amendments, and let us deal with them on their merits. If the debate is continued on the lines of criticising a clause and asking the Minister for an explanation, it will be interminable. Therefore, with the view to expedite the consideration of the measure, I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that, in regard to clauses which are not satisfactory from his stand-point, he should submit definite amendments to improve them. I am sure that if that course were taken we would get on more expeditiously, and also more satisfactorily. I suggest to the Leader of the Senate, too, that he should reserve his gibes, and use them, as he has used them in the past, for the Opposition only. I earnestly appeal to him to refrain from this sort of conduct, because I can see that his gibes hurt a new member of the Senate. </para>

                <para class="block">A co-operative company is a class of company which we all wish to encourage as much as possible, but there are a number of companies carrying on business which have really become proprietary companies; they are exactly the same. There is a general feeling in favour of doing away with the middleman. We want to encourage farmers or fruit-growers to come together and form co-operative companies. But cooperative companies have no business, so far as- 1 can see, to pay dividends or to make profits at all. The basic idea of a co-operative company is that only the actual cost of the distribution of the products should be charged to each individual. The original object in starting a number of these companies was to escape the large charges which were imposed upon them. But they have drifted very far from that aim, and there are n6w a great number of co-operative companies which are neither more nor less than trading concerns, carrying on just the same as ordinary agents who are trading alongside of them. If we exempt co-operative companies of that character from this tax we shall enable a company to trade against an ordinary commission agent who is alongside, and very often a poor man starting in business. It does not appear to me that that would be fair. Some of the wealthier co-operators buy lt he shares of the smaller co-operators, and then they declare large dividends. My view is that 0a co-operative company has no business to make money. We are asked to exempt these companies from a tax on war-time profits, something which they have made over and above what they made in ordinary times. That seems to me a great anomaly. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will see his way to cut these companies out of the Bill, because the idea of a cooperative company making war-time profits, or profits at all, is ridiculous. </para>

                        <para>- A company was started, and there were so many shares representing the capital originally paid in. The richer men in the company bought out the poorer men. The smaller co-operator, as a rule, gets hard up, and sells his shares to the richer co-operator, who then becomes the owner of the cooperative company, and it trades exactly the same as an ordinary company. I, do not think that we would inflict any hardship if we did not exempt these companies from the tax. If they make war- time profits, they should pay the tax. </para>

                        <para>- Practically all the exemptions of businesses. I do not propose to strike out the exemptions in regard to profits which are not taxed. What the Bill purports to do is to tax war-time profits. Yet the Committee is asked to adopt that method of holding the balance fairly between two different kinds of businesses. Take a produce business which is conducted by a co-operative concern, in opposition to a profits business which belongs to an ordinary company, and, therefore, is not co-operative, or which is carried on by a single individual. Why should two businesses, making equal profits and run on the same business lines, have to pay a war-time profits tax, and another business have no tax to pay? That differentiation should not be allowed. </para>

                <para class="block">I may be accused of wanting to tax agriculture. Suppose that after a man had been farming for some years he found that it would be more profitable to dispose of his farm and buy a business. Suppose that he sold his farm to a man who had been engaged in a business for some time, and with the proceeds bought that business. By bringing business methods to bear on the work of farming the new farmer finds that, owing to the increased prices for his produce in war time he is making a handsome return, perhaps a fortune. Although the old farmer has invested his capital in a business, he finds that the whole, or the greater part, of his return during the war period goes into the business. If it is to be a war-time profits tax, let it bear evenly upon all shoulders. </para>

                    <para>. -  I believe, in the words of the Prime Minister, " We must look to the wealthy people to provide the money to carry on this war ; everybody must pay ; none shall escape." But by this Bill more will escape than are going to pay. It is going to strangle some rising industries that we should foster, while allowing others who have made large profits during the war to escape. Why is the agriculturist exempted? Why is the pastoralist exempted? They have all made money during the war . whereas the business of a man who is trying to produce something that is necessary for the industries of this country is to be strangled. I have previously mentioned a firm producing fire-bricks, a necessary article which has to be imported if it is not  made here. They have spent £25,000 in perfecting this silesia brick, they made no profits until last year, and now they are going to be taxed on those profits. Opposite their factory, in New South Wales, there is a pastoralist's run; he has made enormous profits out of the sale of beef during the war, but he is to escape scot-free. </para>

The Bill has been brought forward by a Government composed of two sections which have been diametrically opposed to one another <inline font-style="italic">i-i</inline> their methods of taxation in the past. It hardly seems possible that they could bring in a Bill which would give satisfaction to all their following. If, even at this late hour, we struck out all the exemptions except those of charitable institutions we would make it much more just than it is, because now it picks out certain incomes for taxation and others for exemption. The only fair way to deal with it is to strike out the whole of the exemptions, and let every one pay on the same basis. </para>

                    proposal to abolish all exemptions. I realize the truth of what he has said regarding the hardship which, may be inflicted on some business men, but there are certain industries in this country which at a time like this must be particularly guarded and fostered. While doing that, we must recognise that the purpose of the Bill must be carried out, which is to get extra revenue from the source which is most able to afford it, and which in the interests of Australia we can most legitimately levy on.

                    <para>- The man who grows wool is probably in quite a good position, owTng to the demand for wool and the high price, to pay extra taxation at a time like this. At no period in 'the history of any country has it been more important that the protection or fostering of the primary industries for the production of the necessaries of life in Australia should be undertaken. On the 6th August, 1914, speaking to a body of miners to try to induce them to continue working, I said the man behind the plough or behind the pick before this war was over would be of equal importance with the man behind the gun. That expression stands good today. Following up that policy, the Government of which I was Premier advanced a considerable sum for the purchase of seed wheat to give the farmers every opportunity to prosecute this policy of production. The farmers in Tasmania took advantage of it, and acres of land went under cultivation which had not been under cultivation before. We have to follow the same policy, and, although we are under difficulties at the present time to get our wheat away, I am sanguine that they will be overcome. Every bushel of wheat and other agricultural produce that can be exported will be of the utmost value to the Allies before the war is over. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators seem .to follow the policy that because there is something in the Bill which is wrong, they are going to put something in which is as bad or worse. I will help the honorable senator to exempt shipbuilders from the payment of this tax. It is a new industry, essential to the interests of Australia. I will help to exempt from the tax new industries which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> pointed out. are of vital importance to the nation. If, by grasping at the increased revenue to be derived from this tax. we retard the introduction and establishment of industries which will be for all time an advantage to the Commonwealth, we shall be grasping at the shadow and losing the substance. Vital and important as it is that we should have money for the prosecution of the war, we must not get it at the expense of retarding the industries cf Australia. The producing industry is of such importance, particularly at this time, that there is a justification for its exemption from the Bill. Hence, while I am prepared to assist to exempt new industries which have been started or are about to be started, and to remove exemptions from such persons as professional men, many of whom, I believe, receive considerably increased incomes in consequence of the war, I cannot vote to remove from the list of exemptions an industry which is vital to the interests of the nation and its Allies. I noted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> illustration of the farmer and the business man changing places, but the farmer is carrying on a business of vital importance to the nation, and the other goes into the trading business, which, although useful, is not vital. I admit it is hard on him to tax him in this way - it is hard on anybody to have to pay an excess fax - but if we are going to have a Bill at all. we cannot avoid it. We must- pass a Bill of this kind, and if we find anomalies in it, we must submit to them. We cannot meet all such objections as that raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> if we are going to have an excess profits tax at all. I recognise the force of his argument, but it is impracticable to carry out his wishes. </para>

                        <para>- The revelations will come in about three or six months from the honorable senator's constituents, when they begin to feel the complications of this Bill. The policy of the National Government was to impose a war-time profits tax, and it was announced, even by the Leader of the Government in this Chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> that all those persons who make extra profits in war time ought to be taxed. With such a long list of exemptions, this Bill will not tax all those persons who have made extra profits during the war. I have every sympathy with the man on the land, but I fail to see why an extra profit made by a fruit-grower, for example, should not be taxed if ,an -extra profit made by the man who dries that fruit is to be taxed. I cannot see why an extra profit made in wheat-growing should not be taxed equally with an extra profit made by the millers in rolling that wheat. I fail to understand why a doctor should escape this taxation when an agent is to be subjected to it. I cannot see why, under this Bill, an accountant, a solicitor, or a barrister should not be required to pay when a broker is to be taxed. There is no fairness whatever in the exemptions contained in the measure. Gold-mining is to be exempted from its operation, but tin-mining - although tin is of no greater average value since the war than it was- in the  three years immediately prior to the war - is to be taxed. . Many of the wealthy mining companies in Australia have already exempted themselves from this proposed taxation by making no greater profits during the war period, despite the rise that there has been in the value of metals, than they made prior to the war. Last night I saw the balance-sheet of one of these companies, which fully confirms all that I said in this connexion on the  motion for the second reading of the Bill. If we must have a measure of this kind let us tax- everybody who m,akes an extra profit, and exempt nobody. When once we commence to make exemptions we begin to complicate the issue. I hope that the amendment will be carried, but my attitude towards it has not been influenced by the fact that it has been submitted by ' the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner).</inline> No m.atter how heavy may be the taxation that is imposed upon the trading and mercantile community of Australia, there will be far less dissatisfaction, if we impose a heavy tax which will hit everybody alike, than there will be if we impose <inline font-style="italic">p,</inline> light tax which will make flesh of one and fowl of another. I shall vote for the elimination of all exemptions. If the amendment is defeated I shall propose a new clause which will exempt somebody else. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly. I am Very much amazed at the keen interest that is exhibited in the Bill by honorable senators of the Ministerial party. They seem to realize that under its operation a large number of their constituents will be asked to p,»y something towards the national 'revenue, and, apparently, that payment will be a very unpleasant procedure. There appears to be one striking inconsistency in this clause. Why should we tax any person's business if we permit a solicitor to go soot-free? Surely if we are prepared to fasten on to a flour miller, and to make him pay this tax, solicitors and barristers ought .also to be obliged to contribute to the national exchequer ! Of course, it is impossible to accurately ascertain what fees solicitors earn. Some of them do not make very much, but others make substantial incomes </para>

                        <para>- If a man is making a profit during the war period he ought to be required to pay the tax. The distinction between war profits and war-time profits is a little too fine for me to appreciate. Seeing that we are bound to collect a great deal of money to enable us to prosecute the war, we ought not to countenance such a distinction. It has been asserted that since the introduction of the maternity allowance the fees of medical men have increased to such an extent as to annex a very substantial portion of that allowance. Why should these men escape taxation ? It is almost impossible to differentiate between what are, and what are not, war-time' profits. T7nder this, clause solicitors, barristers, and doctors, together with a whole army of other persons who can afford to pay taxation just as well as can some 'of the friends of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> - some of the big squatters of this country - will be exempt from taxation. It is very commonly stated that men who possess no property whatever are making huge profits in Australia, and authorities like John Stuart Mill and Adam Smith have erroneously laid it down that such persons ought to be called upon to pay taxation. The Bill will interfere' with. industry all along the line, it will nob create any fresh avenues of employment, and it seeks to take from people something they have earned, arid to .use it for the benefit of the community. As the Government possesses a substantial working majority in this Chamber the passing of the Bill is a foregone conclusion. </para>

But if honorable senators opposite who are opposed to the Bill will act in .accordance with their convictions, the measure may not pass in its present form. I repeat that there is no justification for exempting solicitors and doctors from the operation of this Bill. It is also proposed to exempt profits arising from gold-mining operations. ' Why should that be done if we tax the profits arising from mining wolfram, molybdenite, scheelite, and tungsten ? </para>

The industries which derive their profits from war conditions, in common with all other industries, will be subject to the provisions of the Income Tax Acts. To my great astonishment, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, despite the mental acuteness with which we are all prepared to credit him, denied last night that from the early stages of the discussion of this matter -tine idea was that there should be taxation of war prdfits, and not of wartime profits. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but "excess " profits. My contention is that many enterprises that materialized before and since the beginning of the war have no pre-war standard of profits, or any profit directly derivable from war conditions, and yet they will be taxed under this measure. I do not suppose that my protests will be very effective. I did not anticipate that they would, but I must make them heard. I welcome any opportunity which the close investigation of the various clauses of this Bill will give honorable senators to show the public that they are not insensible to the injustices which will almost inevitably be inflicted by its instrumentality. I am not going to adopt the attitude adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> who says that the measure may be wrong or right, but whether wrong or right, everything must be swept into it. I am sorry that such a clear reasoner as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> should, perhaps in sheer desperation, have allied himself with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> in this matter. </para>

                        <para>- There are none so blind as those who care not to see. I believe that the trouble in which we have involved ourselves is due to the attempt to prove the exploitation of the people by men who are benefiting from war conditions. There may be substantial profits made which are directly traceable to war conditions, and if we had adhered carefully to our original intention to secure those profits, we might have readily succeeded in doing so, and at the same time have been guiltless of inflicting any injustice upon the producers of the Commonwealth. But we have been led astray in connexion with the matter, and now, because of some imagined difficulties we are losing ourselves in a wandering maze. </para>

But if we are not going to adhere strictly to that principle, and if, on the contrary, we are to legislate in terms of expediency, and along the lines of least resistance, not of the taxpayer, but of the legislator, we shall inflict very grave injustice. To show the iniquity incidental to the operation of this clause, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has pointed out that the production of one metal will be exempt, whilst the production of another will be brought under the operation of the Bill. </para>

                <para>In some respects it may be said that the agriculturist will be worse off ' than the miner under the Bill. The products of the agriculturist are perishable, and in some cases even where they are kept in cold storage they deteriorate. They are a wasting asset as perishable products, but the agriculturist has always his land which, subject to the vicissitudes of the seasons, is always productive. He is in that respect better off than the miner. Although the ore extracted from a mine will not deteriorate for many years, since there are only some very rare ores that become impaired in .value by oxidization, it has to be remembered that the mine is a wasting asset. The life of any mine is an ascertainable period, and there is no endless vista of production in the case of a mineral deposit. Yet it is proposed to allow some mine owners to escape this tax, and to make others pay. It is proposed to allow agriculturists, whose asset - the land - never wastes, to escape. </para>

                        <para>- Then the companies will not be taxed. In my opinion, the Bill is inequitable. I do not believe that it is possible to frame any system of taxation that will not bear more unjustly upon one section of the people than another, unless it be the system advocated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> so frequently. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> is prepared to exempt certain industries because he believes the Bill to be inequitable. I want to include all industries that are making war-time profits, because I think that all profits should be taxed. If when the measure reaches the third-reading stage, it is not satisfactory to me, I shall certainly adopt a different attitude. I was anxious to see it get into Committee in. the hope that we would be able to put it into an equitable shape. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap)</inline> after all, is only making a pretence of opposition, and whenever he sees a chance of escaping, he gets behind the Government. I want to improve the Bill if it is a bad measure. Government supporters are evidently' of that opinion, judging by the criticism it received at their hands, scarcely one member on the Ministerial side having a word to say in favour of it, either here or in another place. If the measure is not improved it will also receive condemnation at the hands of the people. </para>

                <para>What excuse is there for exempting any section of businesses which have made excess profits during war time?  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> says that such concerns will pay income tax, bub will not all those who are included under this measure also be called upon tq pay income tax? At the best this Bill is an expedient, and though I have no doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will declare that I indorsed its principle in regard to a former measure, I want to say that, so far as this clause is concerned, I never- intend to support any war-time taxation measure that proposes to deal with one industrial section in a manner different from any other. I hold that all industries making profits during war-time should pay this form of taxation. Let us take butter factories or bacon-curing establishments as an illustration. With their plants they can supply the local town with electricity, but because their main business is the handling of produce, they will escape taxation on the profits they may make upon any other business. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to have this assurance, because I was under the impression that the amendment introduced by the Minister -was to the effect I have indicated. Where the main part of such company's business is the handling of produce, and where they supply electric light as a by-product, I believe they will be exempt. But suppose the Minister is right, why should a co-operative concern, producing bacon for profit, be exempt from the operation of this tax, whilst a proprietary business competing with that co-operative enterprise would be called upon to pay an excess war-time profits tax? </para>

                        <para>- Let us consider the position of. two big business enterprises. Let us suppose that one business, by careful management, had two years of big profits to its credit, in 1912 and 1913, and that another, and a growing business, in 1912 and 1913, by special, efforts against its rival, reaped its reward in 1915 and 1916. What would be the result under this Bill? The growing business would have to pay a tax on its profits over and above the profits of the previous two years, whereas the other business would escape because of its prewar standard, and, possibly, it would, drive its -rival out of business. </para>

                        <para>- The older business might, in such circumstances, have such an advantage that its rival might be compelled to get out of the business,- but if b.oth companies were taxed equally on their war-time profits, one business concern would not have an advantage over the other. It is altogether unfair to distinguish between businesses making profits, and as I do not feel competent to judge between industries that should be exempt and those that should not, I have submitted my amendment to include all industries making a profit. </para>

We cannot and I am not going to make an attempt. I submit the amendment, which may be too sweeping for some honorable senators. As regards gold mines, it will be the rich companies which will be affected. I have no doubt that the gold -mil. vng companies in Western Australia will always have sufficient influence with the Government to secure exemption from just taxation which this Parliament should impose upon them.

                    <para>. - Before lunch, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> brought, up a case of companies which, though legally and technically cooperative companies, had really become proprietary companies, because of the absorption by one or two individuals of the major portion of the shares. I must admit that the case has appealed to me very strongly. No one desires to allow a company or a few individuals to get an advantage denied to Weir competitors merely because they are sailing under false colours. I ask the honorable senator, therefore, to refrain from submitting his amendment now in order to give me an opportunity of seeing how far the case he cited may be provided for by an amendment of the definition clause. The notice given to me by the honorable senator has been too brief to permit me to consult the draftsmen and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir John Forrest),</inline> but I will see that an opportunity is provided for him to recommit the definition clause should he wish to press the matter on the attention of the Senate at a later period. </para>

                        <para>- There are, I admit, kinds of co-operative societies which cannot be distinguished essentially from a business which is merely carried on for profit or for loss. There has been some development of co-operation right through Australia in connexion with various bodies. Yesterday, I referred to the cooperative trading companies in Newcastle, Lithgow, Wollongong, and Sydney. I Have a knowledge of these companies in my own State, and I can sav that they do not make profits in the ordinary acceptation of the term. The dividends are bounded, in some cases, by a 5 per cent, maximum in other cases by an 8 per cent, maximum, and, in other cases, by a 10 per cent, maximum. </para>

                        <para>- No ; I am not referring to those companies whose shares are put on the market. I am alluding to those companies whose directors are very often union officials. The secretary of a company is often a union official, and the directors, too, are union officials. They are all working for nothing, because they want to save money for those whom they supply, and who are members of the company, and wish to-cut out the middleman. The true principle of co-operation, I take it i is an effort on the part of people who come together to cut out unnecessary profits which otherwise they would have to pay. The profits axe only profits in name. They are distributed from time to time amongst those purchasers or suppliers of the company with whom they do business. I would point out to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> that to bring companies of this sort under the provisions of the Bill, and to take, in some cases, in the future, 75 per cent, of the money they save by co-operation, is a wrong principle. We know that in- England co-operation is growing, and that many societies are on the same basis. I .can definitely say that companies of this sort do not come under the excess profits tax at Home, and I do not think that this Committee should impose a tax upon the companies in Australia. We would be going much too far if we did. While I see very great difficulties in differentiating up to- a fine point between those companies which are essentially co-operative, and those companies which are out to trade for a profit, this Bill should in this matter, and I hope will, give very large powers to the Commissioner of Taxation. These wide powers will be subject to an appeal to the Board of Referees. If there is a dispute as to whether companies of this sort ought to pay or not, the Board of Referees will decide. But if we do not get a provision of this sort inserted to govern the instances of <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> growing co-operative movements, they must be taxed. There will be no option, because they are not exempted. It will put back co-operation for perhaps a decade. I do not think that any one of us desires to do that, because, after all, co-operation and co-partnership may be the solution of our future troubles. I should be very sorry indeed to see the Commissioner tax savings which otherwise would go back to the purchasers of the goods, or the supporters of the companies or ' societies. I ask the Committee most earnestly to consider this aspect, and see whether some provision cannot be devised, if my amendment is hot particularly acceptable to the majority, whereby we shall not give a set-back to the whole principle of co-operation. Unless some clause is- inserted which will cover <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> societies, there will be a weakness in the Bill, and we shall live to rue and regret it. If co-operative societies, run in the country in connexion with primary products, are to be exempted, I cannot see why other societies cannot be exempted that are being run in the same <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> manner to deal with other goods. For the sake of this very m.uteh wanted principle of cooperation in Australia, for the sake of the elimination of the middleman and two or three unnecessary profits, I urge that we should encourage rather than discourage such movements as this. </para>

But if it makes only 10 per cent, profit it is excluded now. Therefore, the honorable senator is proposing to keep out of the Bill some company which is making more than 10 per cent. Honorable senators will find that the amendment provides for the exemption, of any insurance or trading company of a co-operative nature whose return in profits to its shareholders is limited by 10 per cent. This does not mean that it has not made more than 10 per cent., but that it has not distributed more than 10 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- If the company does not make more than 10 per cent, it is exempted under the Bill now, because it can take 10 per cent, as it's pre-war standard. Therefore, either the amendment is sucplusage, or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> invites us to say that companies making more than 10 per cent, shall be exempt; the only essential Condition being that they do not distribute more than 10 per cent, of their profits. But there are plenty of ways by which a company making 20 per cent, or 30 per cent, can secure those profits quite comfortably to those interested in it, whilst only returning 10 per cent, to its shareholders. I leave it to the Committee to say whether a company making anything up to 50 per cent, shall be exempted merely because it only distributes 10 per cent, to its shareholders. </para>

                        <para>- This proposal was not put up in the interests of those who do business with the company. It is put up in the interests of the company itself, because it speaks' of the company, and not of those who deal with it. This would cover the case of a company started, as has been done in New South Wales, in consequence of the passage of the Workmen's Compensation Act. A number of people with trade interests in common have formed a company. They are co-operating; they are shareholders in the company, and do the insurance business within the trade with which they are associated; but there are many people outside them who are not shareholders but also do business with them. Any profits that are made may be returned as bonuses, or they may not. That rests with the company. But the articles of association' provide for a limit of, say, 10 per cent, to be paid in dividends. If the company makes 40 per cent, or 50 per cent., the extra profit will go into those hidden reserves which enable the company to extend its operations, and, therefore, represents savings or profits that ought legitimately to be taxed. </para>

                    <para>. - I referred principally to <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> co-operative distributing companies. But co-operative companies have been formed in New South Wales by various associations for the purpose of cooperating together, particularly in regard to employers' liability insurance. Those societies put up a certain amount of capital. In their articles of association they limit the interest on that capital to 10 per cent. They are working the -business on a cost of about 10 per cent. Whereas the ordinary accident company as we see it in Melbourne or Sydney spends about 30 per cent, of the premiums, these cooperative societies spend about 10 per cent, of the premiums. At the end of the year they bring down a balance-sheet showing a so-called profit of so much, and the whole of that profit over and above the 10 per cent, paid to the shareholders is given back to the policy-holders in the company the next year. If a butcher, baker, or candlestick maker joins the company, and gets his accident insurance cheaper thereby, there -is an accretion to his income to a corresponding extent upon which he will pay income tax. But if the Government say under this Bill that in the future no one may co-operate for a purpose of that sort, because if they do the Government will take 75 per cent, of the savings they make, they will simply squash these societies. </para>

                        <para>- I know a great deal about these cases. Is the Committee determined to take the savings made by co-operation throughout Australia? If it is, it .ought to say so, and not exclude even the primary producer. If honorable senators take that attitude they stand convicted as opponents of cooperation in any shape or form. This would be very unjust1 in the case that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has mentioned, if the Income Tax Commissioner, in his sometimes ruthless and relentless way, puts the collection of money before equity. Co-operative companies, such as I have mentioned, if they are <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline> and the shareholders cannot get at any time more than 10 per cent., and if all the profits of one year are returned to its supporters in' the following year, are really not making a profit at all. They represent <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> co-operation. Profit is what the investors in a company get or have in reserve. This is a matter which does not affect the reserves of a company. The whole question is whether the savings of any co-operative company, present or future, in Australia, shall be subject to excess tax. </para>

                    <para>. - The company <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> refers to is not co-operative at all, but proprietary. A number of people having their own insurance to do, form themselves into a company. The-" take their own insurance business to that company, but they also take business from any member of the public. That is no more entitled to be called a co-operative company than any other proprietary company which, doing its own business, also does business with the general public.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PRATTEN</inline> (New South Wales) [3.25].- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milieu's</inline> statement is incorrect.

                    <para>. - In the consideration of the Insurance Bill some time ago, a matter cropped up similar to that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has brought forward. It appears to me that if these companies expended the money in the way of soliciting trade, they would escape this taxation. But because they do not, but return it to their shareholders, they are , to be penalized. The so much eulogized thrift is to be fined. If a company eliminates expenses, and returns the money to those who have subscribed it, it is to be punished. </para>

                        <para>- In a co-operative company a portion of its shares may be held by merchants and storekeepers, who perhaps deal with a cheese and butter factory. In such a company the majority of the shares will probably be in the hands of those persons who supply milk to that factory. According to the reasoning of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, that portion of the profits of the company which is distributed amongst the merchants and storekeepers who provided it with the capital with which to start operations, should be exempt from taxation, while that portion which is distributed amongst, those who supply the factory with milk should be taxable. I cannot understand how the Vice-President of the Executive Council can argue that such a company is not a co-operative company. It represents a co-operation cf effort for a definite purpose, that purpose being the conferring of a mutual benefit. </para>

                        <para>- I differ from the honorable senator. The individual who assists another to convert something into an article which is useful is a co-operator in the truest sense of the word. Take the case of a number of butchers in Adelaide, who have associated themselves together as an accident insurance society. That society covenanted to cover risks in connexion with the butchering trade. -Its members are co-operators. They are trading, not in the sense of manufacturing something, but they are trading cooperatively. Their profits are distributed amongst themselves. So long as the profits in a company are limited to the persons within that company, I say that those persons ,are co-operators. The position of a proprietary company is very different. Its business is carried on for the benefit of its owner or owners. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has made out a very good case for his amendment.' We ought to encourage, rather than discourage, groups of individuals to band themselves together for the purpose of establishing accident insurance funds, covering fire insurance risks, and generally carrying the burdens that are associated with such institutions. </para>

                    <para>.- It has occurred .to me that an anomaly may arise in dealing with co-operative societies, inasmuch as the various State Acts do not all provide for the registration of these societies in the same way. If I remember aright, the Victorian Act provides that cooperative societies must be registered under the Friendly Societies Act. If that be so, these societies in Victoria will be exempt from the operation of titis Bill, but in States in which the Act does not provide for their registration under the Friendly Societies Act, they will be liable to the tax. </para>

                        <para>- Molybdenite is not an ore of tungsten, but an ore of the metal molybdenum, <inline font-style="italic">lb</inline> is a redundancy to mention tungsten as an independent ore. To the best of my knowledge, tungsten ores are obtained in two forms - tungsten of iron, which is wolfram; and tungsten of lime, which is scheelite. I respectfully suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> that as the two commercial sources of tungsten are mentioned in his amendment, the use of the word "tungsten," in addition, is a redundancy. Seeing that the Government have so readily accepted this amendment, I should like to ask: What about tin? It is a metal absolutely essential to the prosecution of the war, and in respect of which it cannot be shown that the average price during the war period has been greater .than the price during the three years prior to the war. </para>

                    <para>. - I am in favour of the amendment. I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> is aiming in the right direction; still I direct attention to the fact that industries are established for the production of other metals, which are quite as important as the industries sought to be protected by the amendment. At the present time, there is an absence of barytes in Australia. We have the metal in the* Commonwealth, but we are importing it. It has been discovered as the result of a recent exploration, is mined, and brought long distances to market. Only to-day I heard that deposits have been found in Victoria. Paper is becoming scarce, and I may inform honorable senators that barium is used for the purpose of perfecting the surface of printing paper. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister apparently believes that if the product of an industry is sold at half price, there is some virtue in it ; but if it merely supplies a public need, it should be taxed. Another industry which might be mentioned is one exploiting the manufacture of sulphate of lime, gypsum, for the purpose of producing plaster of Paris, which we have been importing largely. I know of another case, where manganese is being exploited to be used with other substances to produce true crockery ware. An honorable senator has referred to the scarcity of fire-bricks, but I know of splendid deposits of pure silicate of alumina which makes the best of fire-bricks. If people invest in these industries to-day, because a peculiarly advantageous opportunity is afforded at this time to give them a start, they are to be penalized under this measure, whilst the production of the metals referred to in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> 's amendment is to be exempt. I know that potash salts imported in a manufactured form from Germany can be obtained in the Commonwealth. It is strange that when we have a chemical research association under the sheltering wing of the Federal Government, and their researches have disclosed the possibility of the establishment of industries of practical benefit to Australia, honorable senators on this side are apparently prepared to penalize their establishment. There is not one of the substances I have referred to the production of which would not be a real public utility, and involve the employment of many persons. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator should be aware that very large expense is involved in the establishment of new industries of this kind. Expensive machinery has to be installed, and in many cases it is not long-lived; whilst there must be a considerable period of unprofitable preliminary work. Ten per cent., in the circumstances, is not a reasonable reward for the establishment of such industries. It is unfair that when an attempt is made to establish them it should be crippled by taxation of this kind. There seems to be a determination to allow outsiders to benefit at the expense of Australians. I do not want to see the ores that I have mentioned eliminated, and I hope the amendment will be extended to include them. I could occupy the Committee for a considerable time in showing where there are openings for such enterprises, and how the clause will make them impracticable. For instance, I know that deposits of slate for roofing purposes - an article which is urgently required to-day - could be worked profitably were it not for the fact that any profit obtained from that enterprise would come within the scope of this measure, and be taxed to the extent of 75 per cent. This matter is too important to be allowed to pass without a protest. I hope the Minister will report progress, so as to allow the Committee to discuss this question fully. </para>

                    <para>. - While I am heartily in accord with the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn,</inline> I want to point out that, even as a measure affording relief, it discloses once more, in all its nakedness, the principle of inequity, against which I have so frequently protested during the discussion on this Bill, which, I hope, will not pass in its present form. Wolfram mines and those enterprises engaged in the output of molybdenite, which have commenced operations since the 4th August, 1914, will be exempted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn's</inline> amendment. So far, so good. 'But what about mines that were established, capitalized, and were in process of development before the 4th August, 1914, and which have only commenced to be remunerative during the war period ? Are these to bear the brunt of taxation, while industries established since, the 4th August obtain relief? Surely the Committee will take this matter into consideration. I am not a wolfram miner, and I have no interest in wolfram. I am a tin miner, and possess certain tin leases, the operations of which, however, will not be affected by this measure at all, for the simple reason that they are only small leases, and the output is not likely to be such as to get outside the zone of protection afforded by the financial exemptions. But I am concerned with the position occupied by many old friends of mine, who, after a mining life full of vicissitudes, in the evening of their days, discovered wolfram deposits shortly prior to the outbreak of war, and who have made these properties productive during the war. These men will not secure the benefit of this exemption, whereas any mining enterprise dealing with the deposits of ores mentioned in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn's</inline> amendment will be relieved. The thing is manifestly incompatible. We shall have to give relief to industries of a special character, whether they were established before the war period or since the outbreak of the war, and relief must also be given to industries which are not deriving any benefit from any increase in the market price for their products, or we shall stand charged before the people of Australia with being a most inept set of legislators, ready to adopt every legislative expedient, but who will not face the problem of establishing the principle of equity in relation to taxation proposals. The public anticipated a War Profits Bill which would tax all profits legitimately traceable to war conditions. The people did not expect anything else, because anything else in equity they could not demand, seeing that profits gained from any other cause would be levied upon under the income tax. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> to use his undoubted influence with the Ministry to secure an extension of the principle contained in his amendment, for he alone seems to have any influence in regard to suggested amendments. </para>

                    <para>. -  I add my voice to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> plea. I recognise that the Minister has been very firm indeed in the consideration of this measure. I do not believe that the amendment would concern many companies. There is not the slightest doubt that metals for hardening steel are indispensable at present, and that the very life of our nation depends upon their production. The producers deserve our encouragement in every possible way. It is not a very big concession to .  make,  and the harmony thereby restored would be so great that I think that we would get through with the Bill very quickly.. </para>

                        <para>- We interviewed a gentleman yesterday in connexion with a tungsten company. He -informed me that it had been at work for three years and had made no profit. If the company were to strike a patch, just now, it would be very hard indeed, after having struggled along for three years, that it should not get the full benefit of the price of metals, which are so badly required by the British Government. The suggestion made is that all companies producing these metals should be exempted from the tax. It was admitted by the Minister today that such companies are selling the metals at half the world's parity to the British Government.. I am not going to criticise that statement/ </para>

                    <para>.- From the outset I have set my face against allowing any exemptions from the tax. It will be. remembered that I said in my second-reading speech that if any department of trade and commerce could claim consideration, it was mining. I  uTged  that mining is so much of a lottery that, if any consideration could be granted to any series of profit, it ought to be extended to. mining. </para>

                        <para>- On the whole, farming, is not unprofitable. More money is lost in mining than in any other industry. Therefore, if anything claims considers* ation for an exempation, it is mining. This proposal, if adopted, will create much dissatisfaction. From a certain day this form of mining will be exempted, but if some persons were fortunate enough to start a mining venture a week before, that date they will be liable to the tax. It may be said that a line has to be drawn somewhere, but I do not know that it has. If honorable senators are in favour of exempting mining for metals, let them exempt mining altogether. If it is decided to exempt one class of metals, I shall vote to exempt the lot. I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> because it appears to me that tin and zinc are as much required in the manufacture of munitions as are the others which have been mentioned. </para>

                        <para>- I will help to exempt most of these metals, and I think that I shall be quite justified in doing so. The trouble is that from the very start this measure is inequitable. I do not believe that one honorable senator can say conscientiously that it is anywhere near being an equitable measure. It is not proposed to levy a tax on inordinate and excessive profits, but to tax the profits' in excess  at  one time over another. A thousand, examples could be given to show the enormity of the proposal. I am. still of the opinion, notwithstanding all the discussion which has taken place,, that this legislation will be so repulsive to the people of Australia that there will be a strong demand to repeal the Act before it has been in existence very long. If the amendment is carried I shall feel at liberty  to  support exemptions in other directions with regard to mining. </para>

Why wolfram mines, scheelite mines, and molybdenite mines started since the  4th  August,  '1914,  should be exempted, and mines which were started before that date, but which have only become profit bearing during the war period, should be liable to the tax, passes my comprehension. It may be that I have been  damned by nature with certain obtuseness which prevents me from seeing where the symmetry of granting relief in one case and refusing to grant it in another lies. But the fact is that I am absolutely astounded at an amendment of this kind having the limitations placed upon it which the Minister, by his silence, seems to desire to be attached Ito it. The principle for which I contend is that the production of any commodity - I do not care whether it is tin or beetroot- that has resulted in profits which cannot be traced to war conditions should be exempted from the operation of this measure. I care very little whether it can be demonstrated that the tin miner has not benefited on the average during the war period because of . any appreciation in the value of the metal. I am concerned that profits shall not be taxed when they have been made quite outside the influence of conditions created by the war. I desire to move - </para>

No company nor any individual engaged solely in the production of any commodity, not covered by the exemptions in this Act, the average price of which during the first three y«ars of the war does not exceed the average price of the commodity during the three years prior to the first July, 1914, shall be taxed under the provisions of this Act in respect to profits made during the first three years of the war; but if the average price of the commodity increases in any subsequent waT  year beyond the average of the price of the commodity during the three year pre-war period then for any such war year the provisions of this Act shall apply." I do not care what the commodity is, unless it has been specifically exempted by the measure, if it has not benefited by an increase in price during the years of the war, the profits made in the production of the commodity should not be taxed. There is no mention of any particular article. It may be ore or anything else. </para>

I embody in this subclause a principle which should have permeated the whole measure, namely, the taxation, without exemption if you like, of all profits directly attributable to war conditions. This will exempt the tin-producing industry, for it can be demonstrated by statistics, for which the biggest tin corporation in Australia is responsible, that tin has not appreciated in price since the war. I will extend the exemption to the profits on any commodity not directly attributable to - an appreciating market created by war conditions. I shall move the amendment as sub-clause 4 of clause 8, and believe that it will give the necessary relief to industries that have earned profits not attributable to war conditions. </para>

If they remain in the Bill they may place in the hands of the officer commanding a regiment the right to decide whether the life of a prospective taxpayer has been endangered or not. Some may consider positions in the Army Medical Corps or Army Service Corps to be those in which life is endangered, and complicated definitions may be required in other respects. Is it a danger to life to go on a troopship and risk sinking by torpedoes? Is it a danger to life to go to England, or must it be defined as being " within the sphere of gun-fire"? A phrase like this must give rise to a good deal of dissatisfaction, and requires to he carefully defined. If a man was not popular with his superior officer, he might be unjustly brought within the provisions of the Act. </para>

If this amendment were carried, an officer of that kind, sent to America, could claim to be entitled to a concession meant only for those taking an active part in the war. Certain officers who are pure civilians have been sent to England. They were given military rank because they had deal with the civil side of the military organization. It was not intended, and it is not equitable, that they should be able to claim this concession. </para>

It will not be left to any commanding officer to define "field of operations" or " danger to life." That will be prescribed by regulation.

I presume that of the 360,000 men who have left for the Front there is not more than one in a thousand who will reap the benefit of this provision. That being so, I would strike it out altogether- The few who derive excessive profits from businesses that they were controlling before they left for the Front - profits obtained from the dependants of others who are serving us - will be benefited, while the great bulk of our men at the Front will receive no benefit whatever from it. </para>

As regards the general principle of the measure, I have combated the view that taxation should be levied on profits during the war period that are not traceable to war conditions. I have said that in the minds of most people who are concerned about, this measure the idea existed that' it was to tax profits traceable to the war. On- the occasion of the commercial travellers' celebrations, held only last month, so responsible a member of the Cabinet as the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> who proposed the toast of the evening, referred to this measure in the presence of a large body of commercial men as a War Profits Bill. That statement appears in the official report of his speech, as published in the <inline font-style="italic">Commercial Traveller.

                        <para>- And it will be to the honorable senator's constituents. We are members' of a Chamber of review, and when dealing with an important taxation measure like this, it is our duty, irrespective of party, to remove from it any injustice that -we are capable of removing. I am sorry that there has grown up among Australian Ministers - and. I suppose it is inseparable from the Cabinet system of government - the feeling that they must secure every line of a measure of which they are in charge. They seem to resent amendments - to think it derogatory to their Ministerial dignity to accept any, and to believe that amendments are suggested in a spirit of antagonism. They appear to completely forget the larger principle which should animate us here, namely, that we should do justice to the people -when putting into practical operation so important a principle of taxation as this. .1- give willingly to the Minister, and to any honorable senator supporting him, the duty of explaining to the public the equity and symmetry of these clauses, when they compare the effect of the amendment embodied in the Bill, on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn,</inline> in giving relief to certain industries, with the inequitable incidence of this measure as it will inevitably operate in connexion with similar industries established, a little before the war period. The Minister has said that my amendment would do away with all exemptions. That is not so. If anything is exempt under the Bill, that exemption will stand. But my proposed new sub-clause will protect any industry not specifically exempted in regard to its productions, if those productions have not appreciated in value during the war period. Will any honorable senator have the hardihood to say that profits earned  during the war period, and not 'fcraceaible in  any  sense to war conditions, should be taxed, while larger profits earned by smaller- enterprises established before the  waT,  and with the pre-  WW  standard of comparison, escape? The whole thing is iniquitous to a degree. However, I shall not labour the question/ I throw upon the Ministry and those who are supporting them the responsibility for justifying this measure to the country. Seeing the spirit in which Ministers regard the Bill, I  ajn  doing my best to make its provisions, as equitable as possible. I am not even asking that the specific industry which I have championed shall be exempted. But I do urge that profits which are' not traceable to war .conditions ought to be' exempted. However, I have discharged my duty, and the Government must accept responsibility for the measure which, I venture to say, they will be- urging us to amend in the' short space of a few months. </para>
