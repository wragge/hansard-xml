                    <para>He was of opinion that there had been  a  breach of faith with the workers, that a promise had been made that the conditions of work should not be altered. He was just as ready to believe the workers as the Government and the Commissioners. If the Government had a right to introduce any system it liked into its shops, then the workers had an equal right to object and call any such system unjust. The Senate would be well advised to urge upon both parties -the need of a compromise. It ought to show appreciation of the manner in which the men were conducting themselves- </para>

                    <para>. -  Those who have travelled in Europe and America frequently assure us that tipping, more particularly perhaps in Europe, has been reduced to a fine art. Employees in certain industries have, we .are told, not only to depend entirely for their remuneration upon the tips they receive, but in some cases they are obliged to pay a premium to their employers for lie privilege of keeping their respective positions. I do not know whether that statement is quite in accordance with fact. But when traveller after traveller assures me that such is the case, I think it may be regarded as substantially correct. If that is so it is a most unsatisfactory position. </para>

                        <para>- It may not be always good-will; but, as a matter of fact, tipping is such an established practice that it is submitted to by a very considerable section of the travelling public. Those travellers who are so wealthy that the scattering of a few pounds here and there is of no importance to them are able to get an unfair pull over other travellers who  cannot afford to do that. The employees render services for which, they ought to be paid directly by their employers, irrespective of whether travellers are wealthy or otherwise. Tipping is an evil which is assuming substantial proportions in Australia. We are assured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that nowhere in the world is the evil worse than it is in Melbourne. It does not matter whether it is quite so bad in Melbourne as it is in Marseilles or elsewhere. Most honorable senators, I suppose, will be prepared to admit that the evil does exist here, and it is probably growing. We have now an opportunity to stamp out the evil so far as the Railways Commissioner is concerned. It might be somewhat difficult to prevent some employees from taking gratuities, but if the giver of a tip were made liable to a moderate fine of £10 and the fine were inflicted with a fair degree of regularity, I venture to say that in the very near future the evil would become a thing of the past as regards the Railway Service. It is most unfair that the Railways Commissioner should be invited, as he will be invited unless we * carry this amendment, to pay his employees a lesser wage than they otherwise would be able to secure from him. That in my opinion is one of the effects of the existence of the tipping system. It was mentioned here quite recently that one Judge in the Arbitration Court informed the employers that they need not pay the minimum rates demanded, that they could make allowance for the extra money which the employees would drag out of the travelling public. '.That is a position in which no Australian workman should be placed. He ought to be taught to stand up for his salary in the same way as shearers do. When the shearers go into a shed they are not welcomed exactly with open arms by the squatter. They merely glare at each other. The squatter will say, " Well, you are back again." " Yes," the shearers will reply, " we are back again." The squatter will then say, " Take the wool off the sheep." The wool is taken off; the shearers get their remuneration and disappear. That is the proper attitude for employers and employees to adopt toward each other. The employee should do his work efficiently, and the employer should pay him the wages that are due to him. </para>

Today the members of trade societies expect to be paid the full value of their labour in current coin. </para>

                <para>I recognise that the vote which has already been taken upon the question of tipping may be regarded by some honorable senators as determining the vote that will be taken upon the amendment which we are now discussing. But I would point out that the two cases are quite different. In the first instance, we were dealing with the employees on our railways, whereas we are now dealing with the wealthy traveller, who, apparently, does not know what to do with his money. I trust that the Committee will support the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> so that our Railways Commissioner will realize that we do not want any of the Chinese methods of raising revenue introduced here. We want him to pay our railway employees a fair wage in current coin without any expectation on their part that they will be able to supplement that wage from other sources. I object to the Commissioner either directly or indirectly bargaining with his employees with a view to securing the payment of their wages partly from the travelling public. It is up to us to see that our railway employees are not placed in the humiliating position that is occupied by employees in some other Railway Departments. I hope that anybody offering a tip to a railway employee will be fined £10. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall vote against the amendment, not because I am not in sympathy with it, but because I know that it is impossible to suppress the tipping evil. If the amendment be carried we shall be simply penalizing the honest employee, and allowing the sneak to get the " cut."When I was in London recently this tipping evil absolutely got upon my nerves. It seemed to be all-pervading. I visited an hotel in which a notice was posted " Tips disallowed." Any employee accepting a tip will be dismissed." Naturally, I thought that this was the place for me, and accordingly I shifted my quarters there. But I soon discovered that more tips were given there than were given at the place which I had left. I found that at the breakfast table I was placed on short commons while the man next to me was supplied with a full serve. The explanation was that he had given the waiter a tip. It is well known that in the Old Country the railway employees will politely inform you that they do not receive an adequate wage, and are obliged to make up the deficiency in tips. In the barbers' shops there the employees actually pay so much a year for the right to shave customers, and rely absolutely upon the tips which they receive. The system is a contemptible one, and one which I do not wish to see introduced here. But by adopting the amendment we shall not suppress it. We must strike at the evil in another way. The Minister has promised that tipping will be disallowed under one of the railway by-laws. That promise is good enough for me. When I travel on the railways to-day I follow the practice adopted by other passengers, and tip the employees who render me any service. It has not been shown to me that the insertion of the amendment will accomplish anything more than will the by-law which has been promised by the Minister, and consequently I shall vote against it. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. I happened to need a little attention outside that of an ordinary guest, and I offered the porter a tip in return for his services. He  resented  my offer, and I was so astonished that I could not pick up the tip which I had tendered. In that establishment, which contains 1,020 rooms, and accommodates 2,000 persons, the tipping system has been absolutely stamped out. Why cannot a similar system 'be enforced here ? At any rate we can make an honest attempt to enforce it. When I give a tip I always feel that I am degrading the recipient of it as well as myself. It is quite true that on the railways in England the employees are not paid an adequate wage, and the same remark applies to Ireland. For a penny, or even a half-penny, in Ireland an employee will 'carry a passenger's bag up and down the railway station. He will find a seat for the passenger, and touch his cap when the .tip is tendered. It is a scandal that the authorities should permit the existence of this evil. In Australia, too, men employed ' upon 'our coastal steamers have informed me that they had to look to the tips of passengers to enable them to maintain their wives and families in comfort. Where the wages paid are inadequate, tips are justifiable. There are some men who will not render the services for which they are paid until they are tipped. </para>

                        <para>- The point is that they have already been paid for in the purchase of the ticket for a journey. In some of the London hotels one man will grasp your umbrella, another your stick, another your hat, and yet another your coat, and will hold on to them until they are tipped. When you have received them , a man will run down to the taxi-cab you have engaged, and will stand there waiting for a tip. Where the wages which men receive amount to only 18s. a week, that kind of thing can be under r stood, because in such cases, the tip is properly regarded as a source of income. I regard the tipping system as derogatory to the men who receive tips, if they are at the same time in receipt of adequate wages. Why should a man hold out his hand for 6d.- or ls., by way of a tip, when he is receiving fair wages for the services he is asked to render to the travelling public? I should like to ask also, why railway officials should, because of tips, differentiate between persons in the services they render those who have paid the same fare. I am entirely against the tipping system, and whilst I do not believe it can be altogether prevented, that is. no reason why we should not make an attempt to minimize the evil. </para>

If he walks down to the Spencer-street Railway Station he will find there a number of men wearing red caps who receive no salary at all, and who must depend upon tips for the services they render. The platform men connected with the despatching of trains and looking after the comfort of passengers have their duties set out for them, and the carrying of a bag is something extra. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> has said that one man pays his fare as well as another, and yet is treated differently, but one may travel without any luggage, and another may have twenty  bags. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt that the honorable senator had a great many. He has told us that he had a dress  suit, a tall hat, and a walking stick. Does the honorable senator expect the Railways Commissioner to tell off a man to take his twenty or thirty packages off a railway station ? I condemn the system in vogue in Melbourne under which men have to depend on the generosity of those for whom they carry luggage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> will bear me out that in the Old Country there are licensed porters who have fixed rates for the services they render, just as cabmen have fixed rates. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but they have a tariff of charges. Honorable senators will find the intimation on the menu cards of our dining cars that no gratuities are allowed, and yet they will find Railways Commissioners give gratuities. We have all been accustomed to the practice. People start it by giving a penny to their children to go and buy lollies. That is only the tipping system in another form, and we grow up with it. Every State Railway Department has a by-law against servants of the Department receiving gratuities. </para>

                        <para>- They passed a rule condemning the taking of tips, but the tipping of stewards still goes on. If we include a -provision in this Bill prohibiting tipping, it will still go on, and I am prepared to say that a majority of the members pf the Committee will be guilty of a breach of the provision more often than will members of the general public. To accept the amendment would only be to load the Bill with a provision that would have no effect. Do not let us make fools of ourselves by passing a provision which we cannot carry out. </para>

                    <para>.- I have been not a little astonished at the remarks that have been made by honorable senators, who, I thought, might have been expected to oppose the idiotic practice of tipping. The practice has grown to such an extent in the Commonwealth that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has reminded us, it was taken into consideration by the Arbitration Court in the fixing of wages. I consider that a most degrading thing. If we are going to produce a nation of stalwarts, we should not continue this practice, which has the effect of making men servile. We do not want men to bow and scrape, but to stand up and face other men in the image of their Creator and assert their manhood. The average received by stewards in tips was taken into consideration by the Arbitration Court in fixing their wages. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not intend to prolong the discussion, as I agree with the Honorary Minister that it has continued long enough. But I wish to say that to support my present amendment, after having opposed that which I previously moved, is not inconsistent, because in my present amendment I propose that the penalty should be imposed upon the chief offender, and that is the man who offers the tip. Every railway Minister of re cent years, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Malley</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archibald</inline> has said that the Commonwealth Railway Service would be a well paid one, and that high efficiency would be expected from the men employed. If that is so, why not restrict them to their pay from the Commonwealth? I have never claimed that a mere Act of Parliament would stop the tipping evil, but the creation of a healthy Australian public opinion on the subject will, I hope, stop it in time. If the Senate gives a lead in that direction it will have a wholesome effect outside. Every person one speaks to on the trains or boats agrees that it is a rotten system, but there is generally the same confession of weakness that we heard here this morning - that it cannot be stopped. </para>

                    <para>. - When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> first introduced this question I felt like a number of others that, perhaps, we could not stop the practice. Since then I have had several instances of its bad effects brought under my own direct notice, and while I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that it will be very hard to stop it, if we could stop it it would bring about more justice to the travelling public. At Spencer-street I saw a gentlemen who, according to appearances, had plenty of money, give a tip to the porter, who consequently paid him every attention. In fact, he could not do enough for him, and was almost obsequious in his attentions to him. At the same time I saw a woman, with one child in her arms and another hanging to her skirts, who could get no attention from the porter at all, although she was paying the same fare. That was not right, and we ought to stop that sort of thing if we can. We should do something to try to imbue the public mind with the idea that it is not fair that one member of the travelling public should get greater attention either on boats or on trains than another who is paying the same fare, because he is better able to afford to give tips. The creation of a public sentiment of that kind is the only thing which will stop the practice. Every member . here does the same as most of the travelling public do, and the custom has grown to such an extent that when a steamer or railway official does one some little service the first thing he does is to give him a tip. In fact, very often one does it whether any service is rendered or not. </para>

                <para class="block">There is an element of unfairness underlying the system, because some person may not have the cash with which to tip, and will not get the same service from the officials. The officials should be paid by their employer, Government or private, sufficient to make them independent of tips. </para>

                    BOLTON (Victoria [11.50].  -  Some references to the luggage porters at Spencer-street - the men with red bands on their caps - seemed to convey somewhat of a reflection on those managing the Victorian Railway Service. Those men are not employed by the Railway Department. They are members of the outside public who have obtained permission to enter railway premises, and do service for the public in the handling of luggage, &amp;c. At the same time the red band on their caps is some guarantee to the travelling public that they are trustworthy.

                    <para>. -  The consideration of the Bill in Committee might have been finished long ago if the Minister had agreed to accept a reasonable amendment of this kind. He is evidently prepared to put it in the by-laws, and assist to enforce it, but he has shown no good reason why it should not form part of the Bill. If this must go into the by-laws, the same thing can be said about the major portion of the measure. I disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> and others who say that these things cannot be done by legislation. We were told that we could not close the shops at a reasonable hour, and that we could not make men sober by Act of Parliament. Yet both those things have been done. The early closing of hotels has resulted in reducing drunkenness by more than 50 per cent. If the amendment becomes part of the Bill, and the Commissioner and his officers do their duty without fear or favour, the tipping evil will be abolished on the Commonwealth railways. </para>

                        <para>. - From the debate that has taken place it has transpired that while some foreigners have become naturalized in Australia, they have not been absolved from their allegiance to their native country, and the Bill does not appear to me to deal satisfactorily with such cases. For many years we have extended the right hand of fellowship to the white citizens of all countries. We have been prepared to grant them naturalization at short notice, to permit them to exercise the franchise, to become land-owners, and, generally speaking, have conferred upon them the full rights of citizenship enjoyed by native-born Australians. We have discovered, with regard to some citizens of Germany, that while they took out papers of naturalization, they retained their allegiance to Germany. I should like to see incorporated in this Bill provision making it mandatory upon all who take out naturalization papers to become denationalized from their country of origin. </para>

Unless foreigners divest themselves of their nationality, we should definitely refuse to extend citizenship rights to them; we should refuse to permit them to become owners of land, electors, or to occupy any public position in Australia. In Committee, when we come to the clause which partially deals with my objection, I shall be glad if the Minister in charge will accept an amendment depriving such people of full citizen rights so long as their own country also claims their allegiance. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not intend to offer any opposition to the Bill, because our experiences during the past two or three years have shown it to be absolutely necessary that we should tighten up our naturalization laws, and that, I believe, is the purpose of the measure now before the Senate. It is intended to make it more difficult for foreigners to become British subjects. Hitherto many foreigners have come here, and have taken out naturalization papers for the purpose of trade and personal advantages. In my opinion, a German once is a German always, and I think we can also say that a Britisher once is a Britisher always. We know that many naturalized Germans have the same feelings towards their Fatherland that they had when they landed in this country. At the outbreak of the war 1 brought under the notice of the authorities the case of a naturalized German, but I was almost told that I was interfering in a matter that did not concern me. Twelve months later, however, the man I referred to was fined and imprisoned for having rifles stored on his premises. That man ought never to have been naturalized. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>When discussing this subject we have to think of those who are our enemies, as well as those who are our Allies, to-day. We do not know that the latter may not become our enemies at some future time, and therefore we should be careful. I shall render the Government every assistance possible to tighten up the existing law. In Japan, a foreigner, no matter to what nation he belongs, is always regarded as a foreigner. They do not allow him to own land or enter into any business enterprise there. Perhaps that is not known to many honorable senators, but it is a fact. We ought to welcome foreigners here, but we should treat them as foreigners all the time, and be careful. </para>
                    <para>According to the records, it was the desire of past Parliaments to make the naturalization of foreign subjects as easy as possible. That I have always thought was a mistake. I never liked the idea of bringing foreigners to this country, and putting them in possession of some of its best land, to allow them even to make foreign settlements, and to teach a foreign language, and prohibit the use of the British language. When we welcome a foreigner it is not long before he gets his friends to join him. He understands what a lovely country this is, not only from the stand-point of civilization, but from the stand-point of social advantages which they do not receive in any other country. That is why foreigners soon bring their friends here. I can remember a German in my own trade coming to this country years ago, when we first entered into trade with Germany. Our trade union refused to admit these men, and it was thought to be a hard thing. We were condemned by the daily newspapers for our inhuman act to our foreign friends. But it was a wise act, as the situation today proves. In recent years Germans have been welcomed in our trade union, and to-day some are interned in the camps, while others are still workers in our midst, and naturalized British subjects. If, years ago, the Government had followed the example set by our trade union, we would not have so many Germans in our midst to-day as we have. Unfortunately, they are treated now as they should not be. Some Germans, after having been interned for a year, are allowed to come out and enter into business competition with honest British citizens. I have seen interned men at liberty. I do not know how they got out. I have before the Minister one case which is being investigated. This German passes me in the street with a sneering sort of smile, which seems to say, " I have beaten you ; I have got out." That should not happen in this country. </para>
                    <para>I am pleased that the Government are going to tighten up our naturalization law, and do a little, not towards winning the war but towards making it appear that we are in hearty sympathy with the British Empire. The difficulties we place in the way of naturalization are very small, but still they will be of some advantage. It will cause foreigners desirous of being naturalized to advertise the fact, and I take it that the application will be notified in the press. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> did not explain this matter, but on reading the speech made by the Minister for Home and Territories elsewhere, I find that he said that the notification was to be made in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> but that, after consideration, he accepted the suggestion that it should be made in the press, because, while very few persons would read a notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> an advertisement in the press would be generally read. If a foreigner is required to advertise in a daily newspaper that he is about to apply for a certificate of naturalization, it will give anybody who knows anything about the man an opportunity to object to the issue of the certificate. I hope that that idea will be carried out. </para>

When I met in London the delegation from the Russ i an Parliament I was surprised that all the members could speak to me in my own language, and use it better than I could. The gentleman who was sitting next to me was a Russian, but I thought at the time that he must be a newspaper reporter. Every Russian on the delegation could speak the British language. In this country we are defective in that respect. Most men in my station of life can read or write no other language than English. There are plenty of good Australians and Britons to-day holding responsible positions who can scarcely read or write. If the provision I quoted is enacted, it will be a most effective way to prevent the naturalization of very many enemy subjects who were naturalized here in years gone by. </para>
                    <para>There is another provision which could be made more effective. I refer to subclause 3 of proposed new section 6a, which provides that the contents of any statutory declaration must not be disclosed.

If the contents of these documents are not to be disclosed, what will anybody know of the declarations which have been made ? </para>

                    <para>There is only one other point which I wish to refer to, and that is the amount of the fee to be charged for naturalization. When the Commonwealth Parliament was legislating on this subject in 1903, the Government of the day struck out the fee. In introducing this measure elsewhere, the Minister for Home and Territories said that the fee would be nominal. I think that it should be a good stiff fee. Any person who desires to be naturalized in this lovely country ought to be made to pay for the privilege. The Minister elsewhere said the fee may be 2s. 6d. or 10s. In my opinion, it should be <inline font-style="italic">£5,</inline> or even £10. If a foreigner comes here from any part of the world, and wishes to participate in our industrial life and become a naturalized trade unionist, he is always willing to pay a larger fee than that. He is willing to pay £1, sometimes £2; or even more for the benefits he is going to derive from association with trade unionists. The fee chargeable under this measure ought to be £2 2s. at the very least. If the Minister is prepared to make the fee £5, I shall be with him, or if he prefers to fix the fee at £10 I shall be with him. I am willing to assist him to put any possible restrictions upon an undue naturalization of foreign subjects. That is all I have to say on this Bill. I congratulate the Government. I can see nothing harsh in the measure, and will do all I can on this side to assist the Government in making it law, even if they should make it more stringent than it is. </para>

                        <para>.- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> can recall the time when our Naturalization Act came into force, he will find an explanation of why a very small fee is charged for a certificate of naturalization. When everything in Australia was going along peaceably, and there was no international mix-up such as we have to-day, we looked at these matters from quite a different stand-point. The strong enmity against Germany, which I suppose exists almost everywhere to-day, did not exist when we were legislating on this subject some years ago. I can remember well that the tone of honorable senators towards the Germans in that day was quite different from what it can reasonably be expected to be to-day. The desire to bring all foreign immigrants within the nation by making them naturalized citizens accounts, I think, for the very small fee which was charged. In 1903 we heard of instances of foreigners who had lived in Australia for a lone time, and had not become naturalized because each State had its own law, and the State laws were found very often to be in conflict- with each other. The fee varied in amount, and it was not until the Commonwealth was established that a uniform law could be passed. It was found to conflict to some extent even with international laws, because the various nations did not look at the question of naturalization from the same stand-point. Therefore, it is very difficult indeed to get anything like a good, sound working law -throughout the various nations. In legislating, too, it is necessary to see that we do not put some embargo on our country, or give away too much and receive too little from other nations. It is not always wise for us to frame a naturalization law which would suit on all occasions. "With one aspect of the present law I wish to deal briefly, and that is in regard to married Australian women. To illustrate my point, I will mention the case of a Frenchman married to an Australian woman, because we are at peace with the French people, and the illustration will be more fitting than that of a German married to an Australian woman. Hitherto, when an Australian woman married a Frenchman here she lost at once her British nationality. The Frenchman, if he cared to do it, could take her property, clear out of the country, and return to France, and the wife would have no redress, she having lost her British nation.itv by marriage was unable to again become a Britisher.- Undoubtedly this measure will prevent that sort- of thing being done. It will give to an Australian woman married to a foreigner some relief, not, perhaps, all tie relief we would like to give, but she can revert to her British nationality. Under the old law in a case of that sort she had no redress. Not only did she los© her property, but she also lost her nationality, and could not recover it. There was no means for her to revert to her original nationality, no matter how many generations of her forebears had been British. </para>

                            <para>-  Her  rights under that Act were practically nullified by the change of nationality. I would have liked this Bill to extend to an Australian woman, even though she is married to a Frenchman, the right to retain her nationality, and thus preserve all her citizen rights. There is no reason why an Australian woman should, because of her marriage to a foreigner, lose her nationality and all the privileges of her birthright. If she be an Australian or an Englishwoman, simply by reason of her marriage to an alien she loses her nationality and her birth-right. If you take the case of an American citizen living here, he could marry an Australian woman, and if he went back to some of the States He could get a divorce on very trivial grounds, and even then, his Australian wife could not get back her Australian nationality. Now, in Australia we have placed women upon a higher plane than they occupy in any other part of the world. We have given them the franchise on terms of equality with men. There has been an agitation, which, to some extent, has been successful, in favour of paying them equal wages for equal work. If, politically, women in Australia are the equals of men, why should we not make them the equals of men in any naturalization law that we may enact? It seems to me that to do so would be a simple act of justice, and one that would work out to the benefit of Australia. When we see women actually repudiating the German nationality - women who, in years past, have married Germans - we ought to give them an opportunity of escaping from their invidious position. We ought to declare that where a woman marries an alien in good faith she shall have a right, in the case of future international complications, to revert to her original nationality. </para>

                        <para>.- At a time like the present we are too prone to view a Bill of this character from the stand-point of our attitude towards the nations with whom we are at war. We should remember, however, that our naturalization laws will apply to our near friends - to persons from the United States of America, and also to our European Allies. Therefore, I hope that in a Bill of this description we shall do nothing of an extreme character which may be calculated to provoke retaliation. In Australia we have a number of Americans who hesitate to take out naturalization papers, and if, as the result of any oversight on our part, they were subjected to injustice, they would continue their sojourn here without becoming naturalized subjects. Generally speaking, I think that the Bill marks a great advance upon any previous legislation in this direction. I am in entire sympathy with the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie upon the question that he dealt with.. There is one portion of the Bill with which I can hardly agree - that portion which relates to the non-disclosure of a statutory declaration objecting to the issue of  a certificate of naturalization to any person applying for the same. I think that possibly it may lead to grave injustice being done. If a person be charged with an offence he has a right to know who is his accuser. Under British law we have always boasted that nobody can be accused without knowing his accuser. But if effect be given to this provision the charge will be made secretly, and a great deal of injustice will be done. I repeat we must recollect that we are now dealing not only with our declared enemies, but with those who, although they are foreigners, are, nevertheless, friends, and especially with Americans. I commend the Bill to the acceptance of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to say a word or two in commendation of the action of the Government in submitting this measure for our consideration. To my mind, the Bill is some years late, but it is better late than never. Moreover, its lateness is not the fault of the National Government. A good deal of  dissatisfac-tion  exists, particularly in New South Wales, in regard to the actions of naturalized and unnaturalized Germans there. Considerable slackness has been evidenced right throughout the Empire since the war began in regard to this German question. I agree with the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> that events have proved that a man who is once a German is always a German. But whilst I am sympathetic with the idea of relaxing as far as we reasonably can our , naturalization laws in the case of our Allies, we must not forget that, so far as the future can be forecast at present, our only enemies in the future are likely to be Teutonic enemies - the enemies we have at present. If we could insure that the Teutonic peoples would always remain peaceful, we should not need to apprehend being faced with any potential enemies in the future. I agree that this Bill is necessary, and that there should be a general tightening up of the naturalization laws of Australia. I commend the National Government for its action in bringing forward thus early in its career a measure which, as the result of the war, is badly needed. </para>

                        <para>. - This Bill opens up rather a wide question. In the first place, it broaches the subject of a dual nationality. We have to bear in mind that it will affect not only ourselves and the Teutons, but people from other countries. The Teutonic nations are not the only nations which hold to their nationality. Other nations exhibit just the same attachment to their home lands as they do. It is very difficult, therefore, to draw an arbitrary line of demarcation without prejudicially affecting our friends. If we were living in a foreign land we should certainly retain our love for the country which gave us birth, and we cannot expect other races to entirely divest themselves of the feelings that we ourselves experience. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I am pleased that the Government have surrounded this Bill with such conditions as will adequately safeguard us in the case of naturalized aliens. Not only will the measure give us power to call upon an alien to revoke his nationality, but it will clothe the Governor-General with authority to revoke his certificate of naturalization. Then we have to consider the position of those who, having been born in the Commonwealth, lose their nationality by reason of marriage. When an Australian woman marries an alien she forfeits her citizen rights, notwithstanding that she will _ always retain a strong affection for the land of her birth. Thus, we extend to a naturalized alien full citizen rights whilst denying them to a native-born Australian woman who has married a foreigner. I repeat that the Bill will give the Governor-General power to revoke a certificate of naturalization which has already been granted to an alien in our midst. Had this power existed at the outbreak of the war, it would have saved us a great deal of trouble. To-day there are many persons in Australia who are acting very faithfully towards their kinsmen overseas. In so acting I do not know that they, differ very much from English-speaking persons in other lands. If we were resident in any other country in peace time we should take careful note of what was transpiring around us, and communicate the results of our observations to our friends elsewhere, without thinking that we had been guilty of any criminal act. But to-day we are apt to regard any such act as a criminal one. We gain our information regarding the nations with which we are at war in the manner I have outlined, and yet we blame others for doing precisely the same thing. </para>
                    <para>But whilst it is right that the Governor-General should have power to revoke a certificate of naturalization, it does appear to me that in sub-clause 3 of clause 7 there is a very peculiar anomaly. There it is provided that an alien who has been naturalized may, in certain circumstances, have his nationality forfeited, although his property rights will still be secured to him. To my mind, the whole thing is out of focus. I hold that national rights are superior to all other rights. Yet, under this Bill, a naturalized subject may have his citizen rights revoked, while his property rights are preserved to him. It seems to me that if his citizen rights are forfeited, his property rights should be in suspense. </para>

                            <para>- My own opinion is that citizen rights are superior to property rights. I think nationality is superior to the right to property. Whilst power is given under the Bill to revoke nationality, no power is taken, should it be found necessary, to appropriate the property of a person whose nationality is revoked. A Britisher proved to be disloyal is liable, not only to the loss of his liberty, and perhaps of his life, but of his property as well. Under this Bill, though the nationality of a person may be forfeited, his property rights are retained. I am hoping to hear a little more about this clause from the Minister in charge of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>I am glad that Parliament is being asked to face the question of naturalization. I agree that we need to be careful in passing a measure of this kind, that it does not strike at those whom we have no wish to injure. It is possible that in a moment of hysteria, and it will be admitted that hysteria is generated by the war, in striving to do what is right to those who are our foes we may unintentionally do wrong to those who are our friends. I hope that the discussion of the Bill will assist us to make it a useful measure to meet the peculiar circumstances with which we are confronted to-day. </para>

                        <para>. -  I consider that the amendment is quite unnecessary. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has overlooked the nature of these documents, which he thinks should be open to inspection. The applicant for naturalization is obliged to advertise his intention to apply, and any one who thinks that the application ought not to be granted is given an opportunity, by a succeeding clause, to enter a protest All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> asks is that the certificates presented with the application shall be open to inspection. If any one knows anything against an applicant, it is not necessary that he should wait until the persons mentioned in the clause have given their certificates before he takes action. The certificate signed by the persons provided for will be in a form fixed by regulation. The persons signing the certificates will probably be asked to say whether the applicant is a person of good character, has been a good citizen, or whether there is any evidence of doubtful loyalty on his part. What advantage would be gained by any one but the officials knowing what was contained in the certificates, or by whom they were signed? If I object to a man who is naturalized, it will be because of some thing I know about him myself. If I think that it is undesirable that he should be granted naturalization, as soon as I see his advertisement in the newspaper, if I am  a  good citizen, I shall not wait to find out what has been said about him by  a  school master,  a  householder, or  a  police officer, but will state the reasons why I do not think the application should be granted. I can see no advantage from the acceptance of the amendment, but I shall not detain the Committee  in  discussing it further. </para>

                        <para>.- It will be a very difficult matter for the general public to follow in the newspapers the advertisements of applicants for naturalization. If one noticed such an advertisement, and knew of any reason why the applicant should not be naturalized, he would, no doubt, call attention to it. I am thinking more of what may follow after an application has been granted. I want to make it possible, where that may appear to be necessary, to discover the persons who by giving these certificates recommended the naturalization of an enemy subject who ought not to have been naturalized. I do not know of any law under which  a  man is required to , put his name to a document for a public purpose which does not also provide that the document shall be open to public inspection. The acceptance of the amendment would impose no restriction upon an applicant for naturalization. </para>

It is impossible for this Parliament to control or influence the legislation of a foreign country. We can deal only with the man himself who seeks naturalization; not with the country from which he comes. The Bill asks an alien who seeks naturalization here, to renounce before a Judge or recognised official, his allegiance to his country of origin in spite of any law passed by that country. </para>

If the amendment was carried, these men would be nondescripts, and we should have no command over them. We invite them to renounce .the country of their birth and all its laws, and become citizens of Australia. ' Once they do that we have control over them. If we refuse to naturalize them unless their own country has passed a law giving up all claim over them, our naturalization laws become useless.

If an Australian became naturalized in any other country, neither Australia nor Great Britain would claim any right over him. Once he renounced his British nationality he would no longer be regarded as a member of the British Empire until he became naturalized again. A German, however, is still a German, and remains, in the eyes of the German nation, one of its citizens no matter where he goes. I shall press the amendment. </para>

While we may agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> I am afraid we have not the power to go so far as he desires. It is now well known that many naturalized Germans, while of military age, are required to report. annually concerning their whereabouts to the German authorities, and it should be possible, I think, to take some action in this direction. We might provide that, in cases where a naturalized alien is required to report himself 'to official representatives of his .native country, his opportunities as a citizen of Australia should be more limited. </para>

As honorable senators are aware, some citizens of Germany, iri order to become wholly naturalized in Australia, have obtained denationalization papers from Germany. We might, therefore, require that, before issuing a certificate of naturalization, the applicants shall be required to deposit papers of denationalization. </para>

But we cannot lay down in a Naturalization Bill the precautions that would be taken by those charged with the duty of censorship. There is a censorship in existence to-day, and I am not quite certain if it has always given satisfaction to honorable senators opposite. If a man becomes naturalized, and then, by means of the post, seeks to play into the hands of the enemy, he would, under an intelligent system of censorship, be discovered, and pay the penalty for it. </para>

Our Naturalization Act does not meet their case at all. </para>

                            <para>- If they left the island before the transfer, and were living in England, or were employed in British ships, they are regarded as British subjects ; and when they came to Australia, it was not necessary that they should be naturalized. I do not know how long ago it is since Lord Salisbury handed Heligoland over to Germany, but it is less than twenty-one years, and no man gets naturalized until he attains his majority; so, if any natives of Heligoland were born prior to the transfer, they are entitled to the protection of the British flag, and do not require naturalization certificates. The same could be said of residents of Alsace and Lorraine. I know, also, that some people from Schleswig-Holstein claim to be Danes. This question of naturalization is a very serious one, and ought to be carefully considered in the interests of our own people. These people from Schleswig-Holstein may be Danes, but they have strong German leanings ; and the same can be said of the men from Heligoland. Their leanings are towards Germany, and yet we give them full rights of citizenship, and do not require them to take out certificates of naturalization. Under the German law, men from Heligoland have to report in the same manner as those born in the centre of Germany. At the beginning of the war, we had a considerable amount of correspondence in Adelaide on this subject, a German citizen there taking up the position that, although he had been naturalized, he had not renounced his own country. Until we insert in the naturalization certificate a provision that a man must absolutely renounce his own country, our naturalization law will not be complete. </para>

It is obviously desirable that we should not by legislation give these persons a citizenship for which they have shown themselves utterly unworthy. It is, to my mind, quite conceivable that when the time comes to release these persons some further provision in their case will have to be brought under review.

                        <para>. - I wish to call the attention of the Committee to sub-clause 3 of the proposed alteration of section 11 of the Act. According to this provision a man may forfeit his naturalization and yet maintain any property he has in Australia. That seems to me to be an anomaly, and I would like to receive some information from the Minister. The greatest rights which a man in these circumstances has are natural rights, and not rights. of property. If it is desired to conserve a man's property it should be held as a hostage. Should he forfeit in any way the right to be re-naturalized the property should be held for the benefit of his children, who in time may become Australian subjects. The provision seems to be somewhat loose, and should, I think, be fenced round a little. Take the case of a man who was charged with sheep stealing a great many years ago. Under the law of the land the cost of his trial was abstracted from the value of his property. That was the case of an Australian citizen. But here is a provision which seems to preserve the whole property of a man who has forfeited his certificate of naturalization, and thereby became an enemy in the strict sense of the term. I ask the Minister to consider whether some action cannot be taken to hold that property in abeyance, just as a man's citizenship is held in abeyance, so that if by good behaviour for a term he should prove that he is worthy to be received again, he may resume the old position. But I do think that the lesser should go with the greater. </para>

It will not do anything of the kind. It will leave that property to be dealt with by the Government in common with the property of all other aliens. It is a recognised principle on the part of civilized nations - I do not include Germany, of course - that when nations go to war they respect private property. It is known that under the laws of some countries there are certain disabilities as to the possession of property by aliens. Some countries  do not allow aliens to acquire land, for instance. </para>

                            <para>- Suppose that an alien became naturalized, and acquired a ship, and that then for good reasons we were to withdraw his certificate of naturalization. It would be manifestly unfair to say that, having been allowed to acquire a ship under the law, we would, in addition to withdrawing the naturalization papers, confiscate his property. </para>

                            <para>- What would be done in that case? In common with property held by all other aliens, the Government would do what it has done recently in this State, and that is, make special provision for handling the property. It is not desirable that we should confiscate a man's property. Unless we say that the mere withdrawal of a certificate shall not by itself affect a property, it will be for the Government to take the same action with regard to a property held by a denaturalized citizen as with regard to one who had never been naturalized. </para>

                        <para>. - I remind the Minister that under several War Acts - the War Precautions Act, for instance - the Government have been able to take certain steps in regard to the holders of shares in Broken Hill mines. That legislation will terminate with the war. The Minister points out that- this provision will not stop the Government from doing certain things. But they will proceed under certain Acts which are simply War Acts, and, therefore, tentative in their operation. The Naturalization Act is a permanent Act. My desire is that the Government shall take, under the Naturalization Act, the same power as they now have under the War Precautions Act in regard to the property of individuals who have proved themselves to be aliens. It is simply giving them the same power as they have to-day when circumstances have proved certain individuals to be aliens, as by the revocation of their certificate of naturalization they are proved in other circumstances to be aliens. That is my desire, and nothing more. I believe it is held by most honorable senators to be the correct view. </para>

                            <para>- It is not mandatory that when the husband's naturalization is withdrawn that of his wife shall follow in consequence. I wish to be quite clear on that point, because it was mentioned here to-day that  when  an Australian woman marries an alien, who subsequently becomes naturalized, and his certificate of naturalization is cancelled, she becomes an alien too. There is a general desire, I think, that the wife of such a man should remain a British citizen. But this provision appears to me rather obscure, and in that regard it is typical of most clauses.. I should like to see the provision made quite distinct. It is the general opinion here. I believe, that a wife and any minor children should remain British citizens. </para>

                        <para>. - It does, and it does not. It provides that, where the Governor-General withdraws a certificate of naturalization, he may, where he deems "it fit, withdraw also the naturalization which went to the wife by reason of marriage, and to the children by reason of parentage. But where he does not deem it necessary to do that, then those persons will retain their British citizenship. It will be obvious to the Committee, I think, that it is not possible to say that either one or other course should be pursued. Circumstances must guide the authorities in the decision arrived at.  </para>

                    <para class="block">The words " so ceases " mean that the Governor-General has cancelled the man's' certificate of naturalization ; he must have done something very hostile to the Australian public, one would think. Then the provision goes on to say that nothing shall interfere with his property rights as existing at the date when he so ceased to be a British subject. Therefore, although a man's certificate of naturalization has been cancelled, he can continue to enjoy the property rights of a full British subject. That is my reading of the provision. My view is that if a man is thought worthy by the Governor-General to have his certificate cancelled, he ought to take his place alongside alien enemies. I think that the proper plan would be to cut out the sub-clause, if I understand it correctly. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> understands the sub-clause. I would ask him to look at not merely the provision but what is implied by it. This is a Naturalization Bill. It is not a Bill to say what shall be done with the property of aliens. When a person ceases to be one of ourselves by reason of the withdrawal of his certificate of naturalization he becomes an alien. The property of that alien should be dealt with, not under a naturalization law, but under any law which may be passed, or Order in Council which may be issued under the War Precautions Act, dealing with the property of aliens. That is the position. It is not that a denaturalized alien will have any special protection thrown over his property. </para>

                            <para>- I have already pointed out that it is possible that a naturalized alien may have acquired property which nobody but a naturalized or native-born subject is entitled to hold. But when, he becomes denaturalized, neither his wife nor his family will be permitted to hold it. I believe that in my own State some restrictions have been imposed upon the holding of selections. Now the law provides that a naturalized subject may, for example, hold a selection; but if his certificate be .withdrawn, in the .absence of this provision, the first man coming along will be able to " jump " his selection. The clause is intended to affirm that the mere withdrawal of a certificate of naturalization shall not expose the property of the denaturalized subject to any such danger. I do not think that the Government have .been fearful of exercising their rights over property held by aliens where it has been in the public interests to exercise them. But I should not like to see the property of aliens left without any protection whatever. I fear that there would be a tendency on the part of some individuals to take advantage of the position. I ask the Committee to agree to the clause as it stands. </para>

I can quite conceive of an American resident in Australia taking out naturalization papers, and subsequently doing something which, though not of a criminal nature, might justify the Government in forfeiting his naturalization rights. But if we take his property from him, what will the American nation say of us? It will say that we took action for the purpose of grabbing his property. I repeat that we are not dealing merely with enemy aliens, but with aliens who may be very friendly to us. An alien in our midst may be a man seventy years of age&gt; whose sole means of livelihood is a return from a little bit of property. He cannot get the old-age pension. Are we to allow him to starve? 1 think that we should retain the clause in its present form. </para>

Take the case of an Australian woman who has married an American who returns to his own country, and again becomes an American citizen. In such circumstances, whatever property the woman might own would not be subject to the protection that is usually  accorded to property by reason of the fact that she had already sacrificed her nationality. </para>

                    <para class="block">Can it be seriously suggested that the Governor-General would revoke a certificate of naturalization to enable him to declare the wife and progeny of any man to be aliens? Yet that might be argued just as logically as was the contention put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. I say that if the circumstances are so serious as to induce the Governor-General to revoke a certificate of naturalization, the Government should hold any property which such alien may possess, for the benefit of his wife and children. If a naturalized American, who has married an Australian woman, returns to his native land, and again becomes an American citizen, thereby forfeiting his naturalization in Australia, any property that he may possess here should be held in trust for the benefit of his wife and children. </para>

                        <para>. - While it is clearly necessary that there should be power to revoke the naturalization of a naturalized subject, the difficulty raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> is that we have no law giving the Government power to forfeit the property of a de naturalized person, which should be forfeited. I suggest that the difficulty might be overcome by inserting after the word " section," in sub-clause 3, the words " unless by order of the Governor-General." That would give the Governor-General, or the Government, power under certain conditions to order that the forfeiture of citizen rights should carry with it also the forfeiture of property. </para>

                            <para>- I submit it only as a suggestion. I realize that if the sub-clause  were  amended in that way it would put an enormous power into the hands of the Government, because property of very great value might be involved. A wealthy man, or the members of a wealthy company, might place them selves in such a position as to justify the revocation of their naturalization, and the Government, in revoking it, might, if the clause were amended as suggested, say that the whole of the property held by those persons should be forfeited to the Crown. </para>

There are two ways of holding property - one as a British subject and the other as an alien - yet, under the clause as it stands, a naturalized British subject whose naturalization is revoked would continue, although an alien, to hold' his property as a British subject. If I had been called upon to draft this provision I should have put it in this way - </para>

                            <para>- On the cancellation of the naturalization of a naturalized British subject under this clause he ceases to be a British subject, and again becomes an alien. In those circumstances, he should only continue to hold his property in the same way as an alien may hold property. I am not sure what an alien's property rights are, but if a man becomes an alien under this clause, why should he not hold his property as an alien, and not as a British subject ? If the provision were stated as I have suggested, any one could understand it, but no one can understand the clause as it stands. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not know whether my memory is playing me false, but, listening to this appeal to give this power to the Governor-General, which means to the Minister, it comes back to me like an echo that the walls of this chamber were only very recently ringing with a denunciation of a proposal to trust the Minister with power in a matter which might have involved the spending of a few hundred pounds upon a survey. The power which honorable senators appear to be willing to give the Minister under this clause might involve very large sums of money indeed. If the property of a person whose naturalization is cancelled is to be placed in the hands of the Governor-General, which means in the hands of the Minister, there should be some indication as to what is to be done with it. Honorable senators must remember that if the Minister withdrew a certificate of naturalization under this clause, he would, under the amendment suggested, be placed in charge of property, it might be, of very considerable value, and with no indication as to what he should do with it. That would be a very unsatisfactory position. I ask the Committee to accept the clause as it stands, and leave it to the Government to meet conditions as they arise by some remedy which can be shown to be right in the circumstances. </para>

Property is held by an alien under conditions differing from those under which it is held by a British subject. When the certificate of naturalization of a naturalized subject is cancelled his property, if he is to continue to hold it, should be held by him as an alien. I am prepared to move that Sub-clause 3 be left out, with a view to substitute for it the words suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> - </para>

                        <para>. - I asked a question this morning regarding action taken by the British Government in relation to the dilution of labour in munition works. The Minister told me that the meaning of the cable was that the British Government would not enforce the dilution of labour in private firms. Nearly all the munition factories in Great Britain are in the hands of private firms. I commend the British Government for their action. Our Government would be wise to follow their example by showing a little tolerance to the worker, and not enforcing the dilution of labour in their new shipbuilding scheme. If the New South Wales Government had shown a little more consideration for the men, they would not have the great Labour upheaval that they have to-day. In the Old Country, the British Government have, on every occasion, attempted, by conciliation, and by meeting the men, to get over all Labour troubles, and, so far, have been successful; but the New South WalesGovernment show no tolerance or consideration, and enforce conditions that are not enforced even in America. Under the new war scheme in America, that source of sweating has now been deleted, so that the men will have nothing to complain of. Before the Commonwealth Government causes trouble with unionists, it should- follow the example of the British Government by not forcing on them conditions which they dislike. I am not going to discuss the merits of the strike. It is a thing that I never believed in, because I always look forward to the solution of Labour difficulties in a better way: The Minister, this morning, seemed to pass off what I said with a bit of a joke ; but, seriously, the example of the British Government could well be followed by all national employers of labour. We find more tolerance among private employers than among Governments when they undertake big works. In my experience, I have never had any big troubles with private engineering firms. All the trouble has been with Governments as employers. When the Government initiate their great shipbuilding scheme, I hope they will meet the men and see if they cannot come to some compromise without putting the hateful dilution-of -labour method upon them. A stand-and-deliver-pistol-at-the-head attitude, such as is taken up by the Government, is not the way to meet them. I trust that, like the British Government, they will try to meet them in a spirit of conciliation and toleration. </para>

                        <para>.- I asked the Minister for Defence, some time ago, to consider the action of the censors in refusing to the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Workernewspaper</inline> the right to republish articles that had been published in other newspapers. He asked me to supply instances. I have here a copy of the Queensland <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> of 21st June, 1917, republishing an article from <inline font-style="italic">Justice,</inline> a British paper, on " The Campaign in the Dardanelles." This was also published in the Maoriland <inline font-style="italic">Worker.</inline> I shall place these in the hands of the Minister for Defence, so that he may make inquiries to ascertain why exceptional treatment has been meted out to the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker.</inline></para>
