					<para>Forthese classes the service will be voluntary, and, save in the case of rifle clubs, the period of training per annum will not exceed four whole days, during which period the men will be paid at Militia Force rates. The decision as to the classes to be trained each year will rest with the Minister for Defence. </para>
					<para>Arms and equipment will be provided as they become available, and arrangements may be made for their proper custody  in  conveniently locatedarmouries. </para>
					<para>For the. purpose of preserving the traditions and honours won by the members of the Aus- . arabian Imperial Force on active service, the militia units of the Commonwealth Military Forces' will be re-numbered and given, as far as practicable, the numbers at present borne by the units of the Ausarabian Imperial Force. </para>
					<para>To each of the existing militia units so renumbered will be linked a reserve unit consisting of men who have served at the front in a unit bearing the same number of the renumbered militia unit of which they will form ' the reserve. This will insure that the numerical designation of the A.I.F. units who have made history for Australia will be carried on for all time in the Military Forces of the Commonwealth, into whose  Keeping  that great tradition will be given, and who, for many years, will have the actual men who created the traditions as the reserve of many of their units. </para>
					<para>Members of the Reserve who have served in the present war will "be allowed to retain their battalion arm patches,  bo  that, no matter where in Australia an A.I.F. member of the Reserve may be trained, . he will retain the outward and visible sign of the unit with which he fought. </para>
					<para>An opportunity will also be afforded to men who have served in South Africa or any of the Empire's wars, prior to the present one, to give Australia the benefit of their war-won experience. Those men may join any unit which will best carry out the tradition of their particular arm. </para>
					<para>It is reasonable to assume that, apart from the Militia Forces and other sections of the Reserves, this scheme will, within twelve months of the termination of the war, give Australia a force of from 150,000 to 200,000 - men trained' in the latest methods of modern warfare who can, if Australia requires them, be quickly and effectively mobilized. </para>
					<para>The Government, feeling that any man who, through no fault of:  Mb  own, has become incapacitated in the service of his. country, should not be forgotten in this scheme, has also made provision for an Honorary Reserve. No training. will be required from these men, but, belonging to the Reserve will enable them to keep in touch with their comrades, and the units with, which they were associated. </para>
					<para>With the. object of giving the people an opportunity to help the Military . Authorities in all matters affecting the contentment and wellbeing of the men who fought for them, and also those who are being trained' for the future defence of Australia, and holding that it is the sacred duty of all Australians to, in every legitimate way, encourage and help the men who have won for them the right to remain a free people, the Government have constituted the seventy-five Federal electorates of the Commonwealth into territorial associations. In drawing up the duties and functions of these associations, the territorial scheme of Great Britain has been followed wherever practicable. </para>
					<para>For the purpose of recording the names, and tracing the whereabouts of Reservists, the Government have utilized the Electoral Department as being the least costly and most effective method of keeping in touch with mcn, many of whom will, in time, be scattered ali over the Commonwealth. </para>
					<para>The regulations which govern the enrolment, administration, and training of the Reserve have been passed by the Executive Council, and as soon as they can be printed and distributed to the various-'districts, the enrolment of Reservists will begin. </para>
					<para>The Government hope, by means of this scheme, to keep up the spirit of camaraderie among the veterans, and to set before the young citizen trainee a standard of self-sacrifice and soldierly conduct, and further to preserve for all time the glorious traditions won at Gallipoli, Egypt, and on the western and other fronts. </para>
					<para>The Government intrusted  Colonel the  Honorable Kenneth Mackay, CB., V.D., with the work "of drawing up_ this scheme, and for the purpose of carrying it into effect has appointed him, temporarily, to the position of Director-General. </para>
					<para>When taking up his appointment, this officer urged that when, in the opinion of the Minister for Defence, the scheme was in working order, he be relieved, and that a soldier who has served in the present war be given the permanent position. </para>

Yesterday I asked a question upon notice containing, I think, seven or eight paragraphs referring to an inquiry pending now for some time in connexion with the Federal Capital.

						<para>This notice is slightly irregular, as it should have been handed to me before I took the chair. It is also irregular inasmuch as it does not state that it is to-day that the honorable senator intends to move the motion, and, further, it is not signed. It is irregular in these respects; but as these are merely informalities the Senate might very well overlook them.</para>

							<para>- If the honorable senator does not think it worth while to comply with the Standing Orders, he should put up with the consequences. He can submit his motion to-morrow if he likes to put it in proper form and order. The Standing Orders are created to provide for the conduct of business in an orderly manner. If they are too autocratic, or allow insufficient opportunity for honorable senators to bring matters forward, they should be altered ; but while we have them, and a practice which has grown up under them for nearly sixteen years, it is very undesirable to depart from them. They require that a senator shall give notice in writing to the  President  before he submits a motion. The object is to allow the  President  to know when and how it is to come forward. Otherwise a notice of motion might be used to baulk or interfere with other business that would come forward legitimately. The  President  is not likely to take on himself the responsibility of doing something of which the Senate generally may not approve, in the way of interpreting the Standing Orders. Therefore, I am not speaking with a view to casting any reflection on your action as  President  of the Senate. You have brought the matter under our notice, and it is for us to say what we think of it before it is finally dealt with. </para>

I suggested that the Senate might very well allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> to proceed, in spite of the slight irregularity of the notice, but as strong objection has been taken, I must rule the motion out of order. </para>

I admit I wrote the notice of motion out hurriedly, and, at best, my writing is not too plain, but I endeavoured to the best of my ability to comply with the standing order. The  Clerk  of the Senate can bear out my statement that I wrote the notice out at express speed, and I went at express speed to your room, and knocked at the door seven or eight minutes before the Senate met. I got no  response, and the policeman on duty there told me that you were not in your room-. The fault, therefore, is not mine.- I made every effort to find you in your room, and you were not there; 3 o'clock was upon me, and I had not an opportunity of telling the Leader of the Senate what my intentions were. The only ,informality, therefore, is that I personally did not sign the notice-. </para>

							<para>. - The honorable senator is out of order. Arguing a matter is not permissible under cover of a personal explanation. He is now trying to fasten on me the blame for his noncompliance with the requirements of the Standing Orders, for which the Senate, and not the presiding officer, is responsible. Honorable senators who have been in the precincts of Parliament to-day know that I have been available all the tim'e since 10 o'clock this morning until the Senate met at 3 o'clock. It is quite true that I left my room, at about ten minutes before the Senate met, for about three minutes, and with the exception of that three minutes I was in my room and continuously available to every honorable senator from 1,30 o'clock until the Senate met. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's</inline> heroic efforts to find me will not meet with very much sympathy from anybody. </para>

							<para>. - The Standing Orders are emphatic with regard- to requirements of notices of motion. Standing order 101 says, among other things, that a copy of such notice, fairly written, printed, or typed, and signed by the proposer, and showing the day proposed for bringing on such motion, must be handed in. This notice complies with none of those requirements. Seeing,' however, that I recommended the notice of motion to the generous treatment of the Senate, it was ungenerous and unfair, and entirely uncalled for, for the honorable senator to try to throw the blame on me for his own failure to comply with the requirements of the Standing Orders or the practice and procedure of the Senate. </para>

							<para>.- For some weeks the honorable -senator has been continually in the habit of stating mistruths across the table of the Senate in connexion with this matter. I say again that I know nothing at all about the vote, and I never used my position as a member of. the Government to ascertain how the vote went, so I am not going to allow any honorable senator to say that which is not true. If the Government have any good reasons for prohibiting the publication of the vote of our Forces oversea, the Senate is prepared to listen to them, but, so far as I know, there is no good reason why that vote should not be published. I want to state also that if this motion is carried, it is my intention to endeavour to ascertain how that vote has been distributed throughout the different States. It is a most serious thing that- the vote of a huge body of men on such an important matter as this cannot be ascertained, and it will be my purpose, if this motion is adopted, to pursue the matter further., and urge the Government to take the public into their confidence by publishing such details as they are entitled to know. There has been a, lot of talk about this matter, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> may or may not be correct when he says that the vote of our overseas Forces gave a majority in favour of conscription. If that is so, it should remove any objection by the conscriptionists to making it public. But if, on the other hand, the vote was in the other direction, we are quite entitled to know it. A great deal of public interest is shown in this matter, and I see no good reason why the vote should be kept secret. Some one has said that the British Government objected to the publication of the information; but one member of the British Government is reported" to have stated that it is the Commonwealth Government that objected to the publication of these particulars. If there is any misunderstanding between the two Governments the sooner it is cleared up the better. </para>

							<para>. - We know how  every electoral division in New South Wales voted, and we are entitled to the information which I am now seeking. It appears, however, that because our soldiers are at the front, these exceptional circumstances are advanced as reasons why the vote should not be made known, but I maintain that the more publicity we give to the matter the better. The public of this country have nothing to fear by the publication of the vote, and therefore I am taking the full responsibility of moving that the regulation be disallowed, because I believe such a  course will be in the public interest. If there are any reasons, against this course, I shall require to know what they are, but I do not want telegrams from some of our own officers, or anything of that kind, particularly if those men have been recently appointed.   </para>

						<para>May I point out that the motion, even if i t be carried, will not be operative, because the effect of the regulation in question died to-day with the tabling of the last matters connected with the recent referendum campaign. To-day no newspaper would be liable for the publication of the figures relating to the voting of our troops oversea, but i t would have to guess the figures, because it is not likely to be in possession of the correct information.- To my mind, the real question at issue is-whether the Government are going (to release the figures for publication as far as they know them. The vote of the Anzacs in London has been distributed, as far as possible, according to the last known addresses of the men in Australia, and the transports were treated in exactly the same way in strict compliance with the Electoral Act as amended to meet the special circumstances.</para>

							<para>.- They apply equally to all our soldiers abroad. The reason action was taken in this regard was because of a request made by the War authorities in the Home Country. 1 am not prepared, nor are the Government prepared, to discuss the reasons for that request, because we think that they are good and sufficient, and ought to be apparent to everybody. Consequently, we have decided, whilst that request, on the part of the Imperial War authorities remains, not to liberate the figures. I do not think that I need discuss the matter at greater length, because it is obviously undesirable that we should debate the reasons why and wherefore this vote should not be published. </para>

							<para>- That provision was inserted in the Act in order that nien might be protected, and the way in which they voted might not be made known. The men on whose behalf this argument was most frequently advanced when the measure was under consideration were those 'employed on stations - the men with whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has such an intimate acquaintance. It was pointed out at the time that if the "boss" or manager of a station knew how the hands had voted, they would be subjected to victimization, and, in order to safeguard their interests and to preserve the secrecy of the ballot, this provision was inserted in our Electoral Act. Now, if the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> be agreed to, we shall be violating the secrecy of the ballot. I do not think it matters very much whether the result of the soldiers' vote at the recent referendum is made known or not. I have been astonished at the eagerness with which both sides claim that that vote waa cast in their favour. What would it signify if the result were known? If I were disposed to argue on the probabilities, I would naturally assume that the soldiers' vote was a "yes" vote. But even if my assumption proved correct it would not matter one way or the other. </para>

We have maintained that great principle for so long that we should insist upon observing the spirit of our Electoral Act now.. I think that this motion is out of order because it conflicts with one of the sections of that Act. If we have to make the soldiers' vote known, we shall be obliged to give the details, and that will necessitate the publication of a very .much smaller number' of votes than is permitted by statute. </para>

							<para>. - But they are very truthful, and that is the important thing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> must have recognised the point of my interjection a little while ago when I stated that his party had claimed that they knew all about the Anzac vote, and were aware that it had gone in their favour. Does the honorable senator realize the real meaning of his motion, and what may be its result in the future? If we are going to violate the secrecy of the" ballot on this occasion we shall certainly establish a precedent which will recoil, boomerang-like, upon him. It will be a bad thing if such a good Democrat becomes responsible for such a bad precedent. To my mind the most serious question raised by this motion is that of whether it is in order.</para>

With all due respect to the Imperial authorities, I fail to see the force of arguments which declare that the attitude of our soldiers abroad, as revealed by their votes on the occasion of the recent referendum, is something that should be kept particularly secret. But. I have to recognise that the Ministry is an association of honorable men, who state that a request came from the Imperial authorities asking that the details of the soldiers' vote' should not be published.

							<para>If the Imperial authorities asked for the suppression of the details of the voting of our soldiers overseas, I presume that they did so because of war reasons. That being so,  am hot going to lightly flout their wishes, and consequently I 'shall not vote for the disallowance of the regulation. At the same time, I must insist that it is highly desirable' that the information sought should be published, and, therefore I think that the Prime Minister should represent to the Imperial authorities the wisdom of reconsidering their decision in regard to this matter. That is what I hope will be done. I made certain remarks, and addressed a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate in connexion with the matter. I sincerely hope that the details of this particularly special appeal to th electors will be made available to the Australia people</para>

							<para>- The affirmative and negative aggregates will be sufficient  for me. I direct attention' to this point: This was a very peculiar referendum, and had no constitutional effect. It was merely an attempt on the part of the Legislature to arrive at some idea as to what !the popular opinion was; on the matter of compulsory military service. In connexion with such a matter, the voting of the soldiers at the front might reasonably have been expected to have a special value attached to it. Their opinions on the question have certainly a very special value in my mind. That being so, I want to know how they voted. The results of that particular referendum may have a far-reaching effect upon the fortunes of the nation. While I shall not vote for the repeal of the regulation, I do not abate one jot of my desire to know how the soldiers at the front voted at the recent referendum. The Prime Minister has said that their votes gave a very substantial majority for the affirmative, but that is a half revelation which is very unsatisfactory in connexion with, such an appeal to the people. We are told that legislation is to be introduced to provide for the recording of soldiers' votes at an ordinary general election. I venture to say that if the Imperial reasons for withholding the result of the voting of the soldiers at the referendum have any cogency, we may expect the Imperial authorities to say that it is also undesirable that it should be known- how soldiers at the front vote in connexion with an ordinary election. I can conceive a large amount of unavoidable looseness in connexion with the holding of an ordinary election.</para>

I wish to make my position quite clear. I desire that the Imperial authorities shall be asked to remove the ban, but that does not make it necessary that I should vote for the motion now before the Senate. </para>

						<para>Senator . Gardiner has been very ill-advised in moving for the disallowance of this regulation. When we were on the same side, .and fighting for the Electoral Act, our whole purpose was to insure the secrecy of the ballot. -I know that Senator Gardiner was one of those who .urged that, for instance, the vote recorded at a small station should not be made known. Twenty men might be employed upon a station, and all. their votes might go for a certain candidate, and they would get the sack next day when that became known, because they did not vote as the " boss" desired. What the honorable senator now proposes is really that in the case of the crew of an Australian ship, who may number twenty, the way in which they voted shall be made known', and if they have not voted as the skipper desired they will gefc the sack at the very next port of call.</para>

We want to preserve the secrecy of the ballot. The members of the Australian Workers Union were the men who, in every one of the States when the Electoral Act was being considered, asked that we should not count the votes recorded at any particular station, but should mix them up with a lot of others, and that unless 100 votes were polled at a particular polling place, they should not he counted there.</para>

							<para>- We are not dealing here with the votes of soldiers, sailors, tinkers, and tailors. There are too many tinkers and tailors on - the other side unfortunately. The disallowance of the regulation involves the violation of the secrecy of the ballot. We have soldiers in Mesopotamia, in Egypt, in England, and in France. These men are not in electoral divisions of the Commonwealth, but their votes must be recorded for the divisions in which they are enrolled. When I went to record my vote at the referendum I was told that I was at the front, and my name was struck off. It was mistaken for the name of my son who voted at the front, and I had to appeal to the Returning Officer before I was able to record my vote. My son's vote was recorded for the district in which he lived. The votes of these men are scattered throughout the different electoral divisions in the different. States, but each will be counted for the division for which the voter is enrolled. Honorable senators might just as well ask how every carpenter or blacksmith enrolled in a particular district voted , as ask how every soldier voted. Whether a soldier be in France, Egypt, or England, he is enrolled in a certain electoral division, and his vote is counted amongst the votes recorded for that division. What more do honorable senators want?</para>

							<para>- Whether a man at the . front is engaged in the air in a flying machine, or beneath the sea in a submarine, his vote will be recorded for an electoral division of Victoria if he is enrolled for such . a division. There is no solid reason for disallowing the regulation, and if it is disallowed, there will have to be substituted for it some provision which must have practically the same effect. We are proposing to send, say, 1,000 individuals away, and are we to have a special polling place for them, and to show that they voted in a certain direction ? The thing is ridiculous on the face of it. A thousand soldiers are sent to a particular place; the officers all vote "No," and the men all vote "Yes," but what satisfaction is it to us to know that? I do not propose to go into the matter now, but so far as the reasons giving for voting " Yes " and " No " at the referendum are concerned, I may say that I have received letters from officers and men on the subject. I can assure honorable senators that many men voted "No" because they did not want to he forced to go to the front with men who were unwilling to fight for their country. </para>

							<para>- It is a good reason. Some officers have said that they voted " No " because they did not wish to have charge of men who were unwilling fighters. They felt that men who did not . go to- the front willingly and prepared to do their duty to the country would seriously increase their responsibilities. We are asked now to disallow a regulation which provides for the recording of the vote of every man. at the front for the division for which he is enrolled. </para>

							<para>Why should we know how the soldiers voted any more than how blacksmiths or drapers have voted ? Honorable senators opposite, to be consistent, should propose that we should do away with geographical boundaries and make provision for a professional or trade vote under which all the lawyers would be counted together, an all the blacksmiths and all the drapers would be counted in the same way. We have decided upon geographical divisions, and the votes of the soldiers will be recorded for the geographical divisions for which they are enrolled. The motion is due only to party bias and a desire to discover how members of a certain section voted.</para>

						<para>I see no good reason why there should be so much mystery in this matter. I can easily understand the hostility of the War Office, not only to the result of the vote being made public, but to the vote itself. Nothing could be more distasteful to the aristocracy and plutocracy  f Great Britain, and to the people who rule Great Britain generally, than the fact that Australia before resorting to conscription took a vote of its people. That action on the part of Australia must have seemed outrageous to them. Probably the idea in the mind of the War Office when i t requested that the numbers should not be made public was that it did not care to give an impetus to the idea of taking a referendum upon any question of public importance. In any case, i t ought to be made clear to this Parliament that the War Office did request the Government not to disclose the numbers. So far as I have been able to gather, that has not been done yet. We have heard a great deal about interfering with the secrecy of the ballot-box, but the number of " Ayes " and " Noes " and informal votes in nearly every small district in the Commonwealth has been made public. Here we have between 200,000 and 300,000 citizens of Australia who at the time the referendum was taken were scattered over Europe, Africa, and Asia. They voted because they were citizens of Australia, bufc they voted outside Australia under special provisions of the Electoral Act. If the vote in the small township of Horse Flafc is to be made public, why should not the vote of those 200,000 or 300,000 men also be made public?</para>

							<para>- I do not see that it matters anything. In any case,, the German Government probably know a great deal more about it than we do, as the German .secret service is very much more efficient than any secret service we have. It does not matter twopence, so far as Germany is concerned, whether we publish the numbers or not, but it would be exceedingly interesting to the people of the Commonwealth to know exactly how the men at the front voted on that occasion. I shall therefore support the motion to disallow the regulation. </para>

						<para>I see no real purpose to be served by disclosing this information. The principal argument seems to be that certain people would like to know the figures. The vote of the soldier oversea was recorded as though he lived at his old address. The Opposition are, therefore, seeking to disinter his vote from those of the rest of the electors. Honorable senators who are so jealous of the secrecy of the ballot-box are now trying to unscrew the lid.</para>

							<para>- They are so similar that my argument is making honorable senators opposite squeal. There is no good purpose to be served by the motion, which is only prompted by curiosity. I was told by some honorable friends on the opposite side of the chamber that certain messages had been received in a sort of code to the effect that there were so many merinoes and so many crossbreds, or something like that, and that the message was interpreted to mean that so many of our soldiers had voted " Yes " and so many "No." Whether that were so or not, matters very little to me, because I am quite unconcerned how the soldiers voted. What I am concerned in is the fact that the people of Australia, and our soldiers also, had an opportunity of voting on this question. They have made known their decision, and I am prepared to abide by it.</para>

						<para>I sincerely hope that-the motion will be carried, not because we are prompted by a spirit of inquisitiveness and want to know how our soldiers voted, but because I think the people of Australia should know whefcner they were justified or not in turning down the proposal for compulsory military service outside "the Commonwealth. Proof as to whether that was the right or the wrong course will be disclosed by the publication of the vote taken at the front. At present, we are not in a position to say whether our soldiers gave a majority for ' or against compulsion; but believing as I do in the Democracy of Australia, I am loath to think that the majority vote against compulsion in Australia was not a reflex of the vote at the front.</para>

							<para>- Whether it condemns or approves the decision of Australia, I am prepared to challenge the position, believing as I do that the action of the people was quite in accord with the spirit of Democracy. Opponents of the motion, who are pleading the cause of. the men in the trenches, say that" they are animated by a desire to help our ' soldiers. If so, they should freely invite the publication, of the soldiers' vote in order that they may prove that we who opposed conscription were wrong, and that we had acted at variance with the views of our men at the front. If they are afraid to accept this challenge their . arguments on behalf of the soldiers fall to the ground. If we, by opposing conscription, have done our soldiers an injury, surely it is right that we should be warned so that we may retrace our steps, if necessary; but I have yet to learn that the men in the trenches desire that any of the sons of Australia should be forced to do that which they voluntarily have done so well. We should drop all this feeling, and . show our <inline font-style="italic">bona fides.</inline></para>

Let it be known to the people of Australia that our boys at the front want men to come from Australia in the same free manner they themselves went, and I think the manhood of this country will be appealed to most effectively. This matter ought to be cleared up. We ought to know whether or not the action of the people in Australia was in accord with the spirit of the men who are so very bravely upholding the flag in the trenches.</para>

						<para>I listened carefully to the remarks made by Senator Senior, who endeavoured to show that the action of Senator Gardiner in retiring from the Ministry was in direct opposition to that taken up by him in regard to this motion. But I point out that the positions are entirely different. At that time, as Senator Senior must know, if his memory serves him aright, the Prime Minister- proposed to give all eligible men who had not reported under the proclamation the shock of their lives when they came up to record tbeir votes on the 28th October. Had the Prime Minister kept the intention to himself, probably he would have been able to give a number of people a sudden shock on polling day, but fortunatly for us, if unfortunately for the Prime Minister, he allowed his intention to become known, and we were wondering what the shock would be. Subsequently we learned that he proposed to interfer with the right ' of individual electors at the ballot-box, and that was the reason,' I take i t , that Senator Gardiner retired from the Ministry. He was not prepared to see the rights of any elector interfered with at the ballot-box at the instigation of the Prime Minister.</para>

It is quite true -that there is a provision in the Electoral Act under which the votes at polling places containing less than a certain number of electors have to be taken to a centre in .a subdivision and counted there. I am not sure that it is the excellent provision which it is claimed to be. In looking through the returns connected with' the recent referendum, I find that at Euston, in the Barrier district, fifty electors voted "Yes," while thirty voted "No." </para>

Those figures are no more a disclosure of how the vote was taken than are the figures relating to the number of "Yes" and "No" votes cast on board our troopships. At Tarrawingie, fifty-four electors voted "Yes," and twenty-four voted " No." Yet nobody suggests that we can tell who those fifty-four electors were, or that we can establish the identity of the twenty-four electors who voted " No.." At Obley, in the Calare electorate, thirty-seven electors voted " Yes,"' whilst thirty voted "No." But we do not know who comprised the thirty-seven electors who favoured conscription, or who composed the thirty electors who were opposed to it.</para>

But we do wish to know the total votes recorded in favour of " Yes " and the total number cast in favour of " No." To my mind it is exceedingly doubtful whether this information can now be supplied. I also entertain a doubt as to whether the request to suppress this information came direct from the War Office, or whether it was instigated by some person outside of it, and subsequently came through the War Office.</para>

There is no military purpose to be served by its suppression. I believe that the reason why i t has not been disclosed is that the result of the vote was a big disappointment to the Ministerial party. That party anticipated that the men at the front would have cast a substantial majority in favour of "Yes," whereas the voting disclosed either that the figures were very evenly balanced or that there was .a small majority in favour of the " Noes." I hope that afc the earliest possible moment this information will be supplied, and I shall vote in favour of the disallowance of the regulation which has prevented its publication.</para>

						<para>— I am pleased that the Leader of the Labour party in this chamber has moved to disallow this regulation. The regulation never should have been made, and indeed it never would have been framed but for the fact that the Government desired to serve a political instead of a military purpose. Anybody who looks at i t will see that i t was a mere afterthought on the part of the Government. I am sure that if there had been an overwhelming " Yes " vote on the part of the men afc the front i t would have been published in Australia, not on the day after the referendum, but a few days before i t , in order to give the electors a lead. My proof of that statement is to be found in the manifesto issued by the Prime Minister to the men at the front, the concluding paragraph of which reads—</para>

					<para>He said that the Australian soldiers were to vote first', that they were to give their fellow Australians a lead, and that they were to li f t up their voices and send one mighty shout across the leagues of ocean telling them how to vote." "What useful purpose could be served by giving the men at the front that instruction unless it were intended that the result of their votes should be made known in Australia prior to polling day? Additional proof of my contention is to be found in the fact that the regulation itself was not made until five or six days after the result of the referendum was known. The referendum was taken on the 28th October, and this regulation is dated 3rd November. That is conclusive evidence that the regulation was only passed for a political purpose. It was a political expedient, and had no relation whatever to 'the military . situation as it stood. The present Government, for political reasons, have allowed the censor to run amok. Only the other day we had the Prime Minister parading around Melbourne and Sydney with an invitation from the Imperial authorities co attend the most important Conference ever proposed, in his pocket, and intriguing in the meantime in order to secure a political advantage over his opponents before the information was disclosed. That shows the depth of degradation to which politics have been brought in this country by the intrigues of the present Government. It is little wonder that we view with suspicion all that they do.</para>

							<para>- Suppose the War Office did ask that the information should be suppressed, is that any reason why it should be suppressed? Every one knows that the policy of the Imperial Government is conscription. They did not consult the people of England on the matter at all. They simply imposed conscription upon them, and naturally, it would be very distasteful to them that the result of the voting here on the question should be made known. Their instructions- in such a contingency do not in the circumstances deserve to be taken into account. The crux of the matter lies in the dangerous precedent we are establishing of suppressing the vote of any section of the people of Australia. The referendum vote was taken upon the most important issue ever submitted to our people, but the result of a section of the vote has not been made known. Suppose that in a few months' time we have a general election, at which the issue raised is conscription, as it probably would be. . Suppose, again, that the men at the front are, as they ought to be, given the right to vote at that election. If it was right to suppress the result of their vote at the referendum, it is arguable that it would be equally right to suppress it at the forthcoming election. If it is suppressed, what guarantee shall we have that the present Government will not pollute the ballot?</para>

							<para>- I suspect the Government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is a member of being prepared to do many little tricks. I am not speaking in a personal sense, but am judging the Government by their 'past actions. The members of the Government, who, on the eve of the referendum, tried to intimidate the electors of Australia by the secret regulation -which necessitated -the retirement of Senators Russell and Gardiner and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs</inline> from the Ministry, might do anything. I am not prepared to trust them as far as I could throw them, and that would not be very far. If an election is to be a clean election it should be held in such a way as to enable the closest scrutiny to be . made of all the votes recorded. If votes are to be recorded in the way in which they were recorded at the recent referendum, they cannot be scrutinized. We want to do awav with all the secret business. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie said that in proposing the disallowance of the regulation, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was opposing the spirit of the Electoral Act, and was proposing practically the violation of the secrecy of the ballot. I remind the honorable senator that at the last election for members of the Senate the regulation which we are discussing was not in force. I did not hear the honorable senator say at any time that the absence of such a regulation in the conduct of that election made for a violation of the secrecy of the ballot. If it did not do so in 1914, how will it do so when the next' election is held ? There is clearly nothing in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's contention. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> pointed out that we have no right to make a record of sectional votes. He reminded us- that under the Electoral Act we prohibit the counting of votes in small places. But there is no analogy whatever between that and the counting of the votes of tens of thousands of men at the front. I have here a return which was tabled to-day in order to anticipate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> motion.</para>

							<para>- I asked for the information before, but I could not get it until to-day. What is the difference between making known the record of votes of men in Mesopotamia, in England, France, or Egypt, and making known the record of votes for the different States and divisions of the Commonwealth? The return I have before me shows how the people voted at the referendum in every division and subdivision of Queensland, and the same applies to every other State. If we permit these subdivisional records in the case of electors voting within the Commonwealth, what objection can there be to giving the same information concerning the votes of men at the front? There can be no objection unless the Government desire to cover up something, and to withhold from the people information which they are entitled to know. This return of the voting at the recent referendum, in the absence of the Anzac vote being specified, is, after all, merely a relatively accurate return. The majority given in the return for " No " for the State of Queensland is over 14,000, but we have no guarantee that it was not 20,000. What applies to Queensland applies to every other State in the Commonwealth, so that the return is not worth the paper on which it is printed. If honorable senators consult <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham,</inline> he will have to admit that it is only a relatively accurate return. I am sure that he will be able to point to the insuperable difficulties in the way of making it an accurate return in the circumstances. I will show honorable senators why this is the case. The regulation which we propose should be disallowed provides that this return should be made up in the following way : --</para>

						<para>What did that mean? It meant, in the first place, that the total votes of the Anzacs should be allocated to the States from which they came as nearly as practicable. It is important to remember that every man at the front who was eligible to vote had a right to record his vote under the Military Service Referendum Act, whether he was on a Commonwealth roll or not, and the fact that the votes were recorded of men who were not upon any Commonwealth roll made it almost impossible for the officers of the Electoral Branch of the Home Affairs Department to say to which State the votes of those men should be allotted. Hundreds of men who enlisted in New South Wales may have come from Queensland. Scores of men enlisted in Queensland who came from New South Wales. A very important part of the 1st Military District, which comprises Queensland, includes a large section of New South Wales. If the place of enlistment were taken as a guide, a great number of New South Wales votes would be allotted to Queensland. It was clearly impossible to accurately allot to the different States the votes recorded by the men at the front. However difficult that task may have been, it was still more difficult to allot the votes to the respective divisions of the States. The regulation provided only that it should be done as nearly as practicable. The thing was a farce, and as a consequence this return is misleading. I am not blaming the electoral officers for this. I am quite prepared to acknowledge their capacity and honesty, but they were circumscribed in compiling the return by this obnoxious regulation, and had only to do the best they could. They have supplied a return which we must take for what it is worth, and, in my opinion, it is not worth the paper on which it is written. I guarantee that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> perseveres with his intention, and secures a Select Committee to inquire into the methods adopted for the allocation of the soldiers' vote at the recent referendum, we shall find some smellful business connected with it. I hope that the Senate will not hesitate for a moment about disallowing this regulation. There is no' military reason to justify it. It was stated by a prominent member of the House of Commons that -the Imperial authorities had no objection to the information being made known, whilst we have been told here that the Imperial authorities do not desire that it should bo, made known. The evidence on the point is contradictory, and I am prepared to accept that of the Imperial authorities, and conclude that there is no military consideration to justify keeping this information secret. An injustice is being done to the men at the front. The conscriptionist newspapers every day publish cuttings from letters from men at the front who are favorable to conscription, but they publish no clippings from the men who, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> heartilv cheered the announcement that the referendum had been defeated in Australia. I hope, in the interests of fair play, that the result of the vote will be made known in the form of a proper return, and not a mechanical one. What the Government have done has been a purely mechanical allocation of the votes, the direction being that the votes shall be " apportioned as nearly equally as circumstances will permit " to the respective divisions of the State, and in regard to the State itself to "be allocated as far as practicable." What kind of a way is that to compile a return? How would honorable senators like their elections to be subject to the allocation of votes in that way? If it is justifiable in this case, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> might argue that it would be justifiable in other cases, and might refuse the right to scrutinize the vote. At the impending elections the Government might attempt such a mechanical allocation of votes, which would open the door to corruption. Even if we had no doubt of the honesty of the Government, we should not place in their hands a weapon by which they might destroy the incorruptibility of the ballot. </para>

						<para>I support the motion, and regard i t as of the highest importance to the people of this country to secure and make public the result of the soldiers' vote if there is a possibility of getting i t . When the fight was going on, the supporters of the Government influenced many thousands of votes by telling the people that the soldiers in the trenches were unanimously in favour of sending reinforcements in the way suggested by the Government. It is important, not only to Australia, but also to other Democracies which may have to fight the same thing as we have passed through, to have a. true record of the- only concrete instance, so far as I know, of soldiers away on active service being consulted about, and casting a large vote against, compulsory military service. The people of this country may some day have reason to be thankful that there is a vote of that sort on record, so that we may be able to tell them, "We had one fight on this matter. We consulted the people mainly interested, and upon whom the Government relied to carry the proposal, and i t is on record that they voted by a very large majority against compulsory military service."</para>

The people of Western Australia knew nothing about what was happening in the other States. After the vote was taken, dray-loads of printed matter which had come from the eastern States, and had been bundled into corners in the post-office in heaps, were thrown out</para>

							<para>- They were not allowed to get any of that printed matter. One of the newspapers that largely influenced the vote in the eastern States was- not allowed to be distributed at all in the West, so that it is no wonder that the people over there voted with so little knowledge. I have been told, also, that the soldiers went for their ballot-papers, recorded their votes, handed them over to some officer, and did not know what became df them afterwards. If the soldiers' votes are ever taken again, some much better method must be brought into existence. I am not prepared to allow any Government that conducts a ballot in that manner to have the power which thi3 regulation gives to  juggle  with 200,000 votes, which could settle an election in' any division in Australia.</para>

Honorable senators have' been told that the Government received a request from the War Office that for military reasons the details of the vote should not be published. Yet they talk here as if the vote itself had been suppressed or had not been counted. We have been accused of juggling with the figures. If they think the Government capable of that, they do not give us credit for the full amount of viciousness that they suggest, because if the Government juggled with the figures, what was the use . of doing so simply to reduce the " No " majority? If we were corrupt, low, and unscrupulous enough to do that, surely we should have at least created a majority in favour of our own proposals? The thing is so obvious that a child can see that it is so much humbug and nonsense, talked to gull a few people outside into the belief that the Government are in some way corrupt, and that because it is not desired for military reasons to make known the details of the vote, the Government have some deep and -underhand scheme behind it to prevent the votes being counted, or not to give full effect to those that were . cast. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> in a light and airy, and altogether irresponsible fashion, said that he heard certain things, or that somebody said them. He did not say by whom they were said, and he gave no authority. He said he had been told that certain soldiers handed their votes to officers. That is altogether at variance with the facts, which are that the carrying out of the vote was as far as possible placed in the hands of men who were not officers. Brigadier-General McC, Anderson is not a military officer in the proper sense of the term. He was the Chief Electoral Officer, and utilized as far as possible the Red Cross officers who were in England to help him. </para>

							<para>. - The honorable senator assumes that everybody who had. anything to do with the matter was corrupt. Statements were apparently made to him at the street corner, and he did not take the trouble to ascertain whether they were in the slightest degree reliable. In a most casual and irresponsible way he hurls practically a suggestion of corruption at those who conducted the ballot at the front. All that I can say is that the instructions were that, so far as practicable, they were to observe the conditions laid down in the Electoral Act. Because the soldiers' vote gave a majority for "Yes," an attempt is made to discredit that fact, and then to create the belief that that majority was obtained corruptly. Those statements are not worthy of the honorable senators who make them, and will not do them any good in the country. They will not get the people of Australia to believe that the men with whom they have been associated right up to now are corrupt and rotten in their public life. The people will ask them, " Why were you so long associated with those men? Why did you sit cheek by jowl with them? Is it only since they dissociated themselves from you that they have become corrupt?" Such suggestions will not do them or their cause any good, as they will find. The public- of Australia have a higher opinion of their public men than to be taken in by things 'of that sort. No good purpose is to be served by the motion. Its only object is to defeat the request of the Imperial authorities at the War Office. </para>

						<para>I did not intend to take part in this discussion, and should not have done so except for some remarks made by Senator de Largie this afternoon in reply to an interjection that I made. I stated by interjection that the soldiers at the front received with acclamation the news of the rejection of conscription in Australia, and because I was unable, at the moment, to say in which part of the trenches this incident occurred, Senator de Largie cast a doubt upon my statement. We have not all had the opportunity that was given to Senator de Largie. He was able to go to the other side of the world, and to come back professing a great knowledge of military matters, but he has shown, by his attitude in this discussion, that travel has not improved his conception of affairs in regard to the referendum. When a senator makes a statement, either by interjection or "from the floor of the Senate, other senators should at least give him credit for honesty of purpose, and not impute that he is talking recklessly and at random. I distinctly remember reading in the columns of the Sydney Daily Telegraph a few weeks ago a statement that the Australian soldiers at the front were pleased when they received news of the defeat of the referendum in Australia. I have since looked up the files, and I find that in an issue of the Telegraph of 25th January there appeared a report of a . meeting presided over by Mrs. Langar Owen, who, I understand, is the wife of a prominent barrister of New South Wales. The report stated—</para>

					<para>That is the paragraph upon which I based my interjection to Senator de Largie, and I do not think he received i t in anything approaching a spirit of fairness, because he suggested that I was talking at random. In fact, he characterized the statement as childish, and said that every statement I made in regard to the war was unfounded because I had not been so close up to the firing line as he had ; though, by the way, he was always safe from injury.</para>

The hypocrisy of the Government in refusing to make public the result of the soldiers' vote abroad has ' just been disclosed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who said he was prepared to give particulars of the soldiers' votes at the military camps. Surely the same military reasons would apply to the disclosure of the votes of Australian soldiers on this 'side of the world as the publication of the votes of our overseas troops. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> seems to think that those who are supporting the motion doubt the earnestness and sincerity of the Government - I do for one - in withholding the information asked for, and he thinks that corruption is imputed. Well, I impute corruption here and now.</para>

							<para>- No; nor do I include the officials. After a perusal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> manifesto to the troops at the front, we are entitled to assume that the soldiers' vote was an overwhelming " No." What did he ask of the soldiers? He asked them to give the people of Australia a lead. What did that mean ? It meant that the vote would have been published, if it had been satisfactory from his point of view, before the vote was taken in Australia. He has now told us, however, that the voting at the front could not be published for military reasons. Is it suggested that if the soldiers -voted "Yes"' this information would have been withheld ? I hope that the conditions obtaining in Australia during the 'two months prior to the taking of the referendum will never be seen again. They brought me back to the time that I read of the other day in the <inline font-style="italic">Historical Records of Australia</inline> - the years from 1813 to 1815 - when Governor Macquarie had to fight the same battle that we were engaged . in during the referendum. He had to fight the military caste, and in the <inline font-style="italic">Historical Records</inline> to which I refer appears the statement that two military officers who had been out on the " loose " met a girl in the street and endeavoured to force their attentions upon her. She sought shelter in the house of her employers-</para>

It is not too much for me to say that those responsible for the affirmative side of the campaign desecrated the graves of Australian soldiers at Gallipoli by the contemptible references they made to the appeals of the dying for conscription in Australia. They exploited the soldiers living and dead, and claimed that bur troops were crying out for conscription as being the only method by which reinforcements could be obtained.</para>

							<para>- To see how far you were from the truth. When any Australian soldiers prior to the referendum wrote to friends in Australia- advocating conscription, those letters were rushed to the press for publication, but we have, not seen any letters since the taking of the referendum, because the Government are withholding . from the people information" which rightly belongs to them. If the publication of such views can be regarded as of such great significance, and as affecting the military operations of the Allies, where are we going to stop under the present military system ? Until the Government make public those figures concerning the vote of our troops at the front, the people of Australia can come to only one conclusion, namely, that our soldiers voted " No " by a very large majority.</para>

							<para>—Th e honorable senator has neither the right of free speech nor of free action. He has sold his liberty as a member of this Parliament to a section which has no responsibility to Parliament. A great deal of capital is sought to be made out of the fact that in the manifesto issued by the Prime. Minister to our soldiers at the front he asked them to give Australia a lead. The very worst construction is put on that statement. If these man had cast a tremendous affirmative vote they would have given a lead to Australia just as much as they would have done had the result of their voting been made known. There is no proof that the Prime Minister attempted to manipulate their votes. Mr. Hughes is an honest man, and the men who were connected with taking the referendum among the soldiers were also honest. There is not a member of the Government who is capable of committing any of the wicked misdeeds of which they have been accused this afternoon. They have not lost all sense of decency. They are as honorable to-day as they were three or four months ago, when honorable senators opposite were pleased to be associated with them. I know something of the feeling of the hoys at the front concerning the defeat of the referendum in Australia. Whilst it is true that some of them were not disappointed with the resulting t because they did not require assistance, but because they did not wish to have the stigma of' conscription attached to themselves - it t is also true that there are hundreds and thousands of men in the trenches who exceedingly regret that conscription was not carried.</para>

Behind all the fireworks which have been indulged in to-day is the fact that those responsible for the conduct of this war have asked the people of Australia to do a certain thing. Here, in the face of that request, it is proposed to open the door, and to do the very thing which we have been requested not to do. Is it right that the men who are responsible for the defence of the Empire, and who are doing their best to win this war, should have their wishes flouted in that way ?</para>

						<para>—Befor e the Leader of the Opposition replies, there are a few points that I desire to emphasize. In the first place, it has . been stated by the Minister for Defence that the Government are withholding the information sought by Senator Gardiner because of a request which was made to-it by the War Office. That request was conveyed to us through the medium of a representative of the Government in London. This statement is doubted by some honorable senators. Suppose that the "doubting Thomases" are correct, and that, as a fact, no such request was received from the British Government, can we not apply our own intelligence to what the position in the trenches would be to-day if these figures were made known in deference to the request of the Leader of the Orvoosition ? Let us try to picture to ourselves what would happen. We know that the first essential qualification for a soldier is obedience. We know that much heat was engendered in the country, and perhaps a little in the Senate, by the discussion of conscription for military service. We can say with certainty that the same thing'would occur if the matter were discussed in the trenches, where no such heat should be engendered at all. Even if'there were no request on the subject from the War Office, I ask honorable senators opposite to consider what the result of making this information known in the trenches would be. There are men at the front who are heartily in favour of conscription. That is not disputed by any one. There are men in the trenches to-day who, apparrently, are just as strongly against it, and  honorable senators may easily picture for themselves what the position in the trenches would be if, when the men were called upon to obey, as soldiers must, the orders of those in high command, they were engaged in heated arguments for and against conscription. If honorable senators will only apply their common sense to this matter, they will realize that, in the. interests of putting up the best fight possible against our foes, we should prevent the introduction into the trenches of any information which would provoke disputes and dissension amongst our soldiers. The best way to provoke such dissension would be to publish the results of the voting at the referendum, as suggested by those who are supporting the' motion now before the Senate. When i t is said- that to disallow the regulation would have a good result, I reply by saying that, from the point of view of insuring unity amongst our soldiers, no good could possibly result from the publication of information which would give rise to disputes amongst them. That is my contribution to the debate, and if honorable senators will only use their common sense they will be found opposing the motion.</para>

						<para>I am not surprised at the extent of the debate to which the motion has given rise, but I am surprised that three Ministers have each refused to accept my challenge that they should produce the request which we have been told came from the War Office. I am quite prepared to believe' that the Government received some information on the subject from one of their own officer. I am prepared to .believe that one of their own officers has said that the War Office would not like to have the figures published;0but against that I set the information we have received that a Minister of the Crown, in answering a question on the subject in the House of Commons, stated that the request for the suppression of the information came from the Commonwealth and not from the British. Government. The Government can easily settle all doubts on this matter by producing the instruction from the War Office which they are said to have received. The reason they have not produced i t is that they have not got it. Senator Pearce has said that I have moved my motion with the same motive as that which T. had in doing something. else.</para>

							<para>- I have been strengthened in my view of the desirableness of the motion by the weakness of the opposition to it. It is contended that the publication of the results of the ballot will interfere with the secrecy of the ballot. To-day, the Government have laid upon the table of the Senate a return giving the fullest information regarding the results of the ballot in the recent referendum at polling places where only sixty or seventy votes were recorded. I say that the only guarantee that the people can have of a fair ballot is the publication of the results. I. am -not seeking or desiring to secure information as to how certain sections of our soldiers voted. What I want to know is how the soldiers' vote went at the referendum. That is what the country wants to know. I want to know, further, how the soldiers' vote was divided between the different States. I think that honorable senators should insist upon knowing that. The publication of that information could have no effect upon the wax. I venture to- say that men at the front who voted " Yes " .at the referendum will fight as well as those who voted " No." </para>

There was ample reason for my resignation also in the way in which the Prime Minister treated the members of the then Government who turned that proposal down. All that I am asking for is that we shall be given the same information with respect to the soldiers' votes as we are given with respect to the votes recorded at any polling booth in Australia.</para>

							<para>- I am asking that this regulation preventing the publication of the result of ,the voting by the men at the front shall be disallowed, and that their votes shall be treated in the same way as were the votes recorded by soldiers at, say, the Liverpool Camp. I have been asked why I have not proposed to interfere with the voting of the soldiers at the Liverpool Camp. The answer is that it is because the Government did not interfere with it. They issued no regulation prohibiting the publication <inline font-style="italic">oh</inline> the result of the voting at the Liverpool Camp. I have addressed many public meetings recently, and when I was asked in Western Australia how the soldiers voted I said that I did not know. It was not any business of mine even to hint that they had voted " No," but I did say that they voted "Yes" in such numbers that the present Government considered that it would be best not to let the public know how large those numbers were !</para>

If, as the honorable senator says, the difference between the two sides amongst, the soldiers was only 16,000, I say that, in view of the fact that at that time there were between 150;000 and 200,000 men at the front, the result speaks well for their manhood and love of liberty. If, with General Birdwood's manifesto, the manifesto of the Prime Minister, and all the other forces brought to bear, upon them, the result was as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has stated, it was to the credit of our soldiers.

The Government should themselves have relieved us from the necessity of having to compel them to make this information public. What right, for instance, have they to prohibit a writer in a newspaper saying what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has said here to-day. The honorable senator has said that there was a majority for "Yes " amongst the votes of the soldiers at the front of 16,000. Under the regulation with which we are dealing, no "writer for a newspaper dare say that, or he" would be prosecuted under the War Precautions Act. If the publication of this information could have any effect upon the war, there might be some justification for prohibiting it.</para>

							<para>- Let me analyze what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said on the subject. He stated that when the absent votes were coming in, and the soldiers' votes were absent votes, the "No" majority was diminished, and it could easily have been seen from that that the majority of the soldiers' votes were  "Yes" votes. But if we turn to the results in New South Wales we shall find that, although there was a " No " majority of about 108,000 on the Saturday, a week or a fortnight later when the absent votes came to be counted, the " No" majority rose to 118,000. It  should  bc remembered that New South Wales has sent more men to the front than has any other State in the Commonwealth, and, at the time of the referendum, she had sent over 100,000 to the  front</para>

							<para>Then I shall ask for the correct figures to-morrow. These are some more figures which we desire to have, and further information which the public is entitled to receive. At the time of the referendum, New South Wales, had sent over 100,000 to the front, and I have shown that Senator Pearce's method of analyzing the soldiers' votes could not be applied to the results obtained in New South Wales. At one time it rose to 120,000, and then diminished to 118,000, but when the soldiers' vote Was counted the majority was about 10,000 in advance of what i t waa a couple of days after the poll was taken.</para>

							<para>- I am simply saying that it was a fairly evenly balanced vote. I am not particularly interested whether the vote was evenly or unevenly balanced, or even whether " Yes " or " No " won. What I am interested in is that those who watch the public interests here shall have the figures in order that they may be able to check them, and see how they were divided among the different States and the different electorates. I want to see that those who are here to watch the public interests have as much information as the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has. We are entitled to it, and the people sent us here to maintain that position. There has been no reason for any of this secrecy. The Government are sheltering themselves behind a telegram from one of their own officers. They are putting him up to create a mist of secrecy around themselves. It is very significant that, although three Ministers have spoken since, not one of them has accepted my challenge to produce the request from the War Office.</para>

We shall appoint a Select Committee to examine the officers, who will be able to give the evidence as to the figures, once the regulation is disallowed. If the Government do not  supply  the information, I shall take steps to-morrow to move for its supply by the Electoral Office in the form of a return; in which case it will be a public document.</para>

						<para>As chairman of the State Recruiting Committee of Tasmania, I yesterday asked the Minister for Defence, on behalf of the Committee, that the phrase " Win-the-war " should be retained for recruiting purposes only, and not allowed to be used by political organizations. The Minister refused to take that step, with the result that in Tasmania, and no doubt all over Australia, "Win-the-War" leagues have been formed of persons of all shades of political opinion, for the purpose of assisting recruiting", and then nave found the name pirated by other bodies for political purposes. Already in Tasmania the newspapers are using the phrase in connexion with the new party that is likely to be formed to take possession of the Treasury bench. The name should be protected by regulation, so that any suspicion of political motive behind its use may be prevented. I earnestly urge the Minister to reconsider his decision.</para>

							<para>- This title was picked by the Director-General of Recruiting for recruiting purposes only, and therefore should be protected. This is a fair request, and, I make it with the best intentions, as recruiting and the desire to help the recruiting movement forward should not be confined to any one party, but should be common to all.</para>

						<para>I gave this matter consideration when Mr. Mackinnon suggested it to me. We talked it over, and I thought i t was not a proper use to put the War Precautions Act to. I still think so. Mo one can say that the patenting of this set of words is necessary to obtain recruits for our Forces in the field. . No one can say that its use by a political party for its organization will interfere with recruiting by recruiting organizations. The course the honorable senator is asking me to adopt is dangerous. It would probably prevent any political party from using a .particular word or set of words. Does not the honorable senator see the danger of that? Does he not see that if we establish a precedent now we might, on the plea that it would probably interfere with recruiting, on some future occasion prevent another political'. party from adopting some other word or words?</para>

A Minister might say, for instance, that he could not allow the use of the words " Labour party " because the members of that- organization were not the Labour party.</para>
