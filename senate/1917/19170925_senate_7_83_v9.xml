                        <para>.- I find that I am compelled to break away from one of the good resolutions I formed when this session commenced, and that was that the Government should have its financial measures passed without adverse criticism from me. The restraint I placed upon myself when the last financial Bill was going through the Senate showed me that it was a mistake to make a promise which one would find it almost impossible to keep. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>With regard to this measure, I can scarcely call it a financial proposal of the Government. They introduced to another place a measure which looked like a Bill to penalize eligibles who had not enlisted, but no sooner did this bring upon the heads of the Government that hostile criticism which it so justly deserved, than it was withdrawn and converted into what may be called a tax upon bachelors.  I  shall oppose this measure, not only in the House, but in the Committee, and seek to have it so amended that it will deal justly with all sections of the people. We have in existence already an income tax which provides ample exemptions for those persons not in receipt of sufficient income to be expected to pay, so why should not this Bill contain the same provisions? If, under the Income Tax Act, exemption is granted to single men in receipt of less than £100, and to married men with incomes less than £156, why should not single men be treated in the same manner under this proposal ? Very often a young man is  a  bachelor because of family responsibilities resting upon him. Perhaps his condition is due to the fact that his father having died, he is left as the sole support of his widowed mother and members of his family. What will be the position of such a young man under this Bill, who, in addition to self-imposed responsibility, which perhaps he is worthily discharging, will be penalized to the extent of £21 10s. a year should his income reach £250 ? An exemption should undoubtedly be inserted to provide for such cases. </para>
                    <para>Apart altogether from these hard cases - and I know hard cases make bad law - what reasonable excuse is there for the Government to launch a proposition of this nature in their effort to finance the war and their obligations with regard to repatriation? In my judgment, they are acting as the crowd acted in the streets  of Melbourne the other night. They appear to have run amok; and are now indulging in political window smashing. Whenever they are turned away from one street, they go down another, and continue their wild career of taxation. A tax of this kind has the same mental result as the attitude of an unruly crowd im our streets at night. Why have not the Government kept "to the well-beaten track of taxation ? In a time like the present they would have been on safe lines if they had kept to taxation upon land values and income,- because they would then know whom they could reach ; the amount of taxation is easily ascertainable, and easy of collection. In this measure, however, and under the name of an Income Tax Bill, they are seeking to obtain taxation from persons irrespective of whether they have incomes or not. How will the Government collect this tax of <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> from those young men who have not got the money? The Government should seriously face the position? </para>
                    <para>I do not intend to debate the measure at length at this stage. I am stating my objections to it in as few words as possible. I declare emphatically that taxation of this kind is calculated to discredit, not only the Government, but Parliament itself, and, holding that belief strongly, I shall oppose this measure at every stage. This is a tax upon a man because he has not .married, though a man may be unmarried from the most worthy motives in the world. If the measure is intended to counteract the effect caused by the number of marriages of Australian soldiers in the Homeland, it only emphasizes the serious nature of the problem that has been added to Australia's difficulties by this war. I noticed a newspaper statement last week to the effect that 6,000 Australian soldiers had been married in England, and, while I think that we shall get an excellent addition to our population, the position is also serious for the young unmarried women of this country. If, on the other hand, the Government have taken this roundabout way of displaying their spite against the  eligibles  because the Prime Minister's proposal twelve months ago was defeated at the polls, they deserve the sternest censure of this Chamber for having adopted a measure the effect of which will be to cause so much irritation to a certain section of the community. How will certain young men be able to pay this tax ? Why, also, should ministers of religion come under the provisions of this measure? </para>

                            <para>- They should nob be included for a very good reason, at least so far as one section is concerned. If by reason of their faith, ministers of religion remain single men, we should hesitate seriously before we seek to impose any penalty upon them. I hope honorable senators will realize that they have a personal and individual responsibility for legislation that passes through the Senate. I rose merely to state my contempt for and opposition to the Bill, which I hope will be considerably altered and improved before it passes the Committee stage in this chamber. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> in much that he has said with regard to the extraordinary change that took place in the nature of the Bill now before the Senate, but I do not agree with him in his opposition to this proposed taxation upon eligibles,  because I think that  eligibles  who have not gone to the war will have no objection to some measure of taxation, especially if the amount raised is devoted to repatriation purposes. I hold the view very strongly that very great hardship will be caused by this alteration in the form of taxation, making the Bill a tax upon bachelors, especially in the case of the elder men in receipt of small incomes, and who are already feeling the pinch due to the increased cost of living. </para>

Honorable senators, I am sure, do not desire to inflict- an injury upon the older men in our community, and I happen to know of several who have barely enough to live upon. When the Bill reaches the Committee stage I shall move an amendment exempting men over sixty years of age, otherwise they will have to seek relief by applying for an old-age pension and get exempted in that way. I think it) a mistake to expect that hard cases will be discoverable under every law, and I should like to see legislation which inflicts hardship upon no one, for while injustice ito the individual might not be a matter of great interest to the community, it is a very real trouble to the individual concerned. I desire, also, to exempt ministers of religion from the operation of this measure, because I think the poor curate is the most' sweated man in this community. </para>

                        <para>. - - We have heard a good deal from honorable members opposite about responsible government, and the Labour party have frequently been taunted that we do not believe in responsible government, but are merely the creatures of the Caucus. Responsible government, I take it, means that Ministers should be responsible to Parliament. We know, too, that tin are expected to be responsible to the  party  which keeps them in power, and  especially  in regard to their taxation measures. All Ministries with any self-respect have, in the past, regarded that as one of the first principles of responsible government. Whenever their financial proposals were seriously altered, either by the Opposition or by their own supporters, they did not hesitate to resign their offices. But in the present instance the Government have 'merely flung their financial proposals on the table of Parliament, and have said, "There you are. Do what you like with them. If you do not approve of them, we will alter them1 to suit your views." That is the attitude which they have adopted in regard to the two principal financial measures which were designed to assist us in winning the war. </para>

If Ministers had hid the slightest inkling that the measure would receive such rude treatment at the hands of one of their own supporters I do not think it would have been submitted to Parliament in its original form. But even though the Government consented to alter the Bill at the behest of one of their newest supporters they did not secure his vote. It strikes me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maxwell</inline> knows how to qualify for a Ministerial position. The Government did not get his vote, although they tried their hardest to please him. </para>

                    <para>The proposed tax is a punitive impost. It ought to be called a bachelors' tax. From the Prime Minister downwards, every candidate who carried the Ministerial banner during the recent election campaign affirmed that he would honour the decision of the people given on the 28tH "October last, and would not attempt to bring in conscription; but this Bill, in the form in which it was originally introduced, was nothing but a mean effort to bring about conscription. It was economic conscription. That it was an attempt to fasten economic conscription on the country is proved conclusively by the remarks of the Treasurer himself. He said - </para>

                        <para>We say that those who are not physically unfit, and who have failed to volunteer, should pay a special tax. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Will any one dare say that that is not conscription ? The title of the Bill should be altered to read " A Bill for an Act to levy a tax on old bachelors and invalid young men." That is what the measure is. It contemplates a tax upon those who are" above the military age who will not be able to escape it by enlisting, and also upon invalided young men who are physically unfit to pass the medical examination. All the accepted canons of taxation have been violated in this Bill. Under it, there will be two classes of exemptions. It will exempt the physically fit men who have gone to the Front. These are chiefly young men, because save in very few instances men over forty-five years of age are unable to get to the Front. Here I wish to ask whether " enlistment  for foreign service " will include, not only those who have gone to the Front and fought for the Empire, but those who have passed the medical examination, who have embarked from Australia, but who,, soon after, have been found to be- medically unfit and have therefore been returned to our shores? I take it that they will be exempt from the  operation  of this Bill, because it will be held that they have enlisted for foreign service. How unfair it will be to make a distinction between these men and men of eligible age who have volunteered for service, but who have been rejected on the ground of their physical unfitness ! Then there is another class to which I desire to direct attention. I refer to men who for very good reasons have not married, men who are possibly in delicate health, but who because of the possession of an independent spirit have refused to apply for the invalid pension. Because of their refusal to do so, they will" be obliged to pay the tax. Then the Bill seeks to tax the unfit while exempting a man who is fit because, perhaps, his brother has gone to the war. If there be, for example, a family of five brothers, and three of them have enlisted for foreign service, the two who remain behind will be exempt from the tax. They will be able to say to the man in delicate health, " I am a patriot." My three brothers have gone to the war, and therefore you must pay my share of the proposed tax as well as your own." These two brothers may each be earning £300, £400, or £500 per year, and yet they will escape the impost while the delicate individual will have to pay it. </para>
                    <para>Will any one contend that this tax does not violate all the accepted canons of taxation ? One of the first of these is that a man should be taxed in accordance with his ability to pay. This Bill ignores that principle absolutely. The Government in this measure says to a single man under 45, "You should be at the war. Go to the war, or we shall fine you." That is not conscription, of course. The man replies, " You told us that you would accept and honour the decision of the people. This is economic, conscription." To this the Government say, " This is not conscription.  We intend to honour the verdict of the people, but we shall punish you all the same, because you are under 45, are physically fit, and have failed to enlist." They say to the bachelor over 45, " We are sorry to have to punish you, old fellow, also, but it must be done, in order that we may reach the  eligibles,  because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maxwell</inline> has said so. When we introduced this taxation measure we did not intend to tax you. We desired to tax only those under 45, to show our displeasure at their refusal to accept the views of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maxwell</inline> has spoken, and we must hit you as well. You may be an invalid, earning only enough to keep body and soul together and cover your nakedness, but that is your misfortune, because we must tax you since that is necessary to enable us to get at those who are eligible for military service, but will not enlist." </para>
                    <para>In the case of a family of only two brothers, one must pay the tax if he stays at home.' If there are four brothers in a family, and two go to the Front, the two remaining must pay the tax. There is unfair discrimination under this proposal, affecting not only  eligibles,  but their parents. If there are five brothers in a family and three go to the Front, though two are still left to the parents, they are exempt from this taxation. If there is only one son in. a family, and he remains at home at the request of his parents, though he may have desired himself to go to the Front, he has to pay the tax. The wealthy married man is exempt, whilst the impoverished single man has to pay. Numbers of cases will readily occur to the minds of honorable senators of men who enjoy splendid incomes, who will be exempt from this taxation, whilst others, just as worthy citizens in every respect, but who are in poor circumstances be-' cause they have to keep a number of dependants, will be called upon to pay. </para>
                    <para>If this measure is to be regarded as a sample of the genius of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir John Forrest)</inline> for high finance, we must come to the conclusion that his reputation  in that respect is imperilled by its introduction. The right honorable gentleman's financial reputation was badly jarred by the- introduction of the first of the financial measures submitted by the Government in order to win the war, but- what little reputation was left to him after the introduction of that measure will have entirely disappeared before this Bill becomes law. </para>
                    <para>An historical personage mentioned in the Scriptures told his servant on one occasion to go out and bid certain people to come to his feast. The servant re-' turned, saying that a number of persons were asked and excused themselves, one saying that he had married a wife and therefore could not come. We can imagine the Treasurer's servant returning to inform him that one person bidden to his taxation feast said, "I have married a wife, and therefore I do not have to come." </para>

They are all to be made to pay taxation under this measure. Invalids will not escape it. I know men of splendid principles, worthy citizens in every way, who, because they are earning, it may be, as much as £2 per week, or just enough to permit them to live decently in these times when the cost of living is so high, refuse to- apply for invalid pensions. I know others who might secure old-age pensions* mat who, because they are animated 'by the sturdy spirit of independence which we are all supposed to so much admire, decline, as long as they can, to enter the Pensions Office. These people are to be penalized under this measure. If one of them earns £100 a year he will have to pay a tax of £5 a year under this Bill. He can only escape it by obtaining an invalid or an old-age pension. We have on many occasions listened to eloquent discourses, from some honorable' senators  opposite, and  from those who support them, contending that the payment of these pensions undermines the independent spirit of the people, but this taxation is calculated to drive people into the Pensions Office. I believe in invalid and old-age pensions, but I can admire the independent spirit of the man who refuses to enter the Pensions Office so long as he is able to keep himself. </para>

                    <para>I do not think that honorable senators can have any logical objection to the continuation' of the super-income tax. The example of the Mother Country has shown us that there the income tax has been imposed- practically as a war tax, and has risen or fallen proportionately to the  money  required for expenditure on naval and military services. I hold the opinion that in this community the income taxation so far imposed will have to be very largely increased. I shall have a word or two to say in connexion with its administration. </para>
                    <para>It is clear that the Commonwealth needs money. The most debatable clause in the Bill, and the clause which was debated in another place, and will probably be debated here, is that imposing a tax upon all single men over twenty-one  years  of age. I have heard somewhere sometime that it is not good for man to live alone. I personally hold that the married "man who begets a family, and educates that family, is by far a better citizen of the Commonwealth than is the very often selfish man who will not take upon himself the obligation of marriage, and continues throughout his life to indulge his selfishness in this direction. </para>
                    <para class="block">Personally I support this tax. I think it is not an imposition, but rightly payable by unmarried men without responsibilities. I believe that most, if not .the whole, of the women of the Commonwealth favour this tax. I point out that to-day there are more women than men in the continent of Australia, and I think it is up to the single men in these parlous times- </para>

                            <para>- It validates the rates that have been collected, irrespective of whether they are right or wrong. It is clear from the schedule that there is unnecessary complications. It may be that a good deal of this legislation has been lifted from an English Act; but I tell the Senate frankly that not one out of 100 business men can calculate his income tax on the system set up by the Department. There are 233,000 income tax payers in the Commonwealth, every one of them taxed upon this complicated system; and necessarily, in thousands of cases, the taxpayers have to interview officials in order to understand their assessment paper when they get it. This seems an unnecessary duplication of work, and multiplication of officials; and if all the Commonwealth business is being carried on like this no wonder our administrative expenditure is advancing by leaps and bounds. There have been many protests throughout the Commonwealth within the last year or two in connexion with the unnecessary work imposed on the business community in filling up a State income paper in January and a Commonwealth income tax paper in June, and the duplication of work and machinery involved in the collection of the taxes. I am bringing this matter before the Senate and the Minister in the hope that in the recess, when Ministers are free from the responsibility of parliamentary sittings, they will take into their serious consideration, not only the standardizing of the income tax returns as between State and Federal Administrations, but their simplification in every possible way, and the necessity for one collection for the whole of the income tax of Australia. </para>

For instance, it will not touch the land shark or the speculator as such, so long as he does not sell, except in so far as he will have to pay a minimum of £5. It will not touch a man who owns an immense area of valuable land so long as he does not dispose of the land. The measure does not reflect credit on the Government, but it is part and parcel of their policy, and as they have a majority pledged to swallow whatever is proposed, I realize that it is not profitable to speak at length in opposition to the measure.

I hope that after the Government have seen the foolishness of the War -time Profits Tax Bill and this Income Tax Bill they will, in the very near future, see the wisdom of adopting the suggestion which I have persistently endeavoured to keep before them. I trust that they will give us a chance to vote for the imposition of a straight-out flat rate on land values, with no exemptions whatever, just as the municipal revenue is raised in New South Wales. If they take that course, then they will do something towards repatriating our soldiers. At present they are doing nothing of a practical character except as regards a proposal to put up their own "screws," which no doubt is a very desirable thing for them to do. I have seen no evidence in the direction of making land available or doing anything of that kind. I intend to oppose the amendments which have been foreshadowed .

It is a curious thing that, while under another measure the profiteers and profitmongers of Australia are to be mulcted in the small penalty of about £300,000 or £400,000 a year - or a good deal less, deducting the cost of collection - the single men of Australia, rich and poor, are to be called upon to pay a sum which is estimated to be over £500,000 a year, though some persons say it will be as much as £600,000 or £700,000. It is a peculiar anomaly that those who are making a profit out of the war by fleecing the people are to be let off with the payment of a trifling percentage of the amount which they are making out of the public, while young men who are earning practically no income are to pay a share of this extra taxation. </para><para>The peculiar feature of clause 6 is that whether a man is in receipt of an income or not, he will have to pay the tax. I do not know how a tax collector can succeed in getting money out of a man who has no income. The clause reads - </para><para>There shall be payable by every male person (whether in receipt of a taxable income or not) who, on the first day of July, one thousand nine hundred and seventeen- </para><para class="block">The point I wish to call attention to is that, whether a man has an income or not, he will still have to pay the tax. That brings me to another phase of the Bill, and that is that it will be an exceedingly difficult and expensive tax to collect. By the time the Government have searched out the bachelors in Australia, considered the various points in the curves and schedules put before us, debited them with the taxation liability, and collected a revenue of £500,000, they will find that a very considerable proportion of that sum will have been absorbed in the expenses of collection. </para><para>Reference has been made to the position of ministers of religion. I certainly think that these persons ought to be exempted from the tax, and for this reason : that in its essence this is a conscription measure. It provided that men eligible for military service who did not enlist should be made to pay an additional tax ; but under the Defence Act, if this Bill had been allowed to retain its original shape, ministers of religion would not have had to pay the proposed tax.Under that Act, they were not liable to be called upon for military service; and therefore they would not have been required to pay this tax. It is a class tax; it falls almost entirely upon ministers of religion under a vow of celibacy. I refer to the ministers of my own denomination, who gave up all hope of domestic joys and family felicities so that they could devote the whole of their time to a sacred calling. These men are especially penalized under this measure, for they are made to pay an extra tax. On this point. I shall have something more to say in Committee. I hope that the amendment foreshadowed to exempt clergymen will be carried. </para></speech>

                        <para>.- My intention is to vote against the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> would have been right had he said that it is still a conscription measure. The Government are not only anxious to get all the money they can out of the poorer sections of the community, but they are endeavouring to " get even " with the young men who did not see eye to eye with what the Government considered to be their duty. Five pounds is a lot of money to take out of the pocket of a person who earns only £100 per year. A man with a wage of £2 per week has not more than just enough to enable him to live, and live pretty poorly, too. My view is that the men who have the biggest stake in the country ought to be called on to pay a lot more to the revenue than they do, but the men who earn only £100 a year ought not to be expected to pay any tax. I think that the tax of £1 a year imposed on such a man was too much. </para>

                            <para>- I point out that other Governments in Australia are also endeavouring to get money out of the poorer section of the community. In Western Australia recently the Government policy included a tax on bachelors to the extent of £10 a year, so if that impost is levied on top of the Commonwealth taxation of £5, the unfortunate single men in Western Australia will be called upon to pay £15 a year. This impost will affect very seriously the parents of those young men who have been apprenticed to trades. A couple of personal friends of mine have sons serving articles of apprenticeship.' The lads wanted to go to the war, but their parents persuaded them to stay, by pointing out that if the war lasted three or four years and they were away from their trade for that length of time, they would be without effective training when they returned, and so be obliged to carry their swags looking for casual employment. These lads are not earning £ 1 per week, yet under this measure they will be called upon to pay special taxation. The penalty, however, will not fall upon them. It will have to be borne by their parents, who are already struggling in order to give their boys a decent training. This kind of taxation is not fair. I notice that it is expected to yield something like £750,000, which is more than the Government tried to extract from the people who are earning huge profits during this war. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> the other day pointed out that thirty employers in Victoria alone had during the last twelve months earned profits to the extent of £5,000,000 over and above the profits of the preceding term. These people, it seems, will not be called upon to make any extra contribution, though the Government, under this Bill, are now seeking to extract special taxation from single men who may be earning only £2 a week. How can they expect to get £5 from such people? I wish them luck, but I think the cost of collection will amount to about half the sum the Government expect to realize. </para>

                        <para>. - The measure as recently introduced could have been fairly defended if it were not for the fact that it did not square with the expressed intention of the Administration not to introduce conscription by any kind of side wind. The argument that those who are eligible for service at. the Front, but who will not avail themselves of the opportunity to serve their country, should be penalized, is undoubtedly a sound one, but as this represented a contravention of the promise that conscription would not be introduced by any subterfuge, the measure was' in some degree remodelled. It is. now, in effect, a bachelor tax, and in normal times a measure of this description would not be regarded as desirable, or as being within the bounds of possibility in Australia. If, apart from the question of conscription, the marriage state is looked upon as particularly beneficial and in the national interest, I suppose a bachelor tax could be logically defended, although I do not know if there is any particular virtue in exalting the married, and condemning the bachelor, state when we seek to make divorce easy of accomplishment. It seems to me that such a situation, taken altogether, presents some ludicrous features. </para>

                    <para>There is, however, one feature of the Bill of which I disapprove, namely, that it aims at sectional taxation, which is not at all desirable. Of course, if we take the line that it is expedient in certain circumstances, and especially during war time, to get money, we need' not be very particular about the method;but I have stipulated for the principle of justice in regard to all taxation, and certainly it would not have been just to impose taxation as designed under the original measure, because it could be construed as the breaking of a pledge, and undoubtedly those who argued that it was a form of economic conscription were not very far wrong. Under this measure, a bachelor will be taxed to the extent of £5, irrespective of his age, or whether he is earning anything in the way of a substantial income. If we can get £5 from him, well and good; but I have had some experience as a legislator in a State at a time when the finances were at a low ebb, and where we had recourse to something very drastic in the way of income tax legislation. I remember one measure, passed through the Tasmanian Parliament, which imposed an " ability tax " of 2s. 6d. upon every person, irrespective of amount of income, and even this minimum impost was found to be a considerable hardship in certain cases. Five pounds is a very substantial sum to take from any man earning even £100 a year. This amount, I presume, approximates closely to the Customs revenue per head of population. I do not know that the measure before us is one of which anybody can feel proud; and I think we will have to do something in. Committee to exempt bachelors of a certain age earning only a very small income, because £5 is too great a levy to make upon old bachelors who may not be in good circumstances. Some men are bachelors by desire, others because they cannot help it, because I suppose a desirable member of the female sex would not be seen dead in the same paddock with them. That is what we might, I think, call inherited misfortune. Many men have attempted many times to get married, but without success, the fair sex having been an accessory before and after the fact, or attempted fact, so to speak. </para>

                    <para>Speaking seriously, I think we shall have to make some provision in Committee to lighten the incidence of taxation in regard to certain elderly bachelors. I am not prepared to give any great praise to the authors of this measure, because, undoubtedly, it selects a certain class of the community for an invidious form of class taxation; but the argument that those who are eligible to go to the war, but who will not go, should be made to contribute towards the cost overshadows everything else. My attitude on this matter is no contravention of my principles in regard to compulsory service, though I would rather see the Administration tackle a big question like that as it should be tackled, and not by the introduction of invidious taxation of this character, which practically involves a poll tax of £5 per head on a certain class of the community. </para>

                        <para>- The day of reckoning is coming very rapidly. I am not at all disturbed by the statement of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that some reason should be given in support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe's</inline> proposal. My reason is that it is unfair to call upon a man who is in receipt of less than £156 a year to contribute any more than he is already contributing to the taxation of the country. In my own State such an individual is already heavily taxed. Consequently I have no hesitation in supporting the exemption. </para>

                    <para>. - - The Vice-President of the Executive Council has stated that I should have assigned some reason in support of my proposal. One very strong reason which actuates me is that at the time we made the exemption of £100 there was no mention of the imposition of another tax upon one section of the community, such as is embodied in this Bill. It was not then proposed to specially tax the lower-paid section of our people. I do. not think the public of Australia will require any better reason than that for the proposed exemption. </para>

                <para>If the honorable member for Wilmet will leave this matter over, it will be given further consideration. There are not very strong views against the exemption of ministers of religion. In fact, clergymen were exempted in the first proposal, but the spirit of that proposal was different from that which is now before honorable members; and, under it, ministers of religion, and others exempted under the Defence Act, could scarcely be regarded as eligible for military service. The present proposal is more of a bachelor tax than anything else, and therefore certain persons previously exempted are not exempted now. If the honorable member will allow the matter to go now, it will be considered in connexion with any possible amendments in another place. In any case, I do not think that the amendment is as wide as the honorable member would desire. There are many members of religious congregations who are not students of theology. </para>

I think that that statement of the Minister constitutes a very good reason why the Committee should agree to the request I have moved. It amounted practically to a statement that the Government would submit an amendment of the kind when the Bill reached the Senate, and I am surprised that that intention has not been referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline></para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators will agree with the statement of the Minister in another place that the view that this exemption should be made is reasonably widespread. I have no desire to prolong the debate on the matter, but I venture to say that, speaking generally, ministers of religion, no matter to what denomination they belong, are not overpaid in this country. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with that statement. They are poorly paid in proportion to the amount of work they perform, and the calls of charity which they have to meet, and to which they respond as well as do the members of any other section of the community. The clergyman's house is in. many cases the first house of call for the poor. Ministers of religion in many cases receive little more than does the ordinary labourer, and there are very heavy calls made upon them. </para>

                        <para>- I wish I could think so. I wish I could believe that their congregations will subscribe more liberally than they do. It must be remembered that these men will be taxed upon their incomes. A minister of religion in receipt of an income of £200 a year may. have so many calls made upon his purse that at the end of one year he finds himself in exactly the same position as he was in at the end of the previous year. These men have adopted a profession in; which they are not out to make money, but to benefit mankind. If they devoted themselves to money-making they might be in a position to pay the highest rate of income tax. They have sacrificed themselves to their profession, and owing to the war they are now in many cases without the support of the greater number of  the wage-earning members of their congregation. Yet we have here a proposal to take 5 per cent, of their reduced incomes without any exemption. I venture to say that it is not the desire of honorable senators to inflict hardship upon this section of the community. </para>

                        <para>- I shall submit a request for such a general exemption. What I ask for now is the exemption of ministers of religion and students of theology. It is proposed not only that they should be taxed under this clause to the minimum extent of 5 per cent., or £5, but also upon their incomes. </para>

                        <para>- Of course he would. If his income were £150 per year he would have "to pay £7 10s. under this Bill, and if it were £200 he would have to pay £10. I wish that, on behalf of the poor he represents, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> would display a little of the zeal and energy which he exhibited on behalf of the wealthy companies ne represents. The honorable senator held up the last taxation Bill for days. Quite ,properly, he was justified in doing so, because it was an iniquitous Bill, but it was the interests of the people who make profits that were affected by that Bill. We are now dealing with a measure affecting the interests of people who have never attempted to make profits, and I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> will be found trying to protect that section of the community against taxation of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- I know of none. The Government have given ho promise in this regard, and, on behalf of the Government, I am here to resist the amendment. The question was put to the Senate whether it believed in a tax which was obviously a tax on bachelors, and the Senate, by an overwhelming majority, said it did. We are asked now to cut out a section of bachelors ; but I have listened in vain for any reason why we should make an exemption in favour of one particular set of them. It is said that the clergy are underpaid. I have to admit that, in many cases, they are. It is a scandal that many congregations ask their ministers to serve them at a wage which would be scorned by an ordinary labourer. </para>

                        <para>- But, because certain people desiring the services of a minister are not prepared to pay him a reasonable minimum wage, we are asked, as a National Government, to subsidize his income on behalf of a congregation that refuses to do its duty. If  Ave  exempt clergymen on the ground that they are underpaid - as I admit that many of them are - can we ignore the claims of an equally deserving class, the school teachers? I know instances where school teachers can put their emoluments against those of many of the clergy, and the comparison would certainly show that they are not in any better position. </para>

                    <para>. - - We are not asked by the amendment to subsidize religion. All we are asked to do is to avoid discrimination. The Bill certainly does discriminate unfairly, because the ministers of religion of a fairly large section of the people of Australia are prevented by the doctrines of their church from marrying. The doctrines of other sects do not place this restriction on their ministers; and, therefore, those of their ministers who have married will escape this part of the Bill, whereas not one of the ministers of the other church to which I refer can escape it. Fortunately, there has always been in this country the broadest spirit of tolerance. Sometimes we see intolerance displayed, and instances of sectarianism, but no question of sectarianism is involved in an amendment of this kind, because everybody knows that the ministers of one particular church are not allowed to marry. That church probably represents from, one-fourth to one-fifth of the people of Australia, and to .the extent to which- its ministers are taxed that particular religion is discriminated against, although I do not say it was done wittingly or  thinkingly   by those who framed the Bill. The -very Constitution under which it was possible for this Bill to be brought forward lays it down as a principle, which we have all admitted is a good one, that there shall be no discrimination between denominations in this country. Section 116 of the Constitution reads - </para>

                    <para>. - None of those who know me would say that I have any set against the church in general or any church in particular. I am a member of a church, and consequently would be very eager to deal fairly and legitimately with churches generally, but we may reasonably ask why any minister of religion should be exempt. A minister of religion belongs to the loftiest and noblest of all callings. At the same time, he is a citizen of Australia, and, having full citizen rights, be ought not to be exempt in any way from citizen obligations. There are no people who more often tell the population of Australia that those who have privileges have also duties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in answering the argument that the exemption should be granted because ministers of religion were not properly paid, replied, quite naturally, that to grant them an exemption on that ground would be to give a State subsidy to religion ; but now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0'</inline> Keefe has raised a new argument, that the tax is a discrimination against a particular church because the priests of. that church are not allowed to marry. In the Methodist Church, to which I belong, a student cannot be married until he becomes a minister. For some years he is a probationer, and if he marries during that period he is not admitted into full connexion with the church.. On the same lines, it might, therefore, be argued that the Bill discriminates against him. While a probationer he is paid a minimum wage, and if he passes his examinations at the end of three years he is admitted into full connexion with the church, and can marry then if he chooses. When young fellows leave this country to fight, they fight for Protestants and Catholics alike. There is no discrimination there. They fight equally for the Protestant minister and the Roman Catholic priest. </para>

If that be so, the men who go to the Front from Australia go to fight for the liberty and freedom of all ministers of religion in this country, without discrimination. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite another point. The honorable senator now says that, because under the Defence Act ministers of religion are exempted from going to the Front, therefore, under this Bill, we have no right to tax them. If that argument is sound, then decidedly ministers of religion should be exempted from liability to pay, not only the income tax, but also Customs duties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> I am sure, will agree with me that ministers of religion do now pay taxation through the Customs House. Consequently, although they  are exempted from military service under the Defence Act, still they have to pay their taxation in every other way at present. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline>
                    has stated that this is a kind of sectional or class tax, because a large number of the ministers can marry if they please, whereas others cannot. Why should ministers of religion who marry, and who, because they have families, have to pay taxation heavily at the Customs House be called upon to pay this special tax if certain other ministers of religion are exempted ? Money has to be raised to prosecute the war, and if ministers of religion have money, I do not see why they should not pay their share of taxation the same as anybody else in the community.

                <para>I made an interjection in regard to the case of medical students. The doctor, I submit, does a great deal of good in this country. In" many instances lie is very philanthropic. Doctors compel some patients to pay, but, on the other hand, they attend a large number without making any charge. If we are to exempt theological students from this tax, I see no reason why we  should not exempt medical students also. </para>

I am against the exemption of men simply because they are ministers of religion. They are all citizens of this country, possessing privileges and- rights and enjoying the protection of the law and the Army, and, if they have the money, I do not see why they should not be called upon to pay this tax the same as anybody else. </para>

                    <para>. - I can quite understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> should be a little surprised at my taking an interest iD ministers of religion and students of theology. As regards the students, it was not my intention to submit the request as it is now worded. I departed from my original intention, in order to exactly fit it in with the amendment which the Minister then in charge of the Bill elsewhere <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> promised would , be considered here. I venture- to suggest that his statement to the other House was considered by its members as tantamount to saying, " Let the Bill go through here, and the amendment will be put in in another place." That was my only reason for submitting the request in its present form. My original intention was to move that teachers preparing students to follow the profession of religion, and the students themselves, should be exempted. We have exempted these persons from the provisions of the Defence Act. Surely the duty of fighting is a duty which belongs to all! </para>

                <para>When the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> says that to exempt these men is to subsidize religion, he is straining at an . argument. It is nothing of the kind. No subsidy is offered. All the Parliaments in Australia have encouraged the teaching of religion because of the advantages which the State must necessarily derive from such instruction. I am not opposing the tax on account of the pay which the ministers receive. They are not working for pay; their reward, I understand, is to come in another place. No man can say that a person who spends the whole of his life in religious teaching is not devoting his time to benefit the community as a whole. " I care not what religion he teaches. For <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to argue that because we ask for an exemption on behalf of a clergyman on account of the sacrifice he has made, is making, and will make, we seek a subsidy to religion is merely to strain after effect. It is nothing of the kind. It is a very proper recognition, and one which is made by many Parliaments, of what we owe to those who have given up their lives to improve the conditions of the community. </para>
                <para>I shall press my request, though I shall be quite prepared if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> objects to the words " theological students," to substitute other words. I recognise that it is loose drafting, but, as I said, I worded the amendment in that way to fit in with the promise which the Minister in charge of the Bill made in another place. I am quite prepared, however, for the amendment to be altered and applied to those who are being prepared by ministers of religion as well as to ministers generally. I ask the Government to consider this request, coming from the Opposition side, in the same way as they treated the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn.</inline> Simply because they happen to possess a majority, I do not think that all reasonable proposals from this side should be rejected. I welcomed the way in which the Minister accepted the other request, which, in my opinion, was a desirable and fair one, and it would be quite becoming on his part to extend like consideration, not only to this side, but to many of the Government's followers in the other House, because to them his colleague conveyed the idea that this exemption would be made in the Senate. </para>

                    O'LOGHLIN (South Australia) [5.41]. - In my second-reading speech I made the particular point I desired to make. In connexion with this measure there are two objects which may be put forward as laudatory. One is that as a conscription measure it was intended to induce by penal exaction men to go to the Front, and the other is that it was intended to induce bachelors to marry by putting a tax upon them. In regard to ministers of religion the first point will not apply, because under the Defence Act they are exempt from military service. The imposition of a penalty upon them as bachelors, therefore, will have no effect in inducing them to go to the Front. The second object of inducing single men to marry will not be achieved in the case of a large number of ministers who are under a vow of celibacy. The two particular grounds on which the tax may be justified in the case of ministers of religion will not apply there. I am very much surprised at the Government opposing the requested amendment, because I take it that the virtual promise given in another place by the Minister then in charge of the Bill
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline>
                    was not given without consulting his colleagues there. The only inference we can draw is that the Minister in charge of the Bill in the Senate
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline>
                    is the one responsible for blocking the amendment.

                    <para>. - I hope that the Ministry will not be led away by the flimsy statements made by those who desire to see this request carried. It is quite true that ministers of religion are exempted by the Defence Act from taking up arms. It is also quite true that, not very long ago, the Senate spent almost the whole of a night sitting to prevent the war census cards from being worded in such a way as to disclose the values of the lands held by the churches throughout Australia. The churches feared that, as the war proceeded, they might be called upon to pay taxation in proportion to the enormous land values which they are alleged to hold. </para>

                <para>I have seen no petition from ministers of religion asking to be exempted from this tax. I am at a loss to Understand why any one should seek to exempt anybody. I am opposed to exemptions all along the line. But if the exemption of £156 had been carried it would have operated on all classes alike. . It would have operated on the rouseabouts, and also on the clergy for whom some honorable senators are extremely solicitous. I am about tired of this continuous solicitation on behalf of those who can very well afford to look after themselves. I am not here to look after those persons at all. The men who mainly sent me here receive very much less wages, and suffer very much greater hardship than do the majority of the clergy. The rouseabouts, the casual labourers, the men who milk cows, the men who dig potatoes, the men who are mining, and doing the hard work of the country, should be considered rather than men, like the Archbishop of Canterbury, say, who is a follower of the Lowly Nazarene, at £10,000 a year. I have no sympathy for that type of gentleman. </para>

The position occupied by school teachers was also raised during this debate. Why should not they be exempt, too ? They get a number of privileges which the ordinary " rouseabout " does not enjoy, because they never fail to bring their requests before Parliament in the many ways at their disposal. The clergymen of this country are subject to the income tax, but if they have no income they do not pay. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; we will put it that way. I am loath to make any deliverance at any time on matters concerning religion, and, generally, I preserve a discreet silence in relation to that subject, because I hold, with Tennyson, that a man should be sensible of his own imperfections, and make very substantial efforts to remedy them, before he talks about religion. But I cannot hide from myself the salient fact that this is nominally,, and in some measure practically, a Christian country. The Legislature of Australia opens its proceedings with prayer, by the Presiding Officer repeating the petition which the Saviour of Mankind enjoined upon human frailty to the Great Ruler of the Universe. I have a very strong conviction that every honorable senator regards that petition with every respect, but I am sorry to say that in our treatment of this question of exempting ministers of religion from this special taxation we seem to have introduced a very sordid element. There is no doubt that the profession of ministers of religion - if profession it can be called - is substantially differentiated from every other human calling. Our Defence Act makes discrimination by exempting ministers of religion from military service. In regard to this war, I have read many articles, as no doubt have other senators, dealing with phases of human thought in connexion with the war : It is said rightly or wrongly - I do not know, because I am a poor theologian, and  naturally I am rather like  Gallio,  careless in matters of religion - that the attitude .of the human race towards religion will be very much conditioned by this war, that men who have been materialistic "now regard human life as something very unsubstantial indeed. After the war men will . fix their thoughts for some generations on what I might call the higher plane of life, on the problems of time, chance, destiny, and so on. </para>

                <para>It is inconsistent and wrong, as was shown in a recent article in the- <inline font-style="italic">Spectator,</inline> to consider the profession of a minister of religion -as something by which an individual gains a livelihood, or as a profession adopted for that purpose, and I venture to say that not one senator is so devoid of the instincts of a gentleman as to suggest to any minister of religion that he follows his sacred calling simply because he expects to make a living out of it. </para>

If we believe what has been written regarding the esteem in which ministers of religion are held bv our soldiers at the Front, I will go so far as to say that if the men knew this question of exempting ministers from the operation of this measure was under discussion, they would vote overwhelmingly in favour of this course. </para>

                        <para>- Then we have been misled concerning the affection which we have been led to assume is entertained by our soldiers for the ministers representing the different denominations at the Front. Ministers of religion stand on a higher plane than frail and suffering humanity. We have been told - and the honorable senator may read of this in the works of Macaulay - that, during the great plague in London, when even members of the profession of medicine abandoned their patients, and when husbands deserted their wives, there were still to be found alongside the wretched pallets of the sick, ministers of religion, offering to the plague-stricken people that . consolation which the Divine Founder of our religion had enjoined them and 'their successors to administer. I very rarely have anything to do with ministers of religion, but I respect all of them. I have enjoyed their hospitality, and whenever opportunity afforded I have' reciprocated. I find excellent ministers of religion in every denomination from the newest sect, the Salvation Army, -right on' to the oldest Christian denomination. I have even foregathered with Mohammedan priests, and, despite the intolerance which they are supposed to exhibit towards Christians- </para>

                    <para>.- Personally, I fail to see any reason why ministers of religion should be exempted from the payment of this tax if they are in receipt of £200 a year. There is one duty that we all owe to our country, the duty of defending it upon every possible occasion. In the land from which I hail, ministers of religion themselves recognise that they have but one duty to perform, namely, to protect the liberties of their people and their religion. The individuals whom honorable senators opposite wish to relieve of this tax would not be prepared to go and " do their bit " even if the country demanded that they should actively assist in its protection. But they are quite satisfied to see others go and bleed, whilst they remain behind exempt from this taxation. I am not referring to the ministers of any particular denomination, but to the shirkers. Surely if ministers of religion are not prepared to fight for the Empire they ought at least to be willing to contribute their share of taxation to enable our wounded warriors to be comforted when they return to us. </para>

                        <para>- 1 am very glad of that, because I can assure the honorable senator that our soldiers at the Front appreciate their chaplains, just as they appreciate any brave man. But the reason for the esteem in which these chaplains are held is not that they happen to be ministers of religion. It is because many of them have exhibited as much bravery as have ordinary military officers. Under this Bill, chaplains at the Front will not be called upon to pay the proposed tax. In the 'course of his remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> stated that ministers of religion are exempted from fighting under our Defence Act. It is true that they are exempt from compulsory service, but, personally, I am strongly opposed to that provision in the Statute. There is nothing to prevent ministers of religion  from enlisting. A recruiting sergeant is waiting at the Town Hall, who will enroll ministers of religion with as much alacrity as he will enroll other members of the community. In the unit in which I served abroad there was one man who was formerly in charge of a church. He joined the battery as a private, and worked himself up to a lieutenant. I refer to Lieutenant Hare, of Queensland, Who .was afterwards killed at the Front. It is quite' competent for other ministers of religion to enlist as he did. I hope that the request will not be carried, and that ministers of religion will be called upon to do their duty. I have never supported the Government with more pleasure than I do on this occasion. </para>

                    <para>. - Possibly owing to some affinity of character, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> fashioned his latest speech on the model of the serpent, by putting its sting in its tail. He concluded his remarks by a reference to a speech alleged to have been made elsewhere by a colleague of mine, and assumed from that deliverance that the Government were favorable to the acceptance of his amendment, and that I alone was opposing it. He directed public attention to the fact that, whilst other Ministers were favorable to it, I alone was in opposition to it. Let me say that the views which I have expressed to-day are those of the Ministry. They are the views at which the Government arrived in the ordinary way before this Bill was presented , to the other branch of the Legislature. In speaking here to-day, not only did I express my own individual views, but I spoke as one who voiced the opinions of his colleagues. </para>

That Bill he afterwards withdrew. I propose to glance at the arguments which have been advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain, Senator Thomas,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant.</inline> They are all prepared to vote against exempting ministers of religion from the proposed tax. Senators Plain and Thomas voted to exempt doctors and lawyers from the operation of the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill, and yet they now revolt against exempting ministers of religion from this tax. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> was also prepared to exempt these professional' classes. Within the present session we have passed a Bill which will exempt professional men, such as lawyers and doctors, from taxation upon excess profits made during war time. </para>

In view of the present high cost of living, it will be agreed that an income of £156 a year is not too high to be exempt from this taxation. Many of the men liable to taxation under the Bill; as it stands, could not have gone to the war under any conditions. Many are physically unfit for active service, and those between the ages of forty-five and sixty are over the age at which men would be accepted for active service. Many of these men have persons dependent upon them. A man in receipt of an income of £156 a year may have to maintain a widowed mother and three or four children. He must struggle if those children are to be educated in such a way as to fit them for the battle of life.

                        <para>- I am pointing out that a Commissioner may be removed from his office, and a partisan Commissioner appointed to do the work of a partisan Government. I am not making any accusation against any particular individual. I submit a request for the exemption from this taxation of men in receipt of incomes not exceeding £156 a year. Surely we could agree upon such a request as that. The levy of taxation upon such an amount of income should not. be left to the discretion of anybody. If the Committee do not approve of such an exemption, their very disapproval may be regarded by the Commissioner of Taxes as expressing a desire on the part of honorable senators that men receiving any salary should be taxed, whether their income reaches the living wage or not. I do not think that any honorable senators will say that an income of £156 a year is more than barely sufficient for a man to live on, in view of the present high cost of living. </para>

If I thought the Government would accept that, I would be prepared not to go any further. If the Government are not willing to show a spirit of reasonableness, and do the right thing by a section of the community which can very ill afford to pay a tax of £5, I shall press my first proposal. It may be argued that these people can obtain relief under another clause, but the time of the officers who have to deal with appeals 'of that sort will he saved if my proposal is adopted, and there will be a 'great saving to the States by the Act prescribing definitely an exemption of £156. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is quite right in  saying that no one can reasonably complain of the time occupied so far in discussing the measure. I quite appreciate that honorable senators have not spoken with any desire to consume time, but I have not heard sufficient to induce me to recognise  the soundness of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Gardiner's</inline> proposal in view of the purpose and scope of the Bill. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I shall have to move later to re-commi't the Bill to move a request for an amendment that. I should have proposed before. </para>
                <para class="block">Paragraph, c exempts any man who is permanently incapacitated for work. The amendment I wish to have made is to add " and is in receipt of a gross income not exceeding £150." That shows that the Government are desirous of preventing any cases of undue hardship without providing avenues of escape for others. It has a bearing on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> proposal. As paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> stands now, a man permanently incapacitated for work will be exempt, although he might be a millionaire. </para>
                <para>There may be, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> points out, certain people who think they can ill afford to pay this tax, but his proposal would also exempt the sons of quite rich people. There are a considerable number of men whose sons are working for them, but are not in receipt of any fixed salary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> pictured a father of. this class saying to his boy, " You know that all I have will come to you afterwards, and you need not bother, therefore, about a salary." Young men of that kind are well off, although not getting a fixed income, and I do not think any one wants to exempt them. Personally, I do not, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's'</inline> proposal would do it. There are in Australia a considerable number of well-to-do farmers whose boys never receive anything in the nature of a fixed income, but what they make, or save their father in wages, is really going into the family stocking. They  are quite entitled to full wages.' and could not be employed by any one else at less than £3 per week, but the father only gives them a little pocket money. At the same time, they are really well off, arid are not entitled to any exemption, and could pay the tax without any inconvenience to themselves. The request, therefore, goes beyond what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> indicated as having in his mind - the exemption of those who can ill afford to pay. </para>
                <para>There is also a proviso in the Bill that where any one can show the Commissioner that the tax represents an undue, unnecessary, or unfair hardship, the Commissioner can relieve him of his obligation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> did not dispute that that could be done, but conjured up a whole series of bogies. Speaking no doubt from his experience of past Governments, he imagined a Government being wicked enough to use corrupt influence with the Commissioner in order to have favoritism shown, so that a political friend would get exemption where a political opponent would not. It is rather late in the day to raise an objection of that kind, because the, same Commissioner as we have now has been exercising the same power under the main Income Tax Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> found no fault with that Bill when it was passing  through this Chamber, but assented to the expedient, recognising that Parliament cannot lay down any provision which may not in certain cases inflict a hardship which no one desires to see imposed. In order to meet these special cases we have given the Commissioner, in quite a number of cases, power to intervene where the taxpayer shows that the tax would fall with crushing effect upon himself or his dependants. The same safety valve is in this' Bill, and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> proposal would let out, not only the men he wants to save, but also the sons of wealthy people whom I do not think he wishes to see escape, and as those he pleads for are provided for in the proviso I have quoted, I ask the Committee not to agree to his request. </para>

                    <para>. - - I am satisfied that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has no. desire to exempt the sons of wealthy people who are not receiving a salary, but who know that eventually they will come into a fortune, nor do I, nor any other honorable senator, wish to exempt them, because they certainly ought to pay. They have the. ability to pay through their father. I do not think the request would let them out, because in the" aggregate the same amount of taxation would be paid by the father on his enhanced income. If he paid each of his sons a salary his taxable income would be so much less, and he would pay less tax, but each of his sons would pay the tax, so in the long run it would amount to the same thing. </para>

The exemption is a fair one, and if I thought there was the slightest hope of getting support, I would propose two further exemptions, which I think equally fair. It does not seem to be much use, however, because the Minister appears to be determined to stick to every line of his Bill, except that he has accepted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn's</inline> proposal. </para>

We should be doing only the fair thing if we removed that discrimination and exempted also those who have been anxious to go and have been rejected for medical reasons. </para>

He has a brother at the Front, and is just as anxious to get there as any one could be. He said to me, "Either they let me get to the Front, or they put me in gaol ; they are not going to get a fiver out of me. Why should I be put on a different footing from the men who have gone to the Front, while I want to go? Why should I not be exempt the same as the man who has enlisted for foreign service and been sent back as medically unfit after a voyage lasting a week or two, and the same as the man who has gone to some little part outside Australia on service and then come back, declared medically unfit, although he has never seen active service?" </para>

I have no doubt that before some of. them were fortunate enough to get married they did make an honorable offer, and were refused. It would be only fair to exempt from this tax a man who has tried to get married, and who, through no fault of his own, has been rejected. I do not suppose that it would be of any use to move for amendment to that effect, because it is unlikely that it would be accepted by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen).</inline></para>

                <para>In my opinion the exemptions which the Commissioner is given power to deal with are those which precede this subclause, and not those which follow it. At any rate, it will be wise to make an exemption up to £156, and it will not do an injury to anybody. A man who is getting only £156 a year is not a proper subject of taxation for the purpose of repatriation. In 1915, the incomes over £156 amounted to £124,000,000. Why should we tax to the extent of £5 or £7 10s. a year a man. who has only £156 to live on, when there is available a huge sum which could be taxed to provide ample money, not only for the purpose of repatriation, but almost for the conduct of the war? </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to say a few words on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> statement that the proviso to sub-clause 1 does not give the Commissioner power to exempt hard cases from the tax. The words used in the proviso are, " tax payable under the preceding provisions of this section." It is the preceding provisions in sub-clause 1 which impose the tax. That is where the Commissioner gets a discretion to say whether the tax shall be remitted wholly or in part. There is no need for the Commissioner to have a discretionary power in regard to the provisions following subclause 1, because Parliament itself will have stated what is to .be exempted there. The proviso to sub-clause 1 gives the Commissioner absolute authority, under certain conditions, to remit the tax referred to in the preceding portion of the subclause. </para>

                        <para>- Speaking  from a limited range of experience, I dispute that statement. If, however, it is impossible for a single man to live on £3 a week, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> declares, there must be thousands of married men with an income a little over that sum, and with a family of from two to five children, who have a much stronger claim for exemption from taxation. We have to maintain a sense of proportion in this matter. While the heart  of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> evidently bleeds for a single man with an income of £3 a week, I ask the Committee to take into account the fact that, unless such a man is called upon to pay some share of the taxation to-day, there must be an added impost on the man who is getting that or a little more, and who also has to maintain a wife and a growing family. </para>

                        <para>- I ask honorable senators to consider that the Bill in no sense imposes a penalty on a bachelor. No, matter what tax is proposed, it will always be received with a howl of indignation from the particular class on whom it is to fall. A bachelor in this country, hard as his lot may be, is under lighter disabilities, and makes lees contribution to the Treasury than does a married man. Every time the wife of a man goes to buy something, he is a contributor to the revenue through the Customs, and is making a contribution from which a bachelor is exempted. We say to the bachelor, " Owing to the stress of war, we ask you to level up that difference a little." </para>

                    <para>. - I feel it necessary to support the request, because in all our legislation we should be concerned with the practical, and I do not think it is possible satisfactorily to make a levy of £5 on any individual earning only £104 a year. Earlier in the debate, I informed the Senate that I had had some experience in Tasmania of the operation of a minimum tax of 2s. 6d. on all individuals earning £80 a year. In that case, it was found practically impossible to levy the. tax satisfactorily, small though the minimum amount was. It is all very well to start out with the abstract statement that every bachelor should pay; but a man whose earning capacity is not more than £104 a year in the present state of affairs in Australia, is, I think, of very little military value; and we know, of course, that originally the military situation was kept in view when this Bill was drafted. </para>

Given other opportunities, such a man might be able to earn £1,000 a year; but we have to consider what his actual earnings are at the present time.

                    <para>. - I see both the fairness and the unfairness of the proposal. It is quite fair to say  that  a man struggling for an existence should not have that struggle intensified by the imposition of taxation; but I point out  that  provision is already made for such cases in the power given to the Commissioner. Those men are already relieved under the provisions of this Bill. But I can see the injustice of relieving from taxation all those who ought to pay; and the same argument applies in the case of a man earning £104 a year as in the case of a man earning £156, that is, the large number of sons of wealthy persons who are not in receipt of any fixed income. </para>

But my honorable friend erected a fence behind which they could shield themselves. We wanted to send them to the Front, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> would not allow us to do so. The amendment would undoubtedly exempt a number of men who ought to be relieved from taxation. But I say that they will be relieved by another provision of this Bill. The amendment, going beyond that, would relieve a number of men who are well able to pay the tax. If some of them growl at it, as they will, may I remind them that those who have enlisted have given up much more than £5 per year in wages alone. It is fair to assume that the men who have volunteered for service abroad were earning, on an average, 10s. per day, and that they have .gone to the Front, perhaps to lose their lives, for 6s. per day. </para>

I venture to say that his comparison between the sons of wealthy farmers who might escape this taxation and the class for whom I am pleading was an unfair one. There is a far larger number of poor men in Australia who would benefit by the proposed exemption than there are sons of wealthy farmers who would escape the tax. If the request were agreed to, I venture to say that it would exempt about 75 per cent, of the poorer section of the community as against, perhaps, 25 per cent, of the wealthy farmers' sons. I quite agree that the latter should not escape taxation. I am not pleading for them, but for the poorer sections of the community who are eking out a, miserable subsistence on £2 per week, and many of whom are supporting, perhaps, an aged father or mother. I am also pleading for the blind men to whom. I referred a few minutes ago, and who are not getting £104 a year. </para>

                        <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> has stated that honorable senators upon this side of the chamber desire to help the sons of wealthy persons to escape their obligations under this Bill. If that be the case, there is an easy remedy to apply. The honorable gentleman declared that these individuals have no fixed incomes. I presume that he had in mind the sons of men who are given money in order that they may enjoy themselves either at the races or elsewhere, but who do not come forward each Saturday night to collect wages. If the Government are sincere in their desire to reach these men they cannot do it by means of the taxation proposed. In any case, their fathers will pay the tax. But there is another way of getting at these gentlemen through their fathers. Why have not the Government the courage to tax the estates of these persons up to their proper limit instead of proposing to tax poor fellows who are only able to earn £104 annually? No man in this country can live decently on that income. I hope that honorable senators opposite will recall the days when they were working for wages. They must recognise that an impost of this character is not a reasonable one. It partakes of a vindictiveness which I did not expect to emanate from any Government. </para>

                        <para>- It does not matter whether there are 2 per cent, or 20 per cent. I am dealing with the facts as I know them to exist. Where is the justice of the proposal that is embodied in the Bill? Taxation should be founded upon justice, and there is no justification for taxing men whose earnings are inadequate to support them under reasonable conditions. I know many men who are physically unfitted to do any but the lightest work, such as taking tickets at the entrance to the Show Ground or at football matches or theatres. These men are employed, perhaps, for only a few hours per day. Then there are quite a number whose physical infirmities prevent them working more than two or three days per week. Under this Bill, the blind, the deaf and the dumb will be taxed. Surely we should allow them to escape, and place the burden on the shoulders of those who are well able to bear it. I trust the Committee will agree to what I regard as a reasonable amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to know how the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> is going to collect this tax. Is he going to adopt the time-payment system? There are plenty of men in the community who, if they wish to purchase a suit of clothes, are obliged to go to the cheapjack and pay for it at the rate of 2s. per week. When they need a pair of boots they have to pay for them at the rate of1s. per week. Do the Government propose to accept the payment of this tax by weekly instalments? I know of many men who do not earn anything like £104 per year, but who, under this Bill, will be obliged to pay a tax of £5 annually. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur</inline> has told us that a man can support a wife and four children on 27s. per week, and he has enumerated all their articles of diet in support of his contention. But <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur</inline> has not tried the experiment himself. I would like it to be shown by honorable senators opposite how men who are earning only £104 per year are going to pay £5 a year in taxation. There are £35,000.000 lying in the banks this year, and we ought to be able to get £20,000,000 of it. </para>

Only last week the Minister of Education in New South Wales told the school teachers of that great State, with its " National " Government, that it was impossible to increase their salaries from £132 to £156 per year on account of shortage of money. Our teachers are an intelligent section of the community, and are doing good work in the education of young Australians. A teacher receiving £132 a year for going out into the bush to educate Australian boys and girls will be called upon to pay this£5. </para>

There they have universal military service. There we find a mother and her children leaving their house to go into two furnished rooms, because the husband and father is at the war. There we find women going into the coal -yards with perambulators in the winter to get a little coal to keep their children warm. There we have a Government finding 25 per cent. of an annual expenditure of £2,000,000,000. There we find millions of soldiers fighting for their country for 1s. 6d. per day. There we find necessary commodities much higher in price than they are in Australia. Then our thoughts come back to this much favoured land, a land which has never seen the foot of any invader, and has never seen a drop of blood spilt in bloody warfare, and yet we have honorable senators opposite hesitating about putting a tax upon single men to the extent of1s. l1d. per week in order to bring home to them the fact that there is a war on. </para>

                <para>Honorable senators, in arguing in the way they have done, show that they lack a proper sense of proportion. I would bid them go to the Mother Country and realize the sacrifices she is making, not only for herself, but for her children across the seas. I bid them for the sake of the <inline font-style="italic">morale</inline> of Australia to bring it home to everybody, single men included, that it is up to them to " do their bit" to enable us to carry on. </para>
                <para>This Bill provides that a man shall pay1s.11d. per week towards the cost of carrying on the war, if he is not married, and has not taken upon himself the duties of citizenship, and has no one dependent on him. It seems to me that we have heard too much of this sort of thing, when we have honorable senators opposite talking of the poor single men who cannot live on £2 per week. Let us look at what is being done on the other side of the world. I unhesitatingly assert that a single man earning £2 per week is as well, or better off, than is a married man with a family in receipt of £3 per week. I ask honorable senators opposite what has become of the Wages </para>
                <para class="block">Boards and Arbitration Courts when they tell us that single men in Australia can earn only <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per week. I thought that 8s. per day was the minimum rate throughout Australia for single men over twenty-one years of age. </para>
                <para>It is a pity that honorable senators opposite have nob a proper sense of proportion, and that they do not realize what is going on in connexion with the war. I bid them look across the ocean and see what France and the Mother Country are doing for  US  If they do so they can no longer object to single men being taxed to the extent of ls. lid. per week to help us forward in the successful prosecution of the war. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> use of the phrase " a proper sense of proportion " has brought me to my feet. He persisted in suggesting that honorable senators on this side lack a proper sense of proportion. Why, only a few hours ago practically, this chamber rang with the eloquence of the honorable senator in his efforts to save from proper taxation his rich friends throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. When we were dealing with the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill, the honorable senator had a sheaf of amendments submitted to the Committee, and if they had been carried, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would not have known the Bill which he had introduced. Now we are chided by this advocate of the millionaires and wealthy classes of Australia, whom he tried to save from legitimate taxation on excess war profits, with lacking a proper sense of proportion because we are endeavouring to- exempt from this taxation poor unfortunate single men in Australia who are getting only <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per week. </para>

                <para>The honorable senator has drawn a pathetic picture of what is taking place in France. We are all aware of the sad facts. We know the tragedy that is taking place over there, and we know some of the tragic circumstances to be found in the homes of the poor people of Great Britain. But if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> will look nearer home, he will find that there are tragic circumstances here in this city of Melbourne as a result of the war. The honorable senator talks about a wife and her children having to go from her home in London into two furnished rooms because her husband is at the Front fighting in this war. I notice that a question was asked in another place, in connexion with which a statement appears in to-day's newspapers, about a poor woman who, having three or four children to keep, was unable to pay her rent, because her husband was fighting in France. She had a notice to quit placed on her door, and was ordered out of her home. That happened in Melbourne, not in London. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has no word of pity for that case. Where is his sense of proportion? I did think that he was a man of different calibre.  He would tax the poor ; he would make the working classes of this country do all the fighting, and would allow the rich friends whom he represents in this Chamber to escape all taxation, and then he asks honorable senators on this side why they have no sense of proportion. </para>

I never thought, when I was elected to the Senate, that I should come into contact with men who would endeavour to make party political capital out of the blind, the deaf and dumb, and the lame, as honorable senators opposite have done this evening. I must express my disgust at having had to listen to such outbursts. I will not believe that any Government, or any Commissioner of Taxes, would be so base as to insist that this taxation should be imposed upon unfortunate blind, lame, or deaf and dumb persons. I again express my disgust that any members of the Senate should endeavour to make party political capital out of those in our midst who are afflicted in the way described by honorable senators opposite. </para>

                <para>We are proposing now the exemption of men in receipt of a very moderate income from this exorbitant taxation. What would be said if we applied the same rate of taxation to men whose incomes are very much greater, or if we applied it to our own salaries. Why should we not do so? What if the taxation were applied to married as well as to single men in this country? If the war is the cause of this taxation, let us meet the situation as honorable men, and see that the taxation necessary shall rest upon the shoulders best able to bear it. The man to whom only a few pounds are left to pay for the necessaries of life is to be called upon to pay at least £6 a year under this Bill, whilst the rich, who live in comfort and luxury, are let off with the lightest of taxes. For the year ending 1915 Australian incomes over and above £156 a year amounted to no less than £124,000,000. The amount increased in 1916, and I venture to say that it will be greater still in 1917. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> who comes here to represent wealth- </para>

We may yet meet again. When I listened to the enthusiasm with which he attacked honorable senators on this side because we wished to exempt men whose incomes are not sufficiently large to justify this exorbitant taxation, I compared his attitude with the efforts which he made last week when he won the approval of all honorable senators by the way in which he bent himself to the task of understanding the Bill which proposed the taxation of his own particular class.  His  efforts on that occasion were worthy of him. We know what is behind this Bill. If the Government get the money, no matter from whom, it will be a very good excuse for not taxing that section of the community to which they look for support. </para>

                <para class="block">Apparently, it does not matter to the Government whether a man earns £100 or £5, they will tax him. If he earns only £5 during the year, and the Commissioner of Taxes is fortunate enough to find him, the laws of the country will empower him to gather that £5 into the Treasury. Seeing that the Government have descended to the depth of wanting to collect taxation from a man who does not earn a living wage - and I claim that £104 is not a living wage - I want to see how far they are really prepared to go. That is why I move this exemption. Anybody can tell a very telling story that would cause quite a lot of feeling in any audience with regard to the conduct of the war, and we have heard stories of that kind during this discussion. I have always regarded myself as a man of a practical nature, without very much sentiment about me; but I could not imagine a Government wanting to tax a man who earned less than a living wage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> said the tax would be only ls. lid. a week. In the case of men earning £50. it will only be half that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> as a business man, and the rest of those on the Government side, will understand that taxation vanishes altogether when the amount collected is not as much as it costs to gather. It will cost the Government a great deal more to collect- this tax than they are likely to get from it under the Bill as it now stands. They will not be able to collect it at all on incomes of £50 and under if my request is agreed to, and my purpose in moving it is only to get the Government! down to where I think they ought to be- to the lowest depths of degradation in regard to the legislation of this country. I want it to go out to the country that the Government are prepared to tax the lame, the halt, and the blind, and, in fact, to tax everything but the proposition which ought to be taxed. Almost every man on the other side, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> in particular, comes into this Chamber representing the moneyed interests of Australia. I will pay <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> thecompliment of saying they did a very good job when they sent him here, because he puts up a very fine fight. After all, he is only doing what that class of people always do. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, on the general principle that I vote against a hostile Government every time; and if the honorable senator will help me to ' ' out ' ' them, I shall vote with him again. I should like to see those gentlemen put as much energy into protecting the weaker section of the community as they are putting into protecting the people who really do not need protection. There is quite enough wealth in this country to pay the whole of its indebtedness, even that which is likely to be incurred in the present tremendous struggle, and it is nearly time that wealth was called upon to pay it. </para>

                <para>The working people, the men who have earned the smallest wages, are doing the fighting in this war. They are doing all that it is possible for men to do to save all those things which we prize, and it ill becomes the Government to get down below those who are able to earn £2 per week. Fancy a man who cannot earn £100 a year being asked to go to the Front. My opinion is that men who cannot earn that amount would be no good at the Front. When the Government expect to collect the tax from men who can only earn £100 a year in this country, they are getting down to the state of having to scrape up money from those whom they ought not to expect to pay, from sources from -which they should never expect revenue to meet circumstances such as we are now going through. There are heaps of wealth in Australia from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and the Government can collect all the taxation they need. That is the source from which they should raise it, instead of proposing paltry things such as the collection of a tax of ll1/2d. a week from a man earning £50, or1s. l1d. a week from a man earning £100, which is not a living wage for a white man in this country. Any Government that descends to paying for the war or necessary administration by means of taxation from sources of that kind ought to be kicked out by the people at the first opportunity; and I believe the people will be very sorry they ever put them where they are now. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to argue the point with the honorable senator, but I do submit that the burden of his whole speech was that he was submitting the proposal, not as a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> one, but to put the Government where he said it ought to be. Why was the Government to be dragged down ? Because he said it was a monstrous thing to tax any person with an income of £100 or less. He became quite purple in his indignation. It is only a few months since he was supporting a proposition of this sort. The very first Government which submitted a proposal to tax an income of £100 and under was one which he himself supported, and that measure is on the statute-book to-day because he gave a vote to put it there. </para>

                <para class="block">He did not find then this flood of sympathetic indignation on behalf of the blind and the halt. He helped to put that measure on the statute-book. It is only now, because the electors have recorded their opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> and his friends that he suddenly discovers, what a sympathetic friend they have in the man on the Opposition side of this Chamber. The position on this motion is exactly the same as on the other two. The fixing of the amount does nob affect the thing one iota. No matter whether the limit. i3 placed at £100 or £156, the position is the same. Honorable senators on the other side are trying, consciously or otherwise, to open the door through which there may escape the young men of this country, to whom I have referred, and who, nob being in receipt of an income, but earning one which goes into the pockets of their parents, are undoubtedly entitled to be called upon for this contribution, but who, if our opponents had their way, would escape without paying a single penny. 1 think that the position is abundantly clear . The Bill makes ample provision for those upon whom the tax may fall with harshness. It says to these persons that a way is provided by which they may avoid the tax. Having done that, I am not prepared to go farther, and say, " "We will now open the door to those who ought- to pay, who are well able to pay, and who would only avoid the tax because of the fact that they are not in receipt of fixed incomes." If my honorable friends wish to exempt these persons, as they evidently would do, if they could have their way, let them say so straight out. The Bill, I submit, deals fairly with the' two classes. </para>

                <para>Take the very class of men whom it is always claimed we ought to encourage to go on the land. Take the case of men who go into the back-blocks to break up new ground. Are there not in different parts of Australia thousands of men who do' not earn more than £50 a year ? I venture to say that there is a large number of genuine pioneers who will be asked to pay a tax of £5, despite the fact that perhaps their produce for the first few years, if they happen to be single men, does not realize £50. They get only about enough to buy tucker for themselves and secure a bit of clothing while they are trying to bring the land into a state of cultivation. Thousands of these men will wish that they had never gone on the land if they are called upon to pay a tax cf £5 when they do not earn more than enough to keep them in food and clothing in the first few years of their pioneering. </para>
                <para>Will the Minister say that his party would have been returned at the general election if they had told the people that they proposed to. make every single man pay a tax of 5 per cent, if he was earning more than £100 and a tax of £5 if he was earning less than that sum <inline font-style="italic">1</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> knows that the Government would not have been in power today had they dared to tell the electors then that they proposed to bring in this sort of win-the-war financial measure. They had not the pluck to declare their intention to the electors. They are trying to impose the tax because they ha?e a servile majority in both Houses. "Unfortunately they have the support of a few of our old friends whose voices I would have liked to hear denouncing the proposal a year or two ago. The volume of sound we would have heard from a number of those who will probably vote against this motion would have been tremendous. All the dictionaries ever printed would not have provided enough adjectives for their denunciation of such a proposal only a few months ago. lt only shows that they are a servile majority when they are prepared to back up the Government in the passing of legislation which was never submitted to the country. If the Government dared to go to the country to-morrow with this measure they would soon realize their unpopularity. They would not dream of taking such a proposal to the electors; but, safe in a haven of refuge for the next two and a half years, they are prepared to perpetrate an injustice on thousands of men who do not earn more than £50 a year. </para>
                <para>It is all very well for honorable senators on the other side to say, " Where are your Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts?" <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> belongs to a class of men who would do all in their power to smash those institutions. What about the thousands of men whose occupation does not allow them an opportunity to get before Wages Boards or Arbitration Courts? Because in different parts of this country there are thousands of individuals who do not earn more than £2 a week. I have not forgotten the existence of these men, although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> appears to have done so. This proposal will hit very hard indeed, nob thousands of young men employed by pastoralists or wealthy farmers, but thousands of sons of the poorer farmers who are receiving, perhaps, 10s. a week and their keep, although they are over twenty-one years of age. Living with their parents and having the comforts of home life, these young men are content with a little pocket money because they know the exigencies of the situation will not allow their fathers to give them more. There are hundreds of cases within our personal knowledge where one or two sons are trying to bring into cultivation a farm in the back-blocks. It is five or six years before an orchard will give anything like a return to a man, and to-day there are thousands of single men over twenty-one years of age who are working in the family circle, and who, though they are not earning even £50, will be called upon, under this measure, to pay a tax of £5 each. Can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> say that their fathers are wealthy enough to pay the tax for them? He would not dare to make that statement, because he knows that it would not be correct. That is an illustration of the injustice which will be done by the imposition of this tax. On the Government and their supporters rests the responsibility. We made two genuine attempts to get an exemption, and we were defeated. We are making still another attempt, although I do not know whether it is worth while. </para>

                        <para>- And the honorable senator now finds himself out of touch with everything which he supported when in occupation of the Treasury benches. This deduction in respect of each child was then recognised as ji fair deduction, not only for the purpose of the income tax levy, but under the Pensions Act as well. I would point out also that as this is an additional tax the deduction may, in certain cases, be really £52 for each dependant. Under the circumstances, we are dealing fairly with the taxpayer in respect of each  dependant  which he has to maintain. </para>

                        <para>- Well, they are welcome to the Minister's sympathy. In this matter I  would again point out that the concession of £26 by way of deduction for each dependant really amounts1 to only 26s. a year. The same would apply to the original Income Tax Act, although in that case the deduction, I understand, would amount to 13s. or 15s. ; I have not worked out the figures definitely. Now, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has twitted me with my action as a member of the Hughes Government, I remind him that measures rarely secure the united support of a Cabinet, and that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir John Forrest),</inline> when he introduced this Bill in another place, remarked on this fact, saying that it sometimes falls to the lot of a Minister to introduce a Bill of which he did not approve, but that as far as this Bill was concerned, the Cabinet were united upon it. In the face of that statement, less than twelve hours afterwards, the Bill was withdrawn and an entirely different measure submitted. There was no time for full Cabinet consideration to be given to the amended measure, and, therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> gibe at me has little bearing in the light of what has happened in connexion with this Bill.  If, as a member of the Hughes Ministry, which came into office under conditions more serious than have confronted any other Government, I was inconsistent in some matters, I had at least the satisfaction of knowing that for two years I participated in the deliberations of a Cabinet which guided the ship of State on an even keel. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to enter my protest against the method set out in this schedule for the assessment of income tax. There is scarcely a member of this Parliament, who is capable of correctly calculating the tax which a citizen has to pay. As a matter of fact, one of our expert mathematicians in New South Wales has challenged the correctness of the formula supplied for the assessment of this tax. It would be a ' great relief to the average citizen, and to members of Parliament, if the rate of 'the tax were stated in pence without any decimals. It is only persons who have had the advantage of a long scholastic education who are capable of calculating the tax payable by any citizen in accordance with the present formula. It w.ould be very much better if there were no graduations, and if the rate were fixed at so much in the <inline font-style="italic">£1.</inline> At present it is incumbent upon all taxpayers either to employ a professional accountant or to place themselves unreservedly at the mercy of the Commissioner of Taxation. That ought not to be the case. I know that it is quite hopeless to expect the Government to agree to my suggestion, but, nevertheless, I enter my protest against the schedule in its present form. </para>

                    <para>. - I indorse the protest of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant.</inline> When an income tax was enacted some two years ago, a formula was adopted to give effect to a graduated tax. Out of that simple system has grown up a series of arithmetical, if not mathematical, calculations which have been laid down, I presume,- by some expert in the Taxation Pepartment. I defy the Government to find one taxpayer out of 100 who really understands the present method of assessment. I would impress upon Ministers the importance of making taxation matters simple to understand. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The farmer in the country, the way-back denizen, the shopkeeper, the trader, the member of Parliament, and hosts of other people, are all concerned in this matter; and it is only right that we should lay down a basis of taxation which all can understand. Honorable senators do not pay many bills without first checking them ; and I do not think it is a fair thing to fire into a taxpayer an assessment which he cannot possibly understand. In such circumstances, he has either to pay up and look happy, or make two or three visits to the Taxation Department. This sort of thing does not make for national efficiency. It adds to the number of officers required to carry out the administration of the Act; and I therefore ask that, in any further scheme for income taxation, the Treasurer will seriously consider the present much-discussed and very obnoxious method of raising money. Personally, I think that the simpler the taxation, the more agreeable it is to the taxpayer. I do not wish to go into details regarding the second and third schedules of the Bill; but, obviously, every taxpayer cannot be provided with a ready reckoner, even if a member of Parliament can. Every time that income tax assessments are sent out, there is a certain amount of wasted effort in endeavouring to understand them. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> in protesting against the curves in the second and third degree. They are not necessary, and are not in operation in any other part of the world. I trust' that the Government will recognise that simplicity is most desirable in this connexion. </para>

                    <para>.- As showing the correctness of the statements which have just been made, I may mention the experience which a taxpayer had at the Income Tax Department some time ago. When his assessment was forwarded to him, he challenged its accuracy, and immediately waited' upon one officer of the Department, who arrived at a certain result by means of the formula. Then his assessment was submitted to another officer, who obtained a different result. The Commissioner himself then tackled the task, and the taxpayer expressed his willingness to pay the tax on the basis of the lowest result arrived at. Such a condition of affairs ought not to be tolerated. The time is an opportune one for the Vice-President of the Executive Council to say that this </para>

                <para>The Bill authorizes the appropriation for the public services of the country of three months' Supply on the scale already approved of by the Senate in passing a previous Supply Bill a few weeks ago. There are no special features connected with the measure, the votes in the schedule being calculated, as I have said, on the rates previously approved by the Senate. </para>

                    <para>Yes. Payment to the States under the Surplus Revenue Act 1910 is limited to 25s. per head of the number of the people of the State, and the number of the - people is ascertained according to the laws of the Commonwealth by the Commonwealth Statistician as on the 31st December in each year. The law is being complied with. </para>

                <para class="block">I venture to say that is a curious interpretation of the law governing the capitation grant. Thirty-five thousand citizens of Western Australia are absent fighting the Empire's battles. If this interpretation of the law is correct, those absent soldiers are regarded as no longer citizens pf Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>- They have been alienated. I do not wish to confine my remarks to the position in this matter of the State I have the honour to represent, since the replies' to my questions inform me that the same interpretation applies to all the States. In my opinion, an injustice is being done to the six States of the Commonwealth in this connexion. The view of the matter taken by the Commonwealth Government involves that for every soldier absent from Australia the State of which he is a citizen is to be deprived of 25s. capitation grant. I am not a constitutional lawyer, and I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in replying to the debate on this Bill will explain how the legal advisers of the Government arrive at this interpretation. </para>

It is from the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth that the capitation grant to the States is paid, and that revenue is derived from taxpayers who are citizens alike of the Commonwealth and of the States. I hope that the answers given to my questions will be reconsidered, because I believe that an injustice is being done to the State Governments. I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will take notice of my objection, and will tell us how the law came to be interpreted in this way. </para>

                <para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir,</inline></para>
                <para>It has come under the notice of my council that the Prime Minister has openly stated that he is unaware of instances where economic conscription has been enforced in Australia. </para>
                <para>In the opinion of my council, either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has deliberately shut his eyes to facts, or this State is singularly unfortunate in regard to economic conscription. </para>
                <para>We have ample evidence here to prove that economic conscription is in full swing. In the </para>
                <para class="block">Works Department, according to the Australian Workers Union secretary, before any man can get a job he is to state whether he has been to the Drill Hall, and is asked whether he can produce an exemption certificate or not. If he cannot produce an exemption certificate, his chances of employment are very remote. </para>
                <para>Also in the Military Department here, a number of pay clerks are living in a state of suspense because they have been asked by their superior officer whether they have presented themselves for enlistment and been rejected. Several' have replied " No," and given as their reasons the fact that either they were married men with families, or were keeping widowed mothers. Notwithstanding their replies, their names - together with reports thereon - have been forwarded to head office, Melbourne, for consideration, and the men concerned are expecting immediate dismissal. </para>
                <para>The Perth City Council about two weeks ago passed a resolution that all its employees would be required to do one of two things - either produce an exemption certificate or hand in their resignation. (Attached is a copy of notice which the council has placed in the hands of every employee. Also appended is copy of a notice (placed in a conspicuous place on the premises of the electricity and gas department.) In addition, we learn from the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper the following (also attached). </para>
                <para>At the last meeting of my council consideration was given to a recommendation from our executive as follows: - "That the metropolitan council approach the State Recruiting Committee on this matter, and ask them ,to give a straight-out declaration in opposition to economic conscription; also, that we request every district council and the State executive to cooperate with us on the deputation." . . . </para>
                <para class="block">There is information for the Prime Minister, who is reported to have said that he was not aware of any system of economic conscription being applied. The letter goes on to say that a certain firm in Perth went so far as to attempt to corner knitting wool. Whether it was successful or nob, I am informed that the price went up by 200 per cent., thus penalizing those people who have been busy knitting socks, mufflers, and mittens for the soldiers. The letter also tells of the case o'f a returned soldier who went to a Perth firm and applied for employment. He was asked what pension he got, and replied £1 2s. 6d..- He was then promised employment at a wage sufficient to supplement his pension to the arbitration rate. </para>

[Copy extract <inline font-style="italic">West Australian,</inline> newspaper, Friday, July 6th, 1917.] "The Perth Recruiting Committee has been exercised over the unsatisfactory results of the voluntary system of recruiting. Married men, men over 45 years of age, and lads of 18 and 19 have come forward, but the eligibles between the ages of 21 and 45 hang back. As an instance of what is taking place, the Rev. T. Allan,  chairman  of the Committee, yesterday referred to the most recent street appeal. Of the 19 fit men it produced, 16 were married, and 3 of these (had between them 20 children. The resolution passed at a recent public meeting, aiming at the weeding out of the men who should go, were on Wednesday afternoon placed before representative city retail houses. As a consequence, the Economic Stores, Foy &amp;, Gibson's, Brennan Bros.,Chas. Moore &amp; Co., the Bon Marche, and Boan Bros. have agreed actively to . assist in carrying them out. This means, in effect, that single eligible men will not be allowed employment by the firms mentioned, if they are not prepared to fight for their country." ... As a next step in the campaign the Recruiting Committee will approach all business people in Perth, and will seek to induce them to follow the lead. </para>

                </para><para>In connexion with the  present  industrial strife taking place all over Australia, we desire to register with you an emphatic protest against the censorship of telegrams which has been put into operation in the Post and Telegraph Department. </para><para>During the critical stages ' of the dispute it has been almost impossible for the Labour movement in this State to obtain authentic news from Trades Halls in the east. The only news we have been getting has been that which appears from day to day in the capitalistic press. Based on long experience of that press, we consider it to be tainted, and place no credence whatever upon its reports of unions' decisions and unions' business. </para><para>Being unable to get information through in the regular way, we have had to adopt subterfuges, and, while the results have been fairly satisfactory, there has always been, more likelihood of wrong information reaching us than would have been the case had the usual channels of communication been left open. Naturally enough, when the workers over here found that telegrams were being tampered with and suppressed, they became more suspicious than they would have been had they been receiving the truth. </para><para>It is said that the prime object of the Government during such a crisis was to allay men's fears, and endeavour to prevent their minds becoming inflamed. If such a course of action is considered correct, then I must respectfully submit that the suppressing of telegrams from one Trades Hall to another has the very opposite effect. </para><para>My Council hopes that when future disputes occur the Federal Government will bear this observation in mind when endeavouring to effect a settlement. </para><para>Yours  faithfully Andrew Clementson, </para><para>Assistant Secretary. </para><para class="block">I have no apology to make for occupying the time of the Senate in reading these letters. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- The last letter I read deals with the partisan censorship which has been carried on during the industrial struggle. Here were attempts being made by men, who I believe were desirous of assisting in the settlement of the struggle. I know for a fact that leading members of trade unions in Western Australia were desirous of doing that, but they could not get a telegram despatched, nor were any messages despatched to them received. I have been informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rowe,</inline> secretary of the Lumpers' Union in Fremantle, received only one telegram during the critical period of the struggle from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morris</inline> in Melbourne. Such censorship is wrong. </para>

When men in leading positions in connexion with trade unions in Australia were desirous, not of protracting the struggle, but of endeavouring to bring about a meeting, with a view to ending the struggle, their telegrams were tampered with with the sanction of the Government.

                        <para>- That is quite true, but I think that my conversation with the honorable senator was interrupted by some business which had to be attended to. I only asked that I might have the privilege of addressing myself in a fair way to the last Supply Bill we shall have before us for two months. I was quite prepared, and still am quite prepared, to keep the agreement entered into with the Minister that the business shall be terminated by tomorrow afternoon. I do not know whether there has been any change in the arrangements made in another place. When I offered the suggestion that this debate should be adjourned, the Committee stage of the Repatriation Bill had not been reached in another place. If it has not yet been reached, what good purpose will be served by the Senate sitting all night, and then, perhaps, having to wait until the other House has finally dealt with that measure? With that idea in view I asked for an adjournment of this debate, believing that it was unreasonable to ask a member of the Senate to address himself to a Supply Bill of this importance after we had put through at practically one sitting a most important taxation measure. </para>

                <para>A little while ago the representatives of the temperance organizations wished me to move the adjournment of the Senate to bring forward a matter very important to them, and that was the action of the Defence Department in preventing them from publishing a little book entitled, <inline font-style="italic">The Fiddlers; Drink in the Witness Box.</inline> In my opinion its publication would have no evil effect on the conduct of the war. It was my intention to bring before the Senate their complaint, which I think is a just one, in a proper way by reading a few quotations to show the nature of the book, and then asking the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> why it was censored. I have read the book from cover to cover, and failed to find anything in it which should have been censored.

                <para>However, I shall attempt to explain the grievance briefly.

                <para>Drink Leading Famine In. </para>
                <para>The Drink Trade gave Germany her greatest weapon in the war by helping to make the bread famine. </para>
                <para>It was the wilful destruction of 4,800,000 tons of food, depriving the nation of her reserves, that led to the appalling gravity of the submarine menace. </para>
                <para class="block">The book deals chiefly, though there is a reference in it to Australia, with the British Government. The complaints are levelled mainly against that Government for not preserving the food supply for the uses of the people, instead of allowing that supply to be destroyed by the drink traffic. There is another striking cartoon showing a pair of scales weighed down in one balance by the amount of grain and sugar used in the manufacture of intoxicants, with the result that foodstuffs, represented on the other balance of the scales, is right out of reach of the starving people. </para>

                        <para>- And which the people are entitled to know about. The most striking cartoon in the book is the representation of three pyramids, headed "Food pyramids destroyed for drink." There is a picture of the Pyramids in Egypt, containing 80,000,000 cubic feet of masonry, and below it are two pyramids, representing together 180,000,000 cubic feet of foodstuffs destroyed for the sake of drink during this war. These are very striking facts, but I fail to see why the censor or the Minister for Defence should have prevented the circulation of this volume. Surely these facts about the waste of foodstuffs for drink in Great Britain should be known to the people. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable senator must realize that I have been driven to this course. I intended, had I been permitted to do so, to make a few quotations from the book, but the Minister for Defence has challenged me, and I feel that I must put on record what is contained in this little volume, so that honorable senators will be able to judge for themselves if the censorship was justified. There is another way out of the difficulty, 2nd it is in the hands of the Government. If they refuse to accept it I shall continue - </para>

                    <para>So vast is this incredible quantity of food destroyed by an enemy trade while famine has been coming on. We should have saved it all if Parliament had followed the King, and it would have given the whole United Kingdom its flour rations for nearly a year. Take it at its minimum scientific human food value, and on the basis 'of our rations in April, 1917, it would have given us - </para>
                    <para>Flour for the whole United Kingdom, 43 weeks. Sugar for the whole United Kingdom, 33 weeks. </para>
                    <para>Our three war Governments, confronted with the increasing  certainty  of at least a threeyears' war, have allowed the drink trade to destroy this vast reserve of food. It will not do for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George to blame his predecessors;, he has carried on their policy of food destruction. In the first four months of 1917 he has allowed the destruction of 400,000 tons of grain to bolster up this trade in drink. It would give the United Kingdom its bread rations for thirty days; it would make all the difference till the harvest is over. </para>
                    <para>The Government is bringing under wheat a million new acres, promising about two million new tons of home-grown food this year. That is the hope of its stop-the-famine-policy. But what is the certainty of its never-stop-the-drink-policy? Against the hope of two million new tons of food this year, we have the certainty of the destruction of 800,000 tons. Of this enormous quantity of food, certain to be destroyed this year if the Government does not cry Halt! to our food destroyers, 400,000 tons has already been destroyed; the rest can be saved now if the Government wants to save it. </para>
                    <para>There is not a single reason for withholding prohibition a day longer. It is coming; it will come before this year is ended, but if it does not come till then it will come to the eternal shame of Downing-street, for it will be written that when famine came knocking at the door of Britain it found the Government more willing that children should hunger for bread than that men should thirst for beer. </para>
                    <para>The full toll of this trade upon our scanty food supply, growing shorter and shorter while the queues outside our food shops grow longer and longer, is staggering indeed, even now with drink about three-quarters stopped. There is the actual grain and sugar destroyed in" making beer; the loss of food directly due to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prothero's</inline> encouragement of hops (probably 100,000 tons of grain and potatoes this year) ; and the waste of food in making alcohol for munitions - the most criminal waste now going on in the world, because it is utterly unnecessary. The actual facts of the present food destruction are given on page 11. We must remember that it makes no difference that the barley has been malted; it is still good human food, and every ounce of it should be mixed with grain for making bread. Let us remember, also, that brewer's sugar is a good pure sugar, the objection to it being largely the objection most of us have to standard bread - its colour. Malt and sugar too, every ounce a brewer destroys is food stolen from the people. </para>
                    <para>Look for a moment or two into the actual truth behind the table on page 11. Nobody will object to any sacrifice to make munitions; the Government can take the bread out of our mouths for that. But there is in stock 156,000,000 gallons of spirits, every drop of which could be used for munitions. It is almost certainly enough to make all the munitions we shall want to win the war. </para>
                    <para>What should we say if Vickers were storing up guns, if Cammell Laird's were storing up ships, if Armstrongs were storing up shells? But the drink trade is hoarding up munitions. Every ounce of this alcohol in bond for 1920 could be used for winning the war, but it is being kept for losing the peace, and instead of using it the Government is making new alcohol by destroying 740 tons of food a day. It is the most sinister example the war has given us of the power of this trade. </para>
                    <para>That is the unparalleled scandal of the food destroyed to make a drink trade dividend in years to come. What of the food destroyed to bolster up this drinking now? It is a crime against the Navy and against the nation. Think of all the hazard at which our food comes to us in these days - through mines and submarines, guarded and protected on long journeys at the risk of brave men's lives, and brought at last to a famine-threatened land to be handed over to a brewer's destructor. Take a cargo of sugar from the Philippines, ordered for a restaurant proprietor who provides 40,000 meals a day for working people in London. The sugar arrived at the London docks, and the caterer sent for it; but, instead of his sugar, he received from the Port of London authority a note saying, " Delivery of this sugar stopped by Food Controller, unless for brewers." </para>
                    <para>In another case a caterer in the provinces, who had actually paid for his sugar, and received a similar note from the docks, wrote to the Food Controller, whose Department replied that the sugar could only be released if it were sold to a brewer. The caterer, whose conscience would not allow him to sell food for destruction, asked if the Food Controller in such cases arranged for the sale, but was informed that the transaction must be left to the owner. It has not been sold, and the sugar is still at the docks - though since the exposure of this outrage steps have been taken to release this sugar under certain conditions. </para>
                    <para>So we see the British Government holding back sugar from a people waiting for it in queues outside our shops; holding it back from its legal owners in order to hand it to the food destroyers. If the sugar brought at such a hazard must go straight to a brewer's destructor, we might surely have saved our sailors and our shipping all this bitter peril. </para>

As to ships, drink materials during the war have used up 60 ships of 5,000 tons working all the time. </para><para>On Lord Milner's estimate of 19 barrels to the truck - </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I can quite understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> recognising that the Germans may want to get to England when all this beer is there; but I venture to say that before I have finished this book, honorable senators will realize that the British would make a much more hasty trip to Berlin if they viewed the drink traffic through the spectacles of the author of this book. I should like to ask the Minister for Defence whether it was upon an understanding with the Commonwealth Government that the first thing that the Government of New South Wales did when they got the volunteer workers on to the Sydney Cricket Ground was to see that a huge supply of beer was sent to them. </para>

                        <para>- I express no opinion on that point. What I want to know is why the publication of a book of this character is censored. Surely as a free people we have not yet reached the stage when one man should have the power to say what we shall print or what we shall write. The test for the censor is whether the publication of an article is calculated to interfere with the prosecution of the war. If the publication of an article in a newspaper, or in the form of a book, can not be shown to in any way interfere with the prosecution of the war, then no Minister is sufficiently powerful in this country to- censor the publication of  matter  merely because he thinks it is not fit for the ,people to read, when other people think that they should read it. I am not identifying myself with  any  of the statements that appear in this book. </para>

It is all very well to take shelter behind the soldiers. The temperance organizations have never supported me because they do not like the methods which I would adopt to deal with the drink traffic. I have the record of being beaten by a man who put drink down in a way different from the way in which I would put it down. I would not be selected by temperance organizations, although I am a life-long teetotaler. I have no reason to take up the cause of the temperance people. </para>

If we had the control we should have over shipping, delay in loading and unloading at a time like this would not be allowed to continue, because it is too serious. We hear a good deal about the " go-slow " policy on the wharfs, but I have travelled on boats even during this war where, for the sake of saving coal, only an easy pace was kept. The explanation given to me was that it would cost too much for coal if they went at full speed. This is another cause - that the men were incapacitated through drink. I quite understand that the writer and publishers of this book are simply endeavouring to put before the public the evils caused by drink. But the Minister's censor says, " At a time like this, you are not allowed to get a sympathetic hearing for your arguments. You must defer publication until the opportunity has passed away." The Minister, or his officials, have misused their power. The Minister has made one of the blunders of his lifetime in preventing the publication of this book, which continues - </para>

The Minister for Defence has made the statement that this pamphlet contains something that ought to be censored; and if the present attitude is maintained, I shall be compelled, notwithstanding the circumstances, to place the whole of it on record, in order to show that there is not a sentence to which the censor ought to take exception. </para>

                        is working " in a continuous rattle of mocking laughter and gibes." Yes, it is the mocking laughter of a nation that is not really amused by sights like this. The nation does not like to see the bread rations of 70,000 men in France cut down while the Drink Trade is destroying every week bread enough to last these men a year. It does not like to see the Government sending letters ' out to managers of factory canteens, begging them to be careful of bread, while food flows through our beer canteens like a river running to waste. It does not like to see Y.M.C.A. canteens denied supplies of sugar while barrels of beer are stacked in great piles outside. It does not like the calling up of discharged soldier's while thousands of strong men are working hard all day destroying food or carting beer about the streets; ana it does not like the tragic comedies of Captain Bathurst, who warns us that it really may become necessary in the national interest-and then, perhaps, he drops his voice to break it very gently - it really may become necessary, if these cake" shops are not very careful, to whitewash the lower part of their windows.

                    <para>Ob, these fiddlers ! And now we have a new idea from the Food Control Department; it is a coloured poster of a Union Jack and a big loaf. on it, and "Waste not, Want not," printed in big type. It was being printed on the day the Prime Minister told the nation that America had found it is no use waving it neutral flag in the teeth of a shark. It is an eloquent and true saying, but it is also true that it is no use waving platitudes from copybooks in the teeth of a wolf at the door. The Prime Minister says he is taking no' chances. Let us be quite sure. We once had a Government of which men said its motto was " Wait and See." Are we better off, or are we worse, with a Government that Sees and Waits? </para>
                    <para>But there is no end to the fiddling. With Food Controllers who hold up food for Food Destroyers ; with Food Economy Handbooks that cry out loud to save the crumbs but have no word to say about the tons we fling  away;  with a Prime Minister praying for window-boxes and a Board of Agriculture consecrating  hopfields,  we need not be surprised if the nation is not mightily impressed. </para>

                <para>The Drink Fleet during the war, bringing <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the raw material of this trade without cessation, would have brought enough pulp to maintain our newspape'r supplies for years. But these ships brought food for this trade to destroy, and the means of publicity are rapidly disappearing. The Hide-the-Drink Press has control of our communications. </para>
                <para>All over the United Kingdom you can cram great halls for "Prohibition. This page is written on the way from the Free Trade Hall in Manchester, packed with angry people. The other day it was Usher Hall in Edinburgh,, the day before St. Andrew's Hall in Glasgow, and then the Central Hall in Liverpool, Queen's Hall in Loudon, in which we called on the Government to save our food. </para>
                <para>But what have the papers to tell us of these things? Nothing. They live in another world. Take up the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> for "the day this is written; almost any day would do. Captain Bathurst has found a tremendous supporter for his policy of saving food by white- washing windows. If the Food Controller is to make a startling impression, says the <inline font-style="italic">Times, "</inline> he can take drastic action in regard to the display of food." We live in brave days : who shall measure the courage of our greatest newspaper when it writes like that? If we dp not see our food we shall not want it ! </para>
                <para>But we do not like the Hide-the-Food Press any more than the Hide:the-Drink Press. The <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> tells us the most noticeable waste of food now going on is by children. I beg the Timet' pardon. If we have come in this country, as we have come, to a tug-of-war be- tween brewers' dividends and bread for children, decent people are on the side of the children. Once before the Times has called the attention of the Food Controller to the great exasperation of men and women all over the country that shops are still selling sweets. Was any hypocrisy ever so great since Uriah Heep was born ? </para>
                <para>Let us take the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail.</inline> We may raise our hat to the journalist who keeps drink out of it, who spends day after day talking of the waste of food and is blind and deaf and dumb to drink. He can see a gnat and miss an elephant; ho must be the cleverest journalist who ever held a pen. </para>
                <para>Bread is ammunition, and we cannot afford to waste a single loaf, says the <inline font-style="italic">Mail,</inline> but it has not a word to say about the outrage of destroying 6,000,000 quartern loaves a week for drink. </para>
                <para>Every cargo of grain sunk by submarines has to be made up by economy in our homes, says the <inline font-style="italic">Mail.</inline> So have the 26 cargoes of 8,000 tons of grain which the brewers are to destroy in the next 26 weeks. </para>
                <para>Reminding its readers that the fate of the Empire may turn on economy of food, the <inline font-style="italic">Mail</inline> asks : " Will the public ever realize how serious the food .position is? We ask because investigation in public places shows that there are many who disregard the food regulations." There are, for instance, the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail</inline> might have added, the hundred thousand other places where nien, who' think themselves jolly good fellows drink away the bread and sugar for which women' and children ask in vain. But the <inline font-style="italic">Daily</inline><inline font-style="italic">Mail is</inline> not thinking of these men or of these things. It is only the millens of people who are not in high places who think of things like this, and they have no voice i« the papers now. But their day will come. </para>

                <para class="block">How the Allies Did It. </para>
                <para>All the world knows, except, apparently, the world that goes round at Westminster, how Prohibition has helped the Allies. </para>
                <para>With, the Shell Famine at its height- largely made by Drink - the Prohibition Army on the East held up the enemy while Britain fought the Drink Trade for her shells. </para>
                <para>With the Bread Famine looming in sight - largely made by Drink - the Prohibition Navy from the West flings in her power against the submarines. </para>
                <para>Oh, for the spirit of our Allies in this land ! If France wants to rouse the spirit of Verdun she strikes down her foe at home and puts absinthe away. If Russia wants to be great and free she stops this drink and orders out the Romanoffs. If Canada wants to give her utmost help to Britain she stops this drink from sea to sea. If Australia wants to make her soldiers fit she trains them in her Prohibition camps. If America wants to beat the whole world at making shells she drives drink from her workshops. If San Francisco has an earthquake she stops drink while she pulls herself together. If Liverpool has a dangerous strike she shuts up  publichouses  and keeps  the city quiet. Oh, for a Government of Britain that will see what all the world can see ! </para>
                <para>History will do justice to the part the Prohibition policy of the Allies has played in saving Europe, but a pamphlet has no room for these things. We can take only one or two groat witnesses to the mighty achievements of our Prohibition Allies. Let us begin with France, and call our own Prime Minister to tell us what they did. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George : </para>
                <para class="block">One afternoon we had to postpone our conference in Paris, and the French Minister of Finance said, " 1 haver to go to the Chamber of Deputies, because I am proposing a Bill to abolish absinthe." Absinthe plays the same part in France that whisky plays in this country, and they abolished it by a majority of something like ten to one that afternoon. </para>
                <para class="block">And how did Paris take this, prohibition that men said would cause a revolution ? Let us ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Philip</inline> Gibbs, whose splendid letters home have made his name a household word. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Philip</inline> Gibbs: </para>
                <para>Absinthe was banned by a thunderstroke, and Parisians who had acquired the absinthe habit trembled in every limb at this judgment which would reduce them to physical and moral wrecks. But the edict was given and Paris obeyed, loyally and with resignation. </para>
                <para>SenatorFoll. - On a point of order, sir, I ask whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is in order in reading his speech ? </para>
