                        <para>- I wish to ask the Minister for Defence a question in connexion with the money paid to the soldiers at the front, and to their wives and children. Does he consider that 4½d.per day per child is sufficient for the maintenance of those families who are deprived of their breadwinner; and, if not, will he take into consideration at the earliest possible moment the question of raising the amount to something which will be adequate to meet the necessities of those who are dependent, upon that means of income? </para>

                        <para>- It is not correct to say that only 4½d. per day is allowed for the upkeep of a child. In addition to that amount, there is the soldiers' pay and separation allowance, and the soldier is compelled to allow a certain portion of his pay, which increases according to the number of the children in the family. It can 'go up to 10s. per day for seven days in the week, according to the number of the children, which is higher than the average wage, considering that there is no lost time the whole year round, as in the case of a labourer in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- A few days ago I asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether it was the intention of the present Government to appoint a Trades Commission to visit the United States. The reply I received was that the Government had not considered the matter, but would do so later. I now ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether the present Government intend to consider the matter, or whether he will give me a straight-out reply, and say that no such Trades Commission will be appointed ? </para>

                        <para>- I think I am entitled to take some exception to the latter portion of the honorable senator's question. I am not aware that I have ever refrained from giving what he terms a straight-out reply. I did give the Senate the assurance that the present Government has not considered the matter, but intends to do so. That is exactly the position now. Matters in these times move at a very rapid rate, and it is not always possible to secure Cabinet consideration for every matter presented for settlement. </para>

As for the rest, I would remind him that there is not much prospect of an amendment of the kind foreshadowed by him being dealt with this session. If such an amendment were adopted, we should possibly be faced here after the elections with empty  benches  on the Opposition side of the Chamber. </para>

                <para class="block">It is the latter part of section 96 to which I desire to direct special attention. In doing so I need only say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> himself has intimated that he will support me in having this matter referred to the Disputed Returns and Qualifications Committee. It is quite clear under section 96 that no member of any State Parliament who had not severed his connexion 'with that Parliament . fourteen days prior to the date of nomination could be chosen by the electors of any State as a senator. It is equally clear that the whole of our parliamentary institutions, and the whole of the freedom that we enjoy under those institutions, have been gained as the result of the&gt; people securing from the Crown powers which heretofore they had not exercised. It never was the intention of the Constitution to give to the Governor of Tasmania, or the Governor of any other State, or the Governor-General in Council, more power under our free institutions than has been given to the people themselves. Therefore, if the people had not the . power to make a senator of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> seeing that he had retained his seat in the Tasmanian Parliament up to within twenty-four hours of his appointment, the Crown, I claim, had not the power to do that. I think this makes out a sufficiently good case for the matter to be referred to the Disputed Returns and Qualifications Committee. I have nothing further to say on the matter. I recognise that Government business is urgent and insistent. I bring this matter before the Senate, firmly believing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> is sitting here as a representative of the Crown and under conditions which do not entitle him to occupy his seat. </para>

I regret that the Standing Orders have prevented <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> from proceeding with his motion, because I courted the fullest inquiry into the validity of my position in the Senate. I did not intend to say anything on the merits or demerits of the case if it had been referred to the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications. But, as it cannot be referred to that body, I must express my surprise at the interpretation placed upon the Constitution Act and the Electoral Act by the Leader of the Opposition. The position under which I was appointed to the Senate was of an extraordinary character. Honorable senators on the other side, by their usual malignant tactics, succeeded in driving one of their number out of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I am a natural-born subject of the King, so that there is no doubt about that qualification. The only possible doubt in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> mind as to my qualification to be here is based on section 96 of the Electoral Act, which provides that no person who has been a member of a State Parliament within fourteen days of the date of nomination is qualified to become a candidate for election. I was not a candidate for an election; I was not nominated; I was appointed by the Executive Council of Tasmania for a period - either until the general election, or until the members of the State Parliament indorsed their action. That is my position, and I court the fullest inquiry. I am not likely to stultify wy political career by rushing into an illegal transaction. I know exactly where I am. </para>

                    <para>. - My reason for, in the first instance, calling for a division on the question of suspending the Standing Orders was not to delay the Supply Bill, but because yesterday there was so much objection taken to the breaking down or the overriding of the Standing Orders that I did intend to say a few words on the subject. It is a strange thing that, after having at the request of members of my party allowed the motion to go as I did, I should be subjected to jeers from the other side. In answer to the jeers, I wish to let the public know that we on this side can be generous, that had we gone to a division the Ministerial party had not enough senators here to carry a motion to suspend the Standing Orders, because they need the support of nineteen senators for the purpose. </para>

That is the attitude which I will adopt. </para>

I take it that we are to face the electors on the questions of attempted bribery which have been raised here, and which the 'Government have not yet agreed to inquire into by means of a Royal Commission. There is no mistaking the issues at the elections. In my opinion, the Government have not the courage to appoint a Royal Commission.

But there has been one thing running through all that he has had to say, and that is his contempt for Australia and Australians. That has run through all his utterances in this chamber during the last three weeks. </para>

                            has taunted me with my mildness when in Western Australia, just as I have taunted him with his wildness in this chamber. I had but one object in view in visiting the Western State, and that was, if possible, to hold the Labour party together there. I say that the followers of Labour in Western Australia desire to hold the party together, and to give every opportunity to their representatives in this Parliament, who have left the party, to come back to it and stand loyally by the Labour movement. But, unfortunately, the representatives of Western Australia in this Parliament are being led by a man who, in my opinion, has set out with the deliberate intention of dividing and wrecking the Labour movement. I refer to

He did not assist me by speeches, or otherwise to obtain a seat in Parliament. I was the selected and elected Labour candidate for a seat in the New South Wales Parliament three years before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> entered a Parliament in this country. I entered Parliament in 1891, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> did not enter Parliament until 1894. When I entered the New South Wales Parliament in 1891 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was one of the brilliant red-raggers of the Socialist party, and was not connected with the Labour movement. I am* not sure that it would not be advisable for me to keep this debate going until half-past six o'clock in order that I might produce copies of <inline font-style="italic">Justice</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">The New Order</inline> in order that honorable senators might be convinced that the  red-ragger  in politics in those days is the man who to-day is trying to divide trade unionists, and is insulting the Labour movement by connecting our respectable trade unions with undesirable elements of Society. When tha true history of Australia comes to be written the trade unionists of the country will loom largely as an important factor in its development. They are the persons who first organized to make the conditions of life for the workers in Australia bearable, to secure proper sanitary conditions in warehouses and workshops, and to let a little sunlight into the dark places to which the workers were confined by their masters before the trade unions came into existence. </para>

                        <para>- These honorable senators opposite say that it was the Liberals who made the conditions of the workers better. Let them go and tell that to the operatives in the factories and warehouses, and the men in the mines and workshops. Let them refer to the conditions that existed in 1890, and then tell the workers that it was the Liberals who did that for them. Why they  paid  a girl the magnificent wage of 2s. 6d. per week after she had served for six months for nothing. They gave women workers in the warehouses and factories about 10s. per week after they had served for six years. They gave them scarcely enough wages to pay tram fares. That is what the Liberals did for the workers. If we go to the Western State, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> comes here to represent, and consider what Liberal legislation had then done to make the lot of the miner more bearable we shall find that they had done very little. They permitted rich mining companies to take millions of money from the mines of Australia, and pay it into the pockets of shareholders over the' water, who. never risked their lives beneath the surface of the ground. </para>

                            knows more than does any other member of the Senate the forces that had to be used to secure a little more comfort for the men who go down to the sea in ships.

The old-time champion of the seamen of this country is found agreeing with the statement that it was the Liberals who made the conditions of our seamen better. The honorable senator is now sitting with the Liberals, and assisting them to drive the wedge which has divided the Labour movement.  His  past experience should have taught him that it is by solidarity alone- </para>

I suppose that I was a coward because I was not prepared to fight the Beef Trust if it is behind honorable senators opposite, and fight the sugar industry if it is behind you. I may be a coward for doing that, but centuries ago the British people determined that there should be one place in the Kingdom of Britain where the truth could be spoken by a man, and nobody could make him afraid. </para>

Sacrifice the privileges which free men fought to win for us, and if you are brave go out and fight the Beef Trust, which will carry you from one Court to another until yon are ruined." That Trust could employ the services of the most eminent counsel, which a man of more modest means could not possibly hope to engage. I am prepared to accept the taunts of small minded men when I am standing up for rights which' Britishers have- enjoyed for centuries. Honorable senators opposite wish to tear up the Bill of Rights, and to rob this country of a place where the elect of the people may speak the truth without any fear of the consequences. </para>

When I am willing to give it would be just as well for them not to attempt to take undue advantage of me. At every election for the past ten years the Liberals have faced Australia under a new name. Now they have named themselves the " National party." Sometimes they want" to steal the recruiting commanders' title - the title of the " Win-the-War " party. But what have they done to win the war? This party have sunk to the level of purloining that title from the Recruiting Committee. They wish to tack it on to their own, to save their own miserable hides. They may talk about winning the war, but the public of this country want deeds, not words. </para>

                        <para>- I say again that my heart goes out to any man who has lost his son fighting at the front. But what is the treatment which we receive? We all heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> acknowledge that he told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> that the latter, had no chance of winning his election while he was associated with such men as Peter Bowling and Arthur Rae. No chance of winning an election associated with such man? What was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President's</inline> statement? He used fair persuasion to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> and asked, " What hope have you in such a contest associated with Peter Bowling and Arthur Rae? " Peter Bowling has five sons and Arthur Rae three sons fighting at the front. Is it fair play for a public man like the Minister for Defence to ask, " What chance have you of winning your election associated with such men as Peter Bowling and Arthur Rae? " "Surely they cannot be branded as disloyal. Peter Bowling has five sons at the front, Arthur Rae three sons, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> one son, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> two sons, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maughan</inline> three sons. Does the Minister for Defence mean to tell me that men who are prepared to give their best are disloyal ? Why does he want to divide this country by making it appear that a section of Australia is not as anxious to win the war as is his own party ? </para>

                        <para>- I am glad fo tear that. There is no body of disloyal people in Australia. If anybody can find .  3  man in this country who does not want tb win the war, he ought to exhibit him. IE we put the matter on no Higher a level than that of "'Who is to pay for the  War?  " what is the result? If the Allies  win,  the Australian people and their children's children will be paying the debt which will fall upon them, but if the Allies lose they will pay not only Britain's debt but a proportion of the German cost of the war as well. Therefore, only an idiot would not desire to win the war. Those who endeavour to make it appear that we do not wish to win it, have, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> remarked on a former occasion, " the truth in their hearts, but a lie on their lips." Let me here refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman, .Mr. Hall,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beeby,</inline> who, in New South Wales, are joining forces with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and with the Leader of the- Liberal party in this chamber, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> I admit that I have not in my possession any wild statements by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> accusing those who thought differently from him of being in the pay of Germany. </para>

Just now, I want to refer to the men in New South Wales who have formed themselves into a " National " party. Before .the 28th October last, honorable senators opposite were screeching about the shirkers and the slackers, and about the party that is driven by the "outside organizations" - that cant phrase which is so frequently used here by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> Need I remind honorable senators that those " outside organizations " are the organizations which have lifted up all the workers of Australia </para>

Twenty years ago we were called anarchists, and the term " junta " was frequently applied to the executives of the Labour movement. When a great man was shot down in some other part of the world, the newspapers would relate the occurrence side by side with attacks on the Labour movement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie at that time were members of the Labour party. Now, they are employing the worn-out, bloodstained weapons which the capitalists employed twenty years ago. </para>

                        <para>- All I have to say is that, if Australia could have done more, the . fault is not with the Labour Government any way. It was no small achievement to organize and equip 300,000 men, and - to quote <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> himself - to send 292,000 men away from our shores. Indeed, I think it was the greatest achievement to be expected of any country in the world to send these men 12,000 miles over the water, and with scarcely a casualty until they got to the front. That is Labour's work. That is how the Labour Government carried out their promise. What has been done may be taken as an earnest of what will be done in the future should the people of. this country, in their wisdom, return- to Parliament a Labour Government charged with conducting this war. </para>

He knows very well that if I was not able to do so much, it was not because of unwillingness on my part to help in that matter. I . can. say, however, that this war will be conducted by. the new Labour Government . after the 5th May as it was conducted by the Fisher Government, after 5th September, 1914. Make no mistake about that. This is a declaration of war policy. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps the spirit was upon me, but it might be wiser to wait until after the event. We have sent, as I have said, 292,000 men across the seas ; but I venture to say that there is another way in which the Empire can be assisted other than by the exploitation of man power in Australia to its fullest extent. There is the organization of production in this Commonwealth, and the organization of the means of sending that produce to Great Britain. This work may be developed to an extent undreamed of at present. </para>

                        <para>- Do not try to  drag me down to this, petty quibble about our refusals to join the Government. As a party, we refused because we would not have -strengthened the Government by joining in the grab for portfolios. Has the new Government introduced anything in the nature of a war policy, they would have had from me support as generous is was accorded to the late Government by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and his party. But the first thing the Government did was to. state that they intended to send unrepresentative men to the Imperial Conference at which matters affecting the vital interests of Australia, for perhaps a century, would he determined. They intended to send to that Conference men with whom they had been in political antagonism all their lives. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine was to go as the representative of Democracy in Australia 1 <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest was also to go. The other was William Morris Hughes, whose policy was disowned by the electors on . the 28th October; the man who had used all manner of means to belittle the people of Australia; who had reviled the mothers!, wives, and daughters of soldiers if they did not vote as he thought fit. For the time being, he cast aside all tolerance because he thought he could carry the country with him. These men, we know, will now go to the country with the statement that we were not anxious and willing to join them. </para>

I have looked into the figures myself, and I find that the honorable senator only made a mistake of six. The actual figures in Committee were seven times against the Government. The honorable senator used those figures to try and buttress a falsehood which he had previously given utterance to, namely, that I had not loyally supported the Fisher Government. </para>

But what has happened ? There is an election on now in New South Wales, and notwithstanding that the fate of the Empire and Australia depend upon conscription, according to their argument before 28th October, they have published a statement that they will do nothing to enforce conscription. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. They now say that they will do nothing to assist in raising the question. The fate of the Empire and Australia, and all considerations of humanity and civilization, are thrown aside, and we now have these noble patriots down on their knees waving the white flag to the advancing army of electors and crying " Kamerad, kamerad, spare us!" Yes, they will be spared. They will be spared to attend to their private business and not the business of the country, as well as, mark you, those men who, though they may have years of service in the Labour Parliament, are now saying, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> has said, that the leaders of the movement are not now worth following. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story,</inline> I know, was reported to have said that the movement was not worth following, but he corrected that. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly ; and that was the taunt of the Liberals twenty years ago, and these are the people with whom the honorable senator and others who formerly belonged to our party are now associated. It is the same old "National" Association, the same old " Democratic " party. At every election they change their name in the hope of getting votes. The honorable senator knows, as I do, that early in his political career he was fought by the men with whom he is now associated, who classed him with anarchists and everything that the anarchists did. These are the men who said that the country would be ruined if the Labour party got into power. A few days ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> gave us a list of all their old catch-cries, among them being the charge that the Labour party would desecrate the home life, break up the marriage-tie, and do everything that was infamous. Honorable senators on the other side are now associated with their former political opponents, and are joining in the cry, long since worn threadbare by the Liberals. I suppose they think that by doing so they will have an assurance that the Liberals will not drop them from their selection. </para>

                        <para>- So would I; but, after all, I do not know whether I would or not, because, to my mind, the Liberals are the Industrial Workers of the World of politics. I am glad to know that the honorable senator would rather be associated with the Liberals than the Industrial Workers of the World, because we know that he is now following the Liberals. He is supporting the Liberals with a leader in the Senate and a half-leader in the other House. He is going to the country under these conditions. It  looks  as if two of the sitting senators for South Australia have a chance to go, and that one will have to stand down to make room for a Liberal. He is now a supporter of a Government with a majority of Liberals in the party. </para>

                        <para>- That interjection is well worth a passing reference. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said that at one time I was associated with a bogus Labour party. Let me give in tabloid form my political history. In 1891 I was working at the Hasleworth  Battery, in Parkes. A selection of a Labour candidate was made in the town of Parkes to run in association with the Labour candidate selected from Forbes for the Forbes constituency. The Labour organization of the town of Parkes selected me as the candidate. I was then under twenty-four years of age. In the contest which followed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hutchinson</inline> and myself, the two Labour candidates, were returned to Parliament. We signed a pledge to vote as the majority of the Labour party in Parliament decided to vote. I remained in the Parliament for three years, and never broke that pledge. During the term the party split on the pledge. There came up the question of Free Trade or Protection, and honorable senators know that in- those days it was an issue to divide parties. In the Caucus there was a division, in which fifteen members voted to support Reid and twelve members to support Dibbs. I was one of the .twelve members. I immediately walked across and voted with the party who were supporting a man whose principles I did not believe in. But I did that in the interests of solidarity. Then there came into the Labour movement a junta - the men who had been Socialists and had fought us. Holman and Hughes came into the Labour movement, and framed a pledge so drastic that I declined to sign it. I will now compare my action with that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator was a member of the conference, so that he ought to know how it was done. Joseph Cook, too, was a member, and so were Arthur Rae and a whole lot of us. But let me get on to the point, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has tried to impute to me disloyalty to my party. When they drafted a pledge which I could not accept, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> went to organize the electorate I represented. I suppose that his line of reasoning was this, " If this young fellow could win the electorate, it would be a soft snap for me," and after he had organized the Forbes electorate, he went to organize the neighbouring electorate of Cowra, and got the selection as the Labour candidate. After organizing the Ashburnham electorate, which I held, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> went to the Leichhardt electorate, and secured selection. What happened then ? Let me tell the men who taunt me with being a bogus Labour man that I went into the selection which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> had organized, and said to them, " We cannot win this seat for Labour if both of us fight for it. I am prepared to sign the pledge which I signed in 1891. Let your candidate sign the new pledge; let the leagues make a selection, and let whoever wins be the Labour candidate." They unanimously accepted that proposal. We went to a vote. I fought in the leagues organized by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and won the selection by 400 votes to two. I was returned to Parliament as a Labour candidate. Not only that, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> was in the Parliament, with the Liberals. Let <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie go and ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> before he speaks again whether I ever sat inside a room in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> sat. Let him put the question, too, to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who sat in that Parliament. Yet he taunts me with not having been a Labour man always. In 1895 the Assembly only lasted for twelve months. I went back to my constituency again with the united support of all parties in the electorate and outside, and then I was beaten. I did not, however, go and do what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie threatens to do. I did not go running for a seat and splitting Labour votes. </para>

Sometimes when certain people found that I was putting a different complexion on things, I discovered that they had a pretty good fighting dodge - they would start to fight alongside where I was speaking, in order to attract the attention of the crowd. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is evidently following the same tactics, When I am answering a charge he wants to have an argument with another honorable senator to throw me off the track. William Hughes and William  Holman and other men drafted a pledge so drastic that I would not sign it. I went to the Labour leagues and told them that I would not sign the pledge, but would contest the Labour ballot with the man who did sign it. I did contest the ballot. The pledge lasted less than twelve months. Hughes had found a seat at Lang, in Sydney, and that was all the " junta " in that day wanted. They prepared a pledge known as the cast-iron pledge. It was so drastic, so far-reaching, that no honest man with parliamentary experience would accept it. I did not accept the pledge, but I told the Labour leagues which selected me that if they put in a man who would accept the pledge, and he should beat me in the ballot, they not only had my promise to support him but my promise to go round the electorate with him. To the men who have recently left the Labour movement, I say, " Treat our organizations in that way." They say that there is something wrong with the outside organizations. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie say that the western organizations have treated him unfairly? He knows that they did not. He knows that they gave him a free hand. Even when it came to a question of the honorable senator deserting his party here they gave him an opportunity, and I believe they are now giving him an opportunity to go back and make the Labour movement solid. </para>

I went to my league - a solidarity league which was organized by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> - and told them that I would not accept it. I also said to them, " We cannot win the election if we fight each other. Take a ballot, settle the matter by some means mutually agreeable to both sides, and if your candidate wins the selection I will help him to win the seat." Let those who complain now of having been unfairly driven out of the Labour organizations go and do likewise. </para>

                        <para>- I addressed the electors of Kalgoorlie quite recently, and I say that there is about as much hope of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> winning the Kalgoorlie seat as there is that he would win the seat for Broken Hill, or the seat for West Sydney, which he now represents. What a great leader of a party we have in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> On the eve of the battle, when the one thing necessary in the interests of the party is that its leader should possess the quality of courage which we all admire, the right honorable gentleman is running about looking for the safest seat. If he were half the leader that honorable senators opposite claim that he is, he would trust the people of West Sydney, and go and fight the issue of the election in that constituency. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry to have to think that the compliments have caused his head to swell, and that something else has caused him to split the Labour movement. Let us have a look at the seats' which the party opposite are going for. When the Prime Minister started out to organize the new National movement, what was the place selected for the delivery of his first address. It was the quiet, peaceful, and respectful city of Geelong. Why was Geelong selected? It was because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne,</inline> the member for the electorate in which Geelong is situated, is away fighting this country's battles. </para>

                        <para>- I did say fighting, because every man who enlists in the Australian Imperial Force does so without any right to choose the unit in which he shall serve. That is a matter for the Defence Department. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> is not fighting, that is not his fault. " Win-the-War " is the cry of this National party. They say that Australians must be encouraged to enlist, and the encouragement given to them by William Morris Hughes, the great leader of the great National party, is, in the absence of a soldier fighting for his country, to organize' a special party to defeat him at the polls. </para>

This is the party that boasts that their places should be kept for all the men who have gone to the front.. They say that soldiers who have gone to the front must not be kept out of their positions when they come back ; but they take care to make no legislative enactment to give effect to that. We know what the party has proposed to do in Corio and Ballarat. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> is a sergeant-major, or something of the kind. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that he should have been made a commissioned officer before he left Australia.  His  military experience was very considerable, and his military knowledge much more extensive than that of many of the men who went through hurried schools of training. I do not say this to disparage any of those men, because they have all done splendid work, but because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> was a trained soldier in our Military Forces for many years, and held a non-commissioned officer's position in them. </para>

                        <para>- The point I want to make is that it has remained for the party that claims to be a National party to treat men who have volunteered' in the way I have stated. This is worth remembering. It cannot be repeated too frequently that, when the gentlemen to whom I have referred volunteered, they could make no stipulations as to the service which they would be called upon to perform. They volunteered to serve their country, and their positions in the Australian Imperial Force were found for them by the military authorities. They had no voice in the matter. That must not be forgotten, because I have heard that  mean-souled  men have said, " They are not fighting. Any one could do their job." I say that their volunteering was unconditional. There is only one system upon which men volunteer for the Australian Imperial Force. If they pass the necessary medical tests, they are signed on and the military authorities do the rest. So far as the two gentlemen to whom I have referred are concerned, it is not only bad taste and ingratitude, but worse than both, for a political party whose policy is to win the war to try to drive them out of their seats at the present time. The National party have been organizing with a view to deciding whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Plain</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> shall fight these men for their seats in this Parliament. I venture to say that the Democracy of these constituencies will gladly meet the men who want to win the war by winning the seats of men who are at the front fighting to win the war. These things require to be made public before the Senate rises. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will give them some circulation, but we know that the national press of the country will not put up a fight for the men who are being treated in this way. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts</inline> said the other day that if we did not oppose  Colonel Ryrie  or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Abbott,</inline> we expected that, in return, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath</inline> would not be opposed, the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> put forward a very brilliant explanation of the position. It said that there was a difference in the position of the members referred to, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Abbott</inline> had won his seat by 3,300 votes whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> had won his seat by only 2,700 votes. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> gave that as a national reason why a distinction should be made between officers at the front who are members of the Liberal party and officers who are members of the Labour party. There are one or two expressions of people who addressed meetings during the recent conscription campaign which should, I think, be brought under the notice of the electors during the election campaign that is about to ensue. I intend to put them into the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Mansard,</inline> and honorable senators opposite will have the opportunity to disprove them if they can. I find that in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 10th October, 1916, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine is reported to have said - </para>

I understand that they believe in using all their powers to prevent wealth being produced; and, therefore, if true to their principles, they would vote to keep- men fighting because, when men are fighting they are not producing wealth. The Prime Minister and others, for political purposes, have been trying to connect our great, peaceful, constructive movement - that for twenty years in the public life of this country has been working to produce wealth, and not to destroy it, to build up and not to break down, and to make this a better place to live in - with the Industrial Workers of the World men, who would make it a worse place to live in. </para>

                    <para>These leaders of the anti-conscriptionists had established a reign of tyranny. If a man or woman dared to say that they favoured conscription, they were called " scabs " and " blacklegs." What were the men who scabbed and  blacklegged  against their country? What had they done for unionism and Labour? He was proud of the company in which he had found himself. He would rather cut his throat than stand with criminals and rebels, with whom his . opponents were standing. To-day, besides members of the Industrial Workers of the World, and anarchists, there were rebels in this country who were opposed to Great Britain, and who hoped to stab her under the fifth rib. </para>

                <para>That was the man that the senators from Western Australia say our party had not the undoubted right, at our meeting, to remove from leadership, after he had described the leaders of the anti-conscription movement in our ranks as the associates of criminals and murderers. That is the man they are taunting us .with hunting down with vindictiveness and  a  hymn of hate. It is not vindictiveness. It is the long-held-back answer to the man who has deliberately, for some purpose I know not what, and for some reason I know not what, entered upon a campaign to break the Labour movement.

I will say no more on that aspect of the question; but when honorable senators opposite think that we get unduly excited when referring to the Prime Minister, I ask them whether there is not ample cause for our doing so ? A perusal of the extraordinary statements which the right honorable gentleman made during that campaign will reveal the real reason which led up to the division of the Labour party. I was slow to be convinced, slow to believe that a deliberate attempt was being made to divide our party, but very reluctantly I was compelled to conclude that, for some purpose, I know not what, William Morris Hughes had deliberately set out with that object in view. </para>

Nobody used to chuckle more gleefully over the quips and cuts of William Morris Hughes when he was dealing with my political opponents than I did, but I do not relish them when they are applied to myself or to the party with which I am associated. But if I have not his rapier-like wit I can still handle a bludgeon and deal out "  stouch  " to him in my own rough way, and I hope I am doing that.

                        <para>- Two evils were offered to us - one the breaking up of the Government in September of last year, with the consequent formation of a National Government which would give us  conscription either by Act of Parliament or under the War Precautions Act. That is what we feared. There may have been no grounds- for our fear, but still we entertained it. When that break-up came I did my best to prevent <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> being permitted to submit this question to the people. I make no attempt to conceal my opinions. They were well known to all the members of our party. Then, it may be asked, " What sort of a man were you to remain in the Government?" I say again that I remained in the Government to hold it together. If I had not remained there <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> was such a red-hot anti-conscriptionist that he would not have remained there a single day. He was thus whole-heartedly against the proposal until the last' week of the campaign. Then he became overwhelmed with the magnitude of the work of the Navy. He was Australia's head of that great fighting department - the Navy - and during the very last week of the campaign he decided that his previous attitude must be changed. Then suddenly, and for the first time, he became a conscriptionist, and issued a statement to the press. I suppose that he issued that statement after burning much midnight oil, because it was a splendid declaration of his principles, and a valuable contribution to the conscriptionist cause. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that he did, because it bore his signature. What more proof does the honorable senator want? The head of the . great fighting department of the Navy was capable of writing that statement, and of writing even better things, because if he could write so well in favour of conscription he could have written even better against it, seeing that he had been such a strong opponent of it. He went over to the majority. </para>

                        <para>- He thought that he was going over to the majority. If in the early stages of the development of the breach in our party I had not remained where I did remain, I would have felt that I was assisting to break up the Government at a most unfortunate time. Consequently I determined to remain in the Ministry on the understanding that during the campaign I would not speak on the subject of conscription either for or against it. Until the 28th October arrived I did not open , my lips upon it. Of course it may be said that I was looking round to ascertain which way the vote was going. I resigned my seat in the Government, not on the question of conscription, but because the Leader of the Government was endeavouring to use the polling booths in a way that they should not have been used. The Prime Minister had informed the public that "the surprise of their lives " was in store for" some of the young men of this country. </para>

                        <para>- As I have already pointed out, the regulation gave power to returning officers to put certain questions -to young men as to whether they had answered the proclamation or not. At that time there was no reason to believe that any one had not answered the proclamation, because, according to the figures supplied by the Statistician, it was anticipated that 176,000 people would answer it, and, when the regulation was  drafted, no less than 179,000 had responded. The regulation referred to empowered the returning officers if they considered the answer unsatisfactory, to place the ballot-paper in a separate envelope, stamped " Proclamation," as certain other votes were treated under section 9. This was the regulation that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> proposed to issue, but when the Executive Council in Melbourne turned it down - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen, Senator Russell, Mr. Higgs,</inline> and I refused to allow it - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> called an Executive in Sydney, consisting, I believe, of the Governor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen,</inline> and the Prime Minister, and the regulation was passed there. In view of the fact that it had been disallowed in Melbourne, no man could have remained in the Cabinet a moment longer, and so we resigned. Our resignations had nothing whatever to do with the conscription issue. As a matter of fact, I could have taken the platform in Melbourne that night had I wished to do so, and perhaps I could have made some political capital out of the evidence, and got a little applause for having got out of the Cabinet at the last minute. The regulation to which we took exception was as follows :  - </para>

                <para class="block">That is the regulation which brought about our resignations from the Cabinet. I do not wish to again tell a twice-told story, but I do want to say that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was prepared to use the regulation to win on the conscription issue, this Parliament will have to be careful of the power it may intrust to him in the coming election. If a man is prepared to use our polling booths in the way proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and do it in defiance of his own Cabinet and Executive, he will not hesitate to use any power he possesses if surrounded by men who will not oppose him. This is well worth thinking about. I can well imagine that those who are on his side now will welcome an election, because they have with them the strong man who will win anyhow if there is no one to oppose him. What happened to this regulation ? It was passed by the Executive in Sydney, and the Electoral Office was told to act upon it, so instructions were issued to returning officers throughout the country. In many polling booths those instructions were carried out. Questions were put to electors, and their votes were enclosed in envelopes. If this matter is investigated, I am prepared to prove what I say. </para>

I am dealing with the regulation under the War Precautions Act, and on that occasion my objection was shared by such a great mind as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen's,</inline> who is now, however, a conscriptionist, as we learn from his speech in Tasmania on Monday night. I have stated my objection to the regulation, which, I venture to say, would have been quite as repugnant to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap. Mr. Jensen,</inline> however, went to Sydney, and reversed his decision on this matter, no doubt under the hypnotic influence of the Prime Minister, who now has the allegiance of even such a great mind as that possessed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I know I remained in office for some weeks while I was in antagonism to the known policy of my leader, but I remained there in the belief that, in the interests of my country, and during the time of its greatest crisis, I could do something to hold the party together. I know it was inconsistent and unconstitutional on my part to remain there in opposition to the leader of the party. I never had any doubt as to the inconsistency and the impropriety of that course, and I never had any doubt that the correct and constitutional procedure was to get out. But I took all the circumstances into account. There was a ballot close upon the people; the Government were likely to disrupt; the country was engaged in a poll with all the local evils arising from that event, and though during those weeks I brought down upon my head the contumely of those who disagreed with my view, I accepted that condemnation in the belief that I was doing something to hold the Government and the party together. </para>

                        <para>- That is something, also, that might be said. The interjection is a very good reminder 1o me. At the outset of this business, the Leader of the Government had a majority of the Cabinet against him, and also a majority of his party, and he knew that he had. It is unfortunate, but there were all these surrounding circumstances. I take my full share of the blame. I take my full share of responsibility for my apparent inconsistency. But side by side, as' a set-off to that, I say that I knew what, under normal conditions, was the correct course to pursue; but under the existing conditions I freely explained the correct course, and yet, in spite of that, I hung on to office in the hope that the Government and the party could be. held together. I have nearly come to the end of my tether on this occasion. I had practically finished what I wished to say two or three times, but as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has accused me of voting against Tasmania, my honorable' friends have been good enough to turn up the division in the <inline font-style="italic">Journals,</inline> 30th October, 1912. :Senator O'Keefe moved that the House of Representatives be requested to amend clause 2 of the Tasmanian Grant Bill by leaving out " five " in line 9, with a view to insert " nine " in lieu thereof. I find that the amendment meant a difference of £100,000 to Tasmania. The point is that the man who accused me of voting against Tasmania gave his vote on the side of the " Noes," and I am where I said I was; because next to my own State, perhaps before it, little Tasmania has a very warm place in my heart. It was the birthplace of my father. That may be a sentimental reason, but Tasmania never wanted a supporter here when its interests were at stake. Provided that its interests were just and right, I have always been ready to give my vote to the little State to which I owe something. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that there is an overwhelming desire on the part of various civilians to get into the Senate. It may be that the Senate has attractions, but it certainly is not Paradise. During the last few days I could not help contrasting what the Senate actually is, or seemed to be during the heated discussions taking place, and what the sacred book of the Mahommedans, the <inline font-style="italic">Koran,</inline> tells us Paradise is. It says, " Therein there shall not be any vain discourse, nor any charge of sin, but only the salutation -  Peace, Peace.' " Paradise, then, is exactly the antipodes of what the Senate has disclosed itself to be during the last ten or eleven days, and what it would be if we had many orations like that which has fallen from the lips of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> during the last couple of hours. I am not going to indulge in any vulgar recrimination about recent happenings, about the virtues and demerits of -  adifferent political and party policies, for party is a very small matter at this juncture. The national interests should be paramount. I hope to deal with one or two very important matters on a fairly high national plane, but before doing that I wish to make a reference to the eulogium which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> pronounced on the virtues of Labour in politics. I was. elected to the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Senate by the Liberals of my State. I was elected after war was declared, and I was given a free hand as a Liberal to do whatever I thought was right in the best interests of the Empire and the nation during that critical period which every far-seeing man could tell was before us, and could  tell at the time of the general election in 1914. For the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> I will institute, hot in any vicious spirit, a comparison between that Labour party's philosophy in action, which he so extolled, and the tenets of Liberalism. The political situation has been brought about by a split in the Labour party; that is beyond all doubt. The Liberal party found itself as a consequence of the result of the war election in a minority in the other House, and in a minority in the Senate. It at once girded up its loins, accepted the situation, and threw itself whole-souledly  into the work of supporting a Labour administration in connexion with Australia's measures of assistance in the war. Even the Minister for Defence., before the disruption took place in the Labour ranks, was generous enough - and I thank him for his utterances - to acknowledge the measure of assistance which Liberals in both Houses gave to the Administration in connexion with its war policy. The disruption in the ranks of the Labour party was occasioned by its peculiar constitution, by the fact that its representatives in Parliament are hardly ever free agents. They must condition their parliamentary action by the opinions of organizations outside. I, as a Liberal, espoused Liberalism solely because I believe that it is synonymous with liberty - liberty of political and personal action. And, singular to say, I have been under the necessity of denouncing, without anything like a voluminous vocabulary of epithets, the Labour school of political philosophy because I honestly believe that it did not have within it anything like an atmosphere favorable to personal political liberty. A great protagonist of Labour, the Right Honorable William Hughes, has discovered what I have always seen to be the truth. Directly he, and those who thought with him, ventured to act independently, the avalanche fell upon them - the avalanche of that organization which does not believe in personal political liberty or its exercise on the part of its representatives in Parliament. Why ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> did. I venture to say that while we all have respect for the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> as an influential publication, the ranks of Liberal members are not arranged or filed in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> office. We do what we think fit, and in the very best spirit of British parliamentary institutions. Every Liberal who comes here claims the right to mould his political action as he thinks best in the interests of the Empire and his country. I was not challenged to at any time effect a formal alliance with any Labour Administration. Yet I took the responsibility, and am prepared to justify myself, and will never at any time be called in question. The action I took the other day was not conditioned by any actual knowledge of what the opinions of people in my State were. I took the action because of my own conception of the situation. And has there been a single voice of protest ? Has there been anything published to the effect that I have done something which I should not  have  done, and will have to plead at the bar of some organization in justification of my action? Not so.' Therefore the people of Australia, and honorable senators, had better understand at once, when they are extolling Labourism, the cardinal and vital difference between the political principles of Liberalism and those of Official Labourism. That is all I am going to say about the differing opinions regarding party politics. Party politics have very little to do with me at this juncture. I am going to speak with the knowledge that electoral opinion is very often as confused as what Shakespeare calls the "still vexed  Bermoothes."  I do not know what my fate will be at the coming election, nor do I, without posing as a demi-god, greatly care. I have done what I thought was my duty here, and I will continue to do it if I am returned. I will at all -times repudiate any attempt on the part of people outside to shackle me in regard to my expression of political opinion or my political actions. </para>

                        <para>- I do not like elections any more than other politicians do,  but I am going to speak this evening in view of the fact that no man, when he goes before the electors, can deem himself safe. I may be returned ; I may not be returned; and it is in view of the contingency, which must be ever present to a candidate, of. not being returned, that I am going to make a few observations in regard to matters which I think of the first degree of importance to the Commonwealth and the Empire. In the first place the present situation has been created because of a motion which, if carried, would have necessitated our applying to the Imperial Government for an Act to amend our Constitution. It is at once evident to honorable senators, if they care to closely study the Constitution, that while it is an admirable instrument, and deserves to a very large extent many encomiums which have been uttered on its excellences, still it has shortcomings. Its shortcomings are particularly noticeable in regard to this fact, that Australia is a country of great and wide spaces, and that electoral operations through one of the world's continents are slow in producing results. The other day we had the final results of the conscription referendum tabled four months after the taking of the poll. Small bunches of votes had to come along camel pads from the arid interior. Weeks elapse sometimes before returning officers ascertain the results of the voting at far-back polling booths. Great and magnificent as our continent is, when polls have to be taken over the Australian States and Territories, and when it is necessary to ascertain the opinion of the electors upon a matter that is closely contested, it is a long time before we can learn whether the majority is one way or the other. That being so, the "omission from our Constitution of a provision to admit of a sudden emergency being faced is a very grave one indeed. We have been brought face to face with" the difficulty by the situation we have been considering lately. It should be clear to honorable senators that, in respect of a great national emergency, the Commonwealth Constitution is not sufficiently self-adjusting. It is because of this that I have asked Ministers to take into consideration the rapid passing, even before we go to the country, of a measure in perfect consonance with the Australian constitutional machinery known to the electors, to enable the opinion of the people to be ascertained as to whether it is not desirable to insert some provision in the Constitution which would enable us to grapple with a situation due to a sudden war emergency. We might obtain the opinion of the people as to the advisability of adopting such an amendment of the Constitution during the ensuing elections/ and so have the matter dealt with promptly and decisively. The Australian Parliament should have power, by virtue of the Australian Constitution, to prolong its life when confronted with a, grave national emergency, which would not justify the holding of a general election' at the same time. If the Administration properly grasps the situation, and members of this still alive Parliament understand what they are about, they will concede the desirability of saving the expense of submitting this question to the electors in the future- for it must be submitted to them - by having it decided at the next general election. </para>

I referred really to a natural tendency on the part of people born on Australian soil to avoid if possible the necessity of asking for an amendment of Australia's Constitution through an outside authority, in view of the fact that we have been given by the Imperial Parliament the power to completely adjust our Constitution for ourselves. </para>

                        <para>- I do not consider it dangerous at all. It is not considered dangerous in the case of the Imperial Parliament, which is the mother of all our Parliaments. I venture to say that our Constitution is at present too cumbersome to enable us to deal with a national emergency such as an invasion suddenly arising. I have no doubt whatever that, were such a provision as I suggest included in our Constitution at the present time, the public opposition to the proposal for prolonging the life of this Parliament would have been very largely  disarmed. </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe that there was very much public opposition to the proposal. I should like now to deal shortly with the Tariff. I am a Protectionist, and, as I said in the course of the debate on the Ministerial statement, I believe that Australia has been given practically independent powers by the generosity of the Imperial Parliament. The exercise of those powers is not conditioned by any consideration of the desires of foreign nationalities in connexion with our fiscal system. If Australia thinks it judicious at any time to effect an amendment of its Tariff - be that time war time or peace time - I say that I do not acknowledge for one moment that any foreign Power has any right to make any representations to us regarding the desirability of any action we may think it well to take in that regard. </para>

                        <para>- That does not follow. The situation is not as the honorable senator seems to indicate by his interjection. We cannot rip open our Tariff at the present moment; but after the elections, when I hope we shall have a stable Parliament with a life of three years for the House of Representatives, and a continuous life for this Upper Chamber of review, we should take the Tariff into careful consideration. The lessons of the war surely have made us feel more and more the justice of the contention that in all vital matters of production and manufacture Australia needs to be made as self-contained as possible. I hope the Administration will adhere to the intention expressed in the press to-day of checking the importation of articles which are in the highest degree luxurious. This is no time for luxury. It is a time for national economy. It is a time when we should plant our heels deep in the sand and set our teeth for the death-grip, because the Empire is to-day at grips with a foe that has planned its complete destruction. If that destruction is to be averted, and the efforts of the people of the United Kingdom, with the assistance of the people of the overseas Dominions, are happily to be successful, then we ought to go down on our national bended knees and thank the Providence which, so far as human eyes can observe, watches over the destinies of the British Empire. Let us at the present time recognise that we must economise. The importation of articles that  are not necessary in the daily life of the people should be prohibited. That is all I wish to say about the Tariff. I am going to the electors as a Protectionist, and if again returned by them I will urge upon the Administration, immediately after the elections, the desirability of going in for a systematic, careful, and intelligent Tariff revision. </para>

                        <para>- No, not after the war. That would be too late. Let us immediately do what we think is right and proper to do. This talk of " after the war ' ' implies that we may condition our Tariff by the intentions and desires of outside nations. I do not admit for a moment that the, Australian people should at any time condition their Customs policy by the desires of outside nations which happen to have trading relations with us. We are masters in our own house, and we should do what we think right in the interests of our own people. I am sorry that we are not going to have a system of proportional representation in operation at the coming elections. I can conceive in the present mixed state of the public mind candidates representing many parties standing for election to the House of Representatives. I can also conceive candidates representing many shades of opinion standing for election for the Senate. It would be pitiable if a large number of seats in this Legislature were to be filled by men who clearly represented only a minority of public opinion. It seems to me to have been a gross oversight on the part of this National Legislature that it did not during the years it has been in existence provide for a system of proportional representation. I will admit that the policy of the present Administration to appeal for support for its general war1 policy, and to secure a majority in favour of that policy in the Senate, wovjld very probably be prejudiced by the adoption at the ensuing elections of proportional representation; because under that system I think it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Government to secure a majority in this Chamber. I -am only in a very few things an expedientist. Though that might be the result of the operation of proportional representation at the next elections, I venture to say that, in the long run, the adoption of the system would be found satisfactory. I have no doubt that if proportional representation were tried, fresh evidence would be forthcoming of its great utility in the election of members to such a National Parliament as this. I wish to say a little now on what I might call the philosophy of national progress. We have here a continent, and we are the only people in the world who own a continent. I am afraid that recently there have been evidences that a false philosophy is being preached, to the effect that after the present war we shall have a position of things approximating to the millennium. We are told that there will be no more wars. I do not subscribe to that view at all. I say that nations grow in response to, and because of, the operation of certain things that are as truly laws as is the law of gravity. You can no more prevent certain races, at certain periods of their history, rising to national prominence than you can by telling a boy to remain a boy, and that it is undesirable that he should get out of knickerbockers - prevent his reaching manhood. It would be foolish to say to a youth, " Remain in knickerbockers; it is inadvisable for you to grow into manhood," because the youth is growing in obedience to a law which he cannot control. Nations grow in much the same fashion. The sap rises in the national tree every now and then, and what was before only a small shrub, representing the national virility of a small sparse people, blossoms in a night into a great tree, and in the course of a few decades or a century or two, you behold one of the mighty peoples of the earth, which before had been regarded as a small power, of no significance and no weight in the world's affairs. Australia, I say, with very clear, almost prophetic, vision, is going to be brought into contact with peoples in whose national trees the sap is rising, who are going to be great peoples, numerically, scientifically, and in everything that virile peoples judge to be greatness. The natural law will prevail. Therefore, I say, " Australian people, hug not to yourselves the delusion that you are within a few years of the millennium, that it will he unnecessary to have compulsory service to defend your own territories. Emerson says, ' Immortality comes to those who are fit for it,' and national greatness, national endurance and persistence on your part as a free people, will come to you and remain with you only if you are fit. Therefore,  gird your loins, realize your national destinies, realize that there are people who look upon Australia very much as the average Labour man looks upon a large squatter's holding." He says, " This is a land monopolist holding land which should belong to us, and to which we should have access." The land-owner very often answers, and properly, " I am putting the land to the best use - the use for which it is. naturally fitted." But that is not regarded by the Labour member as a sufficient answer.  He says, " We have in our ranks people who desire elbow-room, and want some of that land of yours. How do you make good your title? We have a better title than you, and require the land, which is essential to our well-being." Several nations, although not articulate in that way at present, entertain the same ideas in regard to the present attitude of the Australian people. They say, " Can you  5,000,000  people own a continent ? You are an arrogant people. You will not permit us to have access to it. " </para>

It is at our disposal, as their Legislature, to tax it as we think fit, and, therefore, by virtue of the might of the British Empire, we occupy  it.  Now, let us see if we are prepared to make good our title. It is not  by  teaching ourselves easy-going philosophies,  by  easy hopes or lies, that we are going  to  reach the goal  of  national safety. It is  by a  proper girding up of the national loins, a realization of the possibilities  of  our destiny, and a determination to make national sacrifices of the most intense kind, that. Australia is going  to  remain the property of the Australian people. </para>

                        <para>- I have compared Australia with a land monopolist whose occupation of large territories, withheld from intense public use, arouses opprobrium. Australia, a community of  5,000,000  souls, owns one of the world's continents, an island, it is true, but nevertheless a continent, and by the very fact of its insularity other great contingencies will have to be considered in the near future by the Australian people. The people inhabiting this continent have,  to  a very large extent, warned off the people  of  other nations. They have adopted the policy known , as the White Australia policy, of restricting the entry of alien populations into their country. I do not impugn that policy, but a nation of people determined to adopt that attitude must demean themselves like a race of scientific Spartans, ready to fight with " a licence which the hand of death alone can stay," for the security and integrity of their country and the retention of those ideals of which the White Australia policy is one. In this connexion the Australian people will probably have to show a greater spirit of self-sacrifice than has ever been exhibited by any people on the earth's surface, or at least by any people known to history. They must at all times be prepared to put their blood, their treasure, their all, into the balance. During the referendum campaign young men, who would no doubt hold up both hands to sustain the White Australia policy, in frequent conversations with me spoke as peace-at-any-price advocates. They were men belonging to the school of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks.</inline> They said that if they had to be taken to any scene of warlike operations, they would have to be bound with ropes and carried there. Can a nation of people of that temper maintain the policy of a White Australia? Can they maintain the integrity of this country inviolate? They cannot. </para>

I have said that a fair destiny awaits the people of Australia only if they are fit for it. I am not going to preach about the necessities of the situation without offering some key, some solution, to the great problem that awaits this nation of ours, one of the most important of the King's oversea Dominions. We shall have to maintain a great military force here. We shall have to do our best in  regard  to all those adaptations of modern &gt; naval science, which will enable us to keep our shores inviolate. A great opportunity will present itself when this war is over, when we shall have, I hope, hundreds of thousands of veterans, the pride of our race, returning to our continent. From their ranks must be selected the very pride of manhood remaining, and they must be made a per-  manent' force, in order to stiffen that Army Reserve, the outlines of -which have been given by the Minister for Defence.

                        <para>- I shall disabuse the honorable senator's mind of that idea, which is often held and expressed by others. Other nations may conquer China, but it is always the Chinaman who survives and smiles over the grave of hi3 one-time conqueror. It is the fecundity of the Chinese that can make them too proud to fight if they like. Other nations come, and, for a century or two, obtain a kind of nominal mastery over them. Do they interfere with Chinese institutions? Do they overturn Chinese family habits? Do they take away Chinese liberty or make any impression on the Chinese language? No. In a national sense, nobody has ever conquered China, because of the fecundity of the Chinese race. Let that be a lesson to the world. The Tartar may conquer the Chinaman for a while. The Chinaman, with a sort of supercilious contempt for the barbarian, may even  allow him nominally to rule over him, if he. does not interfere with Chinese institutions. Inside a century or two the language of the Tartar or the Manchu conqueror is as dead as Sanscrit. It ceases to be spoken. The conqueror speaks Chinese, adopts Chinese institutions, follows Chinese practices - becomes, in fact, a Chinaman, and that only because of the unexampled fecundity of the Chinese race. To the Chinaman the getting of men is a passion. They follow the Scriptural injunction to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth. If our men and women fail to regard this divine injunction, they will, in the words of Homer Lee, " presently awake to find themselves on a savage dawn, stripped and desolate," stripped of this continent, which ought to be their eternal heritage, their eternal possession - </para>

                <para class="block">It is the fruitful -races of the world that will inherit it. Let Australians remember this. I make this deliverance here now, because I know that, in the vacillations of public opinion, I may not have the opportunity to return to this Chamber and give the people of Australia what I believe is the benefit of my knowledge. This is a deliverance which I think I should make to the Australian people in the highest Chamber of the Australian Legislature. Nations do not advance to their doom; they retreat to it. That is axiomatic. If the people of Australia are not sensible of their high destinies, they will retreat to their inevitable doom. Not like an insane King Lear, but as a man whose mind is quite made up on the subject, and who has some kind of prophetic insight into the matter, I say, as King Lear said, feeling the spirit of Australia's future behind me, with no desire to hint that I would even disturb or abuse the great matrimonial relation - </para>

With population we shall have soldiers; but we shall not be able to hold or defend this continent if that large and rising section of the Official Labour Opposition is allowed to nurture itself as a political party which is not only opposed to conscription for overseas service in the interests of the Empire, but is opposed to compulsory service for the purpose- of defending Australia within her own shores. </para>

I do not attack the Labour party on lines which will enable" its members to come here and quote against me what they designate as malicious statements. But the fact is that in Labour Conferences, motions in opposition to compulsory service, and not .merely to compulsory service overseas, have been promulgated, debated, and put to the vote. These motions have had for their object the abolition of the principle of compulsory service, which is on our statute-book, and for which the Labour party has been wrongly taking the whole credit. </para>

                        <para>- It is not for the sake of those who will be dead that I am speaking, but for the sake of those who will be alive. In regard to the question of compulsory service, I wish to point out how essential it is that a nation should come to a decision at an auspicious moment, for the auspicious moment some-  times passes- away never to return. There is very rarely a renaissance in the life of a nation. The same soil may produce greatness, but it does not produce greatness in the same nation twice. The Italian nation is not quite the same people as the ancient Romans. It speaks a language somewhat different from that of the ancient Latins; and is certainly considerably different from the Roman and Latin peoples who dwelt in the peninsula of Italy 2,000 years ago. We shall find Saracen blood now where Cicero was born. We shall find people there who are very different from those who inhabited the land at the time of Julius  Cæsar.  It is essential that the people of Australia should remember that, even if they adopted conscription at the present time, the auspicious moment  for securing  the full advantage of that policy may have passed away. Had it been adopted when I advocated conscription, at the inception of the war - and when my efforts were gallantly seconded by my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> - we would have secured the full fruits of a Democratic levy for our armies. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I venture to say that there were a good many Australian men and women who did not properly sense the situation. I advocated tie adoption of compulsory service, not only for Australia, but for the United Kingdom, long before it was adopted there. But had the referendum on the 28th October been carried by a majority large .enough to justify the enforcement of the principle, the men who would have gone into our camps would hardly have been sufficiently trained by the present time. In addition to that, we know that it would be particularly difficult to take them out of Australia just now. But had we adopted the principle of conscription even then, we would have conferred a great morn! advantage on Great Britain and her Allies. Yet our national strength might not have been seriously impaired, "because the men who would have been' called for service, subsequent to an affirmative vote on the 28th October last, would probably still have been in our camps undergoing their training. It is manifest, therefore, that promptitude in matters of this kind is essential. It is of no use being wise after the event. We need to be wise before it. That is the reason why I am urging honorable senators, and the Australian people, to consider the position of Australia in the near future. We shall have a greater burden to bear, because of our pretensions, than any people who have previously trodden the stage of the world. We have aspirations such as no other people ever had.  We have ideals such as no other people ever entertained. We have a country situated as no civilized country has been geographically situated. </para>

                        <para>- To strengthen our youthful national aspirations it was essential that we should throw our whole strength into the Imperial scales. I know what I am talking about, and Ministers and ex-Ministers alike are thoroughly familiar with my opinions on these matters. They know very well that any views which I have communicated to them have been based on a patriotic conception of the true national interests. Let us beware. Let the Australian people remember that if British Imperialism perishes, Australian nationalism perishes. There will be no chance whatever of its retention or preservation. Therefore, even at this late hour, I am going to take the responsibility of telling the Australian people that they ought to throw every other consideration aside, and do the best that in them lies to secure the triumph of that civilization which is identical with that which we are developing - that Imperial civilization from which ours is descended - and that they must secure the retention of those Imperial liberties of which our own are a portion. If Australia heeds not my words, if she chooses the easy course, if she decides to revel in what of luxury remains to us, well, after that, the deluge. Great Britain is in a unique position. The. British Empire differs altogether from any other Empire that the world has seen. It differs completely from " any other modern Empire. In any other great modern Empire the ruling race is the most numerous. In Japan it is the most numerous, in Russia, also in Germany. </para>

                        <para>- The British Empire is the only modern Empire in which the ruling race is in a minority, and the Australian people, who are absolutely a microcosm of the people of the United Kingdom, must recognise that on them devolves a full percentage of the responsibility of maintaining the prestige of the governing race. If they do not recognise that, to use the language of the Koran, " Over them the fire closeth." The submarine campaign, which I also foresaw, would be likely to prove a very menacing one, if the war continued, is seriously interfering with Imperial activities, and to show how a little prevision is necessary in connexion with these matters, I stated two years ago .that the adoption of conscription was imperative, in order that we might be able to throw our whole weight into the Imperial scale at the earliest possible moment. I believed this course was necessary to bring the war to a triumphant conclusion before the submarine campaign could be so developed as to make approach to the shores of the United Kingdom by merchant vessels  a  great hazard. I pointed that out in the columns -of the Tasmanian Labour paper two years ago, and urged that the successful termination of the war could only be secured, not by putting forth the national strength in driblets, but in such powerful waves of reinforcements as would enable us to sweep on the crest of an irrepressible tide to victory. I wish to emphasize my position already declared. I notice that a member of the Administration has been in Tasmania .lately talking about conscription. He is a somewhat late convert. </para>

                        <para>- My attitude on this subject has been made perfectly clear. The official recruiting campaign - the final one, I believe, on the voluntary basis - has been inaugurated, and is now in progress, and I will not disturb it until a full and complete trial has unmistakably disclosed that its results are insufficient for the national' needs. When that position has been so disclosed, I will turn down the page in my history and resume my advocacy of the principle of conscription, even at this late hour, for although a great deal of the merit may have  departed from it, because of the circumstances which I have detailed, it is encumbent upon us to provide for all contingencies and to prepare for a full exhibition of the national strength on the Empire's behalf. In other words, if the present campaign on the voluntary system demonstrates that the results are insufficient, I will once more advocate conscription. The other evening, as I was walking through that magnificent pleasance, the Botanical Gardens, in Melbourne, in the purple sunset, I could see the glittering waters of the Bay, and as I looked upon this magnificent city, with its shimmering domes, I reflected on what was to be the future of this people; this people of whom I am a unit, and amongst whom my daughters, and I hope my daughters' children will live; this people who are my people. And I came to the conclusion that we were in very perilous places ; that we were in the shadows of the dim waterways, that our future was very dark and doubtful, because hundreds and thousands of the manhood of the nation still in Australia will have nothing to do with war. They want to put down the gun. They will not exert themselves on the nation's behalf; they are not ashamed to say that they will not fight; not ashamed to say that they will not go to the field of battle unless they are roped down and carried there. And yet these men would raise a chorus of indignation if two or three coloured men, or if a ship load of marooned coloured men came along to« partake in the development of the riches of this great continent. The two attitudes are absolutely incompatible. It is open to any man to say that his door shall be barred against the intruder, but. he must stand as a strong man armed, and I tell the people of Australia that if the young men of this country are not prepared, in view of our national pretentions to stand like a strong man armed, woe will be upon them. After the war every nation will endeavour to add to its population, so it is absolutely idle to expect that we shall get a great influx of population from other European countries. In Australia, we shall have a war debt of, probably, £200,000,000. At the time when I was speaking of the submarine campaign, about two years ago, I said that if the war lasted for a couple of years Australia would have a war debt of at least £130,000,000. We have  a war debt greater than that at the present time, and it is patent that, in the future the Australian people will have to bear a considerable ' load of taxation. Moreover, Australia will not be so attractive a country as we, in Australia, fancy, it is likely to become. The Australian people, therefore, must increase their, population by their own efforts. Motherhood must be exalted. Childhood must be exalted. We must do everything we can to encourage - but always within proper and moral bounds - an increase of the Australian population. We must make provision for widows, for motherless bairns, and 'for women who, through no fault of their own, are left with the responsibility of maintaining their families. Though I may differ from my friends opposite, as I do on many important matters, I tell them that, in all their efforts directed to this end, they will have my hearty support if I continue in my present position as a member of this Legislature. Fecundity is going to be Australia's salvation. Fecundity, education, and national courage. I put fecundity in the first, second, third, and last place. By no other means can we save our country and retain possession of one of the world's continents. I am going to conclude by referring to a small matter, but one which I think it necessary I should mention. As all honorable senators know, I took a certain course of action a few days ago in what I thought was the best interests of the nation. At that time events seemed to be very mysterious", although they do not seem to be so mysterious to-day. But on a certain Friday following disclosures in this Chamber, I made up my mind that I would vote in a certain way on a motion  whch  had yet to be submitted to the Senate for debate. Now, I am responsible for my action to those who sent me here, and I am not one of those who seek to evade any responsibility ; but I fancy that in some quarters there is a sort of undercurrent of complaint that I did not disclose my intentions after I had arrived at a decision. All I have to say is that while I invert the proverb, and say, Silence is silvern and speech is golden, there are times when silence is necessary. We seemed then to bo in a peculiar situation. We were, politically, in the " misty mid-region of Weir." I wished to keep my own counsel, because, although I had arrived at a certain decision, that decision might have been conditioned by any kind of happening. For instance, when the Senate met on the Monday  morning the honorable senator who made the charges might have withdrawn them. As a matter of fact, he did "weigh in" with another statement, which perhaps he thought added weight to the one he had made. I do not think it did ; but the fact remains that he came in with another statement. Now, we know that anything is possible in the vicissitudes of political life, and if this honorable gentleman had withdrawn the statement that he made on the Friday, by getting up in his place and stating that he had misconstrued what had taken place between him and another honorable gentleman, would not an act of that sort have conditioned my previously formed decision? Undoubtedly it would. On the other hand, what if the honorable gentleman who some .time ago was ;a senator here had in the interim made some confession of improper action or wrong-doing ? We can easily see what a remarkable set of circumstances might have been created. Therefore, although I had arrived at a definite decision, and communicated it in private to some very near and dear friends of mine, I nevertheless held my peace, and awaited the possibilities of any development. I deemed it necessary to preserve silence, which, on the whole, is rather unusual with me. That is a clear statement of my position, and seeing that we shall not have any more Supply Bills, all I have to say is, that so far as my platform .campaign is concerned, I will conduct my election without introducing any personalities, and will endeavour to weigh carefully the merits of all those great issues which divide the people of Australia into two political parties. I believe my ' political opponents hold wrong ideals, and that some of them, have a wrong conception of what is best to be done in the national interests. I believe, however,- that there is perfect unanimity of opinion so far as our soldiers in the field are concerned and as to what is best to be done to defeat the German foe. Believing this, I do not entertain the idea that there is any substantial feeling of disloyalty among the Australian people, and I feel sure that we' shall all hail with glad acclaim the triumph of our Empire and race. . I believe that triumph will not be too long delayed, and that it will be accelerated if, by putting all other considerations aside, we determine to. throw the whole of Australia's strength into the national balance, </para>

                    <para>. -I wish to bring before the Senate what Australia has done in connexion with the war-. During the recent conscription campaign - and even since that time - a continuous effort has been made to belittle Australia's part in this great conflict. Grossly untrue statements have been made which would lead any outsider to believe that Australia had  quitted ' ' the war, and was having nothing more to do with it. There is only one way in which such a statement as that can be controverted, and that is by stating- the number of enlistments - not for one month, or for a series of months, but over- the longer period. I find from official sources that for the past seventeen months the enlistments in Australia have been as follows: - </para>

                <para class="block">
                    <graphic href="081332191703140_41_0.jpg" />
                </para>
                <para class="block">The return for February is incomplete, as one of the States only furnished a return up to the 19th. It will be noticed that, for the three months in which the Fusion Government have occupied the Treasury bench, the enlistments have been the lowest on record. No doubt that is  due to the fact that the public of this country have naturally a diminished amount of confidence in the Administration, because for that period' the average per month has been less than 4,000. To recapitulate, the total enlistments for seventeen months has been 164,088, and the total casualties since the beginning of the war to date have been about 5,0,000. I am not quite sure of the exact figures for the period, but they approximate to that number, showing that the enlistments for the period under review were 114,088 more than the total casualties since the war began in August, 1914. To spread statements broadcast to the effect that Australia has quitted the war is grossly unfair ; and to charge the party on. this side with any other desire than to win the war is also a most unfair statement to* make. It is only since the present Government came, into office that the average enlistments have dropped to below 4,000 per month. During the whole period under review the average enlistments exceeded 9,000 per month. Up to dateAustralia has taken a very creditable part in the war, and I have no doubt that,, when the irritation to which the manhood of this country were subjected by the ill-advised action of the Hughes Administration in endeavouring to foist conscription on the country- has died away, the enlistments will again go up to and exceed 5,000' per month. Therefore there is no justification for the statements made by Ministerialists to the effect that the party on this side is opposed to' winning the war. On the contrary, if honorable senators examine the figures quoted by me, they will see that they, and they alone, are responsible for the diminished number of enlistments during the past three months. </para>

                        <para>- It is a perfectly correct deduction to make. It is all very well for some honorable senators to. make wild statements in out-of-the-way corners, where they may or may not be reported, and where some of the public may believe them. But here, where honorable senators are confronted with facts obtained, from: official sources, they cannot deny, the accuracy of the statement made, nor can they deny the accuracy of the deduction drawn. </para>

                        <para>- The statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> that the reduced enlistments are due to the fact that the harvest was being gathered would be all right did ' we not have the figures for a similar period of last year. In that period, the enlistments in December were 9,307; in January, 22,688; and in February, 18,665; whereas, during the last three months, instead of there being 9,307 enlistments in December, there were only 2,617. I presume that the harvest this year was gathered in much the same way as it was gathered last year. The figures for January, 1916, were 22,688. </para>

These figures prove beyond the possibility of doubt that, while the Labour party held the reins of office, the men of this country were prepared to freely offer their services in its defence. </para>

It is no libel, but merely a recital of facts which may be very unpleasant reading to honorable senators opposite, but which nevertheless ought to be disclosed in the interests of truth and justice. It is a pity in one way that the total figures since the commencement of the war to date have not been disclosed. But as honorable senators are aware, there are good and sufficient reasons why that' ought not to be done. I for one am not going to trespass in that regard. I have  quoted  all the figures I have been able t'o obtain from official sources to show what has been done, and to give the lie for ever  to  those who say that the enlistments today are not sufficient to more than fill up the gaps which are being made. </para>

Nothing has been done, and apparently nothing is to be done in connexion with this question, excepting to continue what the Government are pleased to term a Protectionist policy. It is really a high revenue Tariff policy, which was never designed or intended to- prohibit the» introduction of foreign-made goods. The idea underlying the Protectionist policy is really to obtain as much revenue as possible from the importation of goods in order that the imposition of taxation in. other directions may be avoided. </para></speech>

Victoria, from the Australian view-point, may be regarded as the home of Protection, but Victoria has- _ always secured the bulk of her revenue through the Customs House. The same policy is continued to-day by the Federal Government, not in order to encourage,  foster, and build up local industries, but solely With a view to keeping the Treasury full. That is the objective behind all Protectionist policies, not only here but elsewhere. </para>

                        <para>- Revenue tariffism, either high or low, is the proper name for Protection. Practical Protection and high revenue tariffism are synonymous and  interchangable  terms in these modern times. We have only to look at the returns of revenue through the CustomsHouse year by year to recognise that. The revenue derived in  .his way has ranged from £10,000,000 per annum, at the time of the establishment of Federation, up to £16,600,000 per annum, which is the estimate of Customs revenue for this; year. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that they have proposed a tax of 5s. per head on male cats, and the taxation of female cats at a lower rate. The matter is not of very much importance, but I would not seriously oppose a proposal of the kind. If we are to adopt a Protectionist policy that will suit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> we must look elsewhere for the £16,500,000 of revenue which we now derive from Customs and Excise. </para>

                        <para>- We have an income tax at the present time. A proposal to tax wealth, and other taxation proposals, have been suggested, but the Government have so far made no proposal to tax the most important revenue-producing asset available. I refer, of course, as I have done before, to the refusal of the Government to propose an increased land tax. I find that while the revenue from the. land tax for 1915-16 was £2,040,436, it is estimated that this year it will amount to only £1,900,000. </para>

                        <para>- They do not anticipate to get more than £350,000 from the entertainments tax. I listened this afternoon while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> made a very ridiculous and absurd statement. T interjected in an unparliamentary way that his statement was untrue, but I withdraw that now. What I meant to say was that it was quite inaccurate. The honorable senator said, in effect, that the lands of this country belong to the people who are living here. That statement is quite inaccurate. This country does not belong to the Australians. The more frequently that statement is pressed home the better. We are told by the Chief Electoral Officer that there are in Australia 2,750,000 electors, whilst the Commonwealth Statistician informs us that the total number of land-owners in the Commonwealth is only about 750,000. It is therefore clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> in saying that the people of this country own Australia makes a statement that is very wide of the mark. It is clear that there are at least 2,000,000 adults in Australia who do not own any land at all. </para>

                        <para>- When the honorable senator tells us that the people of this country own Australia I am reminded of the story of a land-owner who was going towards his estate in the company of a man who owned no land at all. The land-owner said, "You and I own all this area over here." The other man said, " You are quite right, you own it all, and I own no pant of it." I again remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> that the people of Australia do not own the lands of Australia, and that there are more than 2,000,000 adults in Australia who own no land at all. </para>

No matter how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> may try to smother up the position, the people of this country do not own Australia1. Only a very limited number do. </para>

                        <para>- But not in an actual sense. After a terrific struggle, lasting over twelve months, both Houses agreed, shortly after the war began, to the issue of a war census card, requiring each person to fill in a return showing the value of the land held by him in Australia. The progress return furnished here a few days ago showed the total unimproved value of land in the Commonwealth, as returned by the owners, to be £446,000,000. The number of people holding estates of a less value than £200 was about 647,000, so that the balance of the £446,000,000 worth was held by a comparatively limited number of people. The Government have given no indication of their intention to bring down a tax on this enormous amount of wealth. Any Government that proposes an amusement tax, or a war-time profits tax, or a cat tax, is not worthy of much consideration when the whole of the lands of Australia are' let off annually with a paltry payment of £1,900,000. The time is ripe for courageous men, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> to tell the people of the Commonwealth that he is in favour of a land tax sufficiently heavy to force into proper use estates like those held by the Van Diemen's Land Company, mostly held, I understand, by absentee Scotchmen. </para>

                        <para>- I was there a little while ago, and endeavoured to ascertain the value of some portions of the Van Diemen's Land Company's estates. I learnt that not far from Burnie, the company refused to permit any Australian to settle on any part of their land sufficiently large for a suburban homestead unless he was prepared to pay a licence of from £150 to £200. The company are typical of all the land-owners of Australia, who, more than anything else, are  preventing the development of this continent. The only thing that will compel the ' owners of large estates to make satisfactory use of them, or dispose of them at reasonable prices to those who will', is the imposition of a sufficiently heavy,, straightout land-values tax. The Protectionist policy, so vigorously and persistently advocated is diametrically opposed to any taxation whatever upon land values. </para>

                        <para>- I quite understand that the practical aspect of the question is unsatisfactory; but I want to pull aside the veil which hides these Protectionists-, and show them up in their true colours. I say, without fear of successful contradiction, that the professed Protectionists are really anti-land-taxers; . because they are the friends of the land monopolists and the land sharks, and the enemies of the landless workers. They are determined to make it as costly as they can, to those who do not own any land, to get possession of a piece. </para>

I feel the loss of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> advocacy on this question more than anything else. He, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> myself, and a few others,, if we stood on the platform together, could impress on the people of.

Estates of less value than £5,000 total in value more than £256,000,000. It  is  most anomalous than other commodities should be taxed while land to that extent escapes scot-free. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator and others who advocate a high revenue Tariff, do so knowing full well that so. long as they can keep the Treasury full no Government will impose further taxation. I remember the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> See, one of the friends of the working man in New South Wales, and one of our ardent Protectionists, stating that if we only got a 10 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, we should hear no more of a' land tax. He knew what he was talking about, and was not afraid to express his opinions. The time has come when the people should ask the Senate; which is more representative of the working men of the Commonwealth than any other Parliament in Australia, to make those who own Australia contribute to the national revenue in . proportion to the value of country they possess. I hope I have said enough to show that there is nothing behind this Protectionist cry except the raising of high revenue with the object of keeping the Treasury coffers full, and thereby avoiding the necessity of compelling the owners of Australia to pay taxation in proportion to their stake therein. </para>

                    O'LOGHLIN (South Australia) [9.25]. - Having been away for six months, I have been out of  a considerable amount of the hurly-burly and contention which arose from the conscription movement. It is due to myself and my party that I should put my position on the developments that have taken place during my absence - so far as I have been able to master them - at the earliest possible moment I am sorry that I have come into an atmosphere of contention, and feel that I should like to go to the war again, for the sake of peace. In this- connexion I am reminded of the story of two men in the trenches who were discussing the question of why they enlisted. One of them, a single man, said that he always liked war, and had, therefore, enlisted.  His  companion, a married man, said that he was always in favour of peace, and that was the reason he had enlisted. It seems to rae that there is more war here in Australia than there is at the front, and that it is being conducted more bitterly. I do not know how the statement got abroad, but I ..learned that during the referendum campaign I was classified as a conscriptionist. Now, I made my position on this question perfectly clear before I left Adelaide. Indeed, I was told . that as an old parliamentary hand I was rather premature in making my views known, and that there was no need for me to have committed myself in the way that I did. The fact is that, as far back as July of last year, a circular was sent out by the Trades and Labour Council of South Australia, asking members of Parliament to declare themselves on that question. Now, the Trades and Labour Council is not the supreme body in Labour matters - it is the United Labour party. Consequently there was no obligation on my part to give a definite reply to that circular. As a matter of fact, most of the South Australian representatives in the State 'Labour party sent a joint reply to it, stating that the matter was a Federal one, and would be dealt with by the Federal party. But I put my position quite clearly at that time, and I propose to read the statement that I then made. It is as follows: -

                <para class="block">Honorable senators will see that that is  a  complete and straight-out expression of my views on conscription. At the same  time I recognise that the question is one on which there is room for a difference of opinion, and I am not prepared to brand as undemocratic or disloyal to the Labour party those who hold a different view from myself upon it. When I left Australia the Parliamentary Labour party was a united one. We had differences of opinion, as all the country knows, upon the question of conscription. But the majority of the party had decided that that question was a proper one to refer to the people for their decision, and that was the policy which the Government were adopting when I left Australia - a policy with which I was iri complete accord. Before leaving these shores I wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> telling him that he could pair me on that question on all divisions on the Referenda Bill. Nobody else had any authority to pair with me, except that I had agreed to pair with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> upon any matter in respect of which the Labour party as ' a body was concerned. </para>

                    O'LOGHLIN.I understand that the censorship was not exercised in the way that we had a right to expect. I come now to the Prime Minister, about whom I am going to say, more in sorrow than in anger, some very straight things, because he is a man whose abilities I admire, and who, with pen and tongue, has done as much for the Labour party and the Labour cause as any man in it. When 1 returned to Australia, the first thing I did was to interview
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline>
                    who was the leader of my party in the Senate when I left here. I have since had a talk with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline>
                    who represents the other division of the Labour party in this Chamber. I have , also seen the Prime Minister ; and had a conversation with him. It was my duty to take counsel with the leaders of the movement on both sides. I want to say this) - and I speak as an old (parliamentary hand, and a man with Cabinet experience - that in the crisis before the referendum was taken, the Prime' Minister acted in such a way as to recall the saying that " those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad." I can find absolutely no justification for his action in regard to the electoral questions which he proposed to put at the referendum, and upon which, as far as I can learn from
                    <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline>
                    he decided without consulting his party or his Cabinet in any way. Now, the Prime Minister is not a Kaiser, who can put a rescript before his Cabinet and say, "Sign that," without consulting its members. Certainly an important departure such as he proposed should have been placed before his colleagues prior to being embodied in a regulation. That proposal struck at one of the most sacred of our institutions-1- the freedom of the ballot. It seems to me that the conduct of the Prime Minister at that crisis was pure  Kaiserism,  and I am opposed to Kaiserism, whether that Kaiserism comes from William Morris Hughes or William Hohenzollern. The next development was that after the disruption of the Labour party,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline>
                    and his followers formed a new Ministry, and took on themselves the responsibility of government without having a majority in either House of the Legislature. That is a. position which cannot be justified. There may be examples of it having been done before. I remember that at a crisis in South Australia not long after the death of our Labour leader, Tom Price, as he was popularly called, a Coalition Ministry was formed, in which Labour had a deciding force.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peake,</inline>
                    the present Leader of the Liberal party, subsequently jumped the claim of Labour to the leadership, and, having been Acting Premier while
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price</inline>
                    was on his death-bed, was sent for by the Governor and formed a Ministry. With only nine members of his own party in the House of Assembly, he formed and carried on the government of that State with the support of the Opposition. I remember how my colleagues from South Australia denounced and ridiculed the idea of such a position being taken up under constitutional government, and I do not know how they can justify the present position in this Parliament, except on the familiar ground that when things are different they are not the same. To-day with a Labour majority in both Houses of this Parliament I find a Government in power in .which Labour is in a minority. It is not a Labour Government, it is not a Hughes Government, and it is not a Hughes-Cook Government. But it is a Cook-Hughes Government. As a pledged Labour man, I am concerned with the Labour policy, but I want to know if that policy is secure, with a Ministry constituted as is the present one? I am told that it is a War Ministry. Now I place the vigorous prosecution of the war before all other questions. I believe that both political parties are agreed upon that matter. The fact that we have been able to carry on the war as well as we have done is due to effect having been given to the Labour policy. It was du© to that policy that, at the outbreak of war. we had a large number of men already trained in military duties. We must also be fair, and admit that no man has done more than the present Prime Minister to develop that policy. With regard to the war, I say that is our first consideration. No party, and no
                </para>
                <para class="block">Ministry, will have my support unless  their  are prepared to carry on vigorously until" we have attained what we are looking for - a victorious conclusion of this conflict. It is impossible, however, to divide public policy into watertight compartments. Both parties may be agreed as to the wisdom of conducting the war vigorously, but it is impossible to prevent other questions from: obtruding. In order to carry on the war,, we must have means, and that brings in. the question of taxation, upon which the Labour party and the Liberal party areas widely separated as the poles. We believe in making the wealthy people bear their full share of the burden. We say that, as the working men are giving their lives in the cause, that the wealthier sections of the community should provide the funds, and on this question, of course, we have always been divided from the Liberal, party. </para>

                    O'LOGHLIN.I hope my honorable friend will not think, from what I have said, that. I suggested that all classes have not done their  share; but the fact remains that the working classes represent a big majority of the men at the front. I suppose 80 or 90 per cent, of the men in the trenches are wage-earners. I freely admit, of course, that the wealthy classes have sent their share of men, but they are,, and must necessarily be, in the minority.. As I have already said, it is impossible,, in carrying on a war, to prevent  other  questions from  cropping up.  For instance,, industrial problems may arise at any moment, and upon this question the Liberal and the Labour parties have always been divided. Other questions must also arise. Commodities are rising in price, and, although wages have been increased to a certain extent, the cost of ' living has gone up tremendously. Then there is the question of combinations, trusts, and profit mongering. The Labour party have .been up against these matters  for years, and in all their struggles they have had very little help from the Liberal party. I want to know how these matters are to be dealt with by this Fusion » Ministry.

I have no faith in Coalition Governments, but, apparently, I do not feel quite so strongly on this matter as the Eight Honorable William Morris Hughes, because I notice in his

I trust, therefore, that the Government will respect the verdict of the Senate, and will not attempt to burke an inquiry.

                    O'LOGHLIN.The present situation is a very sad one for those who have the cause of Labour at heart. It seems to me that as a divided party we must go down, and that after twenty years in the wilderness, and when we had come into our own, and had the country at our back, with indorsement of our policy in both Federal and State Parliaments, because of divisions in our ranks we are to be thrown back and will have to spend another time in the wilderness before we come into our own again. I have no fear for the Labour cause, ultimately. After we have learned the lessons from our divisions we will come back to power, for our policy is the true policy for Australia, and is bound to triumph in the end. I wish now to refer to the question, of conscription and some statements which have been made concerning the vote of soldiers at the front. I am anti-conscriptionist, and it might be said that possibly my judgment is warped by that fact; but I have come in contact with officers and men who have been at the front. I had several officers on board coming" back with me. They were strong, and I might also say, violent conscriptionists. They had been amongst the soldiers at the front and on Salisbury Plain, and some of them said, with disgust, that they found the majority of soldiers everywhere were against conscription. That is my experience, and I must say that I was surprised at it, because I thought that men at the front would probably take the view, " I am doing my little bit, and I want the other fellow to come and do his share."

                        <para>- It is hard to account for the opinion amongst the men. I met Australian ladies who were devoting their time to war work in London. They were strong conscriptionists, and they told me that they were astonished to find that the men they spoke to in the hospitals and elsewhere were against conscription. I heard most extraordinary statements concerning the votes of our soldiers in France. This matter was in the hands of the military authorities, and there were no scrutineers on behalf of the anti-conscriptionists. </para>

                    O'LOGHLIN.Absolutely none. There is another statement which, perhaps, the Minister may be able to confirm, and that is that while copies of the manifesto issued by the Government were made available to the troops - and it was very proper that the men should receive all the information possible - the Premier of Queensland was asked as an anti-conscriptionist to draft a manifesto or document, to be sent over, giving the other side of the question, and it was censored and was not allowed to be sent on. Does the honorable senator know whether that statement is true or not ?

                        <para> - These are statements which I heard, and which I now give for what they are worth. Twice when the question of Home Rule has been brought before the Senate I have been away, and as an ardent Home Ruler I desire to state my position. On this subject, of course honorable senators know where I am. I wish to say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy</inline> President,that I entirely associate myself with the motion which you have moved on two occasions. I think it is right that I should take this course, because I was away when each motion was submitted. Although a year or two back, when this question came up in the Senate and in another place, the statement was made that we had no right to interfere in Imperial matters, it will be found that the trend of opinion in the Old Country now is that the self-governing Dominions should be asked to assist in the settlement of this very difficult and contentious question. The action which you, sir, have taken here- will be greatly appreciated, and have due weight in the Old Country. We are practically invited to express our opinion on the subject. A few years ago there might have been some force in the statement that we were interfering with a matter with which we had no right to interfere. In my consultation with the Minister for Defence, the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> no attempt has been made to dope me or use any influence with me. I have not been offered any good billet or anything. Both Ministers and the leader of the Opposition have admitted that this was a question in respect to which I am fairly entitled to take time for consideration, and to get further information. As regards the appeal to the country, I do not know what the policy of either party is. It is too big a question for me to take a side on until I know fully and fairly what is the position of both parties.' I think that I have put my position before honorable senators fairly and frankly. </para>

At the same time we all must admit that our fellow citizens who are fighting our battles at the front should even, at the risk of extreme difficulty and inconveni-' ence, have every opportunity to express their opinion on any matter affecting their country. </para>

I had seven officers, and only four, I think, commanding units had to do with the taking of the vote. Each officer was Returning Officer for his own particular unit. As a man who had some knowledge of electoral papers, I explained the papers to the officers, and told them exactly what they had to do. I pointed out how they had to initial' the papers, and so on. I just went round to see that the thing was working fairly. I interfered in no other way. I had to sign the final papers and send them on. </para>

                        <para>.- I suppose that I can proceed now with my speech. When I looked at my instructions for taking the referendum on the transport, I found that the votes had to be delivered to Brigadier-General McC. Anderson, in London, on a certain date. On consultation with the captain I found it was very improbable that we would reach London on that date, and, consequently, if it was essential that the votes should be in by that time, they would have been lost. I wired back from Adelaide to the Returning Officer, pointing out this difficulty and suggesting that I would get the vote completed before we reached Fremantle, and that if he would arrange for an electoral officer to meet me and take the ballot-boxes they could deal with the votes here or send them to London by a mail steamer, which would arrive there in time. When I got to Fremantle the Returning Officer, or his deputy,  was  waiting. I had the voting completed, the ballot-boxes sealed, and everything ready. I handed them over to the officer. Whether they went to London or not I do not know, but they were taken off my hands. </para>

I only referred to them because there is a proposal in connexion with the forthcoming election that the votes of the soldiers should be taken. I made the reference in order to show the need for taking care that there is no possibility of a suggestion being- made that there has been any underhand work. </para>

                        <para>- Remembering what I had heard from officers and others, I was. astonished at the statement being made that the vote was in the affirmative. This has drawn me off the- track a little more. Honorable senators, because of their interjections, have themselves to blame if I make my speech longer than I intended. The position of Canada has been referred to; and in this connexion I may say that when I was in South Africa I was interviewed by the press, with regard, to military matters in Australia, and so on. While I was there, a recruiting meeting -was held, at which a colonel made a certain statement in order to encourage the men of South Africa to enlist. So far as assistance at the Front is concerned, South Africa has not done a great deal ; but we have to bear in mind that she had a very big job. on hand to clear- out the Germans who were at her own door; and she has performed that task very thoroughly. The colonel to whom I refer, without, I am sure, any idea of reflecting- upon the good work done by Australia, said in the course of his recruiting speech, " Australia has sent her thousands, and Canada has sent her hundreds of thousands." I took exception to this through the press, and, so far as. the figures in m.y possession would allow, compared what was done by Australia with what had been done, by Canada. I say that none of the overseas Dominions, of the Empire has done anything like so well, as Australia, has done in this great struggle in which we are engaged. Whilst I was in London, a. statement was made- of the number of men registered and enrolled in Canada, up to the end of November, and the number was fixed at 385,000. I reckoned, that at that time Australia had enrolled quite 300,000 men, though I do not say that that number had been sent to . the* Front. I pointed out that the population of Canada was at least 50 per cent, more than that of Australia, and om these figures alone it is clear that the. assistance Australia has rendered is greater- than that rendered bv Canada in  proportion to. population. </para>

I explained that we had sent, out. soldiers four times as far, and at considerably greater expense; and I added that, in addition to the Military Forces we had supplied!, account must be» taken- of our Fleet,, which, though a.. small one, represents, a very expensive item to Australia. </para>

                    should understand;, that I was commenting upon a statement made which would lead to the impression that Canada had done a great deal more than Australia. I must say that I have been astonished, to find, since I have returned, that a great many Australians seem to be of the opinion that Australia has disgraced herself. I think that it is fair to compare what we have done with what "has been done by other parts of the Empire; and. though I should be glad if we had done more-, I contend, that we have done a great deal, and quite as much as has been done 'by any other part of the Empire. What I am concerned1 about now is that while the election cam- 'paign is going on, recruiting must practically come to a stand-still. We cannot be fighting two battles at the same time. It is important to remember that the reservoir from which we draw our recruits' is gradually becoming- less, and. we. cannot expect to secure recruits now in the same numbers as we did at the beginning of the. war. I have put my position- frankly, as I understand it.. I think: that honorable senators generally will recognise that it is a difficult position, and that I can say no more than I have done, in view of the developments which have taken place up to the present time. The course I shall follow in the future must be a matter for further consideration.

                        <para>- That is the position which I have taken up all along. I have never counted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> with the other side, and it certainly was grossly unfair for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie to have done so in the absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin.</inline> It shows the tactics to which our opponents are willing to stoop when they try to kidnap the vote of a man at the front doing his duty to the country by endeavouring to pair him with an honorable senator on this side. Could anything be lower, meaner, or more contemptible than that? </para>

It is a mean thing to malign a sick senator from this side in his absence by imputing to him the possibility that he would vote against his party. I refuse to believe that he would until I have evidence to the contrary.

Any one who reads his speech will know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> made it abundantly clear that there are reasons which make the demand more imperative than ever for a close investigation into everything' surrounding the taking of the Anzac vote. All along members of this party have had grave suspicions that they did not get a fair deal at the Front. I believe that they did not, arid if the Minister for Defence thinks otherwise the means to settle the matter are in his own hands. </para>

Whatever may be the case the people of Australia have a right to know before the elections, and if they do not get the information now, they will be given the information after the elections by a Labour Government. There is another matter to which I wish to refer, and which I should not have mentioned if it had not been referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin.</inline> It was rumoured at the Front- </para>

                        <para>- A cable was lodged in the General Post Office, Brisbane, for which £25 was paid, endeavouring to put before the men at the front the case against conscription. Up to a fortnight ago, according to the information in my possession, neither had the cable reached the front, nor had the £25 been refunded. That is a scandalous position, which shows the despicable tactics to which the Government will stoop, and when we remember this case we are not surprised to hear the recent rumours of scandal. A party could foe subjected to no . greater injustice than that its case should be denied access to the men, while the case of the Government had the freest access to them. There were at the front Liberals and Labour men, conscriptionists, and anticonsciptionists, and it was most unfair that the Government should deny to those sons of Australia who were prepared to lay down their lives for this country and the Empire, the right to have a fair case put before them by their countrymen. </para>

He is one of the parties named in the count, but I am not condemning him. The Labour- party had1 a- majority in the Senate, and that, majority mysteriously disappeared1. There arose in its place quite as mysteriously a Liberal majority. It is difficult to say how that occurred.. The people of Australia want to know how it was- managed, and1 therefore we should have an inquiry. What are the facts?' Ex-S'enator Ready- </para>

                        <para>- I know it hurts the honorable senator. He is squirming.  His  mind is in an awful state, and I can well imagine the fever from which he is suffering, but the  more he kicks and twists and squirms the worse it will be for him. The quieter he keeps the easier it will be to extract the cause of the trouble. Ex-Senator Ready was a Labour man. On the 23rd February, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee,</inline> the Premier of Tasmania, received a telegram from, the Prime Minister to meet him in Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee,</inline> who was then, I believe, at a picnic, broke off his engagement there and hurried, at a breakneck pace, to catch the train and boat, and met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in Sydney on the Monday. It is said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was <inline font-style="italic">in&lt;</inline> the most affable frame of mind', and quite prepared to discuss the questions of wheat and hops, particularly hops. They discussed those matters, hut the remarkable thing is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> in his statement in another place, made it clear that on that day, Monday, 26th February, he knew that a certain senator would resign. He also knew that that senator was likely to be a Tasmanian, and, to use, his own phraseology, he made his arrangements accordingly. The people of this continent will want to know on the 5th May next how it was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> knew on Monday, 26th February, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> would resign his seat on the 1st March, as a result of an illness which seized him on the 28th February. That is a proposition which nobody but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> will be able to solve. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> became ill here on the 28th February, and resigned on the following day, the 1st March. The fact remains that on Monday, 26th February, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> seemed to know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> would get very ill on Wednesday, 2.8th February, and would resign his position on the following day. I do. not know how he managed to become aware of that fact. Anyhow, it remains for the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to solve this problem to the satisfaction of the people of Australia before the 5th- May.. Until they answer the question satisfactorily, it will be very difficult for them to hold their own. That case by itself might, perhaps, have been passed over. We might have been simple enough . to have forgotten it but for the incident which  succeeded it - the most awful disclosures made by <inline font-weight="bold">'Senator Watson</inline> here on the Friday morning, which might, well be called " Black Friday."

I do not say that my mere statement of the case proves it; but I do say that, a serious charge such as this is entitled to the most serious treatment by this deliberative assembly.

                        <para>- Exactly. But we want the whole case investigated, and not an isolated part of it. Therefore the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has issued a writ against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> is mere bluff, because it will not serve the purpose which we seek, namely, the holding of a searching inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding the most discreditable scandal that has ever occurred in the political life of Australia. Even if the writ issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> meant a complete investigation, what does it involve? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> in order Lo have a trial at all, would have to go outside this Chamber and renounce its privileges'. I do not know what he is going to do in the matter, but I have no doubt as to' what I should do in similar circumstances. If I were so  charged I say unreservedly that I would avail myself of all the privileges and immunities which this Parliament grants to me. I will tell honorable senators why. The very existence of this Parliament ae a Parliament, and of the mother of Parliaments, rests upon the fact .that members of Parliament have privileges and immunities. In the Bill of Rights itself, from which Parliament takes its liberties, section 9 declares - </para>

                    <para class="block">That the freedom of speech in debates or proceedings in the Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or place out of Parliament. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">That passage is to be found on page 515 of the Restoration of the Bill of Rights, <inline font-style="italic">English Constitutional History,</inline> Taswell  and Langley. It serves to show upon what we base our claim when we object to abandon our right to plead privilege. What would an abandonment of that right mean? It would mean that as a party we should cease to exist within twelve months. We should be subject to wholesale blackmail at the hands of combines and monopolies, with the result that in a short time there would be no Labour party at all. Had there been no privilege in the Parliaments, the Labour party, either State or Federal, could not have been brought into existence, because every man in public life is called upon to make statements concerning public matters, and no man would have been able to do his duty if he had been subjected to actions at law. Our political opponents have tried, by the spending of their unlimited cash, to crush us at the ballot. How much easier would it be for them to spend that cash in libel actions? We know that, no matter how wealthy an individual might be, he would have no hope in a campaign of this sort. Take a case in point: Suppose a writ were issued against me for libel to-morrow, and, thinking I had a good case, I said, " Yes, I will defend it." Suppose I refused to plead privilege, that my case went to the Law Courts, and .that I Had secured a verdict, as perhaps I ought to on the merits of my case. That would be all right, but I would not have won then, because my opponent would probably appeal to the Supreme Court. Perhaps 1 could beat him there, but still I would not have won, as he might then take the case to the High Court of Australia. Suppose I beat him again. I still would not have won, because he might appeal to the Privy Council. Being a poor man, what, in the name of God, sort of chance would I have of following him through all the ramifications of our Courts of. law? He could persecute and crucify me, as every man in this party would be crucified if the trusts, combines, and monopolies could get at them outside the privileges and immunities of Parliament. Our opponents, therefore, when they say to us, " Come outside," know what they are talking about. Money talks. They know that money is behind them. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- Well, I am not saying that, but I say that it would be worth millions to trusts and combines if they could get control of this Senate for one year. They could spend £100,000 or £500,000 to wipe us out and crucify us. Who are the men who are inviting us to go outside and refuse to take advantage of the privileges and immunities of Parliament? And who was the man to take advantage of these privileges? William Morris Hughes climbed to the leadership of his Government, backed up by his party, but he could never have built up his party if he had not enjoyed the privileges and immunities of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- If this were a charge made by a public man against a private individual, it might be different. Never in my public career, in the State or Federal Parliaments, have I taken advantage of privilege to malign the character of any man who had "not the opportunity of defending himself. But this is a totally different matter. It involves the honour of every member here, and we ought to be jealous of the honour of Parliament. The Government that refuses to probe this matter to the bottom deserves to be sent to obscurity, and I hope to God they will be sent there. </para>

The Government, knowing that they had violated all the canons of politics, and that they had flouted the expressed will of the people, dared not face their masters, so they resorted to every despicable method they could employ to prolong the life of this Parliament, and thus save themselves from the fury of the electors and judgment upon their treachery and cowardice.

                        <para>- They did not approve of it. I say this attempt to prolong the life of Parliament was immoral and cowardly- It was taken in order that the Government might shelter behind the privileges of Parliament. They said, " We must not have an election now, because it would involve party strife during the war." Anybody who knows anything about this matter must realize that no party has done more to create party strife during this war than the men opposite. What are the facts? In 1914 a double dissolution was precipitated. After that decision was arrived- at the Empire became involved in war, so an offer was made on behalf of the Labour party to the then Liberal party to cease party strife, to call off the elections, and prosecute the war. Did they do that ? No. They thought that, by a monopoly of patriotism and judicious flag-flapping, they would be able to wipe the Australian Labour party out at the polls, so they determined to go on with the elections regardless of the consequences to the nation. </para>

                        <para>- But if it was good enough to do recently, it was good enough to do in 1914, because at that time the war was at a more critical stage than it is now. Our valiant Army was then making its immortal retreat from Mons, the German guns were thundering outside Paris, and the enemy warships had not been driven off the Pacific. We were in a more desperate plight then than we are now, and although we asked the Liberal Government then to cease party strife and allow the two parties to proceed with the prosecution of the war, they rejected the offer, and went on with the elections. Since 1914 also we find that on every conceivable occasion the Liberal party have pursued our party with the ferocity of tigers, in their attempt to capture our seats. We had a notable example of this when  they  fought for the  seat  of the late  Hon.  John Arthur, a member of the late Labour Ministry, but that seat is now in the possession of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hampson.</inline> The Liberals also fought for the seat held by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jolley,</inline> a member of this party, and they succeeded in capturing it; They fought also for the seat of our then leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher. If any seat was entitled to be held by the Labour party, surely it was that seat. Worse than that, the men who are now talking about ceasing party strife were the men who involved this country in the bitterest, the fiercest, and the most deplorable struggle that has ever taken place in Australia. I refer to the conscription campaign of October last. Surely these men can no longer charge the Labour party with being responsible for party strife, because, if any  men have taken advantage of their position to create party feeling those gentlemen are members of the present Coalition Government. </para>

                        <para>- Of course we did. I voted against it, and I would vote against it a thousand times. When I was speaking on the Military Service Referendum Bill I pointed out that every man who was then following <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in that unholy alliance would soon be found in a Coalition party. I said that they were burning their boats as far as the Labour movement was concerned, and .that they would find themselves in a political no man's land, exposed to the onslaughts df both sides, or be forced behind the ram parts of Liberalism for protection. That prophecy has come to pass much quicker than I expected it would, for we now have the deplorable spectacle of 29 members of this Parliament, men who were returned upon a definite Labour pledge, sheltering themselves in the trenches of the Liberal party. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, that is the position of those who are in this immoral - I might almost call it putrid - Coalition. We find that the old Tory party are in an overwhelming majority. It is axiomatic that the policy of every Government must be dictated by the majority of the men behind them. Once a man goes into a Coalition in which the majority is a Tory majority, it does not matter what he says or tries to explain, he cannot get away from the fact that he is bound by a policy which must inevitably be coloured by the majority. That means that the present Coalition and the members of it who seceded from our party are going to support the trampling of Labour principles underfoot, and the resurrection of the old anti-Labour and anti-Australian policy. That is the position we find to-day. I am not overstating the case when I say that the majority of the men in the Ministerial party are anti-Australian and anti-Labour. Everybody knows it quite well. What have the gang forming the Coalition done that they should- be entitled to get in by the " early door " to place, power, and pay. Everybody knows that the majority behind the Government to-day would, if they had their way, have made it impossible to have a White Australia. We would have the kanakas back to-morrow if the majority behind the Government could have their way. We would have cheap labour, and Australians brought down to the standard of the kanakas and the chows. If they get an indorsement of their policy I question, if that programme will not be inaugurated. Do we owe anything to a majority of the men on the other side in the matter of possessing the freest franchise in the world ? These men opposite fought with all their might against the right of the adult population to a vote. Yet these are the men who are in power to-day. We know very well that the old-age and invalid pensions would not be in force if men like <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine and <inline font-weight="bold">-Sir John</inline> Forrest, who are the bulwarks of the present Government, had had their way in the past. We know very well that they bitterly opposed the maternity allowance, and that it was men on the other side who described as profligates the women who received it. We know very well that they howled liked dancing dervishes against the creation oi a Commonwealth Bank, and the inauguration of an Australian note issue. All these things are still fresh in the memories of the people, and they are not likely to be obliterated before the 5th May. Here is the position: At the election in 1914 the people of this country gave the Labour party the right to control its destinies till the following election. They handed over the keys of office and the safe custody of Democracy to the Labour party. But, through the treachery of one man, the keys of the citadel of Democracy have been handed over to the enemy. What would be said of one pf our generals at the front if in an hour of distress he handed over his position or his men to the enemy ? Do you think that he could come back and justify his action by saying that he had quarrelled with his men or his officers? No; nothing like that could justify treachery.  His  undoubted duty would be to come back and hand over the keys of his position to the man from whom he received them. What is true of a general is equally true of William Morris Hughes. In 1914, the Labour party received from the people of this country the keys of the citadel of Democracy. They were transmitted from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes!</inline> Because of a quarrel with his party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has absolutely betrayed us, and treacherously handed over the keys of the citadel of Democracy into the hands of our enemies. If by any chance vote on the 5th May the control of this Parliament should fall into the possession, even temporarily, of the traditional enemies of Labour, and through that means these men may be able to undo the great work which the Labour party has done, generations yet unborn will live to curse the odious memory of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and the men who follow him. We are told that this Ministry is the Win-the-War party. In 1914 we, as a party, pledged ourselves to our leader that we would do everything in our power for the successful prosecution of the war. </para>

As a guarantee of the 6071a <inline font-style="italic">fides</inline> of this party in claiming that they desire to successfully prosecute the war, let me. remind honorable senators that when the war began the Liberal party, then in power, offered to send 20,000 men. to the assistance of the Empire. That was claimed as a wonderful achievement, and was applauded throughout Australia. When the Labour party came into power, a. month or so later, they offered to send men in division after division, until now they have sent oversea over .290,000 men. They have' sent them over a distance of 14,000 miles and. that is the greatest military exploit in the annals of history. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it was a very united Labour party. in those days, when it did this excellent work. Surely on that record, if any party is entitled to be called the " Win-the-War " party, we are entitled to that name. But we do not claim the name- I do not believe that any man or any party should claim a monopoly of that name. The mere fact of a particular party arrogating to itself the right to be called the " Win-the War " party creates- jealousy which must hamper us in the prosecution of the war. What we should do if we- want to successfully prosecute the war, is that every man and every party should give the fullest mode of praise to others for what they have done and propose to do. </para>

If he will keep quiet he will have an opportunity to reply much earlier than otherwise; Honorable senators opposite told ns that there must be a coalition Government in order to win the war. A coalition Government seldom accomplishes much. 1 do not know of any coalition Government that was ever worth twopence. The very absence of criticism which a coalition involves proves the undoing of most coalition Governments. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> led the Labour party after the 1914 elections some people proposed a coalition Government, and some of our friends on the other side were eager for it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> said that he would not have a coalition. He would not touch  the Liberals with a forty-foot pole. No  one will deny the fact that with the support of his party <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> conducted the war ably and well. He was able to do so without a coalition. He was succeeded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Hughes,</inline> and no one will deny that, when supported' by the Labour party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> carried on the war quite well for the succeeding twelve months.

                        <para>- Never mind about our pledges. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> while he worked with us, found that he could win the war without a coalition Government, but the moment our party had a quarrel with him he discovered the expediency of forming a coalition Government in order to win the war. The point I want to make is that if the Labour party as a party were entitled to the credit of successfully prosecuting the war from 1915 up to October last, they are equally entitled to the same credit now. I put my honorable friends opposite to the test by asking them this question : What are the present Government doing for the successful, prosecution of the war that was not being done by bur party when we were in power? Can the Minister for Defence or any other member of the party opposite point to one tiling which the present Government are doing for the successful prosecution of .the war that we were not doing before ! Honorable senators opposite advocated conscription. They said it was absolutely essential for the successful prosecution of the war, but short of a policy of conscription, which they have not the courage to openly advocate', is there anything they have done for the successful prosecution of the war. The present Government party are quite prepared to exploit &gt;' patriotism, and make political capital out of the military situation. Instead of being called the " win- the- war party " they should be called, as they are rightly called in the country, the "winthe -election party." That is what they are after all the time. Only a fortnight ago these people who are now being dragged before. their masters were doing all in their power to prevent the electors passing judgment' on their treachery to the people. But be it said to the honour of some members of this  Parliament, a majority was found here to kill that -plot. I have a word to say on the conscription policy of the present Government. I believe tEat another scheme is being hatched by the Government to foist conscription on the people of Australia as soon as ever they get Hie. opportunity to do so. If. any honorable senator is in doubt about that, let him listen, not to my words, but <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the policy of the Government as disclosed' in the statement made to this" Parliament and to the country. Here are the words of the statement: - </para>

The people of Australia will accept no more of his promises after the promise that he made in the House of Representatives on 15th July, 1916, when . he said, "In no circumstances would I agree to send men out of  thiB  country to fight against their will." </para><interjection>

William Morris Hughes cannot deny that on 15th July he said that in no circumstances would he force any man to go out of the country to fight against his will; and the man who broke that solemn promise given on the 15th July, 1915, may be expected to break any promise in the policy which lie. has given to tie electors. </para>

                        <para>- He has violated his sacred pledge. If the quotation which I have made from the policy of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Government is not enough to prove the intention to foist conscription on. the people, let us see what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine said at Dandenong. He said that he could not support any alliance that had not in the forefront of its policy the determination to enforce conscription. That statement does not look much like respecting the . opinion of the people. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, since making that statement, has been exalted by the present Government to one of the highest positions in the land. He has been chosen as a delegate to the Imperial Conference. This shows that his opinions fully harmonize with those of the present Government. Also, the fact that he is supporting the present Coalition that he said he would not support if it did . not have conscription in the forefront of its programme is further proof that the Government are indorsing his policy of out-and-out conscription. If there is still any doubt upon the point, let me show what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has said. Speaking at Adelaide, he said that if voluntarism proved a . failure, compulsion in some ' form would have to be resorted to. He said that he heartily approved of any appeal to the people on that issue. </para>

                        <para>- I am pleased that the honorable senator has reminded me of that. The Minister for . Trade and Customs, speaking at a meeting of the National Federation- - whatever that is - said that it had been a condition of the National Government before the double dissolution was arranged for that, no matter what happened, the verdict of the people given on the 28th October should be respected by the Government until that verdict was altered by the people; but, speaking for himself, he thought that one of the first things that should be done when the present Government returned to office after the elections would be to ask the people the same question again, and get an overwhelming vote of " Yes." I do not think that the Government would take the trouble to hold a referendum on the matter if they had the power to enforce conscription; but even . if they do, how will it be conducted? Seeing that on the last occasion they manipulated the ' censorship, suppressed articles in Labour journals, prevented public speakers from getting a fair deal, and issued secret regulations in order to secure the necessary vote, what, in the name of Heaven, will they do on this occasion? I know of nothing that the Government are not capable of doing if they have another opportunity in order to carry a referendum; and if the people of Australia are foolish enough to intrust, them again' with power, God pity them. In order to show that the. question of conscription is not dead, I wish to quote the remarks of a deputation of a women's recruiting committee that waited on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunter,</inline> the Acting Premier of Queensland, and besought him to embark on a policy of compulsion by first combing out the Public Service. </para>

The dog, resenting the intrusion on his slumbers, jumped up, and deprived the bird of all its feathers before, it could escape and retreat once more to its cage. When the old lady returned and saw her pet deprived of all its feathers, she exclaimed, " Hello -cookie ! What is up?" The parrot replied, " Too much talk, Missus." It is 'the same with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> With him it was a case of " Too much talk." . </para>

I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> to compel the honorable  senator to cease his interjections, so that they may not spoil my remarks.

                    ; Yes, dismissed. That would be putting them out of employment. It would be setting an example to private employers, and the men in question would then nave to get some other means of support, and many of them, I feel convinced, would enlist. That is not coercing them, but merely putting the position before them in a very forcible manner.
                </para><para class="block">That is the position which, certain ladies of Queensland take up on the question, and it shows that compulsion is not dead. It shows that the present Government are quite prepared, if  they  get the power, to resurrect and enforce it. It shows, further, that the people should be on their guard on the 5th May. I feel sick when I hear the supporters of the Government talk about respecting the verdict of the people. In 1914 the Labour party was returned to power with an overwhelming majority and ordered by the people to rule the destinies of Australia. In 1916 the people again gave a verdict, saying that there should be no military tyranny, no compulsion or conscription in Australia. Despite those two verdicts, given within the last two years, we have in power today a Government every member of which is either a Liberal or a conscriptionist. Thus the verdict of the people of Australia, when they said in the first place, " We shall not have the Liberals in power at any price," and secondly, "We do not want conscription," is being violated in a double sense. How can we expect such a Government to respect the opinions of the people of Australia. This is ample evidence, if the electors desire any. that these people are not prepared to respect the opinions of any one. Those who, like myself, are prepared to fight to the last gasp against military compulsion must be up and watching. Eternal vigilance is as much the price of liberty as it was in the days of yore. We have indeed to be more vigilant than ever with these men in power. I would warn the electors of Australia, and those of my own State in particular, against the machinations of a Government who are prepared to rob the people of the verdict  which  they so ably won on the 28th October last. That verdict is the most glorious in the history of Australia - a victory equal to some of those won by the Australians when they gained imperishable fame on the battlefields of Europe. When the history of this country comes to be written, no chapter will illuminate its pages more brightly or better than that in which it is told how the people of Australia, even in war time, said they were not going to be subjected to the iron heel of a military despotism. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I shall not look to my old friend for an inspiration when I require one. I propose now to deal with what is perhaps one of the most important phases of the policy of the Government, and one that must receive full consideration at the coming elections. I refer to the attitude which the Government have taken up on the question of the representation of Australia at the Imperial Conference. We were told that the matters to be dealt with at that Conference were urgent and extremely important, and that it would be necessary for Australia to have representation there. I believe that the matters to be dealt with at the Imperial Conference are urgent and extremely important, and that Australia should be properly represented there. Seeing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> said it was urgently necessary that Australia should be represented at the Conference, why did he- carry about in his pocket for days the invitation to the Conference without acquainting any of his supporters, or even his Cabinet, of the fact ? Why did he carry it about with him while he was trying to gain a political advantage over his opponents ? ' </para>

                        <para>- That makes it more definite still, and nails down <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's interjection. Here we have an urgent and important Imperial Conference, and find the Prime Minister of Australia hiding from the public, and denying to the press of Australia the right of publishing, the receipt of the invitation to attend it. If this Conference is important, and I believe it is, the greater the publicity given to it the better. The Prime Minister received this invitation in December last, but two months elapsed before he did anything in connexion with it. He was bargaining and huckstering, and haggling with the Liberals as to which party should have a majority in the Cabinet, in order that he might form a coalition before he went Home. He told us that matters involving the fate of the Empire were to be discussed at the Conference. Yet, while the Empire Conference was waiting to meet to deal with matters involving the Empire's fate, he was huckstering and bargaining with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> about portfolios. While tens of thousands of brave Australians were fighting for their lives, Cook, Hughes, and party were fighting for political spoils. That is the way in which the war is being conducted; that is how the Government intend to win the war. When they did decide to appoint representatives to the Conference, whom did they propose to send ? Who were the chosen of Australia to attend the Imperial War Conference - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> Is there a man in this Chamber who, on the eve of a general election, will say that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine is a fair representative of Australia to attend that Conference? Will the Vice-President of the Executive Council justify the sending of him ? There is silence on the part of my honorable friends opposite. Will the Assistant Minister justify the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine as a delegate to the Imperial Conference? Here is a man who fought unionism in Australia with the ferocity of a tiger, who did everything that he could to frustrate the ends of Democracy and to block the path of reform, who disfranchised the public servants of Victoria, drove them from their homes and families, and did all that he could to kill the platform of the Labour party. Can it be urged that he is a fit representative of a democratic community like Australia? Then there is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Patrick</inline> Lynch justify his appointment to the Imperial Conference? Will he support <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest as an able exponent of the principles of Democracy ? I have not much to say against him, except that he is an old political fossil. </para>

Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest was one of the few men who, only a few months ago, guaranteed to subscribe £100 a year for three years to fight the war taxation proposals of the late Government. Is that the kind of man we want to represent the interests of this great Commonwealth ? Now I come to William Morris Hughes. All I have to say against him is that Australia turned down conscription, and yet he is still a confirmed conscriptionist, and, consequently, would misrepresent Australia on the question of compulsory military service overseas. Upon that ground alone he has no right to attend the Imperial War Conference as one of our delegates. </para>

                        <para>- When we adjourned for supper I was pointing out that the three men who had been appointed by the present Government to attend the Imperial Conference were totally unrepresentative of Australia as I . know it. If any further evidence is required, we have the fact that three of them advocated conscription, which was rejected by the electors on the 28th October last, and that two of them, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine are members of a party which was defeated at the polls by the Labour party in 1914. It will be seen that all the selected men are political rejects; and if there was one reason more- than another why the life of Parliament should not be prolonged, it was that we should have men fresh from the polls to represent the people of Australia in the councils of the Empire. This Con7ference, which is even now being held, is the most far-reaching in character. Everybody admits - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> himself admits - that the fate of the Empire may depend on the solution of some of the questions to be discussed; and it is all the more necessary to see that our representatives are men who reflect the opinions, whatever they may be, of the majority of the people of this country. I claim that the three selected representatives do not come up to specification in this regard; and, therefore, it is most fortunate for Australia that there is to be an election before the departure of the delegates, whoever they may be, for the heart  of the Empire. Any one who, for the last twelve months, or since the outbreak of the war, has followed the development of public opinion at Home, must recognise that there is a growing tendency towards Imperial federation. This, I am sure, must have been observed by visitors from Australia, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> who had special opportunities for observation. I do not know why such an opinion has sa rapidly developed since the war began, but it is a fact. There is much involved in the adoption of such a policy, and we have to be very careful about entering into a federation which may make it impossible for us in the future to preserve our freedom, or develop this country in the way we think best. Ours is a peculiar Empire, made up, roughly speaking, of some 433,000,000 people, of whom -60,000,000 are white and 373,000,000 coloured; and in the Imperial Conference the question of a White Australia must ;arise. Australia contains only 5,000,000 white people, and we can see how we should stand in an Imperial Conference of About twenty delegates- on the basis of population. With 373,000,000 coloured people .as compared with 60,000,000 white people, the latter would be overwhelmed, and the White Australia policy would be in jeopardy. In addition to the White Australia policy there must, also, inevitably  arise the fiscal policy of Australia; indeed, the whole economic policy of the Commonwealth and the Empire would be in the melting pot. This is a dangerous position for Australia, and, therefore, we ought to be represented by the very best men we have. That is why I am so anxious that there should be an election before we send our representatives, so that they may go straight from the ballot-box. If we have such men, I shall electors to London, reflecting  the most recent public opinion as expressed at the not be afraid for the White Australia policy, feeling convinced that they will do their duty to this country. <inline font-style="italic">Nor</inline> shall I be afraid in regard to the fiscal problem if we have men there who are truly representative of Australian Democracy. In my opinion, the economic position of Australia would have been jeopardized had the three men I have mentioned been sent, but we shall have true representatives of Australian Democracy, provided the people of Australia have the good sense to return a Government fitted to make a proper selection. I am no advocate for a cast-iron Imperial Constitution, for I believe that the silken bonds of kinship are stronger, and will endure longer than any rigid Constitution. At the outbreak of the war the Dominions leaped like hounds to the aid of the Mother Country, and have nobly played their part; and the question is whether, under a rigid Constitution, they would have been equally prepared. We are doing very well as we stand; and the looser the scheme, and the more freedom we have, the more eager we shall be, in case of necessity, to go to the assistance of the Old Land. It is, therefore, absolutely necessary that at an Imperial Conference Australia should be represented by men who will take care that we are not unnecessarily or unduly fettered or shackled, and that we shall be allowed the same freedom as in. the past. There is just one other phase of the question to which I desire to refer before I conclude, and that is the necessity for making ample and adequate provision for our returned soldiers. I do not think there is a dissentient voice to the proposal that the men from the front are entitled to every consideration. My own opinion is that nothing it too good for the men who sacrificed their all by going to the front and risking their lives; and, therefore, when those of our boys who are spared return, we ought to be prepared to make suitable provision for them in their homeland. Before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and those who followed him left the Labour party, we had decided on a policy of repatriation of soldiers, which meant the raising of £10,000,000 by means of a wealth tax. The party were unanimous in regard to this - there was not a dissentient voice. </para>

                        <para>- However, the party, as a party, agreed on this wealth tax ; and what has caused the change of policy ? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> 'and those who followed him found themselves helpless and hopeless in their efforts to carry on the government of the country, and they coalesced with the Liberal party. Part of the price. for the support of the Liberal party was the abandonment of the wealth tax. It is said by the Liberals that such a tax is not necessary now, be-  cause there is no urgency for repatriation, and, therefore, the raising ot £10,000,000 may be postponed. That I regard as a deliberate side-tracking of the question, because I think it is most urgent that we should now do something to ameliorate the position of the soldiers who have returned, and prepare for the soldiers who are returning. The Labour party last year announced to Parliament that it was proposed to raise £10,000,000 by means of a wealth tax; but the proposal has now been abandoned as the price to be paid by Australia for the Coalition. </para>

            <para class="block">State of Affairs in Sydney. hundreds living on charity. </para>
            <para>Sydney. - Six hundred returned soldiers - one-tenth of the men who have been permanently invalided home from the battle front - are walking the streets, practically destitute, desperately but hopelessly seeking employment. To the dozen or- more war funds to which a generous public has subscribed since the outbreak of hostilities a total of over £2,500,000, the penurious soldier looks in vain for succour; he does not come, he is told, within their scope. To the newly-formed State National Government he has appealed fruitlessly for an opportunity to present, by means of a special deputation, the story of his sufferings. Despite the promises made him when he enlisted, the Federal Government has not in operation repatriation machinery which can deal effectively with his case. It is a blot on the national honour that men who at Gallipoli fought and bled to gain imperishable fame for their country are to-day, through sheer necessity, driven to assemble in pitiable queues to receive alms collected by public appeal by the Returned Soldiers' Association. To get among these men and listen to their stories is heartbreaking. One can understand their bitterness; the supreme shame to which they are being subjected. It is a tribute to the community that it has marked its disgust at legislative indifference by subscribing in little over a week £2,000 for their relief. But practically every penny of this has been distributed, and public charity, with the many calls it has on it, cannot be expected to maintain the burden indefinitely. Nor can the mere daily doles public charity makes available provide the unfortunate soldiers with the necessaries of life. That the men are legitimate sufferers cannot be denied, for the executive of the Returned Soldiers has made the fullest of inquiries into the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of each case, and the Dean of Sydney, who is  president  of that body, has personally aided in the investigations, the appeal to -the public, and the dispensation of assistance from the funds subscribed. Here are a few typical cases taken haphazard from the hundreds of appeal papers signed by the applicants. They graphically outline the situation - </para>

            <para>I could read at much greater length a description of the deplorable scenes witnessed amongst our returned soldiers in Sydney last Christmas, showing how urgent it is that those men should have assistance and protection from the Commonwealth Government which sent them to the front.- Portion of the money intended to be raised under the repatriation scheme is needed now; but, despite this urgency, the Government have not taken a single step towards raising a penny. All this proves that the " Win-the-war " party are not doing what they should to protect the men who are really helping to win the war. </para>

                        <para>- I am quoting from the Treasurer's most recent figures. If the honorable gentleman wants them in detail I can give them to him. He knows quite well that as the result of modifications under the 1915-16 war-time profits tax, it is now estimated that the Government will collect £400,000 less than originally was expected; and that, under the 1916-17 war-time profits tax, there will be a further probable reduction of £1,700,000 as well as a reduction in the sinking fund, because the Government intend to extend the redemption of the debt over a longer period than formerly. They also exempt the war bonds of the very wealthy from taxation. These exemptions amount to about £4,000,000, and there is in addition the £10,000,000 wealth tax, which is not to be levied, making the cost of this Coalition Government to the community about £14,000,000. </para>

                <para>We are about to have an election, and I hope that, for the honour of the Commonwealth, the Government will not revert to the practices indulged in during the campaign in October last. Everybody knows of the methods then adopted in connexion with the censorship. AH we ask for now is a fair deal, the right to put our case before the people of Australia, and the right of the people of Australia to hear our case. No law should stand between the electors and the men who desire to represent them in this Parliament. </para>

In this Senate last September we fought for a relaxation of the censorship, but everybody knows we did not have the opportunity to put our case before the people as fully as we desired. We ask, therefore, that on this occasion those abuses may' not be repeated. We ask the Government to use the censorship judiciously, and not to abuse their executive power. No Government ever so flagrantly abused its executive power as did the Hughes Government during the referendum campaign. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> is a living testimony of what I say. So incensed was he, as well as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs,</inline> the then Treasurer, that he and they resigned in a body from the Cabinet rather than be parties to an abuse of executive power in regard to a regulation concerning the voting. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear the Minister say he would act in the same way to-morrow if the necessity arose. I hope it will not arise. I am asking no favours from the Government, and, indeed, I would take no favours from them. All I ask for our party is that we may receive fair play. If the Government grant us this, we shall be satisfied with the verdict of the people, whatever it may be. I hope that no secret service money will be expended during the coming election campaign. Let the Government and their supporters raise their funds as the Labour party does. If we have a fair fight, there will be nothing to complain about. I know, however, that the press supporting the other party will indulge in a campaign of calumny, as they always' have done: but, in spite of their unscrupulous opposition to our party in the past, we have survived all their attacks, and we shall survive them again. We will have the trusts, combines, ' and monopolies of Australia against us, but we will stand all that, so long as we can get a fair deal. I have my doubts, however, on that point whether we will get it or not. The mysterious disappearance of a senator under our very eyes, and the equally mysterious appearance of another senator, suggest the doubt whether we are likely to get a fair deal from the present Government. To give the Senate an idea of the forces that will be opposed to the Labour party in the coming campaign, I shall read a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tom</inline> Mutch, the Labour candidate for Botany, a few days ago. </para>

Cann and Hall had called the Political Labour League Executive into the Ministerial room, and told them that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the Meat Trust, and the Employers Federation had raised a fund of £100,000 to fight the Labour movement, and urged that as a reason why the executive should not press <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> to carry out his promise to the Conference.

                <para>In conclusion, I regret that men who have climbed to fame and fortune on the backs of . the Labour party should be now amongst the chief traducers of a movement founded, as every great movement is, on self-sacrifice and nurtured in adversity. The Labour movement has gone through the purifying fires of adversity during the last twelve months, particularly during the last few months, and it has emerged from that trying ordeal minus the dross, and, therefore, stronger and better for the experience. Nothing in the- happenings of the last few weeks should dismay or discourage the Labour party. It is true that we have lost control of this Chamber through the treachery of one of our own men, but the Labour movement is not to blame for that. Treachery is as old as man himself. Even Christ was betrayed by one of his apostles, but the betrayal of Christ did not injure Christianity, and the betrayal of the Labour party will not injure the great movement which it represents. </para>

                    <para>. - Several speakers on the Opposition side, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> have heaped abuse on members on this side of the Chamber. We are accused of having betrayed and disrupted the Labour party. All the evil that has befallen the so-called Official Labour party is attributed to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> the Leader of the party, refused to allow the conspirators who sought to take the reins of government out of his hands, to have their own way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> spoke to-day, as he has done on many occasions, of the magnificent work done by the Labour party. I readily admit that during the last fifteen years the Labour party has done wonderful work throughout Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> mentioned that I had stated in the Senate that the Labour movement was not worth following, but he admitted that I afterwards corrected my statement by explaining that it was the Labour party which I considered was not worth following. The honorable senator outlined the history of his association with the Labour movement. I was privileged to be in that movement for some years before even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was associated with it. I do not claim any great credit for that, because it is probably accounted for by the fact that I am several years older than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> I do wish to point out, however, to those members of the Opposition who claim that they are true merino Labour men, that in the early days of the Labour movement self-sacrifice was known amongst its followers. I and other men saw that the movement had much to recommend it. We realized that something might be done to give effect to the aspirations of the men who in those days were putting forth efforts for the benefit of humanity. I assisted in the formation of the present Labour party, because at that time the majority of people in Australia were not receiving a fair deal. Men were underpaid and forced to work long hours. The employers took advantage of the necessities of men, and refused to grant them fair conditions, and the redress of the workers' grievances was the objective of the pioneers of the Labour movement. In those days there was no grabbing for office. There was no desire on the part of members of unions to take the places of members already in Parliament. When the Labour party was first started in South Australia I remember distinctly several cases in which a man who had been selected by plebiscite to contest a Labour seat withdrew in favour of another man who was considered to have a better chance of winning the seat. As a matter of fact, it was through an action of that character that the late Premier of South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tom</inline> Price, one of the grandest Premiers that the State ever had, won his first seat in Parliament. One of the pioneers of the movement, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pat</inline> Stokes, had been selected to contest a certain seat. It was represented to him that Tom Price had a better chance of winning it, and to his lasting honour Pat Stokes cheerfully withdrew and allowed Tom Price to win the seat, and to commence that parliamentary career which lifted, to an enormous extent, the Labour party in South Australia. I and other members of this side did not join the Labour party for the sake of getting a seat in Parliament or any other personal advantage. To be known as a member of the Labour party in those days was to be made a target for abuse from all members of so-called respectable society. A member of a trade union was frequently boycotted. Any sympathizer with the Labour party, if he were a trader or small contractor, was either boycotted or refused work. We had a long struggle against apparently overwhelming odds, but the men who led the movement at that time were of the true mettle, and they are responsible for the solid foundation upon which the Labour party was reared, and to a considerable extent for the success which attended its efforts in later years. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKissock</inline> objects to the statement I certainly withdraw it. I have no wish to say anything personally offensive of him or anybody else, but I am here to tell the truth, and I am just referring to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKissock</inline> and other members of this Chamber have succeeded in wrecking the Labour party. He and other senators opposite did not originate that idea, but their action in meekly yielding to the pressure of outside bodies has caused the wreck of the party. I was one of the original founders of the Labour movement, and worked for it before the present Labour party in South Australia came into existence. For ten years after the establishment of the Labour party I was actively engaged in returning Labour men to the State Parliament. I never sought a seat, although I could have had one. I was nominated in every plebiscite from the first to that taken in 1903 for the election of members of the Federal Parliament, and I never consented to submit myself to even a selection ballot until then. Because my desire was - and it was the desire of thousands of persons who never look for personal benefit - to secure the return of men to Parliament who could be relied upon to use their efforts to improve the conditions of the working classes, and make things better for the whole of the community. That was the object of the Labour party, and they have been successful to a considerable extent. But a change has come over the scene. Within the last few years a body of men came to a certain decision. I think that I am safe in saying that the idea originated with the Australian Workers Union. It was resolved by men in the union that, in order to get the power they wanted, they would amalgamate the whole of the unions of Australia, as far as it could be done, into one big union, to control the whole of Australia industrially, and to nominate all the Labour members to go into Parliament. The scheme worked successfully, up to a certain step. In the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> of Sunday last there appeared an article which certainly was written by a person who thoroughly understands the Labour movement, and the constitution of not only the State Labour parties, but also the Federal Labour party. The article is headed "Labour's Scrap of Paper." The writer describes the constitution of the State Labour party in New South Wales, and of the Federal Labour party.' He points out the limitations of the State Labour party in relation to Federal affairs, and he leads up to the position when the industrialists  in the State thought that they were strong enough to gain possession of the Labour machine to, as far as it could be done, displace the sitting members of Parliament in order that the officials of the Political Labour Council, the officials of the Australian Workers Union, and the officials of the other unions and political organizations, should take their places. In this article, which I do not propose to read, the writer points out how the men who got possession of the political machine deliberately broke the rules which were laid down for the guidance of the Conference - the rules which fixed the power between conferences in the hands of a certain executive. He points out how the men got a majority, by packing meetings, by having an inner conference composed of a certain number of industrialists only, who would lay out their plan of campaign, and nominate the whole of the candidates for executive and other offices, so that, when they got into the larger conference, there would be a block vote for the members whom they had decided to select and support. This scheme worked out entirely to the satisfaction of its engineers. </para>

The whole of the Labour press of Australia are as one-eyed as the honorable senator is. They refuse to listen to reason. Those who were forced out of the Labour party, and compelled to come on to this side of the Senate, are not allowed to have an opportunity of explaining why they took that course. </para>

                        <para>- They are not supposed to have a single legitimate reason for having left honorable senators on the other side, but they are called rats and renegades, because they had too much manliness and independence of character to submit to dictation from outside individuals, who had no right or authority to instruct them how they should conduct themselves, or how they should vote on any political questions which might crop up in Parliament. In this article, which possibly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKissock</inline> will read with some advantage to himself, it is pointed out that when the Federal Labour party was formed it was found impossible to allow the State Conferences to deal with Federal affairs. The writer goes on "to point out that it would be impossible for one State to instruct delegates from that State to vote on any Federal matter, because the Executive of the Labour party in another State might direct its Federal members, to vote in a different direction, and consequently iti was necessary to have a Federal Executive in order to carry on the work between conferences. It took them a long time to find that out, because it was not until 1915 that the first Interstate Executive was created at the Adelaide Conference. Possibly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKissock</inline> will agree with me that that Interstate Conference was formed there to deal with all questions arising out of the Federal Labour platform between conferences. The Federal Executive, of course, was given the same power in Federal affairs as the State Executives are given in State affairs. What do we find in connexion with the subject which caused the split in the Labour party ? We find that the Executive of Victoria instructed its Federal members to oppose conscription. We find that the Executive of New South Wales instructed the State representatives in both Houses of the Federal Parliament to oppose conscription, and many of them were informed that unless they voted against the referendum too, they would not be indorsed by the Labour party, afterwards; taking the work absolutely out of the hands of the Federal Executive. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> has reminded me, the referendum was a plank of the Federal platform. Exactly the same thing was done in South Australia. A conference was due to be held there in September last. Prior to that conference being held, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Lundie, who was the Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, and his officers were busy for weeks in finding out the name of every little organization throughout the State which had the right to send delegates to the September Conference. As many of them were located in distant parts of the State they could not afford to pay the expenses of a delegate to Adelaide. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lundie</inline> very kindly offered, on behalf of the Australian Workers Union, to furnish a delegate to represent a local committee, or a branch of a local committee or a trade union, or whatever it might happen to be which had the right to send one or more delegates. The result might have been foreseen. Every member appointed by the Australian Workers Union to represent a distant branch of the Labour party represented in the conference, not that branch of the party, but the Australian Workers Union. The conference was composed of a very large number of representatives, but exactly, the same tactics were adopted there as were adopted in New South Wales. Prior to the conference being held, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lundie</inline> sent a circular to the secretaries of all the trade unions in and about Adelaide, inviting them to meet at the office of the Australian Workers Union a day or two before the conference was to open. Many of them accepted the invitation, and at the pre-conference they fixed up the fate of every important question which had to be dealt with at the larger conference. They decided the names of the officers who should be elected. That is to say they decided on what they termed the industrial ticket, and secured the promise of every one who attended the pre-conference that they would vote as one man for the nominees of the industrial conference, whoever they might be. They agreed to vote in a certain way, predetermined at the preliminary conference, on all questions' discussed at the conference. That is what led to the split in the Labour party. The industrial section of the party has endeavoured to dominate every other interest in it. Those belonging to the industrial section claim that the trade unions alone' represent the Labour movement, and that they should have all the power, not only in conference and councils, but in Parliament as well, and that no one who is not a member of a trade union is fit to be a Labour member of Parliament. To-day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> addressed some of the most scornful epithets to honorable senators on this side because we are supporting a Government composed largely of Liberals. I interjected at the time that I preferred to be associated with Liberals rather than with members of the Industrial Workers of the World. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and other honorable senators opposite repudiate any connexion with the Industrial Workers of the World, and, when it suits them, they condemn that organization. But they cannot escape the fact that it is the influence of the Industrial Workers of the World in the various State political leagues that brought about the condition of affairs which led to the split in the Labour party. </para>

                        <para>- I have said that it was rejected, but I have also said that the present  President  of the Australian Workers Union voted for it. This man, in whom the members of the Australian Workers Union have so much confidence that they have selected him as their  President,  is in favour of direct action, and against arbitration. In the early days of the Labour movement we who were then seeking for justice for the workers believed that if we could only get Arbitration Courts every man would secure fair play. We were opposed by the Conservative politicians of those days, who objected to Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts, and believed in freedom of contract. Every member of the Labour party at that time believed in the principle of arbitration, and we fondly hoped that if we secured Arbitration Courts we should have fair dealing and contentment among the workers of the country. Has that hope been realized? Although! arbitration has brought about an immense improvement in the condition- of the working people of Australia, to-day we find the  president  of the largest union in Australia, that is endeavouring to swallow up every other union, advocating direct action, and proposing to do away with arbitration. He is in favour of brute force. Another of our fond delusions in the early days of the Labour movement was that, if we could only do away with piece-work, and induce the Governments of the various States to carry out their undertakings by the day- labour system, the result would be for . the' benefit, not only of the workers, but also of the taxpayers of the different States. We hoped that men who would be employed by the different State Governments would honestly endeavour to make the day-labour system a success. Has it been a success? I do not believe there is any honorable member of the Senate who today claims to be a Labour man who will contend that the day-labour system in the carrying out of Government work has been a success. There are just as many strikes and disturbances, and just as many unfair demands on the part of the men when employed by a Government, <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> occurred when they were employed by ' private employers. When the Labour party was formed, its aim was to do away with the injustices perpetrated by the employing class. It has been successful . but I am afraid its success has. in some intances, at any rate, made it possible for the workers, who were the sufferers in the past, to become the tyrants. There are many instances which I need not enumerate of most unreasonable demands made by the workers. I do not refer to demands for higher wages, but to silly disputes, such as some of those which occurred at Cockatoo Island, where, in one instance, because a man did a class of work which another claimed to be his particular work, a whole body of men went on strike, and suspended the operations of the whole establishment. If that kind of thing is to be countenanced on the part of men whose conditions have been so much improved by the work of the Labour party, it will become a tyranny quite as great and injurious as the tyranny of the employers in the early days. Such a tyranny will be more injurious to the country than was the tyranny of the employers from which the Labour party rescued the workers in the early days. I have' had placed in my hands a copy of the publication known as <inline font-style="italic">Direct Action,</inline> and I quote from it the following paragraph: - </para>

                    <para>The Australian Workers Union has worn the Arbitration coat for best, and lately it has become so threadbare and shabby that it has been patched and patched until it resembles, the coat of many colours. It no longer protects the worker from the cold blast of capitalism. Why not throw it away and put on this new coat offered free gratis by the Industrial Unionist - Direct Action - with all the One Big Union tactics for beating the boss. . </para>

                <para>Does not that paragraph indicate that if there is not direct action there is direct co-operation between the. Industrial Workers of the World, the Australian Workers Union, and the Political Labour party as at present constituted in the various States ? In South Australia, with one exception, the men who built up the Labour party, in Parliament and outside of it have been driven out of the party by the tactics of the industrial section that believes in direct action. Yet honorable senators opposite say that they repudiate the. Industrial Workers of the World, that they have nothing to do with it, and that the organization opposes them at elections. At <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> request, I shall read this further extract from the same article in <inline font-style="italic">Direct Action</inline> of the 29th January, 1916. </para>

                <para>Honorable senators opposite declare that the Australian Workers Union has no connexion with the Industrial Workers of the World, yet this <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McNaught</inline> is one of the big officials in this big union that is endeavouring to swamp every other union, . and has not only set out to control  the  industrial life of the whole of Australia, but also has as one of its objects the controlling of the political life of Australia by stipulating that it shall be the only body which may nominate candidates for Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> said to-day that the party behind him were just as earnest in the. desire to win the war as any other party in Australia, and that they had carried out the pledges which they gave to the electors at the election's over two years ago. Every member of . the Labour party subscribed to the- manifesto which was- issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> and signed by him as Leader of the Labour party, and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. David</inline> Watson as secretary of the party. That manifesto declared that if the electors returned the Labour party to power they could thoroughly rely on the party doing everything possible to win the war; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> further explained that he meant " everything possible " when he said that Australia was in the fight to the last man and the last shilling. I do not wish to go over the whole fight again. We had it on the referendum campaign, during which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 'Barnes, Senator McKissock,</inline> and others referred in glowing terms to what Australia had done by  Bending  . nearly 300,000 men to the front; but not one of those gentlemen has ever dared to say that Australia has done as much as she could do. I challenge any honorable senator opposite to say that he has carried out the pledge that he gave to the electors at the last election, that  if  elected he would do" everything possible " to win the war. </para>

                        <para>- I am challenging my friends opposite to say that they have done everything they could do. On the contrary, I charge them with having prevented those members of the party who desired to carry out their pledges from doing so. They have prevented <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher's</inline> successor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> from carrying out his part of the obligation. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> held similar views to those of some honorable senators opposite, regarding conscription as a bad thing for Australia, he came back to this country after his visit to the front, where he had seen the necessity for a tremendous effort, fully convinced that the only way in which Australia could do her best was by compelling men, who were able but unwilling to fight; to- do so. He told the members of his party that, in his opinion, it was the duty of Australia, to compel men, who would not otherwise go, to take part in the fight for Australia on the soil of France. We have had several' versions of what occurred, but I do not know whether it has even been directly stated that some members of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> Government deliberately conspired to depose him from the leadership. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs,</inline> who was the Treasurer in the Hughes Government, sent telegrams all over Australia inviting Federal members to come to Melbourne, not to a meeting of the Labour party, but to a sort of preliminary Labour party meeting, just, such a meeting as the industrialists hold before an Inter-State Conference, in order to fir up matters beforehand, and arrange the programme to be carried out at the first meeting of the party. We know that, prior to the eventful meeting when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is said to have left the party, a majority of the Labour members in this Parliament met in some part of the building, and decided that they would depose. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> from the leadership. I was not at the meeting, so that I am not in a position to say exactly what did take place, but it is fair to assume that the meeting decided on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> successor and, in all probability, on those who were to have the portfolios in the Government. I am fortified in my belief that all these things were arranged by the brevity of the speech of the honorable member for Brisbane, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Finlayson,</inline> who moved the motion at the subsequent meeting of the full party. That gentleman, when he rose, said something to this effect: "I propose that this party has no longer any confidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> as leader. We have all made up our minds as to what we are going to do; therefore there is no necessity to talk about it." And, having said these words, he sat down. </para>

                        <para>- It is a true, statement, of what led to the breach in the Labour party in this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was not the lamb that some of his followers thought he was. Had he been silly enough to fall into such a trap, he would not have made the impression that he did in Great Britain and other countries. It was because he knew too much for these gentlemen, because he left the  meeting, because he declined to be thrown aside like an old boot, and because he exercised the right he undoubtedly possessed as Prime Minister to form a Government to carry on the administration of the Commonwealth, that there is such a bitter feeling against him on the part of every honorable senator opposite, and he is the most abused man in Australia today, and is not able to represent Australia at the Imperial Conference. He is not representing us at that Conference, not because he is deficient in any of the attributes that a man representing the Commonwealth should have, but simply because he refused to allow himself to be deposed from the leadership of the Labour party, and because he refused to let another man be chosen as leader whom he was to meekly follow. </para>

                        <para>- That is another question. The reason why the Official Labour party did not enter into the Coalition has been so often threshed out that I do not 'propose to deal with it again, but there is no doubt that the forthcoming elections are actually due, not to the fact that the Labour party in Parliament are unwilling to form a National Government, but to the fact that the bodies outside, which control every senator opposite, would not permit them to take any part in one. For that reason the Government during the last few weeks have been subjected in this chamber to the most unfair opposition that I have ever witnessed since I have been a member of the Senate. </para>

If no Parliament were in existence here at such a critical time, it might lead to very great loss to the whole of the people of Australia. It was because I believed that it was most improper to hold an election at the present time, and that the Government of Australia should continue in firm, reliable hands, that I, as a follower of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> consented to join a Coalition with the Liberal party in this Parliament. That, in my opinion, is the only possible excuse for a coalition of political parties. The Labour party as I knew it when I" was returned to this House, over two years ago, no longer exists. The freedom which members of the Labour party always possessed has been entirely taken from them. Members of the Official Labour party in the Federal Parliament, as well as in the Parliaments . of the States, have conceded to the councils and the leagues outside the right to dictate to them what actions they should take in Parliament. I could not remain a member of any  party in which that state of affairs prevailed. I should prefer to belong to a coalition party or a Liberal party, which was truly Liberal, rather than remain a member of a party in which I was absolutely robbed of my independence. </para>
                <para>In foreshadowing the policy of the Official Labour party, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> pointed to what Labour had accomplished. The Labour party has certainly a noble record' jui building up, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and I, as well as other members of the party, have assisted. But the honorable senator, as the Leader of the Official Labour party in this House, when asked what its policy is to be, merely points to the records of Labour, and says, " Simply trust us ; we shall do something quite as good as we have done, but we shall not tell you what it will be." The Official Labour party has already commenced to demolish the good work done by the Labour party of old. In addition to objecting to compulsory service outside Australia, a very important section of the Labour party outside Parliament has decided that compulsory service even -within Australia is also undesirable. </para>
                <para class="block">The result of the annual Labour conference held in South Australia in September last was so unsatisfactory that a special Labour conference was called in February last. At that conference a great deal of work was done. Every member of the Labour party who had advocated, and honestly advocated, conscription, or who had advised the people to vote " Yes " at the military service referendum was branded as disloyal to the Labour movement, as a traitor and a betrayer of the Labour cause. I hold that the real traitors to the cause of Labour are those who at present control the Official Labour party. The special conference held in Adelaide last February was packed just as the previous one had been by the industrialists who met before the conference to decide what their attitude should be on a number of important questions. They proposed to remove from the Statutes of the Commonwealth a measure with which, I believe, every member of the Federal Parliament has been proud to be associated. There are in the Senate to-day some who attended with me the Brisbane Labour conference of 1907, at which the plank of compulsory military service was first placed in the Labour platform. Every member of the old Labour party, I believe, assisted to give legislative effect to that plank.  We  have all been proud of our association with the passing of the Bill which provides for compulsory training in Australia. When the Liberals have claimed the honour of having brought about compulsory service in Australia, Labour men have waxed indignant, and have declared that Labour alone was responsible for the passing of so beneficent a measure. At the Adelaide Conference, in February, however, it was resolved, on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Greely</inline> - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">The South Australian delegates to the conference, therefore, will be directed and compelled to vote for the abolition of compulsory military and naval service in Australia. And this is the attitude of the Labour party which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> says is the same party to which I have belonged practically all my life. I have proved that it is not the same party - that it is something totally different. I have always been proud to call myself a Labour man. Long before I entered Parliament I advocated Labour principles, and have assisted to some extent to place upon the statute-book of this country those beneficent measures to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> referred with so much pride last night as the work of the Labour party. Pointing to those measures the honorable senator says to the electors of Australia, ' ' You ask for the policy of the Official Labour party; look what we have done." I am as proud as he is of what the Labour party has accomplished. but I am so satisfied that the Labour .party, as at present constituted, is incapable of continuing to do such work - that it- will not be allowed to do it - that I am found on this side of the Senate to-day. During the whole thirteen years that I have had the honour to represent Labour in Parliament I have not cast a vote against a Labour measure. What is more, I have never shirked the responsibility of voting. I have always had the courage to vote "Yes" or "No." During the whole of that period I have had full liberty to vote as my conscience and my intelligence have dictated upon all measures outside our platform. At the Adelaide Conference in February last, however, a resolution was moved by the same <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Greely</inline> - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>That all resolutions carried at conference shall be binding on Labour members of Parliament. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">In other words, a Labour man who is elected on a certain platform, who gives certain promises to his constituents, and who in Parliament possibly adopts a certain attitude in regard to measures outside the Labour platform is to be bound by resolutions carried at Conference. If, before a measure outside the party platform is disposed of, a Conference in the State which elects him to this House decides upon a course the apposite of that which his intelligence has led him to follow, then the Official Labour party as it now exists will compel him to go back on his own actions, and, so to speak, to eat his own words. Were I a member of a party which demanded  from its members such a sacrifice I should be ashamed to hold up my head and to claim that I was a member of Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. - I propose to make a brief reply to the observations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> regarding an incident that has been referred to more than once in connexion with the pairing of senators. Since I have acted as Whip for the present Government I have never asked for a pair, but have frequently been requested by the Opposition to grant pairs. As the members of our party were here ready to attend to the business of the Senate, we did not feel inclined to grant pairs, and so to bring about the defeat of Government business. So persistent, however, was the request for pairs by the other side that I was constrained at last to offer to pair <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> with a member of their party. Before taking the liberty of pairing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin,</inline> who was outside Australia when the present Government was formed, and from whom therefore I had no direct authority, I took the opportunity of consulting his colleagues on the subject. I pointed out to them the urgent and persistent request for pairs coming from the Opposition, and asked for their guidance as to how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> would desire to be paired, and as to the side of the Senate in which he would sit if he were here. From the South Australian members of the party to which he belonged when he left here I learned that to the best of their knowledge he would support the Government. </para>

                        <para>-Unfortunately I did not hear the honorable senator's statement. At any rate, I am putting the position as between myself and his colleagues. They quite candidly intimated that they could not say what the honorable senator's attitude on the question would be now. They could only tell me what it had been. Knowing that the honorable senator's position had not been defined by himself, I was reluctant to pair him. Had I not been repeatedly approached by the other side, I would not have ventured to do so. </para>

                        <para>- I have given an impartial statement of the position in regard to pairs. It will be seen, from what I have, said, that the charge made so recklessly by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> this afternoon was quite unwarranted. I am sorry that, during this debate, statements have been made which have been contradicted time and again. It would be a mere waste of words on my part to repeat that contradiction. The National Labour party have made it quite clear what is their attitude, and why they were forced to take up that attitude. I am quite sure that every one of its members regretted the step which they were obliged to take, and took it reluctantly.. When the Caucus meeting was held which brought the position to a climax, I entered the Caucus room without the slightest feeling one way or the other. I do not say that I. am not as susceptible to political excitement as is anybody else. But, fortunately, I happened to be absent from Australia during the referendum campaign, and consequently I was able to enter the Caucus room free from the bitter feelings which that campaign had engendered. When we entered that room, we found that one of the greatest political outrages ever perpetrated in Australia was about to be inflicted upon the Prime Minister. I can claim as long an association with the Labour party as can any honorable senator opposite. Even before there was an organized Labour party I was associated with the election of the man who subsequently was responsible for the creation of the Labour party in Queensland. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glassey,</inline> the first Labour leader of the Queensland Labour party - that was in 1888. Coming down to the maritime strike, which most honorable senators will admit represented the starting point of the Labour movement in New South Wales, I was again actively associated, as an officer, in securing the return to parliament of a Labour man at the first election following that strike, being secretary of the Wallsend Labour League. I had been taking a very active' part in that industrial trouble in a southern mining district of New South Wales. Probably there is no honorable senator present who took a more active part in it. . I was delegate for the Mount Kembla miners, from the start to the close of that great strike. So that my connexion with the Labour movement dates back nearly thirty years. During the whole of that period I do not hesitate to say there was never a greater outrage perpetrated on any member of the Labour party than the expulsion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> by honorable senators opposite, for doing what he had a perfect right to do. </para>

Is not that the absolute truth? He had already been removed from the movement, so far as the organizations of New South Wales could remove him, and the final touches were about to be put to their . unscrupulous action by honorable senators opposite, although they knew that he had a perfect right to do what he had done. Had I permitted that outrage to be inflicted on the Prime Minister I would have been inviting the same treatment myself. </para>

There is no precedent, so far as I know, in connexion with any policy, past or present, of the Labour party that could give justification for what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Finlayson's</inline> motion proposed on that occasion. Those present were so indifferent to the interests of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and the rest of us, that they would not waste any words on the motion. In the most brutal and callous way I have ever known this motion was moved, and in the briefest of terms <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Finlayson,</inline> sitting down, said, " We have come here with our minds made up, and there is no use saying anything in support of it ; let us get to business." </para>

The whole thing, just as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Finlayson</inline> said, was cut and dried; all had come with their minds made up. Yet we have gentlemen here trying to wriggle and twist out of their responsibilities. Is that honorable of those gentlemen? If they thought it the right and proper thing to do, why do they not take the responsibility in a straightforward way? If I proposed the expulsion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> or anybody else, from an organization, I should be honest enough to afterwards take the full responsibility, and say that I believed that what I had proposed was right. </para>

                        <para>- There were many dumb members of the Caucus on that occasion. Honorable senators opposite will admit that when an important question is discussed, in Caucus, there is great difficulty, owing to the large number of members present, in getting an opportunity to speak. On that occasion, however, the fathers of the proposal sat away at the far end of the room, and no expressions could be dragged from them. I do not know whether that was due to the fact that they wanted the business done quickly, whether they were ashamed of what they were about to do, or whether they desired to remove themselves as far as they could from responsibility, but never, in all my experience in the Caucus in the last sixteen years, have I seen so many dumb members. </para>

                        <para>- What " lead " was it possible for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to give under such circumstances? He was being tried for being a conscriptionist, as if that were a crime, and he was being condemned because he had taken a certain attitude in regard to that policy. It is true that other matters were dragged in. It was said that during the campaign he had spoken of members of the Labour organization as he should nob have spoken; but will any one say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was expelled by the Labour organization of New South Wales for such utterances? Certainly not, because his expulsion by the organization occurred before the campaign began; and he could not be expelled then for what occurred afterwards. </para>

                        <para>- It was for the heinous offence of being a conscriptionist. Is it urged that he had no right to be a conscriptionist? If honorable senators will candidly say so, then we have a clearcut issue, bub they shirk the responsibility. They further venture to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had nob a perfect right to propose a referendum, although that is a very old-established principle of the Labour party. How could he be expelled from the organization for saying things in the general sense in which they were said ? I have read as many of his utterances as possible, and, so far as I can understand them, they have to be twisted and tortured in order to give them the meaning attached to them by gentlemen opposite. I have yet to learn why references on the public platform to bribery, the Industrial Workers of the World, and other matters should be taken by honorable senators as references to themselves, especially as these references were made by a member of their own party. </para>

                        <para>- The whole of this trouble in the party is due to the fact that honorable senators allowed the executives to dictate to members of Parliament, after their election, how they should vote in this Parliament, or elsewhere. That was a fatal step. No outside body should have been allowed to dictate to the elected representatives how they should vote on questions before Parliament. Members should have had perfect freedom to vote as their conscience dictated. This assertion of authority by the executive marks the starting point in the most disastrous split that the Labour party has ever experienced. Members gave way when they should have stood their ground firmly and declared that the executives in Sydney, Melbourne, or elsewhere, had no right to dictate to them how they should vote on this question of conscription, or on the referendum. ' The referendum is a plank in the Labour platform, and, therefore, every member who voted against that plank must necessarily have violated one of the principles of the party. If there has been any violation of principle, it must be charged against the members who now sit opposite. They should have stood to their guns on the occasion referred to. Certainly, they would have had to face the executives, and no doubt would have had great difficulty in getting selection; but, even if they had gone down, they should have remained true to the principles upon which they had been elected, rather than allow any interference by the juntas or executives. Honorable members opposite now talk about their bravery in standing by the Labour party movement, and so forth; but if any honorable members can claim credit for courage in this respect, it is those on this side who dared to face their powerful organizations, and to vote as their conscience dictated, even when faced with expulsion for their actions. </para>

                        <para>- But the Premier of Queensland had no right to interfere in Federal politics. The Labour party, by allowing this interference by the executives with members, are travelling the road that will surely lead to destruction. Democracy is threatened the moment a third party comes between the representatives of the electors and the platform upon which they were pledged before the electors. We cannot have a pure Democracy if we allow a third party to come between us and the people who returned us to Parliament. Who compose these executives or juntas ? No doubt there are amongst them many worthy, honest, and upright men. But who, in the name of common sense, gave them power to step between the elected and their duties to the electors? A Democracy cannot possibly live if we allow an executive - call it what we will - to interfere in that way. I would sooner be in the hands of the greatest despot in the world than in the hands of a junta, the members of which nobody knows. If we were under a despot, were he Kaiser or Emperor, there would be somebody to be held responsible. But the giving to a junta, two-thirds of the members of which are men who never go on the public platform, are unknown to the public, and have no responsibility, such power as honorable senators opposite have surrendered, was a deplorable exhibition of lack of backbone. I cannot believe that men who are well read and experienced in politics have not thought out the consequences. They have not acted through ignorance. They must have realized whither their actions were leading them, but they have not the courage to stand up and do the  right thing at the right moment. If the seventy Labour members of this Parliament had presented a united front to the executive, and said, " We have a perfect right to take whatever side we choose, and we shall not tolerate your interference in any shape or form," we should have been acting properly, and the Labour party would have been solid to-day. There might have been a scrimmage in connexion with the forthcoming selection ballots, but it would have been far better to meet that trouble straight away than to surrender the rights of members of Parliament, as honorable senators opposite have done. I wish to touch briefly upon another aspect of the position to-day, and that is the lack of proper appreciation of the times in which we are living, and the responsibilities that rest upon a political party. It is obvious that honorable senators opposite fail to appreciate what a great war is, and the danger which surrounds their country. They fail to understand the necessity for a united Parliament, such as has been found necessary in every other country engaged in this war. In every Parliament of the Allies there is a National Government. We cannot believe that those nations formed National Governments without good and sufficient reasons. In the French and British Parliaments party differences are just as keen as in the Commonwealth Parliament, but conflicting party interests were reconciled or forgotten because of the paramount importance of the war above every other consideration. Almost from the beginning of this Parliament we had ample proof of the necessity for a National Government. The Labour party returned from the elections with an overwhelming majority in both Chambers, and we could have done almost anything we liked. Why, then, did we drop party legislation and shelve the six referenda questions which we were about to submit to the people! </para>

                        <para>-Whatever the arrangement made with the State Premiers, the old united Labour party assented to it, and its acceptance was undoubtedly the first step in the shelving of the Constitution Alteration Bills. We all know that there was a very good reason for taking that step. Many, if not the majority, of us recognised that there was nothing to be gained by submitting those questions to the people. We . admitted that it was a dangerous experiment, and that in war time it would be advisable to avoid a referendum if possible. But even if we did make a mistake by accepting the promise  of the State Premiers, five out of six of whom were of the same political hue as the Federal Labour party ; even if those gentlemen did promise more than they were able to fulfil, there was no reason why the Federal Labour party, if we had thought the time opportune for party politics, should not afterwards have accepted its responsibilities, and proceeded with the submission of the questions to the people, instead of sheltering behind the State Premiers. </para>

I proposed then to go on with them, and that was in January, after they had been dropped. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> then gave as his reason for refusing to go on with the Bills that we could riot get a statutory majority, and that statement was made in a room behind this chamber. </para>

I thought that the meeting to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> has alluded was a confidential meeting.

                        <para>- It is simply ridiculous for the honorable senator to advance an argument of that kind. I know perfectly well the position which obtained before the Prime Minister went to England. The honorable senator knows that at one stage it was proposed to couple a seventh question with the referenda proposals, and that it met with considerable opposition for fear that it would be defeated with the other questions. There was far more concern shown about the defeat of the seventh question than about the fate of the six other questions. </para>

                        <para>- I was not here at the time, and therefore I may be at a disadvantage. The Prime Minister of England said that the members' of the Australian delegation to the Old Country had had opportunities in France and Britain to see and know things which no member of his Ministry had enjoyed. When I returned to Melbourne, and addressed myself to these matters, I was told by wiseacres, some of whom have never been' out of the Commonwealth,' that I did not know anything about what I was discussing. Let me say that the fate of the referenda questions proves that since the beginning of the war it has been utterly impossible for this Parliament to deal with anything in the nature of a party programme. Honorable senators opposite are aware that the Labour party had a majority in both Houses, and that if we desired to give effect to our party programme we could have done so. Why did we not do so? Will honorable senators contend that it was because we were untrue to our pledges, or for any reason of that kind? That will not be admitted, and honorable senators opposite must agree that the reason why we did not give effect to our party programme was that we were at war, and that party policies and programmes were entirely foreign to the circumstances of the times. To admit that is only to admit what has been the experience of every Parliament amongst the allied nations. It is to be regretted that honorable senators opposite did not take that lesson to heart. When they were invited to take their full share in the responsibilities of Government by the formation of a united party they refused the invitation. It was then necessary that two parties should combine to carry on the Government of the Commonwealth, because no one party in this Parliament possesses a majority in both Houses. By refusing the invitation to join in the formation of a National Government, I believe that my old colleagues in the Labour party lost a splendid opportunity to heal the breach between them and u's. Had they accepted the invitation the proposal of the united Caucus for the prolongation  of the life of the Parliament could have been carried, and by the time to which the life of the Parliament would have been extended, or by the time the war came to an end, the breach between honorable senators opposite and ourselves would have been healed. They have, however, decided to keep the wound open, and to go to the country and to fight for our scalps. If they think there is anything creditable in that they are welcome to any honour they may derive from it. I am personally prepared to take all the risks involved. I would sooner lose 100 seats than accept a seat here under the condition that I should cease to be master of my own conscience. That is the position as it presents itself to me. I make bold to venture into the realm of prophesy, and I say that the time will come when honorable senators opposite will recognise the great blunder they made in not standing by their colleagues on 'this side at the time the split occurred. They  will yet realize that they played the part  of  weaklings when courage was required to enable them to stand to their duty. I do not need any appeals from honorable senators opposite to fight the battle of the election fairly. I have never done otherwise. I hit as hard as I can in a political contest, but I never hit below the belt. Had the Labour party in Australia followed the splendid example of the Labour party of Great Britain, or of the Labour and Socialist parties of France, they . would have assisted to form a National Government, the split would never have occurred, and there would have been no occasion for the regrets which we have heard so much of to-night. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to refer to an incident which occurred last night, in which the <inline font-weight="bold">Deputy President, Senator Millen,</inline> and myself were concerned. My desire is to make it perfectly clear through the columns of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> t.hat I was not guilty of the charge levelled against me, and for which I was about to be suspended when, following parliamentary practice, and in deference to a request from the Chair, I withdrew a certain word I had used. The incident arose while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> was speaking about the soldiers' vote taken on board the ship which he was in charge of. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> interjected that some one on this side had said that the soldiers' ballot was not secret. I interjected, in reply, " Why does not the honorable senator name the man who said it? " <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> then said, " Why are you not definite when you make a charge ? " I then said to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> " If you say that I made a charge against yourself or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> it is a lie." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> objected to what he regarded as an offensive statement, and the <inline font-weight="bold">Deputy President, Senator Henderson,</inline> said that, he had heard me say, " He is a liar."

                    <para>- I am afraid that the honorable senator is not in order in proceeding on these* lines. The Standing Orders provide that if any exception is taken  to  a ruling of the  President  or  Chairman,  it must be taken at the time that the ruling is delivered, and, if exception is not then taken to it, an honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> is not in order in referring to the ruling later. I was not present in the chamber when the incident to which Senator Needham refers occurred, so I have no personal knowledge of what took place. The standing order is explicit that, if exception is taken to a ruling of the  President, Deputy President,  or  Chairman,  it must be taken at the time, and is not open to discussion afterwards. Whilst the honorable member is entitled to make a personal explanation in the matter, he is not entitled to debate the ruling to which he objects. </para>

                        <para>- I have no wish to debate the ruling at all. It is really a personal explanation that I am making. I informed the Deputy President at ten minutes to  12  o'clock last night that I intended to make the statement which I was proceeding to make when you interrupted me. I was about to say that I had not used the word " liar " which the Deputy President accused me of using. He afterwards qualified his statement somewhat by saying that I had used the word "lie." It was because it was suggested by the Deputy President that I had used the word "liar," and that would appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> that I challenged his statement. I withdrew the words I had used for the time being, and asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to state his' case. He did not do it. I eventually withdrew the word " lie," which I did use in the sense I have described. I told the  Deputy, President  the sense in which I used the word. He ought not to have said that I used the words, " He is a liar," and I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to see that the words he used, and which he afterwards qualified, are expunged from the records of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - I do not intend to prolong the debate, but I take this opportunity of referring to a matter that arose a few minutes ago, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie was speaking. He was referring to the fact that the proposal to take a referendum of the people on the several alterations of the Constitution had been abandoned  or postponed by the Labour party because the leaders of all the State Governments had agreed at a Conference, held in Melbourne towards the end of  1915,  to submit to their respective Parliaments proposals to hand over to the Federal Parliament voluntarily the powers which we proposed to ask the people to give to us by alterations of the Constitution. Practically all the members of the Labour party, as it was then constituted,  agreed t"hat this would he .far the better course to pursue than to have a referendum on such a matter at that particular time. In a little while, however, it was found that some of the State Parliaments refused to honour the promises made by their leaders, and at a meeting of the Federal Executive of the Labour party, held in January, 1916, a short time prior to the departure of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> for England, the question cropped up. That Executive, which was appointed by the InterState Labour Conference held in Adelaide in the previous year, consists of two representatives from each State. At the meeting referred to it was stated that the Labour party had been sold by the State Parliaments, and the Executive had to consider whether the Labour party should again submit the proposed alterations of the Constitution to the people at another referendum. I suggested that the party should go on with their proposals to hold a referendum, seeing that they had merely been postponed for the time being, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> who was on the Executive, plainly stated that it was impossible for us to take that course, because Bills for the alteration of the Constitution would require to be passed in both Houses by statutory majorities. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is probably talking about a different matter, upon which I shall touch a little later. Before any such Bill could pass the House of Representatives it must be agreed to by more than half the total number of honorable members in that Chamber, but we did not have that number of honorable members of the Labour party available in another place. Two honorable members of the party had gone to the front, and though they were paired on ordinary business with two honorable members of the Liberal party, that fact was ineffective in this particular case, seeing that thirty-eight honorable members were needed to cast their votes in favour of a Bill proposing to alter the Constitution to give it the statutory majority required. In addition to these two honorable members, we knew that <inline font-weight="bold">'Mr. Wise</inline> would not vote for these Bills if they were brought forward again. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> showed clearly that it would be impossible to get the. necessary Bills through the House of Representatives, even if Parliament had been called together hurriedly for the purpose, or even if Parliament were to sit. during his absence from the Commonwealth. Of course, we realized that we had more than a statutory majority in the Senate which would agree to the Bills, but the measures would have to' go through both Houses to become law. </para>

                        <para>- The  President  will bear out my statement that the matter was discussed at the meeting of the Federal Labour Executive to which I have referred, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was not in favour of submitting the questions to the people-  he did not think it would be wise to submit them at that time. Had our Leader been agreeable, we could have submitted them to the people notwithstanding that we had not a statutory majority in both Houses. We could have passed the Bills through the Senate, where we had a majority, and they could then have been submitted by the Governor-General to a referendum of the people. The Governor-General, however, could have adopted that course only on the advice of his Ministers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Hughes</inline> was at the head of Hie Excellency's advisers, and no other man was entitled to advise him on the subject. Seeing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> considered it would be unwise to submit the Bills to the people at that time, we were therefore absolutely powerless to take the alternative course which the honorable senator has suggested. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie asked why the party had not insisted on the submission of the proposed amendments of the Constitution to the people when it was found that the State Governments had broken the promises made by their leaders. My answer to that inquiry is that for the reasons I have just mentioned, it was impossible to submit them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was not favorable to the alternative course which the honorable senator has suggested. As a matter of fact, he was going to London, and, I dare say, did not desire the . referendum fight to occur in his absence. This, then, was one of the reasons why the proposed referenda was not proceeded with, and it was a very good reason. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie was under a misapprehension in stating that we had a statutory majority in both Houses. He had, perhaps, forgotten for the moment that our statutory majority in the House of Representatives had disappeared at the time in question. When ' the Bills 'were first passed, we had such a majority, but at this particular time we had not, because one, if not two, of our party were not in their places. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I am glad of the honorable senator's interjection. It supports my statement that our statutory majority in the House of Representatives has disappeared so that, although but a few months before we had a big majority in both Houses, it was absolutely impossible to pass the Bills through both branches of the Legislature. I should not have intervened, but for the desire to make this statement, which I felt was necessary as the result of the exchanges which passed between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and myself. I had no intention of revealing anything that ought not to have been disclosed. After all, it is really a matter of no concern to-day since we have a new Federal Executive, and practically everything that happened at the Caucus meetings since then has been revealed. </para>

                    <para>. - While reclining on this rather comfortable seat, thinking of the gleams of morning sunshine coming over the hilltops to gladden the dull hours, I was reflecting whether we, as a duly elected body, the highest council of the nation, were fully seized of the importance and the far-reaching effects attaching to the present situation. We here in Australia are still enjoying a security that no other warring nation possesses today. There are a number of our men who are not comfortably situated as we are this morning, and whose conditions are quite the reverse of ours. They do not possess, as we do,  well-cared-for  bodies, and at this very hour of- the morning they are probably coming out of rain-soaked or frozen trenches. They are a part of the family of our nation, and I am afraid that many persons are altogether too forgetful of the position of these men, and of what they are fighting for. It is because I believe that too many persons in our midst are entirely oblivious of the fact that Australia is at war, and of what our men at the front are doing, that I seek to arouse them from their slumber, and to make them realize that Australia is at war, and should therefore act as a warring nation. Because I recognised the situation from the inception, and because I shaped a course, not this year or last year, but from the very beginning of action which would lead to Australia -being placed in a right position, I have made myself unpopular, have become the victim of very bitter feeling, and have made myself an outcast from the party to which I have belonged for twenty-five years. My own opinion is that I am more staunch to the principles of that party than is any other man in the Senate or outside of it. But I have long since flung all party issues behind me, because I recognise that the safety and security of this country transcend everything which can fall within the compass of party politics. Why did I adopt that course? May I put it this way for the moment. This country would still be very much in my debt if my services, since I landed here thirty years ago, were assessed on a truly cash basis. But I am not going to put the matter on that sordid basis. I have to remember that I am living in Australia, which was the dream of my youth, a place which I longed to reach because I did not then enjoy the liberty which I am enjoying to-day. I landed here without any pretentions other than to earn my livelihood as a unit of society. But without any effort on my part to get a place in the councils of the nation, I suddenly found myself being pushed to the front by my comrades in Western Australia. The result was that I became the elect ot the people there in the State Legislature, and later on, for what I am worth, in this Parliament. I repeat that the position was not one of my own seeking, but was the outcome of the manifest desire of those who knew me best. I would have to be less than grateful, less than a rational being if I did not properly assess the opportunities which obtain here in Australia, and if I were not duly thankful for those opportunities, notwithstanding that if my services were appraised on a strictly cash basis, this country would still owe me something. But the very fact that one is able to rise, as I and scores like me have risen, fills me with a just appreciation of this glorious, free, and unexampled Australia. That is why I am prompted to place the safety of this country above all minor and internal domestic considerations. </para>

                <para>There is only one party for me,' one policy, and one plank in that policy, namely, to win the war. After I had announced that in the most public way to the electors of my State, the miners of North Coolgardie chose me as their duly-accredited mouthpiece, and sent me to the Labour Conference in Melbourne to represent the' cause of Labour. I entered that Conference, and, by all the rules of its constitution, I was entitled to stop there till the close of its deliberations. But the party which comprised a majority of that gathering took it upon themselves in the most unconstitutional way to expel me. I told them that, although I was duly accredited to that gathering, I could serve no useful purpose by remaining, and consequently I retired. Nevertheless I am still a member of the Labour party, and a member of that section of it in Western Australia which has counted for something in the past. I represent the miners of North Coolgardie, who, after I was expelled, still desired to' retain me as their trusted nominee. </para>
                <para>So much by way of a brief summary of how I came to put national concerns above all petty, paltry concerns, and to persist in that course of action until I was, in the words of these newfound prophets of freedom and Democracy " expelled." What I was expelled for has not yet been clearly defined. According to the logic of the party which met in conference' at the Trades Hall I was expelled because I had violated a principle of the Labour party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has since been expelled, as have all the senators who stand with me, excepting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham. Mr. Spence, Mr. Hughes,</inline> and others met the same fate, and have also been expelled on the ground that they have violated a principle of the Labour platform. Now a principle, if it be a principle, should obtain, not in one particular arc of the compass, but all round. </para>

                        <para>- I was expelled because I supported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> who, in turn, had been expelled because he' advocated conscription; and I contend that I was expelled on unconstitutional grounds. If there is a Labour principle, it ought to prevail as such throughout the whole world of Labour; but this alleged principle is sacred in some of the States, semi-sacred in others, and no principle at all elsewhere. I was not expelled on account of my advocacy of conscription, because in Western Australia we were given a free hand by the highest council of labour, namely, the Labour Congress at Kalgoorlie. In the eastern States, however, men were expelled from the party on the very question on which I was given a free hand; and I again submit that if there is a clear and well-defined principle of labour it ought to prevail all over, and not partly through the Commonwealth. The least we expected from our late colleagues was that they should show some tolerance; but it was their intolerance, their tyranny, their unwillingness to allow me and mine to hold opinions we are entitled to hold as members of a free Democracy that has caused the unbridgeable  gulf that exists to-day, and will continue to the bitter end. </para>

                <para>To-day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> said, in reply to myself, that he had upheld the principles of the Labour movement as a member of the Government. Now, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was a member of the Government when the Military Service Referendum Bill was being put through, and he remained so until and after the Bill had been passed, and had become law. Apparently he thinks that his membership of the Government, and his advocacy of the measure, did not violate a Labour principle. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> whether that is not so ? The honorable senator refuses to answer ; and, although he acted as I have said, as he admits, he claims that he never violated a Labour principle. What, then, becomes of those men in other States who, because they voted for the same measure, were regarded as violating a principle, and others who were told that if they dared to vote for it they would not be indorsed for election? The honorable member claims to be the best Labour man in the country. </para>

I have been branded, or an attempt has been made to brand me, as a traitor. Now, a traitor, in the common acceptance of the term, is a man who accepts or enjoys some office in return for turning on his principles. </para>

                        <para>- Let me remind the honorable senator that when I left the safety of the machine, which he was not game enough to leave, I faced risks, even to the extent of political extinction. Traitors are not made of such stuff ; while, in contrast, there are those who remain behind shivering, afraid to leave the machine on which their bread and butter depends. The Government of which I was a member, could have remained in office until September next, but we felt that if we did we should not be able to do the justice we desired to the country, to which we owe so much. We placed national interests above party and personal interests, and shaped our conduct accordingly; and for that we have been branded as traitors. No Democracy can ever stand such conditions in public life ; a Democracy that does tolerate such conditions deserves to be wiped out of existence. A Democracy that will penalize and persecute, as I and mine have been penalized and persecuted, is no Democracy, but a sham, a delusion, a snare, and unspeakable hypocrisy. As I have said, all we wanted was some manifestation of tolerance when there was such a wide diversion of opinion on a vexed and thorny question. It ought to have been recognised that what was right in the West could not be wrong in the East, and <inline font-style="italic">vice</inline><inline font-style="italic">versa.</inline> But we found that what was right in New South Wales was wrong in Queensland and Victoria ; and in the face of this conflict as between State and State we had a persecution of those who dared to allow the voice of conscience to prevail. No Democracy, from the time of Plato, has ever tolerated such conditions, and if Democracy could tolerate them, I would say, "Away with Democracy, and let us have an Autocracy!" Anything in preference to a false Democracy where Democrats cannot live. Plato has wisely said that every Democracy has within itself the seeds of its own decay, and the. seed of decay in our Democracy is, I venture to say, that change which has lately made itself apparent in this country, and which is masquerading in the name of freedom. These men, of course, think otherwise, but I would point out again that the essence of Democracy is the right of the citizen units composing it to be free at all times, and especially in war time, to say and think what they . believe to be in the nation's interest. That is what I conceive Democracy to be. Without that freedom we will have only a diluted form of Democracy or a variegated form of despotism; and despotism, as we know, is a state of society in which the people have to obey a single man acting in conjunction with a small privileged element of the community. A true Democracy, on the other hand, is, as the name implies, a rule of the people by the people, but how can we have this if some people are to be branded as traitors for expressing their opinion? </para>

                <para>We, on this side, have expressed our opinion. We claimed that inalienable right as Democrats, and now we are branded as traitors, and are set up before our fellow men as " rats " and " renegades." It is a sad and a melancholy condition of affairs. Now, may I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that it is just as well that, in his association with the Labour party, he does not claim to be a prominent Labourite. I do not want to make a comparison of what I have done for the Labour party, with what he has done, but I tell the Senate that I have spent months and months in every year away from my wife and family, and have spent many sleepless nights during the last twenty-five years in endeavouring to further the cause I have had at heart. I have spent months on strike, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> were here he would bear me out when I say that I never drew any strike pay. I was organizing labour in the western State, I Was in the firing line, and I got sacked over and over again for my association with the movement. That is unmistakable evidence of my sincerity for the cause with which I am still associated. Yet I am now to be labelled as a traitor. I say again it is just as well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> not to claim to be a prominent Labourite of long standing, and I remind him that in the past he also has been called the names which he applies to us to-day. I have a high authority for my statement. </para>

                        <para>- It is time, I think, that there was recognition in this Senate that members on this side have some sense of honour, and that we are here to play the game fairly.

The  speaker  went on to refer in very severe terms to the so-called solidarity Labour party. The pledge had cost the Labour party sixteen seats. When they had men coming here and branding as traitors those who opposed the pledge it was a very bad state of things. A <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kohn</inline> from the Central Labour Electoral League spoke for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanney,</inline> the central Labour Electoral Candidate, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gardiner,</inline> speaking of him, said, " He had not intended to refer to him, but when he <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kohn)</inline> showed Mb hand so plainly it was time for the workers to consider whether they were going to. place their affairs in the bands of a clique of that description in Sydney. </para>

                <para>I had some intention of  speaking  further on the situation of the day by way of showing that all this hostility, bitterness, and bad blood can be traced to more than one source. In one State the bad feeling has one cause, in another State a different cause. In the western State we were given a free hand in regard to this vital issue of conscription. We have a free hand still. Had the Labour representatives of the other States insisted. on the same freedom, and taken their place in the van of the Labour movement in their respective States, we should have a wholesome Labour opinion to-day. This reminds me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> was characteristically candid enough to admit that the Labourites on this side have not violated a principle of the Labour platform. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator disavows that statement I will allow it to pass. What was the genesis of the evil with which we are confronted to-day, and how many roots has it? In Western Australia the evil has had no origin, or, if it has, the roots have been transplanted there only very recently, because Western Australia is a tolerant State.Whilst we who believed in conscription had charge of the State Executive, and could pass any resolutions we chose, we had as <inline font-weight="bold">president Mr. Doland,</inline> and as secretary <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clemenson,</inline> both of whom were strong anti-oonscriptionists. There was no attempt on our part to expel them. We never dreamt of taking such a course, although we were strong enough to force them out of the  movement if we had so desired. That shows that Western Australia stands on a higher altitude than any other State so far as the treatment of opponents on this issue is concerned. Did the same thing happen in Victoria, Queensland, or New South Wales? No. What happened there, and what is on record is that we soon saw the last of any prominent man who dared to advocate conscription. These people put anti-conscription before Labour principles, as I propose to prove. These men, who say that they cherish Labour principles most warmly, thought more of anti-conscription than of any vital or sacred Labour principle that they heard, knew, or understood. So far as the State of Queensland is concerned, </para>

                </continue>
                <para>I am going to prove that the origin of this hostility is traceable not so much to a firm adhesion to Labour principles as to a bitter opposition to any man who advocated conscription. They elevated anti-conscription again far higher than Labour principles. Here is my proof taken from the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Daily Standard</inline> of the 7th December, 1915 ; that is, before the Wide Bay election took place. This newspaper, I understand,, circulates as the official mouth-piece of the Labour party, and here let me enter a protest against ; the gross unfairness of Labour journalism -towards Labour men, including myself. I ask honorable senators to listen to the report which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Standard</inline> on the date named - There was no hesitancy of opinion displayed by the delegates of the Brisbane Industrial Council at the special meeting held last night to consider what action the unionists of Brisbane, should take in regard to the attitude of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> towards recruiting. </para>
                <para>There was a good attendance of delegates, and the council was unanimous in condemning the insidious scheme of semi-compulsory recruiting as promulgated by the Federal Government. </para>
                <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">president (Mr. A. Skirving),</inline> on opening the meeting, stated that the executive of the council had endeavoured to arrange an interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> last week on his passing through Brisbane; en <inline font-style="italic">route</inline> to Maryborough, -but the Prime Minister did not stop in Brisbane, and so rendered that impossible. He was, however, in receipt of a wire- from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> Finlavson, M.H.R., notifying the council that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> would meet a deputation of three, representing the Industrial Council, on his return next Wednesday from Wide Bay. </para>

            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hansen</inline>
                (Plumbers) considered that immediate and drastic action should be taken by the council in order to prevent this unauthorized system of so-called recruiting being used to coerce the workers. It was an insult to the workers to give local governing bodies the power that was given to them under this scheme to obtain soldiers. These* same local governing bodies opposed the suffrage for the workers, and always fought most strenuously against all efforts to bring about that reform, but they were prepared to use their power and machinery in order to force men, whom they denied votes, into the army - and the Government was helping them. Unless
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline>
                repudiated the objectionable clauses in the recruiting scheme, he thought that the unionists of the Wide Bay electorate should be advised not to vote for the Labour candidate nextSaturday.

            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Axelsen</inline>
                (Baking Trade) said that the scheme was. a strong move towards conscription. The Federal Government would not openly advocate conscription, because it knew that the workers throughout Australia would then, disown it.
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline>
                was to a great extent engaged in a game of bluff, but if that bluff was successful he would go still further. He (the  speaker)  considered that they should go back to their various unions and recommend to them the course they should take. They must take drastic action, and be on the alert. It seemed to him that there was only one possible course to pursue. The Prime Minister was speaking for himself, not for the party, and it was high time the workers understood that.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anzelark</inline>
                (Progressive Carpenters) said it was time for the workers to act. Already employers and Governments alike were discharging single men, which was a most cowardly form of conscription. Despite the frantic efforts of the war-mongers to smother the news all over the world there was a big demand on the part of the workers that this insensate strife should stop, and the workers of Australia, in common with the workers . of all other, countries, should stand up and determine to kill the militarism of the conscriptionist.

            <para>It was also resolved unanimously :  - " That, in the event of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> replies to the deputation not being deemed satisfactory by the council, wires be immediately despatched to the various centres and press of the Wide Bay electorate, recommending that all workers abstain from supporting the Labour candidate." </para>
            <para class="block">The three principal speakers declared that unless they got a special pledge from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> on one issue Labour principles and the Wide Bay electorate would go overboard. Such are the Labourites of the latter day. ' The Leader of the Opposition has, on more than one occasion, twitted Labour members on this side of the Senate with having left the Labour party because they refused to abide by the decision of a duly-constituted meeting of the party, the meeting he alluded to being one at which a motion had been rigged up to depose <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> from the leadership. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> should have told the whole truth on this matter, because the beginning of the movement which caused the disruption of the Australian Labour party goes much farther back than that. It goes back as long ago as the latter part of the year 1915, at the time when an election contest was taking place in the Wide Bay electorate, following on the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> from that seat. While that contest was being waged a resolution was passed by the Brisbane Industrial Council to the effect that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> who was then Prime Minister, did not pledge himself against conscription that council would advise the electors of Maryborough to vote against the Labour candidate for the Wide Bay seat - thus early showing that that council was prepared to scab on the Australian Labour movement if it did not get its own way in that particular matter. The report of the proceedings of the Brisbane Industrial Council published in the Brisbane Labour papers at that time showed that the moving spirits, in getting that resolution passed by the council, were three men named Anzelark, Axelsen, and Hansen. The mere recitation of these three names is a sufficient indication of the kind of influence that was behind the genesis of the anti-conscription movement. </para>

                    <para>- The report I quoted is taken from the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Daily Standard,</inline> the Labour party's own newspaper. I do not know whether any anti-conscriptionist in this building is a true Labourite in the proper sense of the term. I will say no more about this matter than that the three spokesmen, with the remarkable names I have quoted, were influential in getting the resolution passed long before the Government wedded themselves to the Military Service Referendum Bill. These three men said that the price of their support of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was that he should give certain pledges, and if he did not, away would go the Wide Bay seat, and everything in the shape of a Labour principle. It is important to remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was at that time the trusted leader of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline></para>

                        <para>- The question of conscription was one which either affected the . platform of the party or it did not. If it did not, then no one. had the right to claim any pledge from any Labour member on the matter. If, as the Leagues claimed, it was a question vitally affecting the Labour movement, then the fact of the Victorian leagues and council demanding and receiving such a pledge from their representatives prevented these representatives keeping the pledge which they had given to the Australian Labour party, and had signed their names to, that they would abide by the decision arrived at by a majority vote at a duly constituted Caucus meeting of the party. The fact that they had given such a pledge to the local leagues and council effectively prevented them from being free to keep the pledge common to all Australian Labour members, to be bound by a Caucus . decision. Thus the Political labour leagues and council of Victoria, and later of Queensland and New South Wales, which adopted pretty much the same attitude, amounted in effect to scabbing on the Australian Labour Constitution, and had the effect of inducing their members - to use a good Labour vernacular - to " scab " on the movement also. </para>

                        <para>- From my own statement, drawn up for the honorable senator's edification. This is the information which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> did not give to the Senate, which shows that the people who really burst up the Labour movement were those who had taken action which effectively prevented solidarity in that movement, and which also had the effect of allowing the representatives of one State to take one particular course and remain good, loyal, and faithful members of the party, while members from another State who took an exactly similar course were to be branded and hounded out of the party as traitors and rats. That substantiates what I have said about the differences of opinion in different States. What was a rule, last determination, and do-or-die decision in one State was not so regarded in a neighbouring State. Then these decisions in the various States cut across the constitution which these men were pledged to uphold. They came here pledged to obey majority rule in the Caucus", but they have signed their freedom away to leagues in Queensland and in Victoria. To that extent they have blacklegged  and scabbed on the Labour movement, and for that reason they stand condemned. They cannot have things both ways, and so long as I am in the fight they will not be allowed to have things both ways because I shall state the other side of the case, and have it included in the records of the Senate. </para>

We expected something different from men holding responsible positions, and really when such men did not observe the ordinary rules of fair play and good conduct, it is hard to expect that the rank and file, without the information they have, would observe them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunter</inline> had something to say about the employment of Maltese on the trans-Australian railway, and I quote the following telegram from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in reply to what he said - </para>

                    <para>Statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunter</inline> (Minister for Lands), at Roma, that 2,000 men on transcontinental railway already discharged, and 2,000 Maltese put on in their places is without shadow of foundation. You have my authority to deny it in unqualified terms, and to say that it is one of a swarm of deliberate falsehoods and gross misrepresentations emanating from men who have no case, and whose motives for opposing the Government proposals are obvious. </para>

                <para class="block">When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> made his reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunter,</inline> it occurred to me that it would be well to put the other side of the case in order that honorable senators might know what manner of man <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunter</inline> is. I have shown that he endeavoured to poison tEe minds of the electors of Queensland by telling them that 2,000 Maltese were to be employed on the trans-Australian railway. </para>

I do not say one thing in Western Australia, and another thing at the Guild Hall, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> does. In one place the honorable senator praised the British Fleet and the Australian Fleet, but at the Guild Hall he did not want any war. I have here a sample of the treatment extended to Labour mem - bers by the Labour press to show how they behaved at a time when we might have expected something very much better from them.

                        <para>- This is the sort of thing that we have had to endure for some years. Into such hands has Labour intrusted its sacred cause that these jeering, gibing members of the Official Labour party would not give me a chance to speak if it were not for the Standing Orders. I know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that you will see that I am not denied my right of free speech in this Chamber, and that I shall be allowed to give expression to my thoughts provided that these honorable senators opposite have not- a majority to enable them to tear up the Standing Orders and to throw them in my very face. I repeat again that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> will release from the pledge of secrecy those men inside and outside Parliament with whom he has engaged in conversation as to his position in the Official  Labour party, then I will support a motion of censure against the Government if  they  do not appoint the Royal Commission for which a request has been made. </para>

                        <para>- The character of honest men, who have been before the people for years, is assailed by these people. They would besmirch and blight our characters; they would brand us as worthless, low-down, and ill-bred. Is it not time that some one with an honest thought in his breast should give it fling ? I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> to declare that he will release from the bonds of confidence those to whom he has spoken regarding his position in the Official Labour party. If he will do that, I will support a motion of censure on the Government should they refuse to  appoint a Royal Commission. Let him rise and make his charge. He has only to say these words, " I charge the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .</inline> Hughes, with having attempted to corrupt and bribe me." If he will do that now, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will submit a motion of censure, I shall support that motion. More than that I cannot do. Honorable senators opposite, however, are not prepared to do what I suggest. They will stand idly by, and see my character blasted. They will not, they dare not - cowards and black in their hearts as they are - come out into the open. </para>

They would blast the reputations of men of stainless character, who have been for many years trusted followers of the Labour cause, and upon whose word the welfare of tens of thousands of working men and working women has rested. <inline font-style="italic">A.</inline> word from us would have betrayed them', and ruined their welfare. These honorable senators of the Official Labour party sling mud, and try to besmirch the reputations of such men as you, sir, the Minister for Defence, the Prime Minister, and myself. Nemesis will yet overtake them. They have not a vestige of evidence, not a witness to support their allegations, but on the <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement of this one man, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Watson,</inline> they are endeavouring to tear to pieces the character of honorable men. "William Morris Hughes for twenty-five years worked unceasingly in the cause of Labour which he loved so well.  He was surrounded by men whom he regarded as friends and comrades, but they have proved to be but brigands on the highway. He has come through the wood - he has passed through the dark and stormy way - and when at length on one issue he sought to have a free hand these alleged friends and champions of his, these comrades of twenty-five years' standing, rent him asunder. A black and vile and abominable injustice has been done <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> by these men. May it never be meted out to them. That is my charitable prayer, and I hope it may be granted. We  have the Prime Minister on the one hand, and on the other we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> who sits therewith condemnation written on his face. He looks condemned. </para>

                        <para>- I do not hesitate to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson's</inline> mind and heart are on this side while his carcase is on that.  His  better understanding and judgment are on this side, but he sits in opposition. If he will only release from the bond of secrecy the men to whom I have referred, I shall be prepared tomorrow, to place in the witness-box two men who will prove that his heart and mind and conscience are with us on this side of the chamber, while his carcase remains over there. I have reasoned the? thing out, and I invite honorable senators to consider for a moment the effect of the statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> alleges was made to him by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> If his better judgment and his convictions were such as to draw him to this side of the House, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> knowing this, had induced him to cross over, with the result that he and his wife and family were victimized in Newcastle, then I say that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had paid money to keep him from being so victimized that would not be bribery. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> jeers, but it was only the other day that his napkins in the Labour movement were removed. I have been through much during my association with Labour, and on many occasions have made efforts to bring blacklegs over to our cause. I and others have brought them into the Labour fold, and made them feel that they had a conscience, just as I am endeavouring now to make <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> feel that even he has a conscience. After bringing over these blacklegs we' looked after them, and took care to prevent them from being victimized because of their association with us. Was that bribery? Would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> say that it was ? Will' he say that there is any essential difference between what we did in order to bring blacklegs into the fold of Labour - blacklegs whom we paid and bribed as an inducement 'to join our unions, by finding the wherewithal for them and their families in many cases - that there is any essential t difference between what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is said to have done, and what we have done over and over again, and have gloried in doing. </para>

                    <para>. - I was not anxious to take part in this debate, but seeing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has gone through his usual performance of making all sorts of charges against honorable senators on this side of the chamber, I feel that it is necessary to say a few words in reply. I am not going to blow about my long connexion with the Labour movement. My record stands without that. It has been known amongst the people with whom I come into close contact for many years. I have always found that those who have gone back on the Labour movement during the time that I have been associated with it never stop squealing about the treatment which they have received. They are never tired of declaring that they Were driven out of the movement; that a junta had been formed, and that, while they were the only loyal persons connected with the Labour party, those who remained in it were driving it to destruction. My experience teaches me that those who have deserted the Labour cause, notwithstanding that they have loudly complained how badly they were treated, have disappeared from public life -within a comparatively brief period. In Queensland we have had members going buck upon the movement every few years. As far back as 1896 some of them went back upon it. Then the Labour party once more built themselves up into a majority. Again, others went back upon that party. But where are they to-day? There is not one of them in the public life of that State. Consequently, I do not take much notice of the erstwhile members of our party in this Chamber who have recently gone out of the movement. They joined the movement, and they were selected and put into positions here by the men with whom they were associated. In many cases they were placed in those positions without cost to themselves. When they leave the movement, those who remain behind in it do not complain, except that they feel that the men who have taken their comrades out of the workshop o.r the mine, and put them into positions in the public life of Australia, have been harshly treated. It seems to me that the organizations with which I have been connected for many years are quite justified in feeling resentment when they find members whom they have placed in responsible positions recreant to their trust. If they put a man into the office of secretary of one of their unions, and he clears out with the funds, the position simply is that they have placed their confidence in him and he has sold them. That is exactly the case of the man whom they place in the public life of this country, and who afterwards deserts them. No wonder that they feel aggrieved. But the workers soon regain what they have lost by putting other men into those positions. That is the' reason why I do not feel bitter about this business. Those members of our party whose careers are pretty clean need not take the slightest notice of the charges which have been levelled against us. Only the other evening <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> addressing me, said, " If you do not be quiet I shall tell something about you." This is the right place for him to tell it. I do not wish him to hide anything so far as I am concerned, nor does any other honorable senator on this side of the chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has said that Australia is in his debt. That may be so, but I hardly understand how it can be. Australia is not in my debt. I have lived in this country longer than has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> I have worked as hard as he, and I have been connected with Labour organizations longer than he has. ' I believe that I have as good a record in my own State as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has in any part of Australia. Yet I stand here and say that Australia owes me nothing, but that I owe a good deal to Australia. <inline font-style="italic">Not</inline> only do I owe a good deal to this country, but I owe more to the organizations, which are composed of the men who have given of their time and money to build up the movement to which I belong. While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> thinks that he has conferred a benefit on Australia by coming here, I know that I am considerably indebted to this country. Would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> have become a member of Parliament if he had remained in his own country? I do not think .so. I am perfectly satisfied that I would not. In my walk of life it would not have been possible for me to have attained to the position which I now occupy. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> said that he was pushed into the business. My experience is that a little while ago most men were pushed into the business, because it was very hard then to get men who were prepared to take on the responsibility of a seat in Parliament. It was not a question of men looking for seats, but of seats looking for Labour men to contest them. For that reason there were quite a number who, when approached, replied, " I do not think that I am the right man to contest this seat. There is So-and-so, who is better fitted for the task." In that way many a man has been pushed into public life, and has made good when he has got there. The honorable senator informs us that he himself has a win-the-war policy as the one plank in his platform; and the position in this regard is certainly most peculiar. It often reminds one of old <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Johnson's</inline> definition of " patriotism." We see people going around flag-wagging, and declaring from the housetops that they are the only crowd who wish to win the war, though I -undertake to say that in Australia there is hardly a person who has not the same desire. Those people, however, have assumed the name which the Director of Recruiting specially asked should be reserved for the Recruiting Committee, which was practically brought into existence by the Government, and on which are serving persons of all political colours and parties. But the Government and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> step in with the declaration, "We are the Win-the-war party !" However, I do not suppose that this will do them much good, for we all know how they have been trying to win the war. I shall not go into that question; because it has been dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan,</inline> who has shown us how bargaining and haggling has occupied their minds much more than has the war. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> talks about the hard treatment meted out to him - how he was "expelled " from the Labour movement. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Nothing of the sort. No one knows that better than himself. What happened has been told here a dozen times. The fact is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> thought fit to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and to dissociate himself from the Labour movement. Of that I do not complain, because he had a perfect right to do as he chose; but why does he squeal and howl and pose as a martyr? We had no power, as I have said before, to expel any of the members referred to. They know that they never would have been in Parliament without the assistance of the associations and organizations which have been built up in the various States, and which have the right to refuse to indorse selection, or to say nothing and allow those who like to go for selection. It simply means that  an organization which is not satisfied with a member has the power to say that they will not select him as a candidate. No man in the Labour movement has any pre-emptive right to his seat in Parliament. This is a fact well known; and I have stood up for the principle, I suppose, as much, if not more, than any of those members who  are now squealing about their treatment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> asks why the Labour principles should not obtain  all over Australia, and undoubtedly they should be general. But the Labour movement was organized as a State movement, and, as yet, there is no central organization representing the whole of Australia. If a man be chosen, for instance, to contest a seat in Queensland, it would not be of any use to ask the people of Western Australia to indorse the selection. I admit that it is a pity that our organization does not, as yet, extend to united action so far as the Federal Parliament is concerned, though I believe that eventually we shall have centralization to such an extent that the same principles will apply to the Commonwealth Labour party as to the Labour parties in the various States. All this means that the Labour movement is not, as yet, sufficiently organized, but in the many years since we started we have, of course, made quite a number of mistakes, and probably will make more. At the same time, we have always rectified our mistakes as soon as they were discovered ; and I am sure there is sufficient initiative in the movement to remove the objection of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> complains so bitterly. The honor- able senator, as I say, poses as a victim, and I certainly have no objection to his posing as such. He has informed us that years ago he landed in Queensland and worked in various parts of that State ; and I can assure him that we should welcome him there again, in order that he might find out the kind of reception he would get from the men he left long ago. Should he come to Queensland again, he will find himself appealing to people who have gone 'through the industrial and political fire a great deal more than those with whom he has been associated in the western State. The honorable senator complains that he has been called a traitor and other names. I have not applied these epithets to the honorable senator, though I admit I have heard them applied to him. He complains that he and those associated with him left the party at the risk of facing political oblivion, while those who remained have done so in order to secure their positions. That is rather good news for most of us, but I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> really believes that statement. He told us, at the same time, that we on this side are going to be wiped out - that it is this party which is going into oblivion, and will not again see the inside of the legislative halls of the country. He evidently believes that all the kudos is going to those who have practically thrown the Labour movement over and sunk what, in my mind, is one of its principles. It is not only to-day that I have come to the conclusion that the principle I refer to is one of the Labour movement, because I spoke to that effect from my seat here when the Military Service Referendum Bill was before the Chamber. I asked honorable senators then whether they thought that if any one of them had gone on the public platform during the election in 1914, and advocated compulsory service outside Australia, he would have seen the inside of Parliament House. Honorable senators know perfectly well that, under such circumstances, they would not have been elected, and that this was, at any rate, an unwritten law in the Labour movement. I am satisfied that if any member from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> downwards had. gone to West Sydney, and told the people he was advocating compulsory service outside Australia, he would not have got back to the Federal </para>
                <para class="block">Parliament. But having got back, it was then a different matter. Apparently they could then feel free to alter their opinions. I agree, however, with the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> when he wrote and published his <inline font-style="italic">Case for Labour,</inline> that, while a man may have a perfect right to change his opinions, it is then his duty to resign his seat, and go back to the people who had elected him. That is the only honest course. Our friends on the other side do not want to do that at all, but I' feel sure their policy would not be endorsed by a majority of the people of this country. I am not going into that matter now because it has been repeated half-a-dozen times already in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I shall take the opportunity of dealing with it on the platform in my own State.' Evidently there is a desire to embarrass <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> as the Leader of the Labour party in the Senate. It, appears that there is in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of a few years back a manifesto iri which he is concerned. I have forgotten all about it, and I think now it would be a very good thing for our side to dig up that manifesto, which, I understand, was published over the name of J. C. "Watson. </para>

Watson, and if the statement as read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is correct it should be rather a good manifesto for the Labour party to republish, because it will enable the people to see how the men they used to trust as far back as 1894 regarded those who went back on the Labour movement. That is all we are asking now. We want the people to understand where those who were concerned in the little juntas at that time stand to-day, and we want the' people to understand also where we are to-day. </para>

                        <para>-Yes. I have no quarrel with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson.</inline> He stepped out of the party, as he was certainly entitled to do, and after working outside in the interests of the party for a long time, he took it into his head to go back upon the principles of the party so that to-day the party does not want him at all. I believe he is fairly well situated. Personally I do not wish for the downfall of any man from an industrial point of view, but I think it is the bounden duty of Labour throughout Australia to strain every nerve to put men who go back on their principles back into the position from which they were taken. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> had a lot to say about some action that was taken in Brisbane, and the treatment meted out to him and others by a section of the Labour press. I can quite understand that, for I sometimes see in the Labour press opinions that I would not endorse for a moment. But Labour must have a press to make itself articulate throughout the length and breadth df this country, and as we cannot get a perfect press any more than we can get perfect politicians, we have to take the press as we find it. Before we had a press of our own, Labour men were not always reported correctly in the capitalistic papers. If, however, there was something which would tell from their point of view against the Labour movement, we could be sure of publicity through garbled reports and condemnation. At first, we used to complain, but at last we reached the stage when we said it did not matter very much because our reputations were known to the people, and no one would believe that we gave utterance to sentiments ' such as were sometimes attributed to us. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> does not get that treatment now from the capitalistic press of Australia, because he is in the limelight, and papers like the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney . Morning Herald,</inline> the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier,</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> are careful to guard his interests and the interests' of other men of his party whom they bitterly opposed at one time - not much more than three months ago. </para>

                            does some stupid things at times, and I suppose that was one of them. We cannot deal with a newspaper in that way. I think it is better for the public to know the standing of the newspapers. Sometimes when those who are opposed to me in politics receive particular notice in a leading paper like the Brisbane
                            <inline font-style="italic">Courier,</inline>
                            I say to them, "that paper is boosting you," and they turn round complaining that it is doing them more harm than good. That is how the power of this, archimedean lever, as it is called, is sometimes employed". It does not do us any particular harm; and when it speaks kindly of ns» as it does to-day of our friends on the other side, it is time for the people of the country to ask whether it is not necessary to make some inquiry regarding our action, or what we are likely to do. 'Therefore I have no particular anxiety or trouble about this sort of thing. The pressmen do their work just as other people. If a newspaper is issued in a particular interest, it is going to do better work for that interest than for any opposing interest. Newspapers everywhere go on the settled policy that they have been established to do the best they can for those to whom they belong, and they do so.

                            also spoke about the action of the industrial council in regard to the Wide Bay election, and I want to say that a large number of people in Queensland do not agree with what was done in that case But they say, " Now we see how you lost the Wide Bay seat." They do not see anything of the kind. The trouble with the Wide Bay seat was that, because
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline>
                            had been representing it for a considerable time, and was favorably known from one end of the constituency to the other, many Labour people became careless, and the organization was allowed to become slack. When-
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline>
                            went along  votes were recorded for him here, there, and everywhere&gt; and they were able to win the seat time after time. But when the personality of
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline>
                            Fisher was removed, the organization having become weak, the Labour candidate suffered defeat, and, as Labour has always had to do after a set-back, it must do in the Wide Bay electorate a lot of pick-and-shovel work in order to recover the seat. When

                            referred to the men whose names are printed as being associated with the Brisbane industrial council, he made a mistake. I have known Edwin Hansen since he was a boy, and I knew his father nearly forty years ago. Hansen senior was a man who, with little opportunity, did as much work for the Labour movement as
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>
                            ever did. He was unassuming, always at his post, and dependable. After doing his day's work he devoted a considerable amount of time to the Labour movement, because he realized the unfavorable conditions under which we worked, and was resolved to make those conditions better for his fellow men. I respected him, and he was always welcome at my home. Neither

                    nor any other man can afford to throw stones at men of his kind. Edward Hansen is a native of this country;
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>
                    is not, and neither am I. That fact may not make much difference, but those of us who came from overseas cannot afford to cast aspersions on lads who were born in the country before we originally arrived here as immigrants. I cannot say anything of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Axelsen.</inline>
                    It is the name that has attracted the notice of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    - the man who complained and almost cried because some one had insulted the members of his family by saying that his wife was a German. I believe that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Axelsen</inline>
                    was born in this country, and his parents have been in Australia for very many years.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anzelark</inline>
                    has been connected with the Labour movement for some time. He is even more progressive and extreme than I am.  His  people were employed in the early years of last century by the Governor of New South Wales, and generation after generation of the family has been born in Australia. It is at men such as these that honorable senators opposite sneer because of their names, and because they are sticking to a party which those honorable gentlemen have deserted. I do not think the sneers will do any harm. Those men will continue building up the Labour movement, which sooner or later will shift out of public life those who have been unfaithful to it. Mention was made of the action of this organization, and
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    said that that action was taken because the Government made a census of the wealth of Australia. It was not the wealth census that caused those men to take action when the acting Prime Minister was in Queensland. An agitation was in progress that no man should be allowed to obtain employment who could be considered eligible to go to the front. Because of. that agitation those men feel bitter to-day. The Ladies' Recruiting Committee in Brisbane broke up the other day because a deputation asked the Acting Prime Minister to comb out from the Public Service all men who could be considered eligible to go to the front. It was thought that by taking action of that, kind, private employers would be induced to follow the same course, and all those who might be considered eligible to go to the front would be thrown out of employment and compelled to go into camp. That is the sort of coercion against which the Labour party fought, and our attitude was indorsed by a majority of 70,000 of the people of the Commonwealth. We shall not be ashamed or afraid to fight the same issue again, and I believe we shall be just as successful in our appeal to the people at the forthcoming elections as we were on the 28th October. I shall not say much about the attacks upon
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline>
                    He is a bigger man than I am and well able to defend himself. But I do think the manly statement he made regarding his political career will be believed by the people. It is not necessary for him to tell the people of New South Wales what his record is, because they know it, and have returned him time after time to the State and Federal Parliaments. They know the action he took, and the electors have indorsed it every time he has appealed to them. The statements made concerning him are put forth in the belief 'that there will be a number of people who will be induced to doubt the
                    <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline>
                    of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. Those who are in public life and have no hard things said about them are not worth much. Up to the time I first contested a seat for Parliament I had never done anything but heavy work. I was strong and could tackle any job. Because of my physique . I was fairly successful in getting employment. In my first campaign a man who never in the whole course of his life had lifted anything heavier than his own portmanteau, and whose working implement was a pen, came to the district and made a statement from the public platform that I had never done an honest day's work He sought to show that I was a shirker and a loafer, and that the electors could have no confidence in me.  His  attack was meant to injure me, but the publication of such statements in the Conservative press circulating in the electorate did me a lot of good. I was well known in the district, and people saw me going to and returning from work. I always had a fair reputation, and these attacks only recoiled on the head of the candidate in whose interest my traducer was speaking. I am reminded of Mark Twain's story that he never knew what a wretched villain he was until he stood for a public position, and only when he withdrew from the elections was he allowed to realize again the virtues which he possessed. So it is with most men in public life. Speaking to an old friend whom I met to-night I told him of the statements that had been made concerning me. He laughed and said, " I have known you for many years, and I am well a'ware of the work you have done in the Labour movement. Why do not the people who make these statements come to Queensland and repeat them so that the people may take them at their own valuation."
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>
                    was much perturbed because
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline>
                    was supposed to be overjoyed at the possible defeat of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scaddan.</inline>
                    I met
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scaddan,</inline>
                    but I do not know very much about him. He may be all right. But it is reported that during his election campaign he said very little about conscription. He allowed it to be generally understood that he was opposed to compulsion, but as soon as he had won his seat he became a solid worker for conscription. He also sent a telegram to the Premier of South Australia repudiating that State for its vote on the conscription issue unless Wallaroo did something to save it. This incident reminds me of the condition of Sodom. Are there five righteous men in South Australia ? We have heard the judgment of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scaddan</inline>
                    on South Australia. I thought he was renouncing his own State because it has not come up to his expectations since he left it. When I came here I met a man from Bendigo, and when I told him that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scaddan</inline>
                    repudiated South Australia, his own State, he informed me that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scaddan</inline>
                    came from Eaglehawk, and only went over to Moonta or Wallaroo because he could not get a job in Victoria. Although he has repudiated South Australia, I do not anticipate that his action will reduce the yield of wheat, will affect the growth of grapes, the production of wine, the flow of the Murray, or the mineral possibilities of the State. Though
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>
                    was greatly offended at
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>
                    Mullan's  merriment, I have only to say that I am glad that we have not  many Scaddans  in Queensland. We have dad challenges of all kinds thrown out recently in the Senate.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>
                    has challenged
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline>
                    to throw tip
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Ms seat</inline>
                    and go out with him and play the game, as he calls it. I should call it playing the goat. In the first place, the seat is not
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks'</inline>
                    seat, and no one knows that better than does
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks.</inline>
                    It was won by the honorable senator, but only with all the assistance that could be given him by the Labour movement of Queensland. I deny the right of any man who has been put into a seat in Parliament by the Labour movement to give it up because some one challenges him to fight for it. It would be just as bad from the point of view of Labour for
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline>
                    to throw up his seat in order to take up
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline>
                    challenge as it was for
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>
                    to go back upon the party who made it possible for him to obtain a seat in this chamber.

                        <para>- There may be something in that. The first I heard of this kind of caper was when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smythe</inline> were representing Gympie in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. They sat on different sides of the House, and used to throw bouquets at one another across the floor of the chamber. One evening <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smythe</inline> ruffled <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher's</inline> feathers, and, losing his temper, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> offered there and then to resign his seat if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smythe</inline> would do the same. He thought that there might then be an opportunity to have two Labour members returned for Gympie. I was at the time as young a man politically as was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> because we entered the Queensland Parliament together, but I went to him and told him that he had no right to make such a challenge, because, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smythe</inline> took it up, he would learn that he had no right to play fast and loose with a seat which had been won for him by the hard work and sacrifice of the miners of Gympie. In the circumstances, I say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> may sit back and laugh at the heroics of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> I may say, however, that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> came to Queensland to contest a seat for the Senate, he would go away an older, sadder, and wiser man. He would find that his "coo-ee" and monkey tricks would not go down in Queensland. I do not believe that they will go down for any length of time in Western Australia. The honorable senator has also challenged <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> that if he. will do something <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will at once undertake to vote for a Royal Commission. It is very good pf the honorable senator, but his vote is not wanted. By a majority of eighteen to thirteen the Senate has carried a motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission, and the responsibility for its appointment now rests with the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has said that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> will do a certain thing, and the Government do not appoint a Royal Commission, he will assist him if he moves a vote of want of confidence in the Government. We are not play-acting here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> does all the acting, and we are merely spectators of his performance. We are going presently to ask the people to carry a vote of want of confidence in the Government, and why, in the circumstances, need we bother about the opinions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> on these matters. The honorable senator has used the language of vituperation, and has threatened to go outside and say harsh things about us. I shall not trouble to say harsh things about him o r about any other of the honorable senators who have left the Labour party. I shall, however, tell the truth, and if I come back to the Senate it will be because I will have continued, to advocate and maintain the principles of the Labour movement. I must admit that I often enjoy a speech from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap.</inline> In very flowery language the honorable senator quoted the Koran, Confucius, and the works of old-time writers who laid down the principles which to-day guide the peoples of the countries in which they lived. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable senator. He tells us that he was. returned to this Parliament as a Liberal. I have no quarrel with him on that account. But he ought not to make statements about his principles with which we can scarcely agree. He said that Liberalism is synonymous with liberty and freedom. Let us consider how far it has been synonymous with freedom. Twenty-seven years ago we fought, we starved, we slaved in this country to burst up that old principle of Liberalism known as freedom of contract. That was the principle which' led to the maritime strike ' in . 1890. There are friends of mine who have scarcely yet recovered from the shock which they suffered at that time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> told us' tonight that he went through that strike; but in those days he was a young man, having no one dependent upon him. Many of those with whom I was acquainted had wives and families dependent upon them, and as a result of the strike they lost nearly everything they had in the world. I knew men to come out of their ships and walk the streets of Brisbane and other centres' of Queensland for weeks and months. The little homes and furniture they had tried to get together had to be sacrificed in the fight they made against that principle of Liberalism - freedom of contract. The Liberals attempted to enforce the same principle in every industry in Australia, and it was only by the sacrifices of those engaged in the Labour movement that it was possible to scotch, if not to kill altogether, that principle of freedom for which Liberalism stood at that time. There were no Conservatives in tne Parliament of Australia at that time. The ideas of the men then in Parliament were those of people who had lived a hundred years before, but they called themselves Liberals all the same, and they were animated by the principles which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> says animates Liberalism throughout Australia. I can remember the time when work girls in Brisbane used to start work at half -past 8 o'clock in the morning and knock off at half-past 10 at night for five nights a week, and they started work at half-past 8 o'clock in the morning and knocked, off at half -past 11 at night on the sixth day of the week. Although they had to work these long hours they were very badly paid. Those who were his supporters were the strong pillars of Liberalism. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say so for a moment. They may be called Liberals, for what difference does the name make? It is their actions we are, interested in. We were interested in the action that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> took the other day, when, after a great deal of energy and back-door sort of business had been expended by members of the Government to obtain a majority, the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> and his friend caused the majority to disappear. We on this side did not say anything, because it wau those honorable senators' own business; and if it was the action of Liberalism, it only shows that there is some freedom in it. We who have had experience of industrial life in Australia realize that all that has been granted or obtained by the workers has been granted or obtained because of the fear of the growth of the Labour movement. </para>

                        <para>- I think there are other States in which a great deal more has been done. In Queensland, for instance, where there is the only State Labour Government in existence to-day, reforms are being carried out in a way never tried before. In the Western State the. socialistic experiments of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scaddan</inline> and his friends are on 'the scrap heap; and the Liberal Government, said to stand for freedom and everything that is good, are inviting their friends to buy the bargains, which are the result of the expenditure df public money. </para>

                        <para>- It would be a wise course for many of us. The incursions of the late Western Australian Government into industrial enterprises has only succeeded in extracting money out of the pockets of the people; and for this I am sorry, because I should like to see those experiments made such a success as would induce other States to follow the example. It has been said that there is no liberty of action in the Labour movement, but I submit that there is no movement in Australia where the same liberty of action has always been enjoyed. </para>

                        <para>- Do I understand the honorable senator to say that if a thing is not in black and white we have not to take any notice of it? Anti-slavery, for instance, does not appear on the Labour platform, but is the honorable member in favour of slavery? I think that he will say, as I do, that anti-slavery is a principle of the Labour movement; and if there were an attempt to introduce slavery into Australia I would oppose it as earnestly as I do conscription. I contend that those who go back on the principles of a party should no longer belong to the party. </para>

                        <para>- That is a different matter altogether, and I am not going to discuss conscription now, because I intend to deal with it on the platform, as I did in September and October. I shall ask the people whether they have changed their mind, and point out that the same conditions exist now as then, except that there are certain other matters which have to be taken into consideration. I shall tell the public exactly the position I occupy in this regard. In Queensland there was a very nice majority against conscription, and I believe we shall have a larger majority on the 5th May, especially when the people are acquainted with the tactics adopted by the Government to prolong the life of Parliament - to refer to the Imperial authorities the question whether it should or should not be prolonged. I am prepared to meet the supporters of the Government on the Imperialistic question, because I think that if ever there is a curse in this country it will be in consequence of the action of those people who attempt to shackle us more strongly . than we are now in what they term " Imperalism." We hear a great deal about abuse that the members of the Labour party are heaping on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> Personally, I very rarely mention <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> name, and, as a rule, do not refer to him at all, always preferring to avoid personalities. As to what I did, honorable senators know that, in the first place, I was opposed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> going to Europe at all, because I did not believe that he had an invitation. I do not believe now that he had an invitation, but that he simply humbugged the Labour party and Parliament when he went away on his trip. I believe there was an invitation, but that the invitation came a considerable time before, and was to the ex-Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher.</inline> In my opinion, that was the position, and that is my opinion now ; and it is the reason why personally I would oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> leaving the country when I think he can do better work here. </para>

                        <para>- I never said such a thing. The honorable senator can make that statement if he likes, as he has made a large number of other statements on the floor of this Chamber; but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said, nobody but himself will take any notice of him. I am always prepared to stand up to anything that I say. I have been connected with the Labour movement all my life, even before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie saw this country at all. That, however, does not necessarily mean that I have done more than any other man for the movement. It simply means that I am getting older, and have gone down the hill a little further, than some of my friends. At all events, my reputation in my own State is sufficient for me. I invite the honorable senator to go there - to the place where he used to work at one time - and ask the people about my reputation. </para>

                        <para>- I was known long before the honorable senator came to Queensland and worked for blackfellows'  wages down in the pit at Bundamba.  A year or two after the honorable senator left the district, an organization I was connected with sent 'down two organizers to try and get the men to join the union, so that w3 could assist in the maritime strike. An old friend of mine, who knew nothing practically about coal-mining, was sent up there, in company with a man who did know about the district. They went down to the mine to try and improve the conditions of the men. who, as I have said, at that time were working for blackfellows' wages. </para>

                        <para>- It does not matter much, but it was some considerable time before he did. I could give him the date, because I have kept the book which I used to carry at that time. But as I have already remarked, that does not imply that I claim to have done any more than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> who has gone back on the Labour movement; or any other men, but, at all events, I have not gone back on it. I am still connected with it, as I was long before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie landed on these shores. Now with regard to all these allegations about the hatred of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> it appears to me that some people have the impression that if the Right Honorable William Morris Hughes had not come to Australia, we would have been wandering about in a half -clothed and half -fed condition. But if we look round the world,, we find that Labourism is growing everywhere in all civilized . countries, and without the influence of .our Prime Minister. In many places they have never heard of him, and do not know what sort of man he is, but still the movement is growing, because the economic pressure is driving the people along whether  they like it or not, and somebody is bound to rise out of the ranks of labour, and take the place of leaders everywhere. I am prepared to give all the credit that is due to the men who have done so much' for' labour, for I realize that many of them took an active part in the Labour movement at a time when it was not quite so respectable as it is to-day, and when it required brave men to stand up and make sacrifices in order to attain their objective. When the secretaries, and many of the organizers of the Labour movement of Queensland said they were afraid <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was going back on the Labour movement, I told them that I did not believe he would, but that even if he did, it would not make much difference, so long as those who were returned to the Federal Parliament remained solid, as they were expected to. That was the attitude I took up. 1 did not think then that five and twenty other men were  also likely to sell the movement. That contingency never crossed my mind. However, a fair number of men supported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and he smashed, to the utmost of his power, the Labour movement to which he belonged. Then he formed another Government, and smashed it in seven or eight weeks, and still another one, which he smashed in a fortnight. That is pretty quick work. Much was said during the conscription campaign about the light which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> saw when he returned from England. I said that what he saw was the light of the wrecker, and so it proved; he has been doing little else but use that light ever since. When I go before the electors I shall not abuse <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> We have to deal with other matters more important than William Morris Hughes, or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> They are merely passing incidents in the Labour movement. I have seen many come into the movement and rise like rockets. They have been full of energy and sparks for a little while, and then have come down like sticks. Pome of my bitterest antagonists in Queensland to-day are men who entered the movement and served on various councils ,with me. They are some of the most bitter opponents the Labour movement has. </para>

Many men have tried to change the course of the movement, and have dropped out of it. The movement itself is more virile than when they left it. </para>

Roberts, culminating in his  death in the Queen's Hall. If Alf. Roberts were alive to-day he would be a Labour man, and supporting the Australian Labour party. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that, but honorable senators opposite would not have a hope of getting Alf. Roberts on their side if he were alive to-day. We are charged with having opposed the legislation proposed by the Government which we were supposed to be supporting. To that accusation I plead guilty. It proves that, although our party was in power, every member was free to do as he liked in connexion with any measure that was not portion of the party's policy. The most important opposition some of us offered to the Labour Government was in connexion with' the War Loan, and if there is anything of which .1 feel proud to-day it is that action. I intend to ask the people of Queensland whether -they believe that the people who control probably a quarter of the wealth of the Commonwealth shall be free of taxation. I was opposed to such a proposal, and to the Labour Government, which said it was necessary. I am opposed to it now. Looking through the late Treasurer's speech, I find that he, too, is beginning to realize the impropriety of such an exemption. Is it to be said that the great Labour party which entered Parliament in order to place all people on a reasonably equal footing is prepared to exempt from taxation those who control  from one-tenth to one-quarter of the wealth of the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I shall always be opposed to a proposal of that kind, and I shall ask .the people of Queensland to indorse my action in advocating that no special class in the community shall be exempt from taxation. I also opposed the Labour Government on the question of conscription. </para>

A few days ago, he stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page</inline> was one of the men who had changed their opinions upon conscription. The honorable senator must know very well that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page</inline> was never in favour of conscription. On the contrary, he nearly surrendered his seat before the matter came before Parliament. I was with him in the Brisbane Trades Hall on one occasion when he delivered a speech in which he declared himself ready to fight conscription all along the line, and even to resign his seat, if necessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> must have known of those views when he defamed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page</inline> in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- We hear a lot of that talk when the honorable senator gets on the rampage and screeches about the treatment which he has received from the party which he left in the lurch. He, like all others who have left the Labour movement, poses as a martyr. These men talk about juntas, but unless they appoint themselves to a job, as some have done after leaving the movement, they have not much hope of keeping their heads above water. Really, the only thing that can be said against us is that we did not oppose the Labour Government enough. That, I think, is the only fault that the electors will have to find with us. We shall be reminded that we are responsible for the War Precautions Act. We knew that it was being passed at the instance of the Imperial authorities, but we did not think that its provisions would be abused as they have been. I have no doubt that we shall also be blamed for supporting the provisions controlling the manner in which the voting was carried out at the military service ' referendum. I know that in Queensland, under those provisions, insults were heaped upon scores of people, natives of this country, and as loyal as the Minister for Defence himself. If I had dreamt for a moment that that legislation would be administered as it has been, I should have stood in my place here for any length of time to defeat it. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> said that also, but I am referring to what he said before that. We have been told to-night that we missed a splendid chance of reconciliation with honorable senators on the other side when we refused to assist them to form a National Government. Reconciliation with honorable senators on the Ministerial side is not worrying me. I do not propose to go round asking them to come back to the fold. They say that they are still members of unions, and are still taking part in the Labour movement. I am perfectly satisfied with their position. It is not for the Labour party to seek reconciliation with them. It is not the business of honorable senators on this side to sell themselves in order to make easy a path by which honorable senators opposite may escape from the morass in which they find themselves. It is our business to endeavour to build up the Labour movement again, and make it stronger and more efficient than it was when our friends opposite were associated with it. Our course is straight ahead, with no branching to either side of the straight path, to consider reconciliation proposals. If honorable senators opposite desire to remain connected with the Labour movement, well and good. I should like them to do so. </para>

                        <para>- I have heard many statements made to that effect, but I know of no expulsions from the Parliamentary Labour party. If honorable senators opposite do not care about joining the movement again at once, that will not trouble me. There are thousands of people who stood out of the Labour movement for years, and then discovered that it was advisable to join it, and many such men are doing good work in the movement to-day. We did not seek the breach with honorable senators. They took it upon themselves to leave us. They said they would go out from amongst us. I am reminded by what they did of the story of the pied piper of Hamelin. A little note was sounded by William Morris Hughes, and honorable senators opposite all trotted out after him. Why should we complain about that? They came into the movement, did a certain amount of work in connexion with it, and were elected to positions which they could never have attained by any other agency. They had a perfect right to walk out of the movement if they were satisfied they had done all they could. Why should we complain of that? </para>

                        <para>- What else have we done in connexion with the war? We have equipped all our men and sent them away as fast as we could. I am aware that we cannot send any more at present until we -get information which will release the ships from the Imperial authorities. The Imperial Government wanted steel, and the Government of the Commonwealth said that they might have a considerable quantity of the steel manufactured here. The manufacture of steel is a comparatively new industry in Australia, though it has been carried on to a small extent at Lithgow for some years. The Newcastle works were established only quite recently. Yet, when an application is made for steel rails manufactured in Australia, there was no voice raised in this Chamber against giving the Old Country what she could take away of that commodity. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so, but there was no protest raised in this Chamber. So far as the supply of metals is concerned, we are supplying the largest quantities of wolfram and molybdenite that are being received by Great Britain to-day. We are exporting from Australia large quantities of coke that are required by the smelters of North Queensland in the production of copper from the ore that is being mined there. The wheat-growers of the Commonwealth were asked to put in as extensive an area as possible, and the Imperial authorities said that they would take all the wheat we could raise. I realize that this is a question of ship-  ping, and that the same thing applies to the Australian wool clip, to meat, and to other things sent from this country. The fact remains that Australia is, to a great extent, the storehouse for commodities that are at present required by Great Britain. We are doing everything that it is possible for us to do to supply the demands of the Old Country. What else is there that we can do? We went in for the manufacture of munitions, and those engaged in their manufacture here were offered £1 per shell case. The manufacture of shells was started in another part of the oversea Dominions, and they were produced for 13s. 4d., and are now being satisfactorily produced in that part of the Empire for about 6s. per shell case. In another part of the Empire they are producing at 3s. 6d. munitions such as we offered at£1. It was found that we could not help in connexion with the matter, and we have been told that our efforts were, at any rate, not successful. Then, again, can Australia supply the necessary shipping? I only wish we were taking the minerals out of the ground, turning them into metal, and employing large numbers of men in the building of ships. Up to the present we have not been able to do anything in that direction, and for the ships we have built here we have had to fetch most of the material from the other side of the world. Altogether we find that we can do very little beyond what we are doing already.' It is said there is any amount of work to which people can turn their hands in the way of helping to win the war; but there are thousands of men out of employment, in spite of the large numbers that have left the country. What is required is that some scheme shall be placed before Parliament with a view to enable such work to be done. The Government ought to tell us in what direction the energies of the people can be directed to assist in bringing the war to a speedy conclusion. There is just one other matter , I wish to refer to, and it is in connexion with Queensland. When Federation was inaugurated I believed, and, I think, the people believed, that there was to be Free Trade between the various States. We find now that, on a judgment of the High Court, the States Governments have more power than we thought had been left to them. The War Precautions Act, which was never intended to submerge the Constitution, has been brought in to render nugatory the decision of the High Court. One might have imagined that this was only an afterthought, but I now find that that is not because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> on the 8th December last year, made these remarks- - </para>

                        <para>- I have expressed an opinion quite a number of times. I have said that those members of the Labour party thought that they had done enough, and they followed the ' will0the.wisp, and thus separated themselves from the movement of which they talk so much. I do not find fault with them, because the Labour movement will go on the same as before. It may take some little time before the party gets into its stride again ; but it will get into its stride, and those who have left it will be in no better position than others who left it years ago. None were more bitter against the Labour movement than those who then left it, though we were not bitter against them; the only thing was that the organizations, built up as they were, took particular care, and have always since done so, that those who once went out should not come back into the movement and prostitute it. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr .</inline> Hughes is courting abuse and the thrusts that are directed towards him. We might reasonably expect a gentleman, holding the highest, and what should be a responsible, position of Prime Minister, to announce some policy in consonance with the change in the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of his Cabinet. This he has not done, but has indulged in bitter invective against his old associates and the organizations outside. In any case, I am prepared to let <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and those who went with him, see the matter out with their new allies - the Cook-Irvine-Forrest- Watt combination. But there is one phase of the question as to the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> to which I feel called upon to make some, reference. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and others have liberally thrown out challenges to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> or somebody on his behalf, to go outside, and make accusations, when the case could come into open Court, aud the parties, it is said, could be placed on an equality. With that idea I disagree, for- 1 take the view that, if any man foolishly gave up the right of privilege, and went into Court on such a question, the investigation would at once resolve itself into a political battle, and the Court of law would not be a Court of justice. I think our friends opposite are confusing the issue when they say that a Court of law on such a question is a Court of justice. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want a jury  the case has nothing to do with me. To take a case of the kind before a special jury is to be condemned beforehand, because such juries are selected from a class, which, in ordinary course, is under the thumb of vested interests, and has to do the bidding of those interests. I do not think, therefore, that the boastful challenge to go into a Law Court " cuts much ice." The charges have been made, and if they are not probed to the bottom and the fullest publicity given, I think it is safe to say, uo matter how the people may vote at the elections, nine out of ten will at least be' suspicious about the present situation. When I interjected the other evening something about the use of secret service money in this connexion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said he would use only his own money in the Law Courts. The honorable senator is evidently now in the happy position of being able to swing his money bags about, and offer to spend the money in law costs. I interjected that after he had left the carpenter's bench and was carried into Parliament on the back of Labour, apparently he had no money then to flaunt about. </para>

It is quite possible  that the Minister for Defence from the point of view of those responsible for the military machine, is an excellent Minister, and it is quite likely that it is from men such as those that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has got his reputation. I now want to refer to the proposal to prolong the life of Parliament, but which was afterwards dropped. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what has been the experience of the Minister for Defence, but I have been there and I know what justice is meted out by a special jury. I do not want to go back again, as I am not out of the coils yet, although in my case the experience is four years old. It is an empty challenge to taunt opponents to make the statements outside. Now, with regard to the prolongation of the life of Parliament, I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was speaking the truth when, as Leader of the Senate, he said he had no idea, until Senators Bakhap and Keating made their statements, how they were going to vote on that proposal. But I have formed the opinion, from the unexpected developments of the last few days, that a power behind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen, Mr. Cook, Mr. Hughes,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> brought about the collapse of the Government proposals like a house of cards. That power in my opinion, is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. From the beginning <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest has been consistent in his opposition to the proposal to prolong the life of Parliament. In the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of 29th January he was reported as being the guest of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> Smith in Sydney, and was then emphatically opposed to the proposal. </para>

" The present position has arisen through a series of unconstitutional acts. We Liberals have always believed in and preached' responsible government. Then why not let us go straight to the people and ask them to decide ? The situation is complicated, not on account of the war. Both the Hughes and Cook parties are unanimous ' win-the-war parties,' and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> and many of his party, similarly declare themselves. The present political situation is caused by the taking of a referendum on compulsory service in time of war, which every one is now agreed was not a subject to be submitted to referendum, but should have been decided by Parliament itself." </para>

                    Forrest said that every one admits that conscription was an issue which should never have been submitted to a referendum. Evidently he overlooked the fact that 1,300,000 people voted " No " to that question. Continuing,

                    Forrest was not prepared to prolong the life of Parliament, and, in view of the allegations which have been made in this Chamber by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline>
                    my assumption is that he went behind
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline>
                    back to bring about a collapse of that project. I recall the fact that the Melbourne
                    <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline>
                    of Monday, 5 th March, chronicled an announcement by

                    in this Chamber that there would be a general election. That issue also contained a telegram from Sydney stating that

                    McKay, publicity manager for J. C. Williamson's Theatrical Company Limited, had been engaged to accompany the delegates to London as publicity agent on

                    evidently had made all arrangements for a repetition of the boom which he enjoyed on his previous visit. A theatrical advance agent had been appointed in order that He might transmit to Australia the movements of the Prime Minister," as was done on the occasion of his last visit. This accounted for his reputation, and his " dominating personality," about which we have heard so much.

                        <para>- Well, the electors of Queensland will be the best judge as to whether there is anything in my belief. I believe that the Prime Minister was desirous of going to Great Britain. I do not know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was as ready then to go to the country as at any other time. It appears to me that the change which came about was in the interests of Australia, and in the interests of the nation as a whole. The idea of prolonging the life of Parliament by securing the intervention of the Imperial authorities was an iniquitous proposal. I said the other day when I was speaking on the press censorship - and when you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> called me to order because I was outside the scope of the particular proposal before the Senate - that in the conscription issue the Government had sought to put back the hands- of the clock in Australia a hundred years. I was pointing out that in 1815. as described in the latest volume of the <inline font-style="italic">Historical Records of Australia,</inline> two military officers had brutally done to death a man - a husband who had interposed between them and his wife. I pointed out then that Governor Macquarie had to put up fi fight against military despotism in Australia, and that by the introduction of conscription by means of the referendum we would also have to face the military menace, which had become so pronounced in Australia before we defeated the referendum. I will not go so far as to say that the military officers of this country had reached the stage of the Prussian officers who swagger along the footpath and  brush  civilians into the gutter; but they were approaching that stage. We had seen officers with their gold-headed- canes, flicking their gloves, occupying considerable room on the footpaths. A walk down Collins-street on  any  afternoon was almost a sight for the gods. </para>

The statement bv <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higinbotham</inline> confirms my contention that the pernicious proposal to prolong the life of the National Parliament without the consent of the people of Australia was doubly loaded. We can imagine what William Charles Wentworth, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. J".</inline> D.

What would have been thought of it by latter-day statesmen, such as the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne and the late C. C. Kingston? They would not have had such a proposal on their .minds for a moment. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, such a proposition would be seriously loaded, and I would not agree to it. Generally, when I rise to make a few remarks in the Senate, I am asked to say something about the war. My remarks on that subject will be very brief. In anything I say regarding the war, I speak my own personal views only. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> stated a few days ago that when the Labour Government was endeavouring to pass legislation connected with the war through this Chamber, it was opposed by some honorable senators on this side. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> aptly referred this morning to the opposition offered by. himself, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan, Senator Stewart,</inline> and myself to the conditions governing the War Loan. I took the very first opportunity that presented itself of indicating my attitude publicly, during the byelection for Wide Bay following upon the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher.</inline> I spoke during that campaign in support of the Labour candidate, and at every meeting I addressed I took exception to the conditions which the Labour party had granted in connexion with the War Loan. Although I was supporting the Government; I criticised them severely for what I considered their wrong action iri giving the wealthy people of Australia such alluring terms for a War Loan investment. Apart from the War Loan conditions, there was not a single item of war legislation which was opposed, or even severely criticised, by any honorable senator on this side. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that we had opposed measures relating to the war he might have specified them. For the greater part of the time since the outbreak of war, Parliament has been shut up. With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> ! opposed the  closing of Parliament for five months in order to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to go to London on a self-imposed mission. I regret having reposed in a Labour or any other Government such power as is contained in the War Precautions Act, which we have seen put into operation against only one section of the community. A few days ago I read an extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Western Champion,</inline> the semi-official organ of the Pastoralists' Association in Queensland, pointing out that Australia did not belong to the Australian people, but to the people of Great Britain, who had loaned money to Australia, and that if Australian Workmen continued their vandalism, by which was meant the industrial troubles and demands for higher wages, Great Britain might offer Australia to Japan, and leave it to that country to deal with the vandalism. I have not read that the War Precautions Act was put into operation against the <inline font-style="italic">Western Champion.</inline> Such a statement would serve to prejudice recruiting far more than any speech at a street corner, or in a park, on a Sunday afternoon. Further than that, the Pastoralists' Association issued a blackened map showing the portions of Australia which could be worked by black labour, preferably coolies. That map was circulated throughout Australia, and was sent to honorable members of this Chamber, but no action was taken under the War Precautions Act. Will the Minister say that such a publication assisted recruiting? Will he deny that it would retard recruiting? What shall be said of those men who go on public platforms, and urge others to fight for their country, whilst their official organs tell the people that they have no country. If consistently administered, the War Precautions Act would have been put into operation against these plutocratic publications. It has been enforced, however, against only one section of the community, and that is why I object to giving such extensive powers to any Government. . Apart from that Act and the War Loan, what other war legislation has the late Government to its credit? The list of the Government's achievements since the defection of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes, Senator Pearce,</inline> and their colleagues from the Labour party is not a long one. First came the daylight saving foolishness, introduced as a war measure. No thinking person will say after our experience of it that it has had one iota to do with the war one way or the other. No one in either House objected to it, because we were assured that it was necessary. Achievement number .two was the marriage by proxy joke, another war measure introduced by the Hughes Government and not opposed in this Chamber. That stands to the limited credit of the Government. We were assured that it was required in the interest of the people who had gone abroad. The third farce was the "Unlawful Associations Suppression Act. This, we were told, was necessary because there was an institution in Australia known as the Industrial Workers of the World. It is reasonable to assume, if that body does exist here, that the powers conferred by us on the Government have suppressed it. Have the Government done so? If not, why not? It is idle for them to complain of any such unlawful association when Parliament gave them full power to deal with it. Outside those three jokes, none of which has borne any result, the year's list of achievements was barren. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> point to any item introduced by the present Government, the preceding Government, or the late Labour Government, which was opposed by any member on this side, except the conditions surrounding the war loan, which I would oppose again? I have been repeatedly gibed about my attitude towards recruiting, and have scarcely ever risen in this Chamber during the past six months, except this morning, without having some taunt thrown at me on that subject. I am not going to retreat from the attitude I announced regarding recruiting: but personally I have never made a public statement that I would enlist. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> however, are sitting cheek by jowl in the Cabinet meetings with two members of the Ministry who made public declaration « that they would enlist. </para>

                        <para>- That is between the honorable senator and his con- science.'  His  public statement was that he intended to enlist. The honorable senator may explain this, but the impression on the minds of 99 per cent, of the people is what I have stated. There can be no explanation regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt.</inline> I refer to his public declaration in the Armadale Theatre that he intended to enlist. He subsequently gave a reason why he would not enlist then. This was that if he enlisted "his wife and children would be insufficiently provided for. I do not want to go into his personal position, but he had been Premier of Victoria, and for several years a Minister, and is a business man in addition. If his few children would' not be sufficiently well provided for to enable him to go to the front, what about the five or six children of John Smith, working for 9s. or 10s. per day ? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> said he would enlist before he was forty-five years of age. I believe he was forty-five towards the end of last year, but he has not enlisted. Therefore, before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> attempts to throw any gibes across ;the Chamber they should look a little nearer home to their two colleagues. There has been so much reference to myself that I am going to volunteer an assertion that there are more Ferricks gone from Australia among the soldiers than there are Millens or Pearces. I am not claiming any credit for that. I do not believe in any man saying, "I sent my son." <inline font-style="italic">~No</inline> father has a right to send his son I do not entreat, or ask, or' tell any'one to go. Let every man judge for himself ; but the taunts and gibes have been manifestly unfair, and I think have mostly Been made when I have been speaking in the hope that I would say something which  they  could circulate at election time to  help  what, at .present, is their very much weakened cause. </para>

                            put the true position in regard to any Labour man's seat. It is not to be juggled with, and doubly so in my case, because not only did the Labour movement assist the campaign of myself and my two colleagues in 1913, and of the six of us in 1914, but when I met trouble in the Law Courts the three unions in Brisbane in twenty-four hours guaranteed £1,400 to lodge an appeal to the Full Court, and, if necessary, to the High Court, so that I have an added debt to the Labour movement in Queensland.

                        <para>- That is for them to say. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is so anxious to come to Queensland, I tender him a very cordial invitation next time I am a candidate. I am going to stick to Queensland, which is good enough for me. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> wants to desert his State, as he deserted his party, he is welcome to do it. I do not think he has any great justification for throwing challenges and gibes around, because he occupies a very undignified position. We heard a great deal in the recent campaign about the honorable senator's lifeboat. He wrote an article depicting a lifeboat picking up stragglers in the water, every one of whom when rescued took an oar, and did his share. I understand that that lifeboat has been sailing about rescuing people from the vasty political deep, and came upon <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest struggling in the water. The honorable senator helped <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> into the boat, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> certainly took an oar, but as soon as he got his hands on it, he hit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> over the head with it, and knocked him into the water, -and the honorable senator is now struggling about in a whirlpool of unknown political quantity. Whoever is responsible for the hideous collection of monstrosities in. the Queen's Hall, you, sir, as their guardian, might add two exhibits to them - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> lifeboat and a stuffed specimen of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> Bengal tiger. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has made a number of references to the ferocity with which he was going to attack the Labour party as the ferocity of the Bengal tiger. We have not heard so much about it lately. We have heard, "by Gods," and "by heavens," and " The Labour party can have a Royal Commission," but the poor old Bengal tiger has not been drawn out of his lair for some time past. After the strenuous six months we have had, if I were a candidate this time, I would have no compunction about facing the electors of Queensland, and repeating to them everything I have said since I have been here, in effect, if not in words. I am sure the people will prefer our policy, which is always built on the Labour platform, to the absence of policy on the other side. If they are given a fair deal at the coming election, which they were not given at the referendum campaign, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> does not arrogate to himself that licence with which he so freely ran amok prior to the referendum campaign, the people will have an opportunity of recording a fair and intelligent vote. If they do, I shall be satisfied whichever way the verdict goes, but I shall not be satisfied if the Prime Minister seeks to impose on the people the restrictions with which they were burdened in .the recent referendum campaign. </para>

                    <para>. - I made no' public statement in regard to enlisting. As  a member of the Government, I had to go out and ask people to recruit to go to the war. I realized that it was not fair for me, a man of fighting years, to go on the platform for that purpose unless I was prepared to take the risk myself. When the war census card reached me, I filled it in as follows : - " I do not feel justified in volunteering for the war for the following reasons: that since the outbreak of the war I have been elected by the people of this country to Parliament. On two occasions I have been elected by my party to the Ministry, which I take to be an invitation by my supporters in this country to participate in the management of the war." I concluded by saying that, if relieved of my Ministerial responsibilities, I would take my chance with the rest of Australia. I was explaining this to a friend when I had announced that I was going to resign from the Hughes Ministry after the referendum. The press got hold of it, and asked me if it was true. I said, " Yes, I am going to honour my word." T resigned from the Ministry, and placed myself according to my word in the hands of the Minister. It was then expected that I was going to camp, but, unfortunately, at the time I had my elbow out of joint, and had to postpone this for a few weeks." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> then asked me to return to the Ministry-. There was no shirking, and no desire to shirk. So far as was humanely possible I placed -my services at the disposal of the Minister. </para>

                    (Queensland) [10.31 a.m. J - This Parliament is on the eve of dissolution. It may be said that never hitherto has an* Australian Parliament existed under such a dark shadow. The outlook, so far as Australia is concerned, is extremely  bad, whether viewed from- here or in the light of what is taking place abroad. We know what is tak- ' ing place in Europe. We know that the British Empire was being pushed to the edge of the precipice, and but a little more pressure would have sent it right over, and would have reduced it from the position of, perhaps, the foremost Power in the world to one of third or fourth rate significance. We are not quite out of the wood yet, but we are all living in the earnest hope that the British Empire will emerge triumphant from the struggle, and that the forces that have caused the present conflagration in Europe will, at the close of the war, be dealt with in a satisfactory manner. There is one aspect of the struggle to which I desire to direct attention. I believe that one man is responsible for the conditions now prevailing' in Europe. I refer' to the Emperor of Germany. If Germany had been a republic -Europe would not to-day be deluged with blood, as it is. I have on many occasions objected to monarchy, whether despotic, Or governing in a constitutional fashion. My feeling against personal rule is to-day stronger than ever it' was before. In my opinion one of the first duties of the Allied communities after the war is over, and the Emperor of Germany is defeated and degraded, as I hope he will be, must be to see that every crowned head, including that of our own Empire, is dethroned. The position must always be unsatisfactory while men are sitting in places of power with opportunities of pursuing their policy for decades, and of exerting influence over every man who comes near them.

                        <para>- It does not matter whether I took the oath of allegiance or not, I could not live in the country without obeying its laws. I have done so, but reserve to myself the right to say that I think we might have a better system of government than that which is known as a limited monarchy. The people of Europe will, iri my view, be well advised if they dethrone every monarch on that portion of the earth's surface-: - the Czar of Russia, the Emperor of 'Germany, the King of England, and every other King from one end of Europe to the other. If they do so there will be 'at least some guarantee that no single- individual or family group will again have the opportunity of sitting like a spider in a web for a quarter of a century devoting every energy to the one fiendish end, and that is the end which the German Emperor had in view, namely, to place his own individual carcass on a level with some of the great figures of history. That is, in my opinion, one of the chief forces which operated to bring about the present terrible cataclysm, and if- anything can be done to avoid such a thing in the future it should be done. We are all anxious that the Allies should win the war. I believe that they are on the side of freedom. I believe in the people of every country possessing a full and unfettered voice in the government of that country. If Germany wins in the war the people of Europe will be helots and slaves under the iron heel of Prussian despotism, and the people of Australia will be reduced to a similar condition. Therefore, every lover of liberty should favour the prosecution of the war by the Allies with the utmost energy. Australia has done her share in this great struggle well and nobly. When we consider the population of Australia, the distance we are from the scene of action, and the cost of sending our men  to the battle front, and weigh all these circumstances, as we are entitled to do, I say that Australia has not " quitted," to use an American phrase, but has done her share with remarkable zeal. </para>

                        <para>- Very well. The same thing might be said of Great Britain until very recently, because until a very short time ago every man who went to the front from Great Britain was a volunteer. The combination of discordant voices which we now find in power seems to think that it possesses a monopoly of all virtues and credit connected with the prosecution of the war. Up till two or three months ago the undivided Labour party was in power, and had the opportunity to direct the course of the country with regard to the war. Did the Labour Government ever slacken in the prosecution of the war ? Can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> or any other member of the old Labour party who is no longer in it, say that the undivided Labour party ever did anything to put a break upon Australia's efforts in connexion  with the war, or that any single individual of that party did so ? I venture to say that no such assertion can truthfully be made by any one. The Labour party has always been enthusiastically in favour of prosecuting the war with the utmost energy. ' The only difference between the party now on the Treasury bench and the Labour party with regard to the war is that the former believes, or did believe until a short time ago, in conscription ; that is to say, it believes in compelling men to go anywhere outside Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to enter into a general  discussion  of the question; all I wish to. do is to state as clearly as I can the lines which divide the two parties on this question. If I were to say anything in regard to the matter, I would say that, if it can be shown to me that Australia is in danger, so far as I am personally concerned I would vote to send our men anywhere to defend her. That is my personal and particular view on the question. But we are not discussing that matter at the present moment. A short time ago a referendum of the people of Australia was taken regarding conscription. On a matter  of public policy the people of  Australia ought to govern, and seeing that every man and woman in the country of twenty-one years and upwards has a voice in the management of affairs, it was only right and proper that they should be consulted on a question of such momentous importance. They were consulted, and their verdict was " No." The Government now say that they acquiesce in that verdict, and I believe they are perfectly sincere. I do not think that the Government, even if they were inclined to force conscription, would, after the tremendous vote given against it, dare to do so. That being the position - honorable senators on the Government side having abandoned conscription as part of their policy, and honorable members on this side being opposed to conscription, and conscription not being at all  likely  or possible, unless some extraordinary development takes place - both parties are agreed so far as the war is concerned, and there can be no virtue on one side which is not also on the other. Honorable senators on the Government side are eager to prosecute the war to the last man and the last shilling, metaphorically speaking. </para>

Honorable senators on this side are just as eager that the war shall be prosecuted vigorously and effectively as are honorable senators opposite. The idea which is being promulgated by the Prime Minister and by supporters of the Government, that they are the party which the people ought to place in power if they desire to see the war prosecuted to a successful issue, is nothing but the merest moonshine, pretence, and humbug. </para>

I found things on this side that did not completely satisfy me, and things on the other side that were very much more unsatisfactory, and I made up my mind, seeing that the organizations had decided to act in a particular way, and that  this  was probably the only great question in connexion with which I disagreed with them, that it was my duty and my interest to stay where I was. If I had adopted the heroic course taken by some honorable gentlemen, I should have found myself where they find themselves to-day - I should have found myself sitting on the same benches with men between whom and myself there is not a scintilla of political sympathy. </para>

                        <para>- If we fail, then, of course, somebody else will have the settling of these questions. What I desire to insist on is that it does not necessarily follow that we shall fail unless the present Government is returned to power. So far  as my  opinion is worth anything I express it, -and  I  do not think it matters very much, so far as the prosecution of . the war is concerned, whether the present Coalition Government or the Labour Government be returned. But there are other questions which are related, not only to the prosecution of the war, but to the " cleaning up " which must inevitably take place when the war is over. That brings me to another aspect of this great question. When the war is over, even if we win it, Australia, if not exactly in a ruined condition} will be practically an exhausted community. Any man who takes an unprejudiced, unbiased, and clear view of the present situation can come to no other conclusion. The war, whether we win or lose it, will place us in a position such as the people of Australia have never hitherto occupied. What have we been doing, or what are we doing, to meet such an extraordinary position? What is the Government in power doing, and what is a Government composed of such discordant elements as the present one likely to do in the best interests of Australia during' the war and after the war ? There are hundreds and thousands of men away fighting at the front, and these men will have to be provided for when they come back to civil life. We hear of repatriation schemes here, there, and everywhere. Everything we can do for the returned soldiers must be and will be done; that is the one cry which resounds from end to end of the Continent. But I have lived long enough to have heard that kind of cry before. I have seen men who had fought and bled for the British Empire begging bread on the streets of Great Britain, and I have seen them treated in the most mean and despicable fashion. And I have no doubt that, unless something is done, no symptom of which we have yet seen, and no sound of which we have yet heard in Australia, the lot of a great number of these men, who have gone forth so bravely, and who are fighting so manfully - even those  who are . not wounded are suffering severely and sorely - will not be what it ought to be. We hear a great deal about settling these men on the land, but where is the land to settle them on ? </para>

                        <para>- There are millions and millions of acres of land in Australia, and' yet we find everywhere throughout the Continent that people are rushing into the cities, leaving the country practically desolate. Why are they doing so ? There are a number of reasons, but one of the principal is the difficulty of obtaining good land' at a decent price. That is a difficulty which is driving the country people into the city, and which is preventing city people, who may have some idea of settling on the land, from going into the country. I have dealt with the question of land monopoly many a time before in the Senate, but I think that never before in the history of the country has the full force of this evil presented itself' so powerfully to the public imagination, as now, when we find ourselves in the grip of a tremendous struggle. I have asked the Senate times almost without number to take such action as will break up land monopoly, as will destroy it for ever and give the people of Australia access to the lands of. this Commonwealth. And mark you I did not ask a party to do something which it had not the power to do. I asked a party that could have done this thing if it had agreed to do it, but it either had not the courage or there were a hundred and one other reasons whereby action was not taken, with the result that to-day Australia stands on the threshold, of this great struggle with her lands still undisturbed in the hands of the monopolists. What hope is there if. the country returns the present occupiers of the Treasury bench, to power. I have no- doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and every other ex-member of the Labour party now sitting in this chamber would vote for a swinging land tax., but there are other members of the party opposite who would absolutely refuse to pass taxation that would have the result which I have indicated, is desirable,, namely, the breaking, up of the land monopoly. I am absolutely safe in making, that statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> would support this policy, but would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I am aware that he was- a land-taxer but that was in his green and callow days, and. before- he found that there was perhaps an. easier way for political promotion than by advocating something which strikes at the very root of monopoly, and at the power of the monopolists. In the other Chamber we have <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest and. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook. Would they vote for such a policy? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> would, I believe, because he is a. man of. strong and; clear intellect, and knows what is best to be done in the interests of the country. But,. unhappily at the present moment, if he attempted to carry out that policy it would be immediately vetoed by the members of his- Cabinet. If the people of Australia desired that the lands of. Australia should be thrown open, to settlement and occupation there would be no hope from the party which now occupies the Treasury bench. </para>

                        <para>- But that was nob my fault. The only thing a man in my position can. do is to live in the hope that some day the people will have the sense to put into Parliament men who will carry out what they have promised to do-. Everybody makes mistakes. We choose the wrong men. A man goes to the races and picks a "crock " instead of a winner. We all do that politically, and in every other walk of life, but surely in the course of time we shall have in power a party which, will break up this evil of land monopoly. That political party which is not prepared to do this is of no earthly value to the people of Australia, for this is the one paramount question. It stands above everything else apart from the prosecution of the war itself. Australia can never be safe without a very much larger population. How is she going to keep this country if her lands are locked up in the hands of the monopolists, and can only be secured for use by those who desire to cultivate them on the payment of a ransom - for that is practically what it means. Will people come here under such conditions? Nothing of the kind. I wish to see an inducement to people to come to Australia in the near future. I listened with very great admiration to the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> yesterday. No better advice was ever given to our people than was contained in that speech delivered by that honorable gentleman yesterday. If we desire to maintain a White Australia, to keep our freedom, and .establish in this island continent such conditions as will be an example to the other countries of the world, we must be ready to defend ourselves against any possible form of attack. We cannot do -that without population, and we cannot get .people to come here unless we are prepared to offer them conditions and material advantages in the form of cheap and good land in the best position. Do we offer them that now? When those hard-headed Scottish Commissioners returned to England from their survey of the situation in Australia, they issued a report in which they stated plainly that all the land in the Commonwealth which was of any use for practical settlement had already been mopped up by the monopolist, and could not be obtained without the payment of excessive prices. That is the condition to-day. </para>

                        <para>- And I  say  fearlessly, that we cannot expect men to pay what I .term excessive prices for land in a country such as this, and make a comfortable living on it with ease to themselves. That is the reason why large numbers of men and women, instead of staying in the' country, taking up selections for them selves, and becoming producers of food and other products, are deserting the land, and coming into the towns. That is the kind of thing which the people of Australia, if they are wise, will attempt to stop. We have here a position almost without parallel in the world because we have actually more of our population living in the cities than in the rural districts. Take Victoria for an illustration. According to the Commonwealth Statistician the population is 13 and a fraction per square mile, but if the figures are analyzed it will be found that more than half the population is living in the cities. </para>

                        <para>- More than half the population is living in the cities, and the actual rural population - the settlers on the land- actually represent not more than 6 or 7 per cent, of the total. The honorable gentleman asks me if the people are doing well in the cities. I say that they are not. We know that in the towns high wages are paid and shorter hours of labour are worked, and if we take only a surface view of the matter, the condition of the town worker appears to be much better than the position of the man who lives in the country. But, again, if we analyze the position, we find that -exactly the opposite is the case. Take Melbourne, as an illustration. Do we not find .thousands of unemployed clamouring to the Government for relief, and asking the Government to borrow money for public works to  give  them -employment? This is a most unfortunate state of affairs, and for which I say the Government of Australia are responsible. </para>

The wage paid to the average workman is no more than sufficient to maintain him for the time being, and the moment that wage stops the wolf of poverty enters into the home. It has been said that large numbers of people in the cities will not go into the country. I admit that. It is an unfortunate circumstance -that so many of our people seem wedded to city life. But we must ask ourselves how it happens that they absolutely refuse to' leave the cities and go out to the bush, and that so many people leave the bush to come into the cities. There must be a reason for that. I have stated in this chamber dozens of times that it is because the best lands of the Commonwealth are denied to those men and women. Until we unlock the lands and throw them open to settlement and occupation, until we give our people not the worst lands and those which have not been good enough for the capitalist to work, but the very best areas; until we cut up the land so as to settle people on small holdings and give them a chance of earning an honest livelihood in producing food for themselves, the consumers in the cities, and for export, instead of depending on doles of loan money, we shall never have in Australia any thing but rotten and unsound conditions. </para><interjection><talk.start>

                        <para>- I am not thinking of State rights or anything so unimportant. There is only one right in a community, and that is the right of human beings to live. While millions of acres of the best lands in the Commonwealth are held up by men who do not use them, an injury is being done to every man, woman, and child in Australia, an injury which, while it seems to affect only those who are more immediately concerned by it, will in the end, if not remedied, kill the community itself. What hope have we of any reform in this direction from the party at present in power? The Government tell us that they will prosecute the war with energy and vigour, and that we, on this side, are slackers and shirkers so far as the war is concerned. There is not a scintilla of ruth in that statement, but these other problems which are now important, and which will be still more important when the war is over and its burden has to be shouldered by the people of Australia, must be dealt with. Will the party in power deal with them? Will this party, which, in a few days, will go to the country and proclaim itself the Simon Pure of politics and the " Win-the-War party," do anything to break up this evil of land monopoly ? </para>

If a man said to me, " Look here, old chap, you propose to do so-and-so next week, but how the deuce do you know you will be alive next week? " I should say, " I do not know anything about it, but hitherto in my life I have acted to-day on the assumption that, in all probability, I shall be alive to-morrow." We ought to map out a course tor the future on the assumption that the Allies will emerge victorious from the war. While we bend all our energies .to fighting the enemy at the gate we must never forget the other problems which, the moment the war is over, will become insistent, and, indeed, are insistent now. </para>

                        <para>- I have not yet dealt with land values taxation. What I am insisting on is that we have in Australia conditions of land monopoly which are blighting the progress of the community. Some feeble attempts have been made to deal with this problem, but they have been unsuccessful. For instance, we find that there is an exemption of <inline font-style="italic">£5,000,</inline> under which no Commonwealth land tax can be levied. If we are entitled to the community-created increment at all, we are entitled to get every farthing of it. I know honorable senators opposite will say, when I advocate the abolition of the exemption, that I am in favour of the. taxation of the smaller holdings and injuring the occupiers. But I say, and my contention is capable of proof, if -we had an effective land tax no class in this community would benefit more by its application than the men who occupy small holdings. We find in Victoria that if a man desires to buy a small holding for himself he has to pay from £20 to £100 per acre for the land. If we had such a land tax in operation as would effectively break up land monopoly, those men would be able to get land at a very much cheaper rate. I think that contention is unassailable. </para>

                        <para>- I have not very much knowledge of Tasmania, and that which I do ' possess does not give me a particularly high opinion of the wisdom of those who have had the management of its affairs for some time.- I admit that the honorable senator did not have a decent chance to put the policy of the Labour party into operation, because his tenure of office was cut short. I find in regard to Tasmania that her young men are leaving her, and are going to the mainland, New Zealand, and America. Young women are coming across to the mainland. I investigated the statistics of Tasmania's population some years ago, and I found the position absolutely shocking. There was actually a smaller increase of population in the " tight little island " from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> the apostle of fecundity, comes, than in any country of the civilized world, with the exception of Ireland. There must be something radically wrong with Tasmania, as well as with every other portion of the Commonwealth, when we find not only that its population increase is so small, but that there is a continual drift from the bush into the city, and that the number of people in the cities is altogether out of proportion to the total. There must be something radically wrong with the management of our affairs when we have that result. If we wish to hold this country against possible enemies - and there is more than one of them - we have to get a bigger population as fast as we can. We must do that, or some day see the invader land, take our country from us, and make slaves of ourselves, .our wives, and our children. Are we to knuckle down to the land monopolist, and allow the foreigner to come in and take possession, or shall we deal with the land monopolist now, and give the people an opportunity of settling on their country and placing the community in a position for effective defence ? The alternative before the Parliament and people of the country is that if they do not awaken to the importance, difficulties, and dangers of the situation, they will inevitably pay the penalty of their neglect. There is another matter which I think is possibly of more consequence to-day than it has ever been in the history of Australia.  If the history of the war teaches us anything - if it will teach posterity anything - it will be this one lesson over and above all others: that it is to the supreme advantage' of every community to be as nearly self-contained as possible. England to-day is feeling the effects of what seemed to her, and to many onlookers, a wise and intelligent policy, but which was condemned on many occasions by people whose vision was clearer and better. England now finds that she is the prey of a submarine attack, that her ships laden with food and raw commodities are sunk almost within reach of her ports, and that her people are in danger of starvation. I have pointed out here the trouble which Britain was brewing for herself by her policy, and, as can easily be seen, under a criminal policy of Free Trade huge areas in the country from which I came - Scotland - instead of being devoted to the production of food, have been let out as deer parks, rabbit warrens, and pheasantries  for American millionaires. About six years ago I paid a visit - to a place I knew in my youth, where forty .families existed in comfort, making a living from the soil. There was not a single house, not a stone upon the whole place, not a living being except a gillie or two. The whole place was occupied - by what ? By a rabbit warren. Rabbits were bred there for the profit and amusement of an American millionaire, who had leased the whole countryside. That applies almost everywhere throughout Great Britain and Ireland. In England we find that the parks and the manors of the rich occupy hundreds of thousands of acres, that the area under cultivation and producing food has been continually going down year after year for decades, while Britain has been depending for her food supply upon almost every other country on the face of the globe. The people of Great Britain are waking up to the . stupidity of a policy of that kind. They are beginning to turn the parks and manors into potato fields; they should based one it long ago. They are beginning to tarn the rabbit warrens, the deer parks, and other places of that character into sheep walks land '.cattle runs. I . am afraid that it is too late in the day for that kind of thing. Probably Britain may emerge from this struggle with a few very severe scars, but if -she had been wise enough and careful enough, and her -Government not so much in 'the hands of a selfish -and -unpatriotic aristocracy, then -she would -not be in the serious position which she now occupies. If there is one lesson which we ought to learn from the war, it is that every community should be as nearly self-supporting as possible. What is our condition in Australia? There is not a thing that the heart of man or woman can desire which could not be produced here. There is wool to make clothing; there is meat to eat; there is every kind of food produced either under the temperate or under the tropical climes. We have coal, iron, tin, copper, diamonds, and sapphires - we have a hundred -other products, every one of which is useful for the purposes of man, and every one of which ought to be employed by us in connexion with our own industries if we only had any sense or wisdom to do so. We have heard a great deal about the Tariff , as well as about land monopoly. I am one of those who have been continually telling the people of Australia that, in addition to breaking up land monopoly, which would ' give people employment in the country, we ought to have, not a revenue Tariff such as was referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> yesterday, but a Tariff which would practically prohibit the importation of such goods as we could produce and manufacture. I dare say that there are some things which we could not commercially produce at the present time., but there is a very wide range -of commodities which we could produce, and which we ought to produce. In the last financial year, I gather from statistics, we imported about £.70,000,000 worth of goods. One authority . says that we could easily have produced . at least one-half of those goods- here, but we did not do it. Why ? For 'this reason and for no other, that sufficient protection was not given to the local manufacturer, therefore, the market has been overrun by the cheap goods from foreign countries. </para>

                        <para>- It does not matter to me where the goods . ate coming from. All that troubles me is . that we are importing -from other countries the goods when we ought to be manufacturing them. There is another aspect of the question. While we hire the workers of other countries to produce these commodities for us, large numbers of our own people are going about idle or clamouring' for the expenditure of loan money so that they may be able to live. Would it not be very much . better for us as a community, instead of importing these commodities, to be manufacturing them ? I do not believe that we shall ever have any effective remedy for this kind of thing until we establish an enlightened system of Socialism. Let me take one commodity. In Australia we have everything necessary for the production of hats. We have the wool, fur, labour, and machinery. But what is the fact? The fact is that the Italian hat, notwithstanding a very high duty, is almost chasing the Australian hat out of the market. </para>

                    <para>- Perhaps. I will not go into any details. It seems to me to be utterly foolish on the part of this community to be spending such huge sums in paying wages to the foreigner when the commodities could be made for us by our own people. Will the party which is now in power give us any relief ? I know that a number of the leading men in the present Government are 'Free Traders. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is a Free Trader. I do not know whatSenator Pearce is now ; he used to be a Free Trader; there was a temporary conversion to Protection, but perhaps he has again lapsed. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook  is a Free Trader, and so is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.Influential</inline> members of the present Government are men who, if not Free Traders, are strongly imbued with that fiscal poison. What hope have we from them ? If the Tariff is made a really protective' one, instead of obtaining a revenue of abou,ti£16,000.000 a year from- it, we would riot get more than perhaps £6,000,000/, so that a radical alteration would mean a loss of probably £10,000,000 a year to the Consolidated Revenue: Fund. Members, of the Government are not prepared to give away such a huge sum as that for the simple reason  that they would have to find a substitute for it somewhere else', and they are not prepared to take the steps; necessary to bring that about. Australia will find, herself in practically a new position after the war is over - a position which, will entail a complete review of. her social and economic system. When it was established in 1901 the Commonwealth as a Government was practically free of debt- The State Governments no doubt were largely indebted, but if they were, a very considerable proportion of that indebtedness had been spent in constructing- reproductive works-. The State Governments owned the railways1,, and a large number of buildings; of various'- kinds, and in one way; or another the money which had been borrowed' and spent on works was to- a great extent re? productive-,, though not quite so- largely as ought to have been the- case-. How, do we stand now?' The Commonwealth, in stead of being able- to put "nothing" against the- item " national indebted:ness," will,, if the war continues to the end of this year, have to count upon a debt of considerably over £200,000,000-. I wonder whether that stupendous fact has burnt itself into the minds of members of the- Senate. If. it has not, it ought to do so, because it is a fact of so much importance that whether we will or not we cannot escape examining it and dealing with it. There it is. We have a debt of over £200,000,000 upon which interest at the rate of 4^ per cent, has to be paid - an annual interest burden of £9,000,000. Where is that money to come from? Have the Government any policy in regard to it? </para>

                            says that it should come from- the Customs, but I would remind him that we are already raising-' £16,000,000' annually from that source. This- £9,000,000  is- an amount additional to ' what we have hitherto- required! - a sum for- interest only, and one which consequently will not. be reproductive-. All this money, will be simply wasted,  blown  into the air, perhaps, or sunk in. the seas. Not only will this annual tribute of £9,000,000 require to' be paid, but some day the total debt itself will have to be discharged by the people of- the Commonwealth-. That is a fact of sufficient, moment to compel every honorable senator's attention, though we have heard very little of it during this debate. But if politicians regard it as a matter of so little consequence as not to demand consideration, the unfortunate people of the Commonwealth, in the years to come will have to carry it on their backs, and to 'pay it out of their blood, and bone-, and sinews. The sooner we take, a square look at where we stand, and endeavour to discover a way out of the difficulty, the better. Where are we going to get these £9,000,000? There will be money required for repatriation,, for pensions,, and for a dozen other things. In fact, there will be so much  required,  according to the ex-Treasurer , Mr.; Poynton-, that, in the year 1918,. and from thence onwards, we shall have, to, collect .£18,5.00,000 a yean by way of additional taxation.. Where is that money to. be obtained.? Honorable senators must, have some intelligent idea on the subject,, and, if so, it ought to be made public. Have the Government any policy in connexion with the matter? So far as I have been able to discover, they have not.. But the Labour party policy is quite clear and definite... We intend to go for the community-created land values. I have previously pointed out that there is a sum of between £20,000,000 and £30,000,000 of community-created land values annually passing into the pockets of private land-owners. Not a single farthing of that money belongs by moral right to the people who get it. It belongs to the community which has created it, and instead of finding its way into the pockets of private individuals it ought to be paid into the public Treasury. Now the time has arrived when the people- of Australia will have" to choose one of two ways, of raising that money.

                        <para>- The Bill required more than one day for its consideration , as the Vice-President of the Executive Council knew. The people of Australia will have to- choose one way or the other. Either they will pay this £18,000,000 annually out of their own earnings, in addition to the other taxation to which they so largely contribute, or they will order the Government to see that the community-created land values are paid into the public Treasury, instead of finding their way into the pockets of private land-owners. Here is a sum aggregating anything between £20,000,000 and £30,000,000. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> impugns the accuracy of my figures. I do not say they are absolutely right, but I do not think they are very far from the truth. This immense sum is annually being paid to the private owners of land. Let it be diverted into the public Treasury, and not only will the benefit to the people of Australia be immense, but the stimulus which will result from such an operation will, I am sure, be remarkable. Another mistake to which I referred when the War Loan Bill was under consideration is that 'moneys advanced for war purposes are exempted from taxation. Now, if our war debt on the termination of this terrible struggle aggregates something between £200,000,000 and £300,000,000, it is manifest that we shall be practically exempting from taxation an income of £10,000,000 annually. Is not that folly? Why, we ought to be getting anything from £500,000 to £1.000,000 a year in taxation upon it. As I pointed out yesterday, the Imperial. Government is paying 1 per cent, less interest than we are to those people who have elected to be exempt from income taxation in this connexion. Why could not our own Government do something on similar lines? It is not the poor people who are being benefited by the exemption, because 90 per cent, of the War- Loan funds contributed in Australia has been subscribed by the rich individuals and the banking and other corporations. Yet these people are exempted from taxation on the income derived from interest upon those loans. That kind of thing is stupidity itself. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator knows that I am opposed to the payment of any interest on money raised for the purpose of defence. I gave my reasons for adopting that attitude some time ago, and they are so sound as to be practically unassailable. Here we are burdened with a debt which is beyond parallel for such a small community, and yet we are exempting from taxation £10,000,000 annually, 90 per cent, of which is paid to the very richest people in the Commonwealth. I am almost certain that very soon the necessity for the Government bringing this huge income within the reach of taxation will become so apparent that there will be no escape from it. There is another matter to which I would like to refer very briefly. For some time past we have been spending money very freely and living on a very high plane, so to speak. It seems to me that if we do not voluntarily accept the policy of economy, hardship will force it upon us. Therefore I would urge upon the Government, as I urged upon the last Government, the necessity for exercising very great care 'in the expenditure of public money. The people of Australia will have a sufficient burden to bear without being obliged to carry the additional load of an extremely expensive system of government. The pruning knife ought to be applied very freely. I do not wish to make suggestions in this connexion, although I could do so if I cared to. I have no doubt that if the Labour party are returned to power they will know how to face the situation. But in any case the need for the strictest economy is imperative. Many works which are now in progress might very well be discontinued till other days dawn upon us. We are spending money upon projects which in our life time will yield very little by way of a return. If we must spend money to keep people employed, why not spend it upon clearing and cultivating farms upon which we can settle returned soldiers immediately the war is over? Why not spend money in that direction instead of wasting it on a Capital site which will be of no earthly value to any person now living? Why not do what I have indicated, instead of taking the unfortunate men who have fought and bled for their country and dumping them down on uncleared lands, thus compelling- them to do all the hard pioneering work ? Why not put the whole machinery in working order and thus give them a chance? </para>

                        <para>- I am not going into these details. These men coming back every day must be provided for. There is great talk of settling them on the land. Cannot we, the people of Australia, do what private railway companies are doing in America ? The Canadian Pacific Railway Company sends out its gangs, clears farms, cultivates them, builds houses, gets the stock and puts it on the farm, and says to the man when he comes along, " Here is a farm ready made for you to enter." That is the kind of policy I suggest to the Government to adopt, instead of spending hundreds of thousands of pounds upon projects which, however useful they may be some day in the future, are of no practical value to us at present. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to make an explanation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> in the debate on the first reading, made on me the same personal attack ' that, during this brief session, has already been made by his two colleagues from Western Australia - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. What reason those three Western Australian senators have for bringing up a matter twenty-three years old, and trying to put a wrong construction on it, I do not know. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> quoted an attack made on me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> in this Chamber in 1914. Within three months of that attack being made, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> and myself went before the electors. I returned ; he was defeated. All these honorable senators have tried to make out that twenty-three years ago I did not run as a Labour member. I have twice before answered the statement, and will answer it whenever it is reiterated. In 1891, I signed the pledge of the . Labour party. In 1894, when a new pledge was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson, Mr. Hughes,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> I went to the Labour leagues of my district, and said, " I am not going to sign this pledge; it is an impossible working pledge, but I am willing to sign the pledge I signed in 1891 " - which was the pledge of the Political Labour Party, brought into existence by the Trades and Labour Council in New' South Wales. The leagues there accepted my proposal that I should run against the solidarity candidate. I won the pre-election poll against Bowman, the solidarity candidate, by 400 to 200. When the election came on, one of the candidates in the early stages of the pre-election  ballot, stood against me, and called himself a Labour candidate. I believe he got eighty votes, but, at any rate, I won the election. I remained in that Parliament for twelve months, and I challenge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook, who were sitting with the Liberal party in that Parliament, to say whether once during that period I set foot in their  party room. Each time I have been elected to Parliament - State or Federal - I have been elected as the selected Labour candidate. The only purpose which the three Western Australian senators can have in raking up this matter is to discredit me before the people of Western Australia, and I am determined that no <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will go out with their story in it that does not also carry my contradiction. </para>

            <para>Dear Sir and Comrade,</para>
            <para>I have been instructed by my association to bring under your notice the fact that the postmen in Queensland have not yet received their summer uniforms, whilst the postmen in other parts of the Commonwealth have received theirs some time before Christmas. We would like some of the Queensland members of the party to take up this matter. We would also like a protest made against the new system that has been adopted by the Postmaster-General with regard to our supply of uniforms. They are . going to supply us with one (1) suit of serge every year, and every two (2) years with two (2)- pairs of cotton cord (khaki) suits. However they expect us to be able to keep these suits for two years beats us. Of course this will only be for summer wear, but any one that knows anything about the Queensland summer will know these two suits would only last through one summer, if they . got that far. The Department, in their regulations, expect us to keep clean and respectable, and this is the way they are (not) going to help us to carry out their wishes. </para>
            <para class="block">The summer in Queensland begins in October, and will be over by the time the men get their summer suits. That is not fair to them, especially as men in the Southern States, where the matter is not so urgent, have been getting theirs. If the men are . expected to keep their uniforms neat and tidy it will be impossible for them to do it if the supply of those uniforms is cut down as is indicated in : this letter.Iask the Minister representing tthePostmaster-General to bring this matter under the notice of the Postmaster-General and request him to take steps to rectify what appears to be a serious grievance. </para>

The total amount of previous Supply Bills passed during the financial year is £4,282,845, making, with the amount in the Bill now before us, a total supply for works and buildings of £5,271,090, and covering a period of eleven months. Taking eleven-twelfths of the 1915-16 Estimates, namely, £3,005,291,this total exceeds the proportion; of the 1915-16 Estimates by £2,265,799, the greater part of which is accounted for by the following works, which are now being paid for out of revenue, but last year were provided for out of loan : - Commonwealth railways, £1,327,700; erection of buildings in London, £155,000; purchase of sites, £411,800; construction of conduits and laying wires underground, £144,500; and machine shops, machinery and wharfs at Cockatoo Island, £30,000. These items total £2,069,000'. The difference is also partly accounted for by increases in other items, such as Trade, and Customs, New Works, New South Wales, £22,000- the new Customs House at Sydney accounts for the major part of this amount - Northern Territory £24,900- this is the extra amount required in order to carry out the agreement with Vestey's Meat Works, by which agreement £10,000. has to be expended on dredging a pier at Port Darwin, and £20,000 'has to be expended on- a water supply for the freezing works, though the latter amount has to be recovered later- - and Naval Works,. £19,000. representing the purchase of new barges and plant required for naval bases.. These three items account for a further £65,900; and the difference is further accounted for by excess amounts granted in previous Supply Bills on items, which are not included in the Bill before us. </para>

                        <para>- No. The- amounts covered by the Bill have . already been voted in Supply Bills, but not in any Appropriation Bill. This Bill merely accounts to Parliament for sums that have already been voted. There is a schedule attached which honorable senators have before them, and I direct attention to some of the main items, so that it. will pe seen how the larger items come to be included. -There are items, such as Victualling-stores for Permanent Forces(seagoing), £33,225 ; Citizen Naval Forces called up for duty in consequence of the war, £17,952; expenses of detained enemy vessels used as' cargo carriers, -the revenue from these ' vessels in 1914-15 was £145,503- £153,973 ; expenses in connexion with detained enemy subjects, and other " war services," £13,939; purchase of foodstuffs for Governments of. India and South- Africa, £50,368. Of this amount £27,000, owing by the Government of India, has been re-  covered, and of the balance, £23,000. owing by the Government of South Africa, is now in course qf settlement. Then we have an item £2,333 representing duty on presents sent by members of Australian Forces abroad, and an item of £21,063 in respect of prize- courts. That item covers the wages of detained enemy vessels and all other expenses in connexion with such vessels whilst under the jurisdiction of prize courts. These are practically all war services. Apart from war services the vote for the Defence Department is £24,423. There is also an item of £13,517 in respect of the search for the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Endeavourwhich</inline> was lost in the Southern Ocean, and an item of £30,809 in respect of working expenses on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. The revenue from this railway in 1914-15 was £147,889. It will be seen that there are no large items in this Bill ; the major portion of them represents expenditure in connexion with the war which was unforeseen, and, suddenly arising, had to be met out of the Treasurer's Advance Account. </para>

The fact that they have asked for only three months' Supply means either that after the elections some senators' who have, lost their seats may be called here to legislate, or that the Government will have to carry on without Supply for a considerable time. </para>

                        <para>- No. In the ordinary course of events the Estimates and Budget-papers would have been submitted before the close of the financial year. I am informed that it was thought advisable for Treasury purposes not to ask for Supply covering the remainder of the financial year in the hope that the Department might be able to put forward a complete balance-sheet in respect of the whole year. If we were now to take Supply up to the 30th June, the Treasury would not be able at this stage to bring in a complete balance. The whole matter is left open, so that a complete balance may be brought in. </para>

Of this total of £42,630, £18,129 is provided for a special war reserve of raw material for the manufacture of cordite and the erection of the wireless station at Woodlark Island, while there is also an item of £9,823 for the Naval College. The balance of the provision is made up of various small amounts,' the majority of which are to supplement short provision for specific works on the main Estimates for the year. It carries us only up to the 30th June, 1915, the Estimates for which have already been passed. </para>

                <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                <para class="block">On the 3rd December, 1914, in the House of Representatives, certain resolutions were submitted embodying a Tariff schedule. Honorable senators, of course, are aware that the moment the Tariff schedule was laid on the table of that House the duties became operative. The imposition of the duties, however, is not complete until a measure for that purpose has been passed through Parliament. Seeing that the duties have been, and are, in operation, it is not proposed by the Government to alter any item, except in regard to one or two small things, so as to remove a legal doubt. Otherwise, it is not intended to increase or decrease any portion of the Tariff by a halfpenny. The only purpose of this Bill is, in view of the approaching dissolution of the other House, to legalize the collection of the duties under cover of the resolutions of the 3rd December, 1914. The amount which has been collected is between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000. If this Bill were not carried it would be necessary to refund that sum to those persons who have paid duty in excess of the rate in the old schedule. That is really the only principle with which the Bill deals. I think that everybody is seized of the necessity for the Commonwealth to retain possession of this money. </para>

                        <para>- It is said that this is a Bill to validate the collection of money under the new Tariff schedule which was introduced a little more than two years ago. But some very startling proposals have been put before the country by the Government. I understand, for instance, that there is a proposal to hand back certain money by a complicated arrangement which I cannot explain at this moment, because I have only a slight grasp of it. I refer to the money which has been collected on the importation of cornsacks. </para>

                        <para>- It is too serious a matter to be merely the subject of a statement made on the Bill in the other House. Where is the Board or body of men who would be capable of finding the persons who paid the duty on the cornsacks? The farmers who purchased twenty or thirty bags would get no money handed back to them, because they made their purchases at the retail stores. I submit that the Government, having announced their intention to appeal to the country, should have asked Parliament to appropriate the money necessary for the elections, and done nothing else. I, of course, recognise that the validation of the collection of money under the new Tariff was a necessity. I' do not think that I am a very suspicious man, but if the intention of the Government is that the money paid on the importation of cornsacks is to be refunded through the Wheat Board, it will have to be taken out of the funds derived . from the sale of wheat. First, the farmer has paid a high price for his cornsacks; and, secondly, the amount of the duty is to be handed back to the importer of the cornsacks, and the Wheat Board will refund the money out of the Wheat Pool. It is not a small sum which is involved. . I have only hurriedly looked into the matter, but I am informed that the refund will amount to about £140,000. This is a very serious proposal. It ought not to have been made on the eve of a general election. It ought not to be carried any further here until we have the frankest statement as to how the operation is to he given effect, and every detail has been thoroughly threshed out. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> poses here as a representative of the farmers in his State, I believe that he is a farming man, too. </para>

                        <para>- Well, I will say that the honorable senator is here representing the farmers of Western Australia, and is a farming man himself. I venture to say that he is not prepared to accept this proposal without the fullest explanation. I am prepared to validate the collection of the new Tariff, but as regards the proposal .to hand back the money paid on an item to any one, I require a fuller statement to be made. I do not want the farmers in my constituency to have an opportunity to say to me, " You agreed to a certain sum of money being paid back to the importers of cornsacks, and to that money being taken out of the Wheat Pool." I do not suggest that the- Government are going "to take that course. I have only heard a statement that it is to be done by the Wheat Board. All the money which that Board handles <inline font-style="italic">is,</inline> of course, derived from the wheat which it has sold. It will be easy to- find the men who imported the cornsacks, but" I do not think that any person will say that, in this country,, there are any philanthropic importers who did not- add the amount of the duty paid on the cornsacks to their wholesale price. </para>

The Ministry had considered the question of supplying the farmers with new sacks for the 1917-18 crop. It had been found that the use of old sacks was attended with very serious inconvenience and much loss. It was, therefore, considered desirable that, new sacks should be used.. The Ministry intended, through the Wheat Board, or otherwise, to relieve the farmer of the payment of duty on the bags. (Ministerial cheers'.) Probably provision would also- be made for an adequate supply of bags., </para>

                        I must confess to a certain amount of surprise that this suggestion should come from such a quarter. (Laughter..) I thought that the great pastoralists of this country found other mouth-pieces. (Laughter.) However, if the squatter, like the humble " cockey," when he finds himself in difficulties, comes to the fountain without money and. without price, we shall take him in, too. (Loud laughter.)

To my mind, it is desirable that the farmers should have their wheat sacks admitted free, and I think that the pastoralists also should have their woolpacks and their wool bales , admitted free. But I am not prepared to remit to the Wheat Board the determination of the question of whether or not the existing duties shall be abolished. </para>

I regret exceedingly that we have to deal with the Tariff in the way that we are dealing with it, but I recognise that no matter what Government 'happened to be in office it could not be dealt with in any other way. Before Parliament is dissolved it is absolutely essential that the collection of the duties levied under our Customs schedule during the past two years or more shall be validated, in order that no question may arise as to the legality of that collection. </para>

                        <para>- But if Parliament were dissolved, and the opportunity offered, I venture to say that the liquor industry, for example, which has been called upon to pay much heavier duties since the enactment of this Tariff, would endeavour to secure a remission of those duties. I recognise, therefore, that the Bill is necessary. To my mind, the most satisfactory settlement of the matter would be that which I have already foreshadowed. Under it, the duties hitherto levied would be collected up till to-day, but, henceforth, cornsacks, woolpacks, and wool bales would be admitted free. I am just as - anxious as is anybody that the farmers should be given a square deal, but I am, nevertheless, quite conservative in saying that the determination of whether or not the. existing duties should be abolished ought not to be remitted to the Wheat Board. </para>

                        <para>- Their bags cost much more to-day than they did previously, in addition to which they are smaller. Their bags are more than 100 per cent, dearer now than they were eight or nine years ago. On the other band the price of wool and sheep to-day is very much higher than it used to be. The drought conditions have affected both industries, but if we are going to grant any concession to either of them, we ought to recognise that the bad seasons have injuriously affected the farming industry more acutely than any other industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> talks about land values taxation. Why, he could go to Western Australia to-day, and get 500 or 600 farms if he chose. Why do not such men get their necks in the collar and do a bit of cultivation? Why do they not take an axe in their hands and go out into the forest? Then they would realize the risk that is incurred by a man who seeks to make the wilderness productive. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has done something like that he will be entitled to falk, but not before. The men on our wheat-growing areas to-day are living like blackfellows in lean-to shanties. - It is utterly impossible for them to provide decent conditions for their women. The latter are true heroines - the women who dwell on the frontiers of civilization to-day. What chance do the children of such settlers get? </para>

                        <para>- That is so, sir, but I have been led to contrast the position of our wheat-growers to-day with the position of persons in other branches of industry. City workers, who receive 10s. or l2s. per day are living in a paradise as compared with our wheat-growers. Those who make its idle lands productive are the salt of the population of this country. Such persons should be encouraged. Under the old Tariff a duty of 15 per cent, was charged on bags used by the farming community. That is not a very serious impost, and under normal conditions I am prepared to call upon the agricultural industry to make an equitable sacrifice with a view to securing the enactment of a permanent and scientific Protective Tariff in this country. The duty on bags, that is to say, the manufactured article, has been 15 per cent.,  and, as I have stated, the price of bags has risen to over 100 per cent, more than it was eight -or ten years ago. "We have to take into consideration the fact that there is a duty of 10  peT  cent, on woven jute imported for the manufacture of bags, so that the total duty on the industry amounts to 25 per cent., and that is a pretty stiff duty upon the farmer. I am not asking for special favours for the unfortunate wheat-growers. Perhaps it would be more correct to speak of them as wheat-sowers, for very often after they sow their wheat it does not grow". The wool-raisers of the country have had a pretty fair time. Mutton and wool are to-day selling at higher prices than ever before in the history of sheep-farming in this country. Though the war is supposed to be advantageous to the wheat farmer, the price of his product has only increased by a few pence per bushel. Honorable senators should bear in mind that the' wheat-growers delivered the goods last year, and have not been paid for them yet. </para>

                        <para>- I am satisfied that the Government in remitting the duty on cornsacks will adopt' a wise policy. If the present duties up to 25 per cent, are continued, the effect will be to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. It will mean that men in the new wheat-growing areas will be unable to support their families, and will have to borrow money to pay the duty. It will be agreed that that would be a wrong policy. When the wheatgrowers get fairly on their feet I shall not object to ' calling upon them to meet their full share of the sacrifice necessary to establish a scientific system of Protection, but in the present state of their industry they cannot stand the duty. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) [2.52].  -  I am very pleased to hear that the Government intend to remit the duty on cornsacks and woolpacks. Wheat-growing and sheep-growing are primary industries of the Commonwealth which deserve all the assistance we can give them. I rose merely to say that I approve of what I understand to. bo the intention of the Government in this matter, and to add that I think it would be a mistake to make any distinction, so far as the remission of duty is concerned, between the two industries referred to.

                    <para>. -  The debate has been a somewhat wide one, and, in reply, I can scarcely confine myself to the bare question of tie duty. The position with which we are confronted is due to the operation of the Wheat Pool, and the difficulties in connexion with freight and shipping. Last year we had a record wheat crop in Australia, but it followed upon a year of drought. The result of the drought was that the wheat crop suffered little or no damage from pests.- The plentiful rains of the. present season have put us up against the. difficulty of coping with plagues of mice and other pests that are attacking the wheat. Our expert advice is that the spread of pests is sometimes due to the use of second-hand bags. The shipping difficulty has been increasing from time to time, and although we have sold practically all of last year's wheat, and this year's wheat as well, we have no guarantee as to when we are going to get the next shipment of. wheat away. I hope we shall be able to do so at an early date. In the circumstances, we. do not desire to take any unnecessary risks in- connexion with the storage of wheat, and have consequently decided not to permit the use of second-hand bags for the purpose. I have to say further that there is no bag at present made in Australia that is considered suitable for the storing, of wheat for any considerable length of time. There is no difficulty in connexion with  the supply of 90 per cent, of the bags required by the wheat farmers. What happens is this : A farmer who wants 1,000 bags cannot afford to lay out his money, and let it remain practically idle for twelve months, and so he orders only 900. The whole of the difficulty in dealing with the matter arises in connexion with the supply of the last 10 per cent, of bags required. I have given personal attention to the matter, and I have found that sometimes as much as 12s. 6d. and 13s. per dozen is charged for the last 10 per cent.  We have a well organized Wheat Pool, and are able to handle the wheat crop in the interest both of the farmer and the country. We think, therefore, that we may be considered equally capable of handling the bag problem. But the course that is to be adopted has not yet been finally decided. If the Commonwealth Government imported the jute bags a saving could be effected for the farmer, because no duty would be charged upon the Government importations. It should be mentioned that the present duty is a purely revenue duty. </para>

Protection has been the declared policy of the country for a long time, and we have had Parliament after Parliament elected to place that policy upon the statute-book, but it has not been done. It seems to me that members of the various Parliaments have been somewhat in the position of the unjust steward of whom we read in holy writ, with this difference : that whereas he was discharged ignominiously, members of the Senate have not been treated in that fashion. </para>

                    <para>. - Perhaps I may be able, under this clause, to put on record what I desire to say. I regret very much that Protection, which is the declared policy of the people of Australia, has not been given effect to by this Parliament, and I trust that every known Free Trader in this Parliament - I do not care who he is, or to what party he belongs - will be dismissed at -the coming elections. Seeing that the people, by great majorities, have on different occasions declared for high Protection, and not merely for revenue tariffism, members ought to be prepared either to give effect to the policy or resign their seats. Revenue tariffism is not my creed. I believe in Protection, and the present Tariff is ; a revenue Tariff, pure and simple.  I do not say that it has been constructed with the . object of relieving the rich from taxation, but it certainly has that result. I believe in . trying to develop the industries of Australia, and not in keeping Australia in perpetuity as a hewer of wood and a . drawer of water - as a hod-carrier to the brick builders of other nations. Let me take the case of wool. How much do we manufacture in this . country? And can we manufacture it here? </para>

                        <para>- Why do we not manufacture more of it? We have a great number of mills here, but, unfortunately, with the exception of one or two, their machinery is not up to . date. If we had a really effective Tariff an inducement would be given to companies from other countries to come here with their capital and machinery and manufacture our wool into clothing. In that case a number of companies would undoubtedly be snuffed out, and only those equipped with the most modern machinery would be able to survive competition. If such a policy were adopted it. would be bad for some of the existing companies, but it would be extremely beneficial for Australia. So much for wool. Let me now take the hat industry. We have the wool and the fur, as well as operatives "capable of making hats. I am not going to say where the trouble lies - whether with the hat manufacturers or with the wholesalers or retailers - but it is patent that, notwithstanding the high duty which ought to be 'protective, but which "apparently is not, the Italian hat manufacturers are pouring their hats into Australia by the thousand. </para>

                        <para>- I thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> for your ruling. This measure, . as you have pointed out, is a Bill to validate certain duties. Now I am opposed to validating duties which do not give effect to the Protective policy which the people -of Australia desire, and which it was the object of this Parliament to secure when the Tariff was made law. Surely I am entitled to use arguments in connexion with the various items to make out my case ? Now, in the matter of hats, I took the opportunity a few years ago to interview . the Denton Halt Factory people to ascertain what they got from the wholesaler for their bats. I was told that they were paid from 48s. to 54s. per dozen, or from 4s. to 4s. 6d. for each hat. The retailer of these hats, which had been sold by the factory to the wholesaler at 4s. 6d., passed them on to the public at anything from 10s. 6d. to 12s. 6d. each. There appears to be something wrong there. It seems to me to be useless to give high Protection to an industry unless the public are to benefit from that Protection in some way or another. With the wool and fur obtainable in Australia, surely it should be possible for a hat costing the wholesaler 4s. 6d. to be retailed at a lower price than 10s. 6d., and still leave a sufficient margin of profit for the wholesaler and retailer. It seems to me that Protection, after all, does not wholly fill the bill. We shall have to go in for Socialism instead of allowing the manufacture of our hats to remain in the hands of private companies. If we are wise, when the people give us the power we will establish Commonwealth hat and other factories, when we shall be in such a position that we can pass on the whole benefit to the consumer. So much, for wool for hats. There is a number of' other industries which it is absolutely essential should be developed in Australia. Take, for instance, the iron industry, which is the basis of every other industry. What have we done in the direction of its development? Have we done anything of any importance or consequence ? Do we nob stand just where we did a few years ago ? Have the directions given by the people of the Commonwealth to this Parliament had any effect whatever ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but we are not manufacturing steel rails in anything like the quantity which we should be doing. There is not a single industry I can think of in which a vast development is not possible. The only means by which that development can be brought about is by shutting out the products of other countries, and thus giving encouragement to the local manufacture of those commodities. We import large quantities of boots from other countries, though not nearly so much as was done at one time. I see no reason why we should import a single pair of boots. Our people can make boots as effectively as the bootmakers of any country. We have the hides, and ought to be able to manufacture leather of as good quality as the leather from any other part of the world. We are sending away ever year a vast number of hides which ought to be manufactured into leather here. We have, the raw material of nearly every industry. Why do we import so much? During the last financial year why did we import £70,000,000 worth of other commodities ? One half of those commodities could have been, made on Australian soil by Australian hands. Why was it not done'? Simply because our duties, nominally protective but really only revenue producing, did not permit of it. </para>

                            seems to think that no country in the world has attempted to carry out a really Protectionist policy. If he looks up the Tariff of the United States of America, he will find that it produces, per head of the population, only 25s., as compared with, the 75s. which the Australian Tariff produces.

                        <para>- That is one instance of a really Protectionist Tariff. What has been the result in the United States of America so far as the organization of, not only industries, but industrialism, is concerned? That country stands in a class by itself. There- is no other community under the sun where the dealing with the products of Nature is so highly developed and organized as. in the United States. That is one. of the direct results of the policy of high Protection which was inaugurated there many years, ago. If it was done there, surely it could be done here ! The people of Australia want it to be done,, but the- politicians, apparently,, for some reason or another,, will not do it. If the people have any wisdom they will take the Free Trade politicians by the scruff of the neck at the. coming election and bundle them out of Parliament into private life. </para>

                        <para>- They can use nearly everything else, whereas we use nothing: We have any quantity of raw material suitable for every conceivable industry. We have the most boundless possibilities, with regard to the development of industries', and- we fail to take- advantage of them. A double duty  devolves upon  the Parliament of the Commonwealth. We are bound, as men having a little common sense, to utilize if we can the various products of Nature which have been placed at our disposal. If we have iron, why do we not use it? If we have wool, why do we not use it? If we have hides, why do we not use them? And so on. But we have another duty to perform. We have the young men and women of the Commonwealth to consider. We have to provide careers for them. We have to open to them the gateways of industrialism and science and the application of science to various industries. Upon us lies the responsibility of giving the young men and women an opportunity of developing the talents with which Nature has endowed them. Are we doing that? No. The policy of Australia has made of us a community of hewers of wood and drawers of water. The Australian brain is as quick and as keen as the brain of the people of any other community I know of; in fact, I believe that it is quicker aud keener in many ways. Yet what opportunity do we give our people ? Why not follow the example of the United States of America and establish industries by the means which they adopt 1 </para>

                        <para>- We cannot be leaders where others have already blazed the track. It is a most excellent thing to be a good leader, but it is also a very good thing to be a careful follower. If we follow in' the footsteps of the United States, without tumbling into some of the pitfalls which awaited them, I think that we shall be doing a very good thing for the people of the Commonwealth; but if we continue to go on with a revenue Tariff, what will be the result? We will not establish industries; as a matter of fact, we will do the very opposite. We will place a direct obstruction in the path of Australia's development. Suppose that we had no Customs  duty,  and that everything was allowed to come in free, we would lose £16,000,000 of revenue: but we would have to get that revenue from some other source, and the source I would vote to obtain it from would be land-values taxation. If that were done, the resources of the Commonwealth would be made available to its people, and the land monopolist would be taxed ; but while this revenue Tariff remains in force, he will be saved from the necessary taxation, and the resources of the Commonwealth will remain undeveloped. </para>

                        <para>- My position is quite clear, to myself, at any rate. I may not, perhaps, have been able to get the whole thing into <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant's</inline> head; but that is not my fault. What I am pleading for is a Tariff which will protect, which will create industries instead of giving us revenue. The Tariff which it is proposed to validate is a mere revenue-producing machine. It does not create a single industry. It actually prevents industries from being established. If we had a really Protective Tariff, the consequences would be the very opposite. We would get comparatively little revenue, but the hum of " industry would be heard all over the Commonwealth. Persons from Great Britain and Europe, and perhaps from America, would be coming here with their money, their plant, ' their experience, and their trained men and women, and would be establishing industries on the soil of the Commonwealth which would not only add to its population and its wealth, but also to its strength and its security. Let me give one instance. When the present Tariff was going through this Parliament, there was some discussion on the question of condensed milk. That is not a very important matter, but the principle I am seeking to enunciate applies to it, and applies to every other industry which could be established here. At that time the duty on condensed milk was so low that the great bulk of that commodity used in the Commonwealth came from Nestle's factory, in Switzerland, I think. When the duty on condensed milk was being discussed here, we had letters from butter and cheese factories in various portions of the Commonwealth asking us not to vote for any increase in the duty. Why? Because these persons knew perfectly well that if we made the duty a protective one, Nestles and Company would establish themselves on Australian soil, and would mop up a very large share of the trade in milk and cream, and thus deprive them, in a measure, of the business that they were doing. These arguments did not weigh with some honorable senators. We persisted in our action, and the duty was made a protective one. What was the result? Nestles and Company came here, brought their plant, their experts and their capital, so that Australia is now one of the great condensed milk-producing countries of the world, supplying not merely the requirements of our own people, but actually exporting to other countries. What has been done in that industry could be done in a score of other industries, to the great advantage of this community. I have said enough to show honorable senators that what I desire is a highly Protective Tariff. I do not care how high we put the duties, </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to say a very few words in connexion with this Bill. I shall vote to validate the collection of duties under our existing Tariff, for the simple reason that no alternative is presented to me. At the same time, that Tariff does not by any means meet with my approval. I would like to see the duties levied under it much higher than they are; but, of course, I recognise that if this measure be not passed, it will be absolutely impossible to return to those who have paid them the duties which have been collected since December, 1914. All the money thus raised has already been expended, and, consequently, I am obliged to vote for the Bill. At the same time, the existing Tariff does not meet with my approval in many directions, and I hope that the Government which is in power after the elections will bring forward a more effective schedule.  from a Protectionist stand-point. I agree in the main with the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> and I think it would be wise if we started to build up a high Tariff wall, even in the midst of the present calamitous war. Truly the people of Australia are long-suffering. Upon nearly every occasion . they have been gulled on the fiscal question. They have been promised a large measure of Protection at the first opportunity. Now they are told that the promise has not been redeemed on account of the war. </para>

Of course, it may be argued that my proposal will have the effect of opening up the whole Tariff. But I would remind honorable senators that in another place the Government themselves moved several amendments. So far from desiring to open up the entire Tariff, I have no other proposal to submit.

He has intimated to us that he has no other request to make. But if his proposal be carried, a number of other honorable senators may wish to take advantage of the opportunity to prefer requests for an alteration of existing duties. If once we open the Tariff to any amendment, I fear that we shall open the flood-gates of talk. Regarding the proposal itself, I need scarcely point" out that we have already intrusted the Government with the disposition of the whole of our wheat crop, and are we now going to haggle over a comparatively small matter such as the control of the duty on cornsacks?

I admit the force of the contention that if my request may be submitted, other honorable senators may propose to deal with other items of the Tariff. </para>

But I point out that merely to say that to permit the moving of my request would prolong the discussion on the measure, is not a good reason for refusing to allow the request to be submitted. I repeat that the right of the Senate to make requests in connexion with a Bill such as this is undoubted. </para>

                        <para>-  I direct: attention  to  the fact that the Bill provides for ne, validation of the collection of Customs duties, and has nothing whatever to do with the rates of duties or the levying of duties. The object is merely to validate 'the acts of Customs officials in collecting money without parliamentary authority. The request is no more relevant to this Bill than it would be to a Bill introduced to validate the collection of railway fares on the South Australian railways. The purpose of the Bill is to give legislative sanction to the act of collecting money which has already taken place-. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> may submit a request with respect to one item of  the  Tariff other honorable senators may propose to deal in- a similar way with every item in the Tariff, and the request,, therefore, becomes- an effort on the part of. the honorable senator to create  a  Tariff. If this were a Tariff Bill it has been settled that the- Senate has a right  to  submit requests covering as many items as honorable senators please, but I again repeat that this is merely a measure for validating the collection, of money. </para>

                        <para>- In answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> let me say that the purpose of the Bill is to validate the collection of Customs duties on imported goods up to to-day. My request deals with item 129, and the revenue collected under that item is important. It runs into about £140,000 a year. The collection of the duty under the item for the last t|w0' years would be legalized by this measure, but the intention of my request is to provide that from and after this date no further money shall be collected on goods imported of the description covered by item 129. </para>

The point raised is a very important one, involving, as it does, the right of the Committee and the right of the Senate to make requests. I do not think that the point is one upon which I should be asked to give a hurried ruling. I should be given sufficient time to look up authorities and precedents, and in order to enable me to do so I shall . suspend the sitting of the Senate until 50 minutes past 4 o'clock, at which hour I shall resume the chair. </para>

It reads as follows :  - </para>

                <para class="block">From inquiries I have caused to be made I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCarthy,</inline> in whose name the telegram was sent, is the secretary of the Linesmen's Union, in Sydney. It appears probable 'that he has unwittingly committed a breach of the privileges of the Senate, because, perhaps, of the fact that the men of his union may be smarting under what they consider to be an injustice in 'having to suffer a little delay in the payment of their salaries. My duty has been to report this matter to the Senate, and it will now be for the Senate to take what action may 'be considered proper in the circumstances. There is no doubt whatever that the telegram is a breach of privilege, because it conveys an insulting message to the Senate. In fact, it conveys a threat that a certain event will happen if the Senate does not do something which the writer demands shall be done. Parliament must be left entirely free, from any outside influence in the conduct of its deliberations, and certainly in this case an improper influence is sought to be exercised by the sending of this telegram. No improper influence must be used or threat made at any time to members of Parliament, either . collectively or individually. As I have said , it is probable that this action has been taken unwittingly by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCarthy,</inline> and because the men of his union are smarting under a sense of grievance at having their pay slightly delayed. Consequently, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCarthy,</inline> no doubt, acted in ignorance of the gross breach of privilege which he has committed by sending the telegram. I now leave the matter in -the hands of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>- I have to inform the Senate that I have considered the point of order raised in Committee, and reported to me by the  Chairman  of Committees. The point of order was that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was not in order in moving a request in connexion with the Customs Tariff Bill. I have looked up all the available authorities on the matter, and I have not been able to find one to guide me, so far as our procedure is concerned. The procedure in the Senate with regard to making requests in money or taxation Bills received from another place is unique in the history of constitutional government, and so far as I am aware is without precedent in any other Parliament. We are compelled, therefore, to build up our own practice and to create our own precedents. There are only two questions which govern the matter. One is the question of relevancy, and the other is whether a validating Bill is capable of being amended with regard to any of the details proposed to be validated. There is no doubt that the amendment requested is relevant to the Bill. With regard to the other point, I hold the opinion very strongly that exceptions may be made in any validating Bill. That being so, in my opinion, it is quite within the competence of Parliament, in considering a validating Bill, to make exceptions to what it was proposed to validate; in other words, that Parliament should not be compelled to validate <inline font-style="italic">in globo,</inline> but that it should have the right to limit the matters proposed to be validated. This view is borne out by clause 4 of the Bill, because the Government themselves in that clause propose to make several amendments. Therefore, if the Government have the right to do that, a private member ought also to have that right. In addition, I hold that any action which limits the rights of the Senate in a matter of this kind is not a desirable precedent to have built up in this new practice. Taking all aspects of the subject into consideration, I hold that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has a right to move the request mentioned, and, further, I point out to the Senate that as this is a validating Bill it could only be taken <inline font-style="italic">in globo</inline> by the general consent of members, and that it is not any part of my duty to compel members to give that consent. I rule, therefore, that the point of order cannot be sustained, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has a perfect right to move his request. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government, long before this request was put forward, considered all aspects of the question of providing the farmers with cheap bags, and their plan - to remit the duty to the farmers - is the best. There are nearly 4,000 items in the Tariff, and if this one is opened up every member of the Senate will have a perfect right to move requests in any direction. This is therefore likely to create a big debate, when time is most pressing. For instance, a Victorian senator might move for various increases of duty which many of us as individuals would be inclined to support. If that were done there would be no hope of getting the Bill through before the elections. I urge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> although we do not differ so greatly in spirit with him, to regard this merely as a question of finding the best business method of doing what he wants, and therefore to refrain from pressing the request. If he does, it will prevent others from exercising the same freedom, and avoid a general debate on the whole schedule. If it is pressed, I would urge the Committee not to pass it because we believe our method is the best for all concerned. </para>

                        <para>- I have been doing that ever since I came into the Senate, but have not received much reward for it. I am anxious that no contentious matter should be introduced on this Bill, and am just as desirous as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> to get the business of the Senate finished. No doubt the Government have generous intentions towards the farmers, but the way to the 5th May is paved with good intentions. What will happen if on that day the Government are not returned to power ? No promise given by the Government can definitely extend beyond the date of the general election. The simple carrying of the request will give the farmers their bags cheaper, saving them from the payment of a great part of a duty amounting to £139,000 or £140,000 per annum, while at the same time those engaged in industries of which these things form the raw material, will be able to extend their businesses, because the present duty on the raw material is rather a handicap than a help to them. If the majority want to turn the request down, let them do so in a proper way, but it must not be turned down as a mere expedient. I approach this question free from all party feeling or opposition to the Government. To turn the request down, for fear of opening up a general discussion would be more likely to lead to a long debate than otherwise, because some one might t'ak'e a fiendish pleasure, in a purely party spirit, in making certain senators vote to turn down requests of which they are really in favour. I urge the Committee to pass the request on the voices, so that " everything in the home may be happy." </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is quite correct in saying that the withdrawal of the request would still leave the door open to the presentation of innumerable others. The point is that until 5th May next the carrying of the request will not alter the position in the slightest. Whether the duty is collected or not, the farmer will not pay it, because the Government have undertaken that' it shall be a charge on the public Treasury. That promise was made by the Prime Minister in another place yesterday. The Government' took that course because they recognised that if they began to alter items in the schedule they could not reasonably object if members in another place wanted to rip up the whole Tariff. </para>

It makes no difference to the farmer whether the request goes into the' Bill or not, but if it goes in it makes a great difference bo us all by causing delay between the two Chambers: Is it worth, while to consume time passing the Bill backwards and forwards to secure, after- all, no different result ? </para>

                    <para>. - When the point of order was raised., I said to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that it was rather late to propo.se a remission of duty on bags now, when the farmers had suffered for the last two years under the duty imposed by the Ministry to which he belonged. It is never too late to do the right thing, and I should vote for his request if it were not for the assurance of the Government that they are going to achieve the same object in another way. It is not desirable to open up the whole Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but as soon as it was discovered to be- an anomaly we intended to- take it off . The honorable member for Yarra, who was Minister for Customs in that Government, has already stated, in another place that that was his intention. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> is willing to take the vague assurance of the present Government, because ' they have not told me, although I asked a question before lunch, exactly what they intend to do. Let me- put the matter to the honorable senator as a commercial man. He is prepared to take the promissory note of the- Government rather than the hard cash of this Parliament. I venture to say that in Australia there is no farmer who is prepared to do that. What the request offers to the farmers now is that, no matter what may happen at the general election, from the 15th March no duty will be collected on their bags. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> is going to accept from the Government is a, promissory note for some unknown arrangement. Now, if the arrangement is to be made, with the Wheat Board, it must be remembered that the only money which it can handle is; the farmers' money. </para>

What I fear is that- the- farmers will- get their bags, the duty will be paid and the Wheat Board- will reimburse- the- money, which will amount to £140,000;. and will be taken from the profits of the farmers-' wheat which the Government have sold. We are really up against a serious proposition. There is one course for the Senate to pursue, and that is either to- relieve the farmers from this burdensome duty or- to- take, as- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> is prepared to take, the vague- promise of the Government that the farmers will be relieved in another- way. Neither in the other' House, nor- here by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Millen,</inline> has the other way been attempted' to- be made clear. </para>

I do not wish to make political capital out of this matter. There is no injury -done to the Government by saying . that no duty shall be paid on bags. It is, of course, understood that the Go-, vernment do not propose to give back the money which has been collected on the importation of bags during the last two years. If this Bill is passed, the money collected on 'this item at the Customs Mouse is to be given back by a . secret method. Government by secrecy we are getting accustomed to in the Senate. To Senators Shannon, Newland, Buzacott, Millen, and Gould, who each represent a wheat-growing State, I point out that I am not pressing this request to gain a party advantage. I am quite willing that it should be dealt with on the voices, so that there shall be no division,, and then the other House will accept the request, in view of the urgency in this matter, for I am sure that it does not want to precipitate a fight on this issue. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to say that the farmers in Tasmania are as clear-bnained and as hard-headed as are the farmers in New South Wales. Even under the Wheat Pool their 'great complaint has 'been, not that the 'Government have not made promises, 'but that they have not parted with hard cash. If there is one cause of complaint more rampant than another in the farming districts of this country, it is with regard to the red-tape which surrounds the operations of the Wheat Board. I,as a Minister., am responsible- for . the proceedings of the Wheat Board while I was -in office, . but if I am to take any share of responsibility for all the ills which accrue from the Board, I must claim credit for the fact that it is the best thing which has lever been done for the farming interests. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, because of the slowness with which the money was found. During the last six months the farmers have been agitating to have, a representative on the Wheat Board ; in fact, they have been quite angry over this matter. I do not pretend that there are no. real difficulties in the way of acceding to their wish. But will there not be some real difficulties when the time comes to hand back the money paid on the importation -of cornsacks ? Take the case of a man who in October next buys 1,000 bags.,  and pays the duty of 10 per cent. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> think that that man will like to wait until the Government say, " Having collected a duty of 10 per cent.' from you, -we are going to pay it back to you " ? </para>

                        <para>- Have the claws of the socialistic tiger grown so long that it controls the combination Government ? I suppose that the Minister has counted heads, and knows that he has the numbers. One of the taunts to which I have had to submit for the last three weeks has been that the party machine makes me vote as it desires. My request will give the farmers an opportunity of seeing how the machine on the other side makes honorable senators vote. I appeal to honorable senators who seem to be willing to follow Ministers in a division on a proposal like this when the very interests of the hardest working classes in Australia are at stake. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to say that the Wheat Pool is an indication that the Government of which I was a member realized that fact more than two years ago, and I can claim some of the credit for what was done. We strained the credit of the country to help the farmers, and I venture to think that the farmers, recognising that fact, will show some gratitude to our party. Honorable senators on the other side apparently prefer to accept the promise of the Government in preference to the cash down offered by this request. </para>

If I thought that this request would prevent the Government from carrying out the splendid scheme of checking the .speculators, I would not press it as I am doing. I hope that nothing we can do will prevent the Government from protecting the farmers. I am even prepared to go so far as to apologize to the Minister for Defence for detaining him so long, in view of the arduous nature of this sitting. </para>

The honorable senator charges me with being vague, but I say that the policy of the Government is 'quite clear. That policy is that the duty will not be chargeable to the farmers who use the bags. The honorable senator has also suggested that the importer will collect the refund after the farmer has paid the duty. May I point out to him that that is not possible, because the Government will control the prices of these bags. </para>

                        <para>- The goods made elsewhere will continue to come here, and probably German goods will be amongst them. Under the operation of this measure, we shall - continue to obtain our revenue as at present. In my judgment, it would be much more sensible to raise revenue . by the means outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to-day than by means of this Bill. It will not have the effect of excluding foreign goods. It was designed by an alleged protectionist Government, but its only effect ' will be to increase the cost of commodities without providing any additional employment for the toilers. In short, it will confer no benefit upon anybody, save the landowner, who will be permitted to escape his due share of taxation. </para>

I have learned that a remark which I made during the course of my speech in the early hours of this morning has given pain to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKissock.</inline> Although I have not yet seen the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof of what I then said, I am convinced the honorable senator is quite in error in thinking that I suggested that he was a criminal. So far as my memory serves me, I said in reply to an interjection - and I merely used the term as a figure of speech - that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKissock</inline> was not the criminal he was an accessory after the fact. I merely wish to make the position quite clear to the honorable senator, for whom I entertain a high personal regard, and to assure him that I had not the slightest intention of suggesting, either that he was a criminal or had criminal instincts. I exceedingly regret that he should have thought that I did. </para>

I am seriously referring to a matter affecting my . own conduct when in Western Australia, as the only senator representing, that State who fought the anti-conscription campaign.

I was assured that the Acting Mayor of Albany was agreeable that the Town Hall should be at my disposal free of any charge for rent. I . accepted that assurance, but I was later informed by the Acting Mayor that I could not have the use of the Town Hall,  which he had guaranteed me free of expense, because a. transport had arrived in port wilh 1,000 or more New Zealand soldiers, and he thought that, if I addressed a meeting against conscription., the Town Hall would be broken up. He demanded that I should pay £25 before. I spoke- there. I told the Acting Mayor of Albany that I would not guarantee £25 for the hall. At five minutes to 8 o'clock I was due to speak there. I did not beat a strategical retreat at all, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has sneeringly suggested, but I went across to the town hall, and, standing on the steps, I said to New Zealand soldiers who- were' there - " I am here to address the meeting, but because you men have threatened to wreck the hall, and because I am not prepared to guarantee £25 for the use of it, I am refused admittance." I then invited them to the Rotunda., where I attempted to address them, but I did not succeed, because the New Zealand -conscript soldiers attempted to assault me. They pushed me from the box on which I was standing, but I defied them to go any further. I tried for 25 minutes to speak, but was prevented, not by the citizens, of Albany, but because of the conduct of the conscript soldiers from New Zealand who were let loose that evening. I might mention, also, that this was the first time for fifteen months that any transport was allowed to land troops at Albany. The next morning I- went down, to Denmark and addressed, a hostile meeting. I left Albany at- 7.30 a.m., arrived at Denmark at 10.15, addressed the meeting, and reached Albany again in the afternoon. Included in my audience at Albany was the  Hon.  John Scaddan, who was due to address a meeting himself in that town on 27th October. An offer was made to him that Tie and I" should address the same meeting from the same platform, and I was prepared to speak either first or last. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scaddan</inline> declined the offer. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- Well, the honorable senator has never missed any chances in his life-time, and has- never lost any opportunity to. assail me. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> arrived- in Western Aus?tralia, his speeches, as well as- those of Senators Lynch, Henderson, and. Buzacott, were.- freely reported,, whilst only one of my speeches, was reported throughout the- whole- campaign. All the papers in Australia, however, reported the fact that I was attacked by the New Zealand soldiers on Friday night, 27th October. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scaddan</inline> elected to address his audience in the Albany town hall, whilst I addressed mine from the Rotunda. On the following morning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scaddan</inline> got a column report of his speech in. the Albany press-, whilst I, because I was advocating anti-conscription, did not get a solitary word. I would not have transgressed upon the time of the Senate after the long sitting, but I have come to the conclusion that, in order to protect myself from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> sneering remarks, I should place the facts before the Senate. I challenge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to mention any meeting that I ran away from. I challenge them also to say that I beat a strategic retreat from Albany. I could not get the Town' Hall in Perth, because there was a picture show on that night. I arranged for the Victoria Hall, Fremantle, intending, to make that my opening meeting; but I was denied it by the reverend gentleman who controlled the- hall. Hie demanded £5 rental, and a £25 guarantee1 against damage of furniture. I got the Trades Hall in Fremantle for nothing, and addressed a- gathering there that could not be got within its four walls. The- reverend gentleman referred to- said I. could not have- the- hall because- I was- an- a.nticon.scriptionist. He admitted that he had. a conscriptionist meeting in it a week, before,, and charged nothing for. it because the speakers advocated conscription.. I beat no retreat from the Albany meeting; strategic or otherwise. </para>

I do not regard that as any reflection on him, because during the campaign I made several. On one occasion I came dangerously near to being routed. The honorable senator must not take my laughing just now as any reflection on himself.I laughed because I saw a ludicrous resemblance between the subject the honorable senator was discussing and the following cablegram from Amsterdam, dealing with the German retreat, which I was reading in the evening paper: - </para>

All that I have to say in respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham's</inline> speech on this motion, is that when he reached the Western State he was heralded as the leader of the anti-conscription, movement. In due course, as he has already stated, effective arrangements were made for the leader of that movement to address meetings in the State. A hall was about to be engaged at Fremantle </para>

                        <para>- The serious part of the business is that when it was announced that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> as leader of the anti-conscription movement in Western Australia, was about to arrive and to set the Swan River on fire, there was a very great shortage of furniture in the State. Those who had limited stocks started, according to the report, to corner it, and those who had charge of the available halls where the leader of that movement was about to speak, saw the prospect staring them in the face that they might not be able to re-stock their furniture if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> were to speak there. Being isolated, as we were, with a prospect of sitting on jam or milk boxes, we did not wish to have our public halls used by. the leader of the anti-conscriptionist movement, unless he entered into a guarantee as business arrangement that no furniture would be broken. </para>

                    <para>. -  There is one matter which I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister for Defence, and it is in regard to the proposal I placed before the Pensions Commissioner some time ago in connexion with the death of a soldier at Enoggera Camp. He duly enlisted as a  volunteer. On one night he was absent from camp without leave, and while away he met with an accident which resulted in his death. He left a widow and some children to whom pension rights have been denied on the ground that the soldier was absent without leave. It appears to be pretty hard, if a technical offence was committed by the man, that punishment should be visited on his widow and children. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will agree with me that in the early stages of enlistments in Queensland and other States absences from camp were pretty frequent. I do not think it was a very heinous offence for a man to have committed. Certainly the punishment meted out for it was not very- drastic, because I understand that this offence was pretty common throughout the military camps of Australia. I have not had an opportunity of inspecting the camps adjacent to the various State capitals, but I have inspected the Enoggera camp, and, as one who is not a jingo, I must say that I have no fault to find with it. But I have been informed by colleagues on both sides of this chamber that the Enoggera camp is the star camp of the Commonwealth. Now, a soldier absenting himself without leave is guilty of a military offence. But, seeing that this particular young man, while he was thus absent from camp, met with a railway accident which terminated fatally, I do not think that the penalty of his misdeed should be visited upon his widow and children. Some time ago I wrote to the  Deputy  Commissioner of Pensions in Brisbane, setting out the facts of this case, and stating that the widow and children were in pretty straitened circumstances. After the lapse of some time I received a reply, not from the  Deputy  Commissioner of Pensions, Brisbane, but from the head office in Melbourne. Before that reply reached "me I had placed the whole of the facts before the Minister for Defence, and had informed him that I had been approached by the Honorable John Huxham, of Queensland, who occupies the position of Home Secretary - a man who would not have intervened had the merits of the case not warranted it. I gave the Defence Department full particulars- </para>

                            <para>- I intended to say a word in reply to the challenge that has been thrown down to me in this chamber by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to contest a seat for the Senate in Western Australia if he would contest a seat in Queensland. I saw the honorable senator during the dinner adjournment, and told him that I desired his presence in the chamber after dinner, as I intended to refer to what he had said. He told me 'that he regretted that he would be unable to . attend, as it was necessary for him to fulfil a prior engagement elsewhere, I think in connexion with a recruiting meeting. Seeing that in the early hours of the morning, when he desired to say something about me, the honorable senator was good enough to send the Whip of this party, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> to find me, it is my intention to play the game, and to reserve my remarks in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> for some other occasion when he will be able to be present in this chamber. We have been sitting continuously for thirty hours, and I have had enough; but I wish . to say that I was wholeheartedly in favour of the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> for the remission of duties on cornsacks. My idea was that that would lead to the re-opening of the Tariff for discussion, and honorable senators representing Queensland, including. I believe, the  President,  were in receipt of representations with respect to the dire necessity for increased protection in the interests of the timber industry. </para>

                            <para>- The lines along which the honorable senator may direct his inquiry are whether dodgers and publications of the Labour party in New South Wales are being unduly hampered by the censorship, and whether the censorship generally is used to the disadvantage of Labour men engaged in the contest referred . to. My information is supplied by an urgent telegram, which, naturally, does not go very fully into the matter, but I have such confidence in the source from which the information is derived that I feel justified in insisting upon some inquiry by the Government. The censorship of political matter is an injustice which cannot be .tolerated in this country. When this sitting commenced, very many hours ago, I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> whether it was the intention of the Government to appoint a Royal Commission, and preferably a High Court Judge, to inquire into the charges made. here by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> against the Prime Minister, and also into the suspicious circumstances surrounding the disappearance of ex-Senator Ready from this side, and the appearance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> on the other side. </para>

                            <para>- Although the honorable senator does not appear to be conscious of it, it does appear to me that the very fact that he comes up as ex-Senator Ready goes down, and the extraordinary manner in which he made his  appearance in this chamber, suggests that he should be interested in securing some inquiry into the matter. In view of the ruling by which a motion I intended to propose for referring the matter to the Elections and Qualifications Committee has disappeared from the paper, the necessity for a Royal Commission to inquire into the whole affair should, I think, appeal to the honorable senator. </para>

                            <para>- Well, I have my suspicions. Comparing British newspapers with Australian newspapers one is at once brought face to face with the fact that the discussion of great Imperial questions is being carried on very much more freely and openly in Great Britain than here. I have read statements in Scotch newspapers which would not be permitted to appear in the Australian press. If there were any difference between Great Britain and Australia in this respect one would expect that the advantage, so far as freedom of discussion is concerned, would be with Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Then they must be very differently applied. The men who direct the censorship in Great Britain must possess some share of what may be termed the Imperial mind, whilst the men who direct it here have the local mind, and keep their particular advantage, and the advantage of their party, always to the front, whilst the welfare of the community is 'left to sink into the background. The great bulwarks of British freedom have always been free speech and a free press. To achieve these two great things the people of Great Britain subjected themselves to a great many indignities. After decades of struggle they at last succeeded in securing what should exist in every Democracy, and that is absolute freedom of discussion so far as matters pertaining to the government of the country are concerned. I do not for a moment suggest that matters, the publication of which might play into the hands of the enemy, should not be subjected to censorship but what is there about a local political campaign such as that now going on in New South Wales that demands the interference of the censor ? </para>

                            <para>- I gather from various newspapers - their  utterances  on the question are guarded - that they have been prohibited by the Government from discussing subjects of public importance, but which have no direct reference to the war whatever. The conviction is borne in on my mind that we are suffering from what I might , call an abominable tyranny. Why did we establish a Democracy in Australia ? Was it to stifle free speech and muzzle the press? Is that the kind of thing the people of Australia desired ? </para>

                            <para>- Some of the Melbourne newspapers I know have complained. Why all this secrecy and this attempt to stifle the expression of public opinion <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It ought to be an axiom in the government of a country like Australia "that every man and every newspaper which cares to express an opinion of any subject of public importance should have the fullest opportunity of doing so. We have heard a great deal about playing into the hands of the enemy. It strikes me that the enemy knows a great deal more about what is going on in Australia and on the water between Australia and Britain as well as at the front than we do. Why should not the people of Australia be permitted to discuss their own affairs in their own way ! I gather that the Prime Minister seems to be playing the part of a petty despot in this matter. </para>

                            <para>- I was associated with the Prime Minister for a very much longer period than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and., like other men of superior talent, I always found the Prime Minister to be very fond of getting his own way. I found also that occasionally he was not too scrupulous about achieving his ends, and I have not the slightest doubt he is just the same kind of man to-day as he was then. The Prime Minister, a man with great intellectual qualities, has all the elements of a despot in his composition, and it is to this that I attribute this unwarranted and unforgivable attempt to muzzle the Australian press. I hope that honorable senators who sit behind the Ministry will bring ' pressure to bear upon the head of the Government to do away with this miserable pretence of carrying on the business of a country under what may be termed a despotic <inline font-style="italic">regime.</inline> Speech must be free, and the press must be free, otherwise our guarantees for anything like good government and freedom will disappear. I trust that our friends on the Government benches will inquire into this matter, and without asking <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> to disclose the sources of their information, will find out for themselves whether this iniquitous thing is going on, and, if so, that they will put an end to it. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to bring before the Senate a matter to which I directed the attention of the Minister for Defence a little while ago in relation to the rights of Australians resident in New Zealand under the operation of the Compulsory Military Service Act of that country. When I approached the Minister for Defence some time ago I informed him that Australians in New Zealand - people who ' had no desire or were not in a position to go to the front - came under the- new ukase of the Dominion Government. I. have received letters  from several Australians, resident in the Dominion for the time being, claiming the protection of the Australian flag, and- asking to be allowed to return from New Zealand rather than be driven compulsorily to service abroad. The Minister courteously said that he would make inquiries, and he was as good as his word. He tried his best to interest the Dominion Government, and to endeavour to free Australians in New Zealand from the operation of the conscription law of that country. British-born people- - I am excluding Ireland - who are resident in the Commonwealth of Australia have not been called upon for service under the conscription edict of the Mother Country, and that being so, surely we in Australia should have some control in regard to Australians resident in New Zealand for the time being, and who have no desire to be sent to the front against their own free will. </para>

                        <para>I beg to state that I have a brother in New Zealand who went there for six months about two years ago, but has been locked up within the confines of the island ever since. He has made application to the authorities over there for .permission to come back home to Victoria, but they have flatly refused him a passport. Some three months ago his mother was seriously ill, and the doctor attending her had little hope of her recovery at the time. He was written for then, and the case placed before the authorities over there, but still they refused his application.. Mother is over seventy years of age, and my single sister, who lives home with her, is almost a cripple. There is about 100 acres of land overflowing with feed, and only about four head of cattle are running on it, owing to the fact that mother is too infirm, and my sister not being able to look after them. 1 think this is a case where ah Australian's rights have been interfered with to the detriment of his family and the State. I will now ' ask you _ if anything can be done in the matter. My brother does riot wish to get out of New Zealand to  dodge conscription, as he would have volunteered when the war broke out, only mother strongly objected to the farm going to rack and ruin.  My  mother now has eleven grandchildren lighting for their King and country. </para>

                    <para class="block">This case may be typical of those of many' Australians resident in New Zealand who should not be drag-netted under the Act. We knew in theory what compulsion would mean. We know from actual New Zealand experience what it does mean. Not only single, but married men, are being compulsorily called up, with a view of sending them to the front. Already clergyman of all denominations and others have been notified that they must go into camp by a certain date. Even a bishop has been lassoed and dragged along. By next November married men of forty-seven years and under will be in the camps. Many married Australians who went to New Zealand to follow their usual avocations, and were there  when this iniquitous thing called conscription was fastened on that country, have been roped in, instead of being allowed to remain or come back to their homes and friends in Australia. They have been torn from their families and thrown compulsorily into the firing line, whether they liked it or not, and irrespective of whether their wives and families can be maintained in decency and comfort during their absence. When such a thing can happen close to our shores in a country that probably at one time formed part of our mainland, and which should now be joined with us in one  big political Dominion&gt; the Government of- Australia should take action, because Australians showed, by their vote on 28th October, that the system was repulsive to them. Our Government should represent to the Dominion Government that Australian citizens must not be enslaved against their will. </para>

                            <para>- I claim the protection of the Australian Government for every Australian citizen at present resident in the Dominion. No Australian Government worthy of the name should allow them to be lassoed and dragged to the front like bullocks to the pens. Then should be allowed to claim the protection of the Australian flag, of which ' the Government of the Commonwealth are for  the time being the custodians. We look to the Government to protect those who cannot protect themselves. This letter speaks eloquently of wrongs done to Australians in New Zealand, and when one is out on a recruiting campaign, in the laudable endeavour to get more men voluntarily to help in the fighting line in this titanic struggle, it is discouraging to find obstacles placed in the way through the obstinacy and stupidity of our Government, which refuses to look after the interests of its children abroad, as a paternal Government should do, and stupidly says, "Let things go; let them go. We are trying to do the same thing to Australians in Australia." What has happened to Australians in New Zealand should be an object lesson to the people here, apart altogether from that furnished by the action of the Dominion Government in imposing conscription upon its own citizens, without giving them a chance to say whether they would have it or not. Nothing could be a greater deterrent to successful recruiting than this sort of case. An aged mother and crippled daughter hold a farm, with a boy in New Zealand prevented from coming to his mother's help - a mother already represented by a number of grandchildren at the front. I hope the Government will take timely warning from what has happened in the sister Dominion under a Government gone conscription mad, and that the Australian people, by repeating the timely check given to the last Government on the 28th October, will prevent any future Government attempting to fasten conscription on this country in time to come. </para>

                            <para>- Every censor must necessarily interfere with a publication somewhere. If the honorable senator knows of any instance where a censor has exercised his powers wrongly, I ask him now to bring us evidence of it. If he wishes any matter to be regarded as confidential, the Minister for Defence will so treat it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> went so far as to say  that he' " feels something is wrong." If I told a policeman in Bourke-street that I had a -sort of feeling that murder was being committed in the neighbourhood, and implored him to do something, he would probably run me in. That -is exactly the position my honorable friends are placing me in, except that I have no power to run them in. If honorable senators genuinely believe that real grievances exist, let them help us to remove the trouble, 'instead of by making vague statements, creating an impression that something is wrong of which we know as well as they, and which we are unwilling to remedy. </para>

                            <para>- I have had many complaints from newspapers, and some of them indicated that occasionally a censor had not exercised his powers as I individually would have done. That is bound to happen where there are a number of censors. But honorable senators seem to think there is some general system or series of regulations under which the censorship is approaching the condition of being unfair, and even tyrannical. </para>

                            <para>- I do not pretend that the censorship is without mistakes. As the censors are only human, an occasional mistake is bound to occur, as they themselves would be the first to admit. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> suggests to me by interjection, I myself have produced censored articles in this chamber, and on one occasion at least the Minister told me frankly that he did not approve of what the censor had done. When he disowned it, I was quite satisfied that it was not a mistake which I could charge against the Administration. </para>

Why not ask them to furnish them with the censored proof", with the portions the censor desired to have struck out marked in blue pencil ? </para>

                            <para>- If the Prime Minister had a Cabinet meeting by himself, obviously, I could not be aware of it. I do not want my honorable friends to assume, sir, that because you ruled a certain motion out of order yesterday, they are debarred from proceeding in connexion with that matter. If they still think that the question as to whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> is rightly here or not should be inquired into, it is competent for them to proceed by the regular way which you pointed out, and that is to present a petition to the Senate praying to have the matter inquired into. So that your decision does not in any way bar the door to them if they still wish an inquiry to be held. I come. next to the matter which was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKissock</inline> with so much vigour and force, and, may I say, eloquence. When he was speaking with all that vehemence, I was wondering what sort of a speech we should get from him if an Englishman came out- here, and, after having lived here for two years, objected to obey some law we had passed  on the ground that he was an Englishman - if he came here and said, " I came out here. I am a British subject. I claim all the rights and privileges of your citizenship. I enrolled myself as a voter and helped to elect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKissock,"</inline> and we then passed a law which required him to do something, and he turned round and said, " This is coming it too strongly. I am a Britisher." That is the position of my honorable friend's New Zealander. Can any one imagine the eloquence ' and the thunder which would proceed from him if such a proposition were put to him ? </para>

                            <para>- We know that that is what happens in regard to New Zealand. A very considerable number of our people are in the habit of going over to that country, not with any intention of becoming residents, but in connexion with shearing and other occupations. They are very keen and active politicians, and the first thing they do at the earliest possible moment is to get enrolled. I am glad to see my honorable friends opposite laughing, because they know that what I am saying is the truth. These Australians take a very keen- interest in  Politics.  They have sat at the feet of my honorable friends on the other side, and imbibed a keen political appetite. They  bo  over to New Zealand, and at the earliest possible moment they manage to 9et enrolled, and they suddenly find that they have become citizens of the country. But when the obligations of citizenship are raised, they say, "We are Australians- We are only visitors here." I want to tell these persons through my honorable friends - and they know it, too - that they cannot have it both ways. </para>

                            <para>- These are the facts; it is an honest interpretation of the case. I have had no opportunity of conferring with the Prime Minister or my colleague; but I do know what is the usual practice, and one might almost say the international law. If any Australian has gone to New Zealand, and is being intercepted in the course of what is, obviously, a visit, there is no difficulty in getting him away from the country. No country to-day will attempt to treat as one of its citizens a mere passer-through. Even when a man went into Germany he was not compelled to obey its laws of conscription. The Government never attempted to apply the laws to a visitor; but when a visitor became a citizen of the country, then whatever . obligation the conscription laws imposed upon' other citizens, he had to share them. I suggest to my honorable friends opposite that they should make themselves a little better acquainted with the details of the case. One gentleman, it appears, has been in' New Zealand two years. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKissock</inline> almost brought tears to my eyes when I heard him plead that the man had an aged mother, and ought to be allowed to return to her. This lady, he said, is between seventy and eighty years of age. We had the pathetic picture of an elderly lady longing for her son. But I remind the honorable senator that the man was young when he went away, and that he has been away two years. </para>
