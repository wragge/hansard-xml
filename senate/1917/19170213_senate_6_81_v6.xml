If they have come, will the honorable gentleman inform the Senate as to their nature, character, and form, and as to the authorities from which they have come ? Will he also let us know what action the . Australian Wheat Board is taking to enable wheat supplies to be maintained in Tasmania for milling purposes ? </para>

                            <para>- What does the Minister mean by&#34; interested parties &#34; ? Last week he referred to &#34; interested States,&#34; and explained that he meant the wheat-producing States. The Premier of Tasmania has communicated with me repeatedly since we met last week, urging that instant action be taken in order that a wheat crisis - a bread and butter crisis, a breakfast table crisis - may be avoided in Tasmania. Is the Government doing anything to obviate the possibility of this ? </para>

                    <para>Soldiers are discharged from the A.I.F. when, in the opinion of the medical officers . concerned, such action is deemed necessary. In the case of men entitled to pensions, military pay. ceases on the day prior to that on which pension commences. With the object of providing employment for returned soldiers, an employment bureau, under the auspices of the State War Council, has been established in the capital city of each State. Partially incapacitated soldiers, and those who have been discharged as medically fit to earn their own livelihood, who are desirous of obtaining employment, are instructed to apply to the officer in charge of the Employment Bureau. Recent reports indicate that the returned soldiers are, with advantage, adopting this means of securing employment. </para>

                        <para>. - There are one or two matters with which I should like to deal on the motion now before the Senate. I have to direct attention first to the most peculiar procedure which has been adopted by the Government. After an adjournment of some weeks, the Government meet Parliament, make no statement, and merely move the first reading of a Supply Bill, without giving any information to the Senate with respect to what has transpired during the adjournment. It has hitherto been the practice, not only in this, but so far as I know, in all other Parliaments, for the Government to give some information concerning events which may have transpired during an adjournment. Ministers may say that it is for them to decide- how the business shall be carried on, and that they will conduct it in any way they think proper. I can only say that, if that is the course which we may expect Ministers to follow in the future, it will not tend to shorten debate or to avoid unnecessary questions.- To-day I asked a question with respect to a matter which I had previously brought under the notice of the Senate on several occasions. &#39; I asked what action the Government are prepared to take upon the report of Judge Eagleson as a Royal Commission appointed &#39;to inquire into charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> L. Gilchrist with respect to the conduct of work on the Kalgoorlie to Port &#39;Augusta Railway. I had to ask quite a number of questions on the subject before . I could secure any information at all. Why the Government should  desire to smother up such a matter I am at a loss to understand&#39;. It is a matter of very great importance, not only to members df the Senate, but to the public at large. The last day upon which the Senate sat in December, the Minister for Works informed me, in reply to one of many questions on the subject, that an opinion had been received from the Attorney-General, but that <inline font-style="italic">hp</inline> had not had time to lay it before the Government for consideration. It was added that the opinion would be laid before the Government on the next day. That was definite information. I thought, in the circumstances, that I should be able to-day to learn what the Government proposed to do in the matter, and when I asked a question on the subject of the Minister for Works, he apparently did not think it necessary to reply. &#39; </para>

                            <para>- 1 asked my question as plainly as I could, and mentioned the circumstances which led up to it. I stated that, on 19th. December, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> had informed me that an opinion on the matter had been furnished by the Attorney-General ; that the Cabinet had not had time to consider it; and that it was to be considered on the next day. As so much time has since elapsed, I considered that the Cabinet would have had an opportunity of considering the matter, and I asked to-day whether the Government had arrived at a decision. I saw the Leader of the Government in the Senate speak to his colleagues when I asked my question, and then the Assistant Minister got up and asked me to kindly give notice of the question again. Information of this kind should be given as soon as it is asked for. Why should honorable senators be compelled to bring up matters of this kind time after time before they are given any information? I went into this matter some time ago, and do not intend to go into it again to-day. I shall, however, take another opportunity to put the facts into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the information of the public, and shall use them on the platform as well. I shall refer to the opinion expressed by Judge Eagleson in reporting the result of his inquiry as a Royal Commission, because I believe that public servants have a right to be protected against people who make charges which cannot be substantiated. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know whom the Government are trying to shield ; but when I was asking these questions in December, it was rumoured that I might be sure that nothing would be done, because it would lead to the washing of too much dirty linen. When I last referred to the matter, &#34;I mentioned that, in connexion with the railway service in Victoria, when a clerk embezzled <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> or &#163;6, he was immediately brought up, lost his employment, and was sentenced to a &#34;term of imprisonment. I contrasted that with the fact that, up to the present time, there is a man in .the employment of the Commonwealth who, apparently, may make charges at will against the integrity of public officers, and, though a Judge appointed as a Royal Commission to inquire into those charges reports that this man has been guilty of wilful and corrupt perjury, the Government do not appear to be able to decide what, if anything, should be done with the offender. Personally, I have only seen <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> once. He came up here the day before the Senate last adjourned*. He asked me whether I was interested in the matter. I said that I was, only to the extent disclosed by the questions I had asked. He said that he- had a position to go to in another State; but that he did not &#34;wish to leave Victoria so long as this charge hung over his head. He wanted to have a decision one way or the other. I shall again refer to the matter if some action in connexion with it is not taken in the meantime by the Government. No man should be allowed to speak at large and defame and destroy the character of public officers holding responsible positions, and then be allowed to go free when the charges he makes have not been substantiated. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly so. In that regard the honorable senator&#39;s experience is wider than my own, and no doubt he speaks with authority. There is another matter to which I desire to refer, and which I may say greatly surprised me when I heard of it. While in Brisbane recently I was waited upon by a returned soldier - a man who had been wounded while at the front, and had been sent back. The story that he told me was  bo  surprising that I was disinclined at first to believe there was anything in it. He said that he enlisted on 11th January, 1915, and that whilst he was in camp iri Australia his wife and children received the separation allowance, but that it was discontinued from the. day that he embarked for the front, the 18th February, 1915, until the 1st May following. I think that we all understood that the dependants of those who enlisted were to receive a separation allowance from the day that the men went into camp until they were finally discharged. I was surprised, therefore, to be told that the wife of this man had not received the allowance from the day on which he embarked until nearly three months later. On inquiry at the Defence office at Brisbane, however, I was told that the statement was quite correct; that at that time while a man was in camp his wife, living a mile away, perhaps, waa entitled to a separation allowance for herself and children, but that the allowance was discontinued . from the time that he embarked for the front. I had a chat with this man after ascertaining the correctness of his complaint, and was informed by him that it was not until his return to Australia that he learned of what had been done. He assured me that there were numbers of men at the front whose wives had been deprived of the separation allowance in this way without their knowledge. Surely the dependants of a man who goes to the front should be as much entitled to receive the separation allowance as are the wives and children of those who remain in camp in Australia. The position is so ridiculous as to be scarcely believable. Had&#39; I not taken the trouble to go to the pay office and verify this man&#39;s story, I should not have mentioned it !here.. The man said to me, &#34; It would have been all right if I had remained in Australia; my wife and children would have received the allowance; and I do hot think it was a kindly act on the part of the Federal Government to stop this allowance to my wife and children for about three months after the date of my* embarkation.&#34; Much argument should not be necessary to induce the Government to pay what is due to these people. Why should the dependants of those who remain in camp here receive the allowance while the wives and children of those who leave for the front are denied it? </para>

I am here to give the Senate the information supplied to me by this man, an <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> verified by reference to the Department. On inquiry at the Brisbane office, I was told it was the rule at that time to grant a separation allowance to the wives and children of men while in camp in Australia, but to stop it as soon as the men embarked for the front. It is because I obtained that information, not from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland,</inline> but from the Department in Brisbane, that I have brought it forward. I hold that this grievance should be remedied - Even if the sum involved is only &#163;4 or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> per man, those who have been done out of it by the Federal Government should have the amount made good without delay. What have we heard recently regarding the correspondence which men at the front have been able to receive? </para>

                            <para>- There is another matter upon which I desire to say a few words. We have been assured in the press, and on all hands from the Prime Minister downwards, that the present war loan has been such an unqualified success that it evidences the determination of our people that Australia shall prosecute the war to a victorious ending. May I say that the people of Australia have never determined anything else. But we have a perfect right to express our views in respect to this war loan, and I cannot understand the cause of all the jubilation in connexion with it. The announcement was made a couple of days ago that the loan had been fully subscribed. That is perfectly satisfactory from one stand-point. If we set out to obtain &#163;18,000,000 from the community to enable us to carry on the war, and if the full amount is forthcoming, all our requirements have been satisfied. Nevertheless I confess that I was somewhat disappointed with the &#39;response made by the public to our invitation to contribute to this war loan. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. I do not bring cases before Parliament without first investigating them myself. What is the position in regard to the present war loan ? &#39; We have raised just a little over &#163;18,000,000. The total number of subscribers to the loan was 44,397. Out of that number, seventeen banks subscribed &#163;4,440,500, four savings banks &#163;315,000, fifty-three insurance and other companies &#163;3,832,000, and sixty-one subscribers, who subscribed a minimum of &#163;10,000, invested &#163;892,000. &#39;  Thus we have 135 subscribers who contributed &#163;9,879,500, while the balance of a little more than &#163;8,250,000 was taken up by 44,262 subscribers. We must not forget, too, that applications were made to the Treasury that the names of some of the larger subscribers should not be published, and consequently we do not know them. Now I wish to compare the response made to this loan with the response which was made to the last loan, and I think it will be at once manifest that it has not been so successful as was the last loan. Applications for the last loan closed on the 1st August, 1916, and on Thursday, 3rd August, the Treasurer announced that 69,592 subscribers had contributed &#163;20,569,400. On 4th August the number of subscribers had increased to 73,782, and the amount of their subscriptions to &#163;21,559,080. On the 18th November a notice was published in the press to- the effect that there had been 101,858 subscribers to the loan, and that  their subscriptions1 aggregated &#163;23,574,120. As the result of ringing up the Treasury I have ascertained that the number of subscribers when the loan actually closed was 102,039, and that their total subscriptions1 represented &#163;23,586,570. I admit that we may reasonably expect a large increase in the number of subscribers to the present loan. But I wish to point out that on this occasion we have &#39;not had the response from small subscribers that we had on the last occasion. </para>

                            <para>- I know very well that there are quite a number of persons who cannot continue to be subscribers; but there are also a number of others who, if. they understood the position in Australia to-day, ought to be among the small subscribers to the war loans. That is one of the reasons I am dealing with this question. I believe in the democratization of finance and of credit. This has been carried out to some extent in Australia; and any one who  knows  the results of such a policy over a number of years on the continent of Europe and in Ireland must realize that there, by this means more than any other, production in agricultural and other directions has <inline font-style="italic">been</inline> promoted. I do not believe that any extra consideration should be given to small subscribers as contrasted with large subscribers. </para>

                            <para>- What  is the position here in Australia? Do we give any special consideration to small subscribers? I do not think we do; and I have always held that the man in Australia who lends his money&#39; to the Government should receive just as much consideration, and as. much interest, as does the lender abroad. The small subscriber should, as I say, receive just as much consideration as a large subscriber, and should not ask for more. In my opinion, if we could have had 1,000,000 subscribers at &#163;18 a head it would have spread a basis of the loan in such a way as to create far more interest in the matter than we have found displayed. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad the honorable senator agrees with me as to that. The Savings Banks, which are very good institutions, have &#34;always been prepared to pay a lower rate of interest to the small man than that at which the Government was able to obtain money from abroad. If the average man, with  his  &#163;5, his &#163;10 or his &#163;15 to invest, believed for one moment that his bonds would, after the war was over, be very nearly as negotiable as a &#163;5 note or the &#163;10 note, I believe thousands of people would subscribe to these war loans. At the present time, by means of the Savings Banks,, the various Governments in Australia have nearly &#163;100,000,000 at their disposal; and only when we can get the people to understand that these smaller- bonds of &#163;5, &#163;10, or &#163;15 will, after the war, be nearly as negotiable as &#163;5 notes*- </para>

                            <para>- I desire to see the war loans spread over a wider basis than at present. I do not wish to have another loan -in which 132 people take up considerably more than half. Can such a position be regarded as a democratization of finance ? &#34; Certainly it serves to save the face of the Government, and enable them to declare the loan a success. I am glad that so much money has been received by the Treasurer, but I should have preferred to see the contributions more widely distributed. The insurance companies are in much the same position as other financial institutions. Some which are mutual, and some which are not, have subscribed large sums of money to the loan. Are the non-mutual companies subscribing this money for the benefit of their clients or <inline font-style="italic">for</inline> the benefit of those who are practically the proprietors of the companies ? Their position is just the same as that of any other institution which has shareholders. If the company is formed on a mutual basis, the&#39; policy-holders receive a return from this investment in the shape of a bonus, but if the company is not mutual, the policy-holders have only a small amount returned to them, and the balance of the . earnings is distributed &#34;amongst the proprietors. I have no desire that we shall talk about the enormous success of this loan when, in my opinion, it is not nearly as successful as. it ought to be in a .country where the wealth distribution is wider than in any other country in the world. For that reason I believe that it would be better to endeavour to induce a greater number of people to invest in the war loan, and thus show their confidence in the country, and their preparedness to do what is within their power for &#39;the successful prosecution of the war. </para>

                    <para>Another matter with which I wish to deal is that of Inter-State Free Trade, concerning which we have heard a good deal of talk lately. The Prime Minister was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom</inline> in another place a few days ago whether the Government had come to any decision with regard to the matter of the Queensland Government placing an embargo upon the movement &#39; of stock from that State. The Prime Minister replied that .the Government had decided, on the recommendation of the Attorney-General, that the Inter-State movement of stock, being - intimately related to export, was a matter coming within the ambit of the Commonwealth&#34;, and it was proposed therefore to legislate, either directly or by regulation under the War Precautions Acts, in such a way as would prevent the State of Queensland from taking action having for its object the prohibition of the movement of stock from that State to another. This is a matter on which this Parliament, as well as the State Parliaments, will have some say. In the press of the 10th February the Premier of Queensland made these observations - &#34;As far as Queensland is concerned, the Government has no intention, and never had, of violating the Federal Constitution in any way.&#34; This was said by the Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> to-day, when his attention was directed to a Melbourne telegram announcing that the- Federal- Government had decided that, as import and export transactions were clearly within the ambit of the Commonwealth, it would take action by legislation, or a regulation under the War Precautions Act, to prevent State interference with the&#34; export and import of cattle, Inter-State br overseas. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> added, &#34;The High Court has already held that the Meat for Imperial Uses Act is valid, and the action of this Government is quite constitutional. I am sure I do not know what  action <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> contemplates, but I would &#34;naturally expect that he would communicate with me if he intended to attempt in any way to interfere in Queensland affairs. - It is difficult to pass an opinion on the scope that the Prime Minister would give to the War Precautions Act. I think he regards it as a panacea for all evils. The only thing that seems to be outside the scope of its operations is the Labour majority in the Senate.&#34; I consider <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan&#39;s</inline> remarks were very <inline font-style="italic">a</inline><inline font-style="italic">propos.</inline> The position, as we understand it, is this: The State of Queensland has a considerable number of cattle, and the Imperial authorities made arrangements with the State Government to secure a big proportion of those cattle for export. The State Government at the same time acquired a large number of cattle to insure a supply of meat for the people of Queensland. Finding that a number of cattle were being driven southwards,  towards  the New South Wales border* the Queensland Government, acting  as they believed in accordance wilh&#39; the Constitution and the State laws, prevented the cattle from crossing the border. Prior to this the matter had been referred to <inline font-style="italic">Hie</inline> High Court, which decided, in effect, that the State had no right to interfere with stock crossing the border, or to impose any restrictions whatever upon Inter-State trade. On a second case coming before the High Court, however, an almost unanimous decision was arrived at that the State law of . Queensland was quite in conformity&#39; with the Constitution. I do not propose to argue the legal aspect of the matter, but&#39; I desire to point out how recent has been the awakening of certain people to the importance of Inter-State Free Trade. When the Referenda Bills were before the people on two previous occasions, the very people who are complaining that they have not freedom of Inter-State trade in their commodities, and that the Constitution requires an alteration, were bitterly opposed to the referenda proposals, which would have secured to them freedom of trade between States for all time. The Prime Minister says he could take action-- </para>

It does not matter, apparently, whether the censor cuts out information which honorable senators think ought to go outside, or whether,  under that Act, the Prime Minister censors an invitation to the Imperial Conference, which one of the Liberal members declared <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> quietly put in his pocket and said nothing about for two or three days. It does not matter, according to the honorable senator, and everything must be all right, because it is done under the War Precautions Act.

                            <para>- That is what I am coming to ? Does the honorable senator think that South Australia will get better beef under their own conditions? The offer was that the cattle should be killed in the Queensland meat works, put into cold storage and sold as chilled,&#39; not frozen, meat, in just the same condition as it is offered for sale in all parts of Australia. When cattle are killed at the meat works, the beef has to&#39; be sent into chilling chambers to&#39; be cooled down, and it may be there two or three days before it reaches the butchers for distribution. That was the kind of beef that was offered to South Australia, but evidently the Government of that State do not want it.. </para>

Now, , I have said that I am as strongly iri favour of Free Trade in commodities between the States as any member of this Senate-, and I want to draw attention to the - attitude taken up in some quarters when we had the referenda before the people asking for greater powers to. be granted to the Commonwealth. Did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> then get any support from the people who are now claiming that there should be Free* Trade- between the States? None whatever.- On that occasion, they said, &#34; Let us fight this question for all we are worth,&#34; and, in pursuance of that policy, they brought all the forces they could marshal against the movement, including the full strength of the manufacturers, the Protectionists, and the Free Traders. They were all up against the party that was endeavouring to do justice to the people in the various States, because they thought the extension of -Commonwealth powers would play into the hands of Labour. Is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> prepared to stand that? I am not. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware of that, and also the fact that the Act provides&#39; that, unless the . cattle are slaughtered in the abattoirs, the meat cannot be distributed within that particular area. But I am not complaining about that at all, and I am not urging that the South Australian- Government should alter the law. All I want to say vis that beef discharged into a cold store from -a ship- can be inspected just as thoroughly as. at any abattoirs. The most careful inspection in Australia is carried out at the big meat works in Queensland,, where practically all the inspectors are veterinary , surgeons, who are continually going through the works and inspecting; every beast that is killed. I admit that there was a time when inspections of all sorts were badly carried out, but that time is past, and to-day the meat works of Australia at any rate those which are exporting, are all operated under Commonwealth expert examiners. </para>

                            <para>- We know what went on at that time, but the prohibition only lasted for a little while. It lasted because the wheat, which was being brought into Sydney from the outside districts, was being shipped to Queensland. The New South Wales Government said to Queensland, &#34; If you want wheat, take the wheat which is grown near your own - border, and take it over the border.&#34; </para>

                            <para>-There  was undoubtedly some discrimination made by one State against another, but since then the Commonwealth has taken a hand in the matter, and to-day there is no question about prohibition. If the Com-  mon wealth Government were to do the same&#39; thing with stock there would be no question about their being able to hold it up, &#34;because practically an agreement would be made, so far as the States were concerned. But. no agreement has been made. There was no agreement made by the Imperial authorities with&#39; the Commonwealth or by the States with the Commonwealth ; it was a case of go-as-you-please. And because Queensland has acted in what is considered to be a perfectly constitutional way we are told now that the State Government is to be coerced under the War Precautions Act so that it may be compelled to do things which it is believed are constitutional. If it is to be another, case of providing money for the lawyers, well and good, for that is certainly what is bound to happen. It is because I do not care about seeing these sort of  things  going on that I think it would be a long way better if some other arrangement could be come to Between the Commonwealth and Queensland, so that if the people of South Australia want cheaper meat, and Queensland has it, they may be able to, get a supply. At the same time I say that the very people who to day are yelling out against the action of the Queensland Government are those who stood in and used all their influence and might against the extension of a boon like this to the Commonwealth people. I refer to the time when they had an opportunity to carry referenda proposals, which would have not only provided for commodities to be free, but also enabled many things to be handled by the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly, the Queensland Government at that period were, because they represented the interests of which I am speaking. Because they did not believe practically in having Free Trade between the States; because they did not believe in giving power to c the Commonwealth to control labour ; because they did not/ believe in the Commonwealth being enabled to wipe out all the anomalies which exist at the State borders, they were opposed to the proposals. Had the State Government only supported the proposals there would have been no possibility of the. State Parliament passing the legislation which has had the effect, as they claim, of compelling people to pay more dearly for their meat in some States than is paid in others. That is the reason why I brought this matter up here to-day. </para>

                    <para>SenatorTURLEY. - Those who form the present Government in Queensland worked day and night to secure the passage of the referenda proposals. Something may have been done at the Premiers&#39; Conference, or some such gathering of which we have no report, but as regards the members of the party which is in power there to-day the big majority of them were out on the platform and doing all they possibly could to secure the adoption of the referenda proposals. We have seen an address by a man who has been advertised all over Australia as a great constitutional authority - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> F. Mitchell. </para>

The &#34;wheat&#34; case and the &#34;meat&#34; case were regarded by many people as showing a need for unification. All he desired to say about those cases was that comparatively simple amendments of the Constitution could be readily suggested, which would vest in the Commonwealth power to pass laws for repealing any State laws, the effect of which did really interfere with absolute Free Trade between States. </para>

They seized a trench and dug-outs, and sent back thirty-five prisoners, including two German officers, and when the last message arrived from there they were holding the captured trench and strengthening the position during the night. Around them stretches a vast snowfield, broken only by the brown pockmarks of recent shells. </para>
                        <para>For the past fortnight the country has been bound in frost more severe than any in the past twenty years. The country is entirely covered with a thin sheet of snow. The thermometer several times has been not far from zero. Every lake, pond, waterhole, and shell crater is frozen fast with ice a foot thick. Behind the lines during the first day snow fights raged between the Australians. One that I know of continued on and off the whole day. Snow-men sprang up all over the Australian area. The excitement after the first day or two wore off, but the Australians are still every day to be seen sliding across the village ponds. </para>
                        <para>In the line, through the long, long nights, the troops look out over the wide, moonlit snows in the teeth of a bitter wind. But more bitter still is the thought which I hear expressed on every side that, after all these men have done, the Australian party politicians cannot sufficiently sink party gain and loss to whole-heartedly represent in the Imperial Conference the Australian ideas of justice and right for which they are fighting and dying. </para>

                        <para>- The appointment was made in order that the Australian public might be supplied with news from  our men at the front, but on numerous occasions political opinions have been&#39; given publication in this way. Would not the correspondent have been hauled over the coals had there been in power a Government opposed to conscription? The probability is that under such, circumstances he would have been recalled for expressing opinions considered detrimental to the interests of Ministers. There is not time to-day to deal with the question of Imperialism. _ In my opinion, a large body of electors in Australia will not  countenance  an Imperialism like that which some honorable senators opposite seem to favour, and to which at one time they were opposed. I quoted this article to point out that it is not the duty of an official journalist to express political opinions; it is his duty merely to supply news. He may profess to give the opinions of the men at the front, but it often happens that a journalist is wrong when he undertakes to say what are the opinions of other persons. The bulk of the newspaper writers in Australia were saying, before the vote was taken, that the country would not reject conscription. They were utterly mistaken as to the opinion of the majority on that question. Last week, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> was referring to a proposed coalition of the Cook-Hughes parties, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> interjected, &#34; What about the offers that the Labour party has made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook?&#34;</inline> I replied at the time that no offer was made by the Labour party, and I wish it to be distinctly understood that that is the case. The <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier,</inline> in its issue of 11th January, said that the Leader of the Federal Liberal party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> had stated that all sorts of offers from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> opponents had been made to him, and that he had been asked to take the whole of the portfolios, but &#39;that he had regarded the offers as in the nature of gifts from the Greeks. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> made that statement, but I do know that he has not bee* approached by the Labour party, nor asked by it to take any or all of the portfolios. </para>

He referred to the proposed creation of a National Government; and asked why the Labour party was unwilling that Australia should follow the example of Great Britain in this matter. My reply is that the circumstances of the two countries differ entirely.  He spoke as if the war would be ended in the course of a few weeks because of the development of the .submarine campaign. Great Britain, whether with or without the consent of a majority of its population, has conscription; Australia - I think   rightly - turned down the conscription of manhood. Then, in the Old Country, there is a great production of coal and iron, and machinery is manufactured there and sent to all parts of the world. Great Britain, moreover, is the greatest shipbuilder in the world. Having made inquiries, I understand that, although many . industries might be started here, an obstacle in the way is the lack of machinery. We were kept waiting a long time for the machinery needed to duplicate the plant of the Small Arms Factory. We also had to wait a long while for information necessary to the making of ammunition, -and although thousands of pounds were lost, we were able to do practically nothing in that matter for want of knowledge and machinery; but, notwithstanding this, our endeavour to play our part in the war has been recognised at the&#39; heart of the Empire. Over 300,000 men have volunteered in the various States for service abroad, and o&#38;r men have been ready to do the work that they were called upon to perform. Again, when there was a demand for artisans in the Old Country, the number of applications for employment was more than was needed. We are not able to do certain kinds of work, but we have produced enormous quantities of foodstuffs - wheat, meat, butter and jams - and we have also exported wool, hides, leather and metals for the assistance of the Empire at large. This is what&#39; Australia has done to assist the Old Country. We have been told that we can do a great deal more, and I think that we can by our men volunteering to go to the front, or by our supplying the things that are necessary to enable those who are conducting the fight at the front to do the best that is in them to settle the war. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has told us that the Liberals did not seek any alliance. As I have just said, the members of the Labour party are not interested ; they have not sought any alliance ; as a matter of fact, they turned down the offer that came from both the Liberal and the National Labour party to form an alliance, for the simple reason that they do not care for Fusion Governments, and do not wish to be a party to them. </para>

When the last Supply Bill was before us we found ourselves in a very peculiar position. We were asked&#39; to give the Government three months&#39; Supply; but we told the Government that two months&#39; Supply would be sufficient to carry them over Christmas, when they could get further Supply. There was a little bit of friction between the two Houses; but, eventually, the Government saw the moderation of the Senate&#39;s demand, and told us that they, would send up a new Bill covering two months&#39; Supply ; and, when that Bill came up  to  us, we passed it. But what was the big argument used in favour of granting . three months&#39; Supply) Every honorable senator was anxious to go back to his State and do something towards recruiting and bringing- the war to a successful conclusion. Has that been, the policy pursued ? As every one knows, instead of recruiting work being done,  all  that has been in progress&#39; has been political intrigue in Melbourne. Those who were appealing for time to carry  on  a recruiting campaign have been engaged in forming new parties, and in appealing  all  round to  all  sorts of people, of every nationality and party, for support in connexion with their object. A word or two in connexion with party formation in Australia  is  necessary. Before any honorable senator had-- an opportunity of getting upon a recruiting platform; this statement was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier,</inline> of the 8th January: - </para>

At the final meeting of the Referendum Committee, which was attended by the Premier of Victoria <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alexander Peacock), Sir William</inline> Irvine, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> among others, the Prime Minister made a speech advocating the formation of a new National party on a Win-the-War &#34; policy. The coming together of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HiSlman&#39;8</inline> supporters and the Liberals in New South Wales was quoted as. a precedent for the establishment of a Federal party on a similar basis. An attempt was then made to enlist the sympathies of the State Premiers, the Queensland Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> being, left out. Subsequently arrangements were made to hold a conference in Melbourne to coincide with the reassembling of the Premiers&#39; Conference. Delegates were sent from New South -Wales and Western Australia, but on their arrival this week they were told that, owing to unexpected developments, it was not to be held. It appears that neither the Leader of the Liberal party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook)</inline> nor the great majority of the members of the Liberal party were in the secret that a meeting was to be held to consider the formation of a new party. This caused ill-feeling, but not individually to any of those who attended the meeting. Why the proposed conference was not held has not been announced, but, from what can be learned, few of the visiting Premiers viewed with favour the formation of a new party, and this may have pen the reason  for not proceeding with the conference. The .formation of a new party , 1088 not appear to be. viewed with much favour by Liberal members generally. A frequent objection is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> supporters claim that, notwithstanding that certain action has been taken in regard to them by the Labour  organizations, they still adhere to every plank  of the Labour platform to which they have previously subscribed. Under such circumstances the difficulties in the way pf uniting in one party are regarded by a prominent member of the Liberal party as insurmountable. </para>

                        <para>It is my pleasure and privilege to lead a party consisting of very able men indeed. Whoever else is critical of the Liberal party, I, for one, am very proud of it, and never prouder than in these last few days. Oura has been a task of no mean difficulty. Since the war broke out we have addressed ourselves, without thought of party preferment or ambition, to the consideration of the great war tasks as they developed, from day to day. How else would it be possible for a great party, such as ours is, to swing behind a party that is much smaller - shall I put it in that way? - that we should be keeping in office, and in positions of responsibility, a number of men who, on every democratic principle, have no claim to be in such a position! On no party&#39; or political grounds could they be permitted to remain there for one minute. It was only because of the intrusion of those larger issues, which tower high above party considerations, that we found ourselves supporting a Government composed, as a party, of the least numbers of any of the parties in the present Federal arena. </para>

                        <para>I&#34; see in some quarters an attempt is being made to bring into existence another party, an &#34; in-between party,&#34; which they call a National arty. I am much concerned as to its name, ut I om more concerned as to the men composing it. They call it the National party, and delegates are already meeting in Melbourne; but when I look at the names of these delegates I find only the names of Labour men. I want to say this quite plainly, that if the matter of the war is all that concerns these gentlemen - and it is only war that should concern them just now - then I say, unchallengeably, the party to which I belong has turned itself into a Win-the-war party since ever the war began, and will so- continue until the last shot has been fired, and a triumphant peace has been won. </para>

                    <para class="block">This waa in consequence of an announcement made by the Prime Minister that a meeting would be held on the next evening in the council room of the Melbourne Town Hall. for the formation of a National organization. He had, he said, received numerous requests to call a meeting for the purpose, and this was the initial step. Then we heard of the organization of the party. A number of men were sent down from Queensland, amongst them being <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Adamson, Mr. Peter</inline> Airey, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> and, I think, Canon Garland. I understood that they were going to Melbourne in connexion with recruiting business. I do not know anything about the way in which the expenses in connexion with this matter were met, but the first intimation we had as to the work being done by these gentlemen was that it was in connexion with the formation of a new political party. I am speaking now from the Queensland point of view, and the information sent to Queensland was that those forming the executive committee of the new party for Queensland included <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Adamson, Mr. Edmund</inline> Jowett, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peter</inline> Airey, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Matthew</inline> Reid. We were told later that Canon Garland and others were at the meeting. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Airey</inline> is reported to have said on that occasion, when supporting a motion, that the Premier of Queensland. did not represent the feeling of that State with regard to the question which they had before them.

I raise no objection to the formation of organizations of any kind; but it has been a matter of wonder to me that men should be joining alleged Labour organizations to- &#39; day who have previously considered such organizations the greatest curse that Australia has ever seen.

I was with him in the Queensland Parliament for many years, and I know that he always considered that if ever there was a curse to the country it was a Labour party of any description. On one occasion his leader made the .statement publicly in the Queensland Parliament that it would pay the State well to pay the expense of sending out of the country every man who was agitating on behalf of the Labour movement. It will be considered great fun in Queensland that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Philp should have joined what is alleged to be a Labour party. </para>

                            <para>- That, of course, may be the case. The best thing I saw in connexion with the matter was the appointment on the executive of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edmund</inline> Jowett. I believe it was good tactics to . appoint to the executive this gentleman, who is a prominent member of the Pastoralists Association, because* in view of the various interests he holds in the State of Queensland, he is surely entitled to that position. The Pastoralists Association, of which he is a member, has until lately regarded a Labour organization as, not only a curse to the country, but especially to the industry in which the members of that association are concerned. I thought it would be well to see what interests are held in Queensland by this gentleman, who has just joined an alleged Labour organization. I never met him, and have nothing to say against him. I have understood that he was, and is, a very large holder of Crown leases in Queensland, for which he pays a rental to the Government, and in respect of which he has, - no doubt, to contribute a good deal to land  taxation, and, possibly, also in income taxation. There can be no objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jowett</inline> on that score at all. He may possess a good deal of freehold property, also, but on that point I have no information. There may become pre-emptives  connected with the leased estates in which he is interested. I have taken out a few facts and figures from  Pugh&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Almanac</inline> for 1916, and I mention estates in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jowett</inline> is interested in various districts so that honorable senators may be able to form an idea of the extent of his interest in the country. In the Adavale district he has Mount Howitt, with 78 horses and 4,600 head of cattle. In the same district, Collabra,  &#39;with 18 horses and 675 cattle. In the Alpha district he has Drummondslope, with 20 horses and 1,850 cattle. In the Augathella district he has Clare, with 10,850 sheep. In the Aramac district he has  Doongmabulla,  with 83 horses and 3,757 cattle. In the  Bogantungan  district he has Rutland, with 98 horses and 796 cattle.&#34; In the Burke district he has Alive Vale, with 370 head of cattle. In the Burketown district he has Almora, with 6 horses and 180 cattle; Alroy, with 20 horses and 460 cattle ;  Armraywald,  with 98 horses and 600 cattle; and Whitworth, with 200 head of cattle. In the Claremont district he has  Bathcaston,  with 96 horses and 3,000 cattle; Finnigan, with 12,900 sheep;  Labona,  with (2,875 .cattle; Shuttleworth, with 18 horses, 882 cattle, and 18,850 sheep; and Tungi, with 14,800 sheep. In the Cloncurry district he has Haslingden, with 11 horses and 2,700 cattle;  Quillalar,  with 25 horses  and  200 cattle; and Westbank; with 73 horses and 4,227&#34; cattle. In the Dalby district he has  Canaja,  with 495 cattle&#39;; Fairyland, with 35 horses and 505 cattle; Foxborough, with 64 horses and 32 cattle, and 24,900 sheep; Stockyard Creek, with 10 horses and 886 cattle. In the Isisford district he has Mount Marlow, with 362 horses, 369 cattle, and 63,000 sheep; and Gallipoli, with 250 head of cattle. In the Jericho district he has  Eastmere,  with 394 horses, 901 cattle, and 41,000 sheep. In the Jundah district he has   Berrimpa  with 47 horses., 60 cattle, and 9,000 sheep. In the Kynuna district he has Quambatook with 74 horses, 96 cattle, and 30,593 sheep- In the Longreach district he has Topham with 2,200 cattle ^-Vergemont 260 horses, 300 cattle, and 28,000 sheep;  Warbreccan  North, 1,300 cattle. In the Leyburn district he has  Cloonacool  with 12 horses, 4,054 sheep. In the Normanton district he has- Roderick with .5.00 cattle; East Creek with 2,000 cattle. In the Pentland district he has Blair  Athol  with 37 horses and 1,600 cattle. In the Richmond district He has Trenton with 1,000 cattle; Bunda Bunda with 216 horses, 5,000 cattle, and 45,993 .sheep;  Kuradin  with 3,100 cattle; Malpas with 150 horses, 2,000 cattle;  Pinaba  with 2,000 cattle. In the St. Laurence district he has Warwick, 2604 cattle. In the Windorah district he has Portia with 700 cattle; Uko with 720 cattle; Curran with 560 cattle;  Dirri Dirri  with 1,400 cattle;  Palparara  with 84 horses and 10,340 cattle. In the Warra district he has  Wyobie  with 46 horses, 115 cattle., 7,176 sheep. In the Winton district he has  Binburi  with 1,000 .cattle.;  Carcara   with 1,050 cattle ; Dunham Downs with 60 horses and. 9.00 cattle;  Manabudgeri  with 1,100 cattle; and Selkirk with &#39;950 cattle. It was a good tactical move to appoint as treasurer of this new organization a gentleman holding such vast estates. There will be no necessity for levies upon its. members, seeing .that it has as its treasurer a gentleman possessed of this enormous wealth. A small levy on his cattle-herds would bring in more money&#39; than would be necessary to finance any new party in Australia over a considerable period. I was surprised that a man possessed of such wealth should have become a member of an alleged Labourorganization. I have been taught that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a. rich man to enter the Kingdom &#34; of Heaven. It would seem, However, that the days of miracles are not yet passed. Here we have a gentleman, who must be literally rolling in wealth, coming forward and saying, &#34;I am prepared to join a Labour party with the object of making things better in this country of ours.&#34; </para>

                            <para>-  Undoubtedly.  It is only a few years ago that the capitalistic papers throughout Australia were telling us that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and some of his friends had taken up thousands of miles of shee,p country in Western Australia, and were blossoming into pastoralists. I do not .know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has succeeded so well in that direction as to have .become a member of- the Pastoralists Association. If he is in the industry he should become a member&#39; of that organization. He tells us that &#34; these are the sort of people that, are required in a National Labour party.&#34; T can quite .understand the honorable senator&#39;s statement if, as we are &#39; told, he holds a large area of land, in Western Australia, and is developing it. In such circumstances his sympathies would naturally go o&#39;ut- to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edmund</inline> Jowett and other large land-holders.  The list of properties which I have just read out represents merely the areas held by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jowett</inline> in one State; I do not know what properties he- possesses in other ,parts of the Commonwealth. It is only since the honorable senator left the Labour party that he is able to appreciate the assistance of such men who have been for many years towers of strength in the big Pastoralists Association. </para>

                            <para>- We do not mind being included in that category. Experience teaches us that the worker can rely only on his own efforts, and the efforts of those who belong to his own party, to drag him out of his  poverty-stricken  conditions. The worker knows  very well that, until the last two or three years at all events, those who have reached great heights in the pastoralists&#39; industry were always prepared to oppose to the best of their . ability those who were endeavouring to improve the conditions of Labour in Australia. The Labour movement has not yet been able to establish a heaven on earth, but it is the only movement that has improved the conditions of the workers. That being so, it is difficult to imagine a&#176;man who is overburdened with  wealth  throwing, himself -enthusiastically into -the work of a Labour organization, or offering to supply it with  the sinews of war. </para>

                    <para>I want now to deal with the platform of the National Labour party. Every organization must have a platform on which to appeal to the country; and I find that the fifth plank in the platform of the National Labour party is, &#34; The upholding of the White Australia&#39; policy.&#34; In my time I have taken a fairly active part in the work of upholding that policy. I supported it at a time when the preaching of such a doctrine was not very popular. I supported it when we had in Queensland a greater number of imported coloured people than there was in any other part of Australia - when we had in that State, I suppose, more Chinese than were to be found in any other part of the Union. We carried on the agitation for a White Australia until at last statesmen considered that the time had arrived to give effect to it, and when Federation was brought about the people in power legislated to bring the policy into operation. I refer to this matter because of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edmund</inline> Jowett, who is a prominent member of the Pastoralists Association, has been appointed treasurer of this so-called Labour organization. I do not know whether he subscribes to all the doctrines which the Pastoralists Association preaches, but I propose to make a few quotations from an article on &#34;The Northern Territory Problem,&#34; which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoral Review</inline> of April, 1914, and which does not seem to be altogether consistent with the policy of a man who joins an organization having as one of its objects the upholding of the principle of a White Australia. In this article we have the statement - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It is impossible  to  have an entirely white population in tropical Australia,  but  the failure  to  realize this is  what  has kept the &#34; White Australia &#34; fetish alive  so long. A  &#34;pure-white&#34; Australia is impossible  of accomplishment, and most of our  politicians  are  aware  of  it,  but  will  not  publicly proclaim  or  acknowledge it,  as they know it  would  be as  much  as  their parliamentary salary is worth  to  do  so.  There is no country in the world possessed of low-lying tropical areas where whites make  a  living solely by their own unaided efforts. They superintend,  but  those they oversee  are  units of  dark-skinned  races. Science teaches  that  the black  or  dark skin is not nearly  as  susceptible  to heat as  white,  the  black pigment being  a non-conductor,  and nature,  on  this account,  has  peopled  all  her  hot,  tropical areas with dark-skinned races -  the  Africans, the South American Indians, the Hindus of India,  the  South Sea Island kanakas, the Australian aborigines,  and so on.  Therefore, it is obviously unnatural  to expect  white people  to work  manually in tropical countries subject  to great and  continuous  heat and an  abnormally high degree  of  humidity. </para>
                        <para>Further on the article deals with the  methods  which should be adopted in order to secure the settlement of that portion of Australia. It says: - </para>
                        <para>For over fifty years the South Australian and Federal Governments have been pouring money into the Territory and building up a huge debt, and now at last it has sunk into the minds of unprejudiced people that we have made a mistake. The reason for all this is want of suitable labour. It must be introduced, but,  at  the same time, it must be a systematic introduction which will check any tendency to overrun the whole of the continent, multiplying) and ultimately developing into the problem which confronts the United States and South Africa. If coloured labour, Chinese, kanakas, Javanese, or Fast Indians, were allowed uncontrolled freedom of movement into any part of Australia, the remedy would be almost as bad in the long run as the original evil. </para>
                        <para>The indentures should be of, say, five years&#39; duration, although at the expiration of that time the men could be allowed to sign a fresh agreement for a further period of years. Restrictive legislation would have to be framed to prevent them obtaining vested interests in the country, but that would present no difficulty. The problem has been how to allow black labour in the Territory, and at the same time to keep them from overrunning the whole of Australia. The above solution briefly is to introduce men and women under agreement for a term of years, and to keep them within a fixed boundary, the line of demarcation to be the 75 deg. wet bulb summer isotherm. Children born in the country must be subject to the same conditions, and leave either with their parents or after a. fixed number of years. </para>
                        <para>I do not know that I have ever heard of any more inhumane statement than that. </para>

Whites could live in comfort, their wives would have domestics to do the house work, and the sea coast-line would be quickly peopled, and defence made easier. The &#34;White Australia&#34; fetish must be dropped; a continued worship of it spells ruin for the north; discarding it means prosperity, progress, and safety. Introduce the labour, and capital for development will follow: The sensitiveness of capital is such nowadays that it will not readily follow white labour in temperate latitudes, much less the tropics. But give it the security that black labour offers, and sympathetic government, and the development of northern Australia is assured. </para>
                    <para class="block">I have read this extract because it seems to me so incongruous. Here we have one of the pillars of the Pastoralists Association identifying himself with a new political party which has for its object the depletion of the membership of Labour organizations as much as possible. The first meeting of this new party was held in Geelong, and the second in Ballarat, from both of which places Labour men have enlisted for service at the front. These were the centres selected for the purpose of forming and fostering this new organization, which has for its object the political cutting of the throats of many members of Labour organizations while they are absent from the country patriotically doing their duty. If a parliamentary representative of the people departs from Australia on active service, he is liable to find that, during his absence, a movement Has been inaugurated for the purpose of securing his political slaughter. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier</inline> of 24th January, the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> in addressing the members of this new party, said - </para>
                    <para>I hope my Liberal friends will remember that I broke with the most powerful party organization in Australia, not because I did not believe in the Labour platform, but because the Labour movement, which was created to serve a great and unselfish purpose, was being prostituted to the ends of a mean and selfish one. In the supreme hour of national danger it failed to think and act nationally. Suppose the position had been reversed. Suppose the Liberal party in a majority, and controlling the Government, had split, as the Labour party had done, and the smaller section, fighting for a great principle, had to rely upon the Labour party for support in Parliament. Would they have not thought it a little difficult if, when they wished to form an organization in which all parties could work, who put certain great principles first, the Labour party had said, &#34; Why form a new party ? Why not join the Labour party?&#34; The fact is that I am not a Liberal, that very many of hundreds of thousands who support me are not Liberals, that we are only agreed that all other things, Liberal and Labour, must be subordinated to the necessity for solidarity in this hour of great national peril. A new organization is required into which men and women of all parties may come without abandoning their principles or their connexion with their own party, but, loyally subordinating party interests, work together for the great national cause. The National Federation is such an organization. A Liberal may join without abandoning his principles or severing himself from his party. A Labour man may do so without prejudice to his Labour principles. All that is necessary is that Liberals and Labourites shall accept the platform, which is non-party, suited to the exigencies of the present situation, deals with those problems that must inevitably arise after the war, and is compatible with free democratic government. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is a most peculiar feature of the organization. I am not much in the habit of frequenting racecourses, but when I have occasionally visited them, I have seen some men playing a game which is known as &#34; the thimble and the pea &#34; - a game&#39; in which one pays his money and takes his choice. That game seems to resemble very closely this new political party. If one is a Labour man, he is assured that he can join it without sacrificing his principles, and the same assurance is given with equal facility to all Liberals. Is it to be imagined for a moment that Labour organizations will be content to sit quietly down while their members flock to a new association, whose one object is the main- . tenance politically of those who have left the Labour party? </para>

                            <para>- That is not so. Only the other day I pointed out to a man who questioned me on the subject, that Labour members of this Parliament had no pre-emptive claim to their seats. So far as the party inside this Parliament is concerned, it had nothing whatever to do with the action of certain members of it who, on a memorable occasion, quitted a Caucus meeting. The party has always reserved to itself the right to select its own  chairman.  It has a right to change its  chairman.  What are the facts of the case? A meeting of the party was called. Nothing was pre-arranged, so far as I am concerned. At that meeting, somebody moved that the  chairman  be no longer permitted to occupy his position, that the office be declared vacant, and that somebody else be elected to it. </para>

So far as the party in Parliament is concerned, neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> nor any one associated with him was asked to leave the meeting, but they walked out at the invitation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> himself. </para>

I was pointing out that the organization to which I have referred is out, as other organizations have been in the past, on many occasions, to crush the Labour movement in Australia ; and this we are not going to allow if we can possibly prevent it. Coalitions and fusions, and the allotment of portfolios, have nothing to do with the Labour party, which stands &#34; on its own/&#39; as it always has done. This party has had &#34; setbacks &#34; on many&#39; occasions, though in the Commonwealth we have done remarkably well. On one occasion, in Queensland, our numbers were reduced from thirty-five to seventeen, but in a very few years we again became- the governing power. The Labour party cannot form alliances or fusions with any other party, owing to the fact that to do so it must sacrifice many principles which its members have advocated before the public. I suppose that things will go along as they are for some time, and I do not wish it to be understood for one moment that the Labour party or the Labour movement is averse to doing everything possible to assist in bringing the war to a successful conclusion. I have realized that, in spite of all the talk we heard on a previous Supply  Bill as to what must be done in recruiting, comparatively little work has been done by -those who made the most noise. The work has generally been left to those who made no fuss, but were prepared to attend recruiting meetings, and do everything possible in the way of bringing it home to  eligibles  that their duty is to go to the front. In this work I have taken some little hand, and I shall  be very glad when I have an opportunity to resume it. While we will not form any fusion with members opposite, or with the Liberal party, we are prepared- </para>

What I desire to say is that, whilst we will not form any alliance&#34; or fusion with our friends opposite, or with the Liberal party, we will not have it said that we, as a party, refuse to do all &#39;we possibly can to bring the war to a successful conclusion. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator has referred to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jowett</inline> is treasurer of the new organization, and also to the connexion of wealthy men therewith. But is the Official Labour party also to be condemned because some of its members possess wealth ? Many men possessed of this world&#39;s goods have been amongst the best Democrats the Labour party has ever known. Because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jowett</inline> is treasurer of the organization, and a member of the Pastoralists Association, are we to be condemned because of what some editor or other has &#39;said? There are Labour newspapers in connexion with the Labour party, but God help the Labour party, and God help <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> if it, or he, has to be held responsible for all that may appear in their columns. Many such journals depend on volunteers for their work; and surely no outside person or persons can be held responsible for what may be published ? Because something appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoral Review</inline> in reference to White Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> for election purposes, would brand all of us on this side with the stigma of not believing in that policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> by means of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> seeks to cast this imputation upon us, although he, and those associated with him, know in their hearts that it is false. Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> nor any other honorable senator opposite can point to any vote cast against the interests of the working masses by a member of the Labour party on this side. No one can show that a -man on this side has dishonoured himself by breaking any of his written pledges. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> told us that all men may join the Official Labour party if they are affiliated members of any union. Well, I am an affiliated member of a union, and yet neither I nor my colleague are eligible. I understand that in Western Australia, if men in a similar position to myself comply with the dictates of the- local executive, they may once more become members. That I, myself, could &#34;do in Victoria, if I went down on  my bended knees, and begged the privilege from men whom I. believe to have no power or authority, nor, if I may say so, in many, cases, even an average intelligence entitling them to dominate my position here. We have taken up an attitude which is hostile neither to the principles nor. to many of the persons of the </para>

                    <para class="block">Labour party. I have always been proud of my colleagues in the old party, regarding many of them as fine, manly, honorable men. But, because I have this regard for certain men, and because I hold certain principles, am I to abandon whatever manhood I possess, and submit, to the control of the few outside? If Labour members opposite expect fair play from us, they ought surely to extend fair play. Would&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> instead of dragging in the Pastoralists Association, and making the imputations he has, take it upon himself to say, in all honesty, to me as an individual, &#34; Russell, you do not believe in a White Australia, and desire to became the owner of stations&#34;? Heaven knows where these stations are; and I do mot know whether or not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie or his station is &#34;broke&#34;; &#39;but I fancy that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> were to make an offer of purchase, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie would accept it with a very considerable discount. As to the idea that Queensland and the north of Australia will be &#34; ruined,&#34; even if we suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jowett</inline> believes in the principles imputed  to him, would it be fair, on the other hand, to suggest that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> believes in all the godless assertions made in a certain section of the* press, , and in the declarations of policy of the Industrial Workers of the World movement? Certainly not, I have too high an opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline>  to think so; but, if he expects manly treatment, he ought to give manly .treatment in return. I have heard despotic proposals made in my time, but the greatest of all is that, when the people in the south of Australia desire fresh meat, they must eat chilled meat for the benefit of Queensland. Whether we, in the south of Australia, get fresh meat or not, must depend on the commercial advantage to the northern State ; and that, from a Socialist and humanitarian like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,is</inline> the most extreme suggestion I ever knew. Queensland may gain the advantage  of a little work and labour in the chilling and preserving of meat, but in return she has to pay an enhanced price- for her daily loaf. Owing to the system adopted in the wheat districts, every bushel which goes into Queensland to-day costs 6d. more than -what is paid- in the other States, and this largely for the- benefit of State railways and private shipping companies. Just as I am anxious to remove the embargo on wheat, and  give </para>

                        <para>. - From communications which many honorable senators have received from the Northern Territory it is apparent that there exists a great deal of anxiety concerning the danger of the re-appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> to the position of Administrator. I call the possible re-appointment a danger because I think it would be in the worst interests of that portion of the Continent to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> to continue in his present office. For a considerable time past the Territory has been seething with discontent, and the conduct of the Administrator has not made things easier. In times past I. have called attention to the policy laid down by that gentleman, and I cannot help believing still that the aim of that policy has been to prove white labour a failure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> quoted this afternoon from a very pertinent and significant pamphlet issued by the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoral Review,</inline> issued shortly before the outbreak of war. On previous occasions I have pointed out that there appeared to be throughout the newspapers of the Commonwealth a well-organized conspiracy in accordance with the spirit of that particular pamphlet. Even the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> were offenders in that respect, for regularly they published articles in which the argument was used that, whilst white labour might be all right for other parts of Australia, it was greatly to be feared it would never be a success in the Northern Territory. Those of us who have worked in tropical and sub-tropical parts of Australia will agree that where a coloured man can work a white man also can work, and it has been our experience in the canefields of North Queensland that the white man can do twice as much work in a given time as his coloured competitor. The climate of the Northern Territory is not vastly different from that of North Queensland but the policy laid down by the present Administrator is the encouragement of all the coloured races that have found their way to Australia, including men from the southernmost parts of Europe, Patagonians and mixed nationalities from all parts of the world&#39;, except Australia and Great &#39; Britain. The Patagonians and Greeks have been attracted by the inducement of high wages on the wharfs and on railway construction works, but I affirm that if similar encouragement had been given to the workers throughout Queensland there would have been plenty of response. I stated on one occasion that if applications were called from men willing to work on railway construction in the Northern Territory at the then prevailing rates ranging from 16s. per day upwards, the fares of the workers to be paid as were those of the Patagonians, there would be 500 responses in North Queensland alone within twenty-four hours. I suggested also that people who had been acclimatized could not be surpassed as settlers in the Northern Territory. The present Administrator has adopted a dictatorial policy which&#39; has not been in the best interests of Australia. From the very inception of his term of office the policy of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> has been violently anti-Labour, and his subordinates knew that unless they were subservient to his policy they must get out. I do not suggest that insubordination should be tolerated,.&#39; but the experience has been that if a man dared to disagree with any proposal of the Administrator, or even to make a suggestion within his own Department that was antagonistic to the policy laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> he earned his superior&#39;s enmity, and had  to leave. We remember that Mr.Ryland, the Director of Lands, was sacked as soon as the Cook Government came into office in 1913. He was an energetic and capable man, and applied his faculties to the land question, to which he had given years of attention.  His  only fault was that his mind had been imbued with certain principles, and that he had been appointed by a Labour Government. Owing to his possession of those desirable attributes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryland</inline> was never given an opportunity by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> to formulate any scheme for the lay-out &#39;of the country with a view to its partition and ultimate settlement. Again, the Director of Mines, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jensen,</inline> has been virtually kicked from pillar to post, and was relieved from the position of Director of Mines to which he had been appointed in conjunction with that of Government Geologist, whilst a subordinate has been appointed . Director of Mines and placed at the head of a separate Department. Even when <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jensen</inline> continued with his work as Government Geologist, he was hampered in every direction, and no play was given to his knowledge and proposals, and finally his services were dispensed with. There has not been smooth working in the Territory for several years past, and there will not be in the future if the present administration continues. With the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth&#39;s</inline> particular supporters, the people of Darwin are up in arms against him; and whatever Government may assume responsibility in the near future will be acting in the best interests of Australia if they make a change in the occupancy of the office of Administrator. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> has been in Melbourne since September last.  His  salary is about &#163;1,750 per annum, and he has an allowance of &#163;500 for entertaining at Government House at Darwin. While absent from &#39;Darwin, he is entitled to draw expenses at the rate of &#163;2 2s. per day. Every year he comes to Melbourne for lengthy periods, frequently visits Government House - that, of course, is his private affair - and takes a prominent part in social affairs generally. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it is attached to his salary. While he has been prating of his patriotism and his adherence to the policy of a White Australia, Government House has been filled with Chinese servants. That fact, in itself, shows his ardent desire to prove that white labour can be successfully employed in the Northern Territory. In to-day&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> appears a long report of a meeting held at Darwin on Friday night, when resolutions were passed in favour of the motion moved in the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the affairs of the Northern Territory. Today I received this significant communication from Darwin - </para>

                    <para>Large and enthusiastic public indignation meeting Town Hall last night, representative all classes. Severe criticism Administrator and administration. Motions carried unanimously condemning same, also motion calling on Government to give representation, also allow Territory to be administered by advisory council. </para>
                    <para class="block">The grievance of the people at Darwin in regard to representation has been accentuated since the referendum campaign. Despite any provision made by Parliament they, in common with the people of other Federal territories, were given the right to vote on the conscription issue. Having exercised the franchise on that occasion, they naturally believe that they should have&#39; the opportunity of doing so at every Federal election,  and should have representation in the Federal Parliament. The creation of an advisory council is also a sore point. Government nominees are placed upon the council, but in order to qualify , for an appointment they must be in sympathy with the policy of the Administrator. It appears to me that the people in that far-away portion of Australia should be given at least the ordinary inducement of being allowed to conduct their affairs in a proper and systematized way. If the Government re-appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> I am certain that there will be a continuation of the pastraspings in the Territory, and that no genuine progress will be made. As a matter of fact, we cannot have progress with an anti- Australian policy in force, and administered, in same cases, &#39;vindictively by certain officials, in the Northern Territory. I have taken this opportunity to ventilate this particular aspect 4&#163; the question, lest the whole schedule go through before honorable senators had an opportunity of giving attention to it. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to direct attention to the fact that, in Melbourne, and in every other capital city of Australia, thousands of men are out of employment, and that, as the schedule &#34;includes provision for works and railways, the Government should act as quickly as possible by instructing the Public Works Committee to &#39;consider the proposals without delay. At the present time in Melbourne there are about 1,000 carpenters out of work, and the schedule indicates that if the works contemplated are put in hand there will be plenty of employment. It is the duty of the Government to keep these people in work if possible; and, as the matter is urgent, I hope the Government will give early consideration to my suggestion. The Government have set out  to run the affairs of Australia, and, as far as I can see, the rest of the earth also; and I want particularly to impress upon them the necessity of not forgetting that the only possible chance of successfully carrying oh the affairs of this country is by keeping every available man willing to work in work. If it is possible for the country to raise &#163;18,000,000 for the war loan - and this&#34; has been done successfully, although, by the way, the amount is &#163;9,000,000 short of what the Government asked for six months ago - I say the first consideration should be to put into operation those works which will give employment in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- It will not be as far as I am concerned, and I do not think the Government will be able to do that so far as the honorable senator is concerned. The suggestion I make is a reasonable one, and, if adopted, it would be of immense benefit to the people of this country. All that is necessary is that the Government- should instruct the Works Committee to consider the undertakings mentioned in the schedule, and have the work approved as early as possible. No man with ,a family including five or six able-bodied sons, would keep them hanging round the house in idleness if there was any possibility of getting profitable employment for them; and exactly the same argument may be applied to the Government of the country. Only a fool Government would keep thousands of men out of work if there was work to do, especially when those men have- wives and children to support. I hope the Government will not adopt the procedure of the Industrial Workers of the World of slowing down in &#39;connexion with their public works proposals, when there are so many men out of work in Australia. They have a responsibility with regard to the people in Australia as well as to those who have gone out of Australia, and it is part of their duty to find employment for them. </para>

                            <para>- He was a veterinary surgeon. That occupation does not carry with it any particular qualification for the position he holds, and the history of the -Territory during his administration, I think, proves that, to put it mildly, he was not, and is not, the kind of man for the position. Some time ago, when the question of the Territory was under discussion, I pointed out that it embraced 70,000,000 acres of good agricultural and pastoral land, which was held on lease in large areas by people- who were making comparatively little use of it. I urged upon the Government the desirability of resuming that area.  If  we here could not persuade Parliament to tax the present holders out, as I think ought to have been done, then the next alternative was to buy them out ; but the Government apparently did not see the desirability of&#34; doing that. I still believe that, before . any settlement is possible in the Terri-  tory, this huge area of good country must be resumed. It must be got possession of in some way by the Government, and placed under its control. We hear people talk about settling small men in the Territory. In my opinion, the idea is ridiculous. I do not think that a small man has a ghost of a chance of making a living in the Territory. He is too far from markets, the cost of labour is too high, and everything is against him. The only man who can make a living in that part of Australia is one possessing a sufficient capital to start sheep or cattle or horse-raising in a fairly moderate way. </para>

If men of that stamp got hold of a portion of the Territory, they would, and could, develop it; but, unless conditions are altered, I think that the whole outlook is hopeless. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In any case, the foundation of this huge socialistic scheme may very well be laid in the Territory, seeing that we cannot get the small capitalist, or even the comparatively wealthy capitalist, to go there. The people of Australia, -having the Territory thrown on their hands, ought to attack the problem of its development in their own way. That is how the settlement of that country, so far as sheep and cattle are concerned, can be carried out. With regard to mining, we have been told here, time and again, that the Territory is particularly rich in minerals, but, so far as I know, the Government have never had a survey of the country made by a competent mining engineer. That is one of the first tilings which ought to be undertaken by any Government. When a man buys a property, if he has not found out already what it is, one of his first acts after he obtains possession is to try to discover its possibilities. In the Northern Territory we have not attempted that. No Government, so far as I know, has in any way tried to find out what the possibilities or probabilities&#34; of the Territory are from a mining point of view. I think that that also ought to be done. The Government should take this matter in hand at the earliest possible moment. But to carry out these proposals, a man would require to be placed in authority who has had some experience in connexion with land and mining. In Australia, there are dozens of men who have had a large experience in that direction, and whose services, I am sure, could be obtained on the terms held out by the Commonwealth. If the Government would only look for a man of that class, - 1 am perfectly sure that they would find him. There are many such men in Australia. I do not consider that the present Administrator ought to be re-appointed. I do not think that he is suitable &#34;for the position. &#39; In addition to not having the necessary knowledge with regard to the land, and other matters, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilruth</inline> seems to be wanting in tact. No doubt he had a very rebellious people to deal with, but tact goes a long way. In my view, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilruth</inline> is very deficient in the gift of managing people of the class he undoubtedly had to deal with. - On the whole, I think that the Government would be very well-advised if it did not re-appoint him. </para>

                            <para>- In speaking to the first reading, I called the attention of the Minister to certain matters in connexion with the wool clip, and also to war pensions and old-age pensions. I think that, when the honorable senator was replying to the debate on the first reading, he might have given the Senate some information on those two points, which I consider are very important. It has always been customary on such an occasion for the Minister to give some indication of what is in the mind of the Government on important points raised in debate, and I think that the Minister will agree with me that the points I referred to are very important. Not having given us any information, I desire to refresh his memory. In my former speech I -pointed out that under the system in existence all the wool from each State) must be sent to one port, there to be appraised, and that in Western Australia the system does not apply very well. I pointed out that at Geraldton there is any amount of wool to be appraised, but that the Government insists upon that wool being sent to Fremantle. When I made that remark, the Minister appeared to be sympathetic with the idea that an appraiser should be sent to Geraldton. The wool-growers up there are prepared, and have made the offer to the Government, to pay the cost of an appraiser. I shall be very pleased if the Minister will intimate, before this schedule is disposed of, what the intention of the Government is in that direction, so as to relieve the difficulty which exists, and which is in no way fair to that portion of the vast State. The other matter I referred to was an injustice to many citizens of Australia, in so far as the right to a war pension is militating against the grant to them of the full benefits of the Old-age Pensions Act. I pointed out last Friday, and I desire to point out again, that an applicant for an old-age pension who in every other respect has fulfilled the requirements of the Act, should not be deprived of a full pension because that person is in receipt of a war pension. I further refer the Minister to  a  statement in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> by the Leader of the Senate, when I raised a question on the War Pensions Bill. If such a thing occurred, I asked, was it the intention of the Government to so amend the Old-age Pensions Act that the two Acts, that is, the Old-age Pensions Act and the  War  Pensions Act, would be independent of each other. If  a  man or woman has reached the statutory age of sixty or sixty-five years, and is in every other respect entitled to a full pension of 12s. 6d. a week, and is getting a war pension of some sort on account of the loss of a relative at the front, or of an injury to a relative, it is unfair that the latter pension should be set off as income against the old-age pension. Every indigent citizen who has arrived at a certain age is entitled by law to an old-age pension, and when such persons are also entitled to war pensions they should be permitted to draw both pensions. I have already spoken on this subject on many occasions, and shall continue to speak on it until I have obtained redress for those who are suffering injustice. </para>

                        <para>. - I understand that there are in the Commonwealth about 3,000 blind persons, some of them employed in institutions such as the Blind Institute on the St. Kilda-road, which are partly subsidized by the State. No person who is not destitute of feeling could visit one of these institutions without being moved to pity for the unfortunate inmates. Blind persons are now treated in respect of pensions much in the same way as invalid persons, but I hold that they should be put into a class by themselves. Every one who is permanently incapacitated should be given enough to keep body and soul together. Some of those who are blind lost their sight through following occupations which are extremely hazardous. It is rightly provided that no deduction shall be made from  a  pension given to  a  soldier who has been incapacitated on active service, and the rates of military pensions have been increased since the war began. A soldier may earn as much as he can without bringing about the reduction of his pension, and rightly so. Blind persons, however, may not earn more than 10s.  a  week without a deduction from their pension. The pension given to  a  blind person is 12s. 6d. a week, but should  a  blind man earn more than 10s.  a  week in addition, there is a deduction from the pension equivalent to the excess;  a  blind  person&#39;s full pension and earnings may not exceed 22s. 6d. In my opinion, every blind person should be paid the full amount of the pension, irrespective of what he may earn. Those who enter institutions to learn useful trades show their desire to be independent, and it is a discouragement to make deductions from their pensions in proportion to their earnings. They have pointed out that what they can earn, together with the pension, is altogether insufficient to allow them to marry. At best, they cannot earn a living wage. I understand that a short time ago a deputation which waited on the Treasurer received sympathetic consideration, but I have not heard that definite action has been taken to comply with its requests. I urge this Government, and whatever Government may succeed this, to extend special consideration to the blind. My desire is that they shall be given the full pension, irrespective of what they may earn in addition. </para>

                        <para>.- I invite the attention of the Committee to the continuous neglect of the Minister for Works to provide decent house accommodation for the workmen at Canberra. Any senator who has visited the place will substantiate my statement that it is a disgrace to this Parliament and to the Department that the workmen employed there should be housed in the wretched habitations which they now occupy. The streets appear to have been laid out, but the houses themselves are built of rusty kerosene tins, pieces of corrugated iron, boards, old doors, sheets of oilcloth, and any other material that will help to keep out the wind and rain. </para>

                            <para>- Some little time ago. I have already referred to it in this chamber. That is why I speak of the neglect as continuous. There seems to be absolute indifference, if not hostility, on the part of the Minister to those employed at Canberra. The machinery in the power-house is well housed; the departmental officers are well housed; but the men who do the hard work of the place, with their wives and children, are treated unsatisfactorily. The present state of affairs should not be allowed to continue for a month. If it were a question of providing a dwelling for <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> or some other high official, the machinery of the Works Department would be set in motion without delay to build a decent habitation; but the workmen are completely neglected. A number of the single men are living in a wool-shed, where they are comfortable compared with the occupants of some of the detached dwellings. I might use a stronger term than indifference or neglect; but I hope that that may not be necessary, and that the Minister for Works, or the Minister for Home and Territories, whichever may be the responsible Minister, may give attention to the matter. Photographs contrasting the workers&#39; accommodation with that of the officers&#39; would be interesting. I draw attention also to the callous indifference of the Minister for Defence to the welfare of the operatives in the clothing trade in Sydney, and perhaps in other parts of the Commonwealth. Almost without warning, the instruction was issued a few days ago that no more cloth &#39;should be supplied to the contractors, with the result that about 1,000 persons, girls and young women, were suddenly thrown out of work. At the same time, returned convalescent soldiers are being clad in British-made suits. This retrenchment comes on top of the action of the New South Wales Government, which, by closing down a large number of works, has thrown at least 10,000 persons out of employment. I look upon this as part of the reward the electors of the Commonwealth are getting for the disappearance of the Labour Ministries in the Commonwealth and in the State of New South Wales. Of course, it will continue, but not with my consent or approval. </para>

                    <para>I have previously referred to the question of securing a reduction in the hours of labour, more particularly in the case of men employed in the building trade by the Works and Railways Department. The whole of the building trades in New </para>
                    <para class="block">South Wales are prepared bo effect an immediate reduction in the hours of labour to forty-four hours per week., but for some inscrutable reason the Minister for Works and Railways has refused to agree to the unanimous request of the council representing the whole of the building trades of the State, claiming that it is a matter for arbitration. I cannot understand his attitude. A reduction of hours would not interfere with the efficiency of the work done, or with the output of work per man employed; in fact, we might reasonably suppose that the output would be increased, with a consequentially better return for the money spent. There seems to be no reason for refusing the request. </para>

                            <para>- There is no difficulty in the way of carrying the scheme out. Keeping the rolls up to date is a most costly operation to the States and to the Commonwealth. I think that the Commonwealth ought to bring pressure to bear on the State authorities to settle the matter without delay. We hear continual talk of cutting out unnecessary waste, and if the&#34; States are genuine in these protestations they should fall into line with the scheme for the adoption of common rolls- </para>

                            <para>- To my mind, honorable senators do not talk nearly enough. Those who charge us with talking too much are the people who are themselves anxious to manufacture public opinion. It is just about time that members of Parliament, who are elected to represent the people of the country, should assert their right to manufacture public- opinion in the same way that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Huie,</inline> who edits the <inline font-style="italic">Standard,</inline> in Sydney, which advocates the policy of land values taxation, tries to manufacture public opinion in New South Wales. Other papers make most strenuous efforts to manufacture public opinion. Fortunately they are not held in very much regard, and it is a safe line to follow, if one desires to make progress, to go in the opposite direction to that advised by the newspapers. That remark holds good in regard to nearly all newspapers with the exception of the <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> and a number of ethers I need not mention. </para>

                            <para>- I could refer to them, but I tell the Minister candidly that I have no desire to elevate any party, even that to which I belong, to the position occupied by Ministers. When I look for information from the Government, the people whose duty it is to give it, the Leader of the Senate retorts&#39; that my party should make a statement. If he cannot see the difference between a party and a Government I can ; but I overlook his demand. I may say, however, that we publicly announced, in regard to the Fusion Government we were asked to join, that we had been informed that for six weeks continual squabbling had been in progress between those holding office and those desiring office as to how the portfolios should be divided, and that we thought it would only intensify the difficulties of the position if we came in. So we left it to themselves. </para>

The honorable senator will agree with me that it is not good to have a party discussing -week by week whether the National Government should consist of six Liberals and five Hughesites, or. whether seven Liberals or four Hughesites would sooner win the war. Possibly with eight Liberals and three Hughesites we shall have every chance of winning the war. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that I am doing so. We are dealing with the whole of the schedule, and are asked to vote one month&#39;s Supply, not for this Government, but possibly for another Government - which makes all the difference in the world. I hope that when I finish my remarks the Leader of the Senate will tell me whether he intends to carry on until the end of this month&#39;s Supply, or whether another Government is likely to spend the money. If the  Chairman  will permit me, I shall connect the schedule with my remarks. We find in it provision for. the Parliament, the Department of the Prime Minister, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of the Attorney-General, the Department of Home and Territories, the Department of Defence (Military), the Department of the Navy, the Department of Trade and Customs, the Department of Works and Railways, and the Department of the Postmaster-General. I am anxious to know whether the offices so excellently filled by my honorable friends opposite may to-morrow be filled by others. This raises the serious &#39;question of whether we should pass this Supply, or wait first to see who will administer the expenditure of the money we are asked to vote to-night. If the  Chairman  says that that cannot be discussed on this schedule, I must bow to his ruling; but I take it that as in the discussion of Supply we have the right to ask for the redress of grievances, such a ruling would be calculated only to prolong discussion on each item of the schedule. I have not the slightest desire to take such a course, but, on the contrary, I desire to help the Committee in the consideration of the Bill as much as possible. I was pointing out that by making way for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, the Minister for Works might be under the impression that that would help to win the war more quickly; but for the life of me I am unable to understand that the substitution of one. Minister for another, when the reason is claimed to be the establishment of a strong National Government, can help to win the war more quickly. I understand that various members of the present Government are likely to <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> by the board. I have heard that the Postmaster-General has himself said that it would be a calamity if he were removed from office for the next five years. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to have that assurance from the Assistant Minister. I had twelve months&#39; experience of office with the Assistant Minister and the Prime Minister, and I know, of course, that the Prime Minister always took us into his confidence, and told us everything he intended to do. I have little doubt that he is pursuing the same course at the present time. To get back to the question of the proposed strong National Government, why is all information concerning it withheld from Parliament? Is it because the heads of the Liberal party, in the interests of winning the war more quickly, are trying to squeeze a little&#39; more out of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in return for their support? I say that that kind of thing ought not to be allowed to continue. No Government should try to secure support and a majority by offering Ministerial positions to members of another party, or offering to allow some one else to accompany the Prime Minister to Great Britain. If the affairs of the country are to be properly conducted, the Government should bring down a straightforward policy  for the  consideration of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I think, sir, that I am taking that course, and if I had been permitted to continue my remarks I should probably not have taken up so much time as has been occupied through <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s interference.  If I  had to seriously consider <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> suggestion to wait until the Government submitted their policy, I might ask that the Government should wait for Supply. I do not wish to do that. I feel&#39; that at this stage I am quite justified in refusing  to  vote any one of the items of the schedule when the money may be spent by men to whom the Committee might not be prepared to intrust the expenditure of a single vote. </para>

                            <para>- So far as my following is concerned, evidence has already been given of our desire to assist the Government in that direction. I want, however, to say that my offer was contingent upon another proposal which the Government did not accept, and that was to skip the Friday sitting, and adjourn until , the Tuesday. I am not in any sense &#34; stone-walling,&#34; but if I cannot get in the few remarks which I wish to make, in discussing the schedule, I may be obliged to ask that the Estimates for the several Departments should be considered separately, or it may be necessary for me to move that Supply be granted for only a fortnight. The Government asking for this money are negotiating with another party under the pretence of the establishment of a National Government, and the whole difference between them is as to how many Liberals and how many Hughesites there should be in the new Ministry. </para>

I ruled that the schedule had no application to that question, and that the honorable senator, therefore, could not discuss the distribution of portfolios or the formation of a new Ministry which might, or might not, expend the sums provided for in the schedule. To that ruling <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has taken exception. </para>

                            <para>- On the motion for the first reading of any ordinary Bill, there is no discussion, but in respect of Supply Bills it &#39;has been the practice on such a motion to allow a general discussion of matters not relevant to-the Bill itself. This Bill, however, has passed both the first and second reading stages. The question of whether or not the Government should be intrusted with the expenditure of the amounts which it has asked Parliament to vote, might be pertinent, I. submit, .to the motion for the second reading of the Bill; but the, Senate, by passing the motion for the second reading, without even a division, has really agreed to the proposed vote. That being so-, we are now concerned only with the allocation of the sums provided for in the Bill amongst the several Departments. It is obvious that the discussion in Committee must be pertinent, and relevant to the one point as to whether or not the sums of money allocated amongst the several Departments should be so allocated ; whether they are sufficient or insufficient, and whether they will be properly expended or nob by the Government. The discussion, in order to conform to our practice and our Standing Orders, must be kept within those bounds. </para>

                            <para>- I have no desire to disregard either our practice or our Standing Orders. This Bill, however, provides for certain votes in respect of the Parliament, and the Departments of the Prime Minister, Treasury, the Attorney-General, Home and Territories, Defence (Military), the Navy, Trade and Customs, Works and Railways, and Postmaster-General. In the discussion in Committee, I was pointing out the difference between voting the Supply asked for to the Government at present in office, and voting it for a prospective Government to expend. The  Chairman,  on a point of order, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, ruled me out of order. Believing that the freedom of debate in this Committee is more important than any mere party advantage, I appealed to you for your ruling. </para>

                            <para>- There are two well-known principles of parliamentary procedure which have a distinct bearing on the point of order raised. The first of these is that before Supply is granted, every grievance must be heard, and that every honorable senator shall have the right to criticise the Government and the management of public affairs in any way he thinks fit. The second principle is that every discussion which takes place, either on the Bill when before the House on the second reading or on the items of the Bill when in Committee, must be relevant. The first principle I have enunciated as bearing on the question is complied with by the practice of the Senate in giving to every honorable senator on the motion for the first reading an unrestricted opportunity for speaking on any subject he thinks fit - hypothetical or otherwise, relevant or irrelevant - to the fullest possible extent that his fancy dictates. That opportunity was taken advantage of by many honorable senators when the Bill was before the Senate on the motion for the first reading. When the motion for the second reading <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> the Bill was called, a further opportunity was given for discussing its general principles. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> rose, however, the Bill had been taken into Committee, and the only question I have now to decide is whether a discussion on the. lines indicated by the  Chairman  as having been pursued by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is relevant to the subject-matter of the items in the schedule. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> unquestionably; would have been perfectly in order in criticising to the full either the present or any hypothetical Government had he chosen to do so on the motion for the first reading of the Bill. I am not prepared to say that he would have been out of order in doing so on the motion for the second reading. But the question is whether the honorable senator&#39;s remarks were relevant to the items in the schedule. Those items all concern the ordinary working of the various Government Departments, and it is unquestionable that any discussion regarding expenditure connected with each of these several items, provided it was confined to the expenditure of those items, would be in order. Any speculations that might be indulged in as to the Government which might be in office next week, next month, or six months hence, however, do not appear to me to be relevant to the particular items of expenditure in the schedule to this Supply Bill. If the salaries of. Ministers were included in any item in the schedule, something might be said for such a discussion. We know, however, that they are not. They, like the allowance to honorable senators, </para>

                        <para>. - We have recently had complaints about correspondence not being delivered to troops at the front. I do not know what explanation the Government have to offer in regard to this matter, but I was recently shown a letter from a soldier who was on his way to the front. He gave his regimental number, and all the information that he thought necessary to enable his friends to correspond with him. Yet everything was deleted in this letter except his name, and the letters A.I.F. That may. be a perfectly sufficient address. Whether it is or not I do not know. I am merely stating how his letter was treated by the censor.  His  people are now under the impression that they cannot correspond with their son, and are very much disappointed in consequence. Perhaps the Minister for Defence, in reply, will give us some information on this matter. </para>

                        <para>. - If honorable senators will take the trouble to read the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of this evening, they will there see a paragraph which we publish every week, in order to disseminate amongst the community the correct way in which to address soldiers abroad. Here is a sample - </para>

                    <para class="block">But what happens is that a number of soldiers, in writing to their friends, forward to them what they believe to be the correct address, but what, in nine cases out of ten, is not the correct address. They usually put in a lot of details which are not essential, and omit things which are essential. When honorable senators come across cases like that mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> I suggest that they should recommend to their friends the wisdom of cutting out the newspaper notices to which I have referred, and putting them aside for the purpose of reference. &#39;Not long ago we had a complaint from a woman to the effect that her letters to her son were going astray. We asked her to supply us with the full address to which she had been writing. She sent it along, and, although it covered the whole of the envelope, it was, nevertheless, the wrong address. We gave her the correct address. </para>

                            <para>- It appears that honorable senators are consumed with anxiety lest I should reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> and out of respect for their feelings I forbear criticising his statements in reference to myself on the present occasion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has accused me of being guilty of continuous neglect in failing to provide proper housing accommodation for the men who are employed at the Federal Capital. I wish to assure him that the Capital is not exactly under my control at the present time. The fact is that the Minister for Home and Territories and myself have decided to jointly control it until the report of the Commission which is now inquiring into certain matters connected therewith has been received. It will then be determined under whose control it shall remain in the future. In the meantime, I wish to point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has been a member of this Parliament for nearly three years. He has visited the Capital as a close scrutineer of public works, but it is only lately that he has discovered that the men employed there are being badly treated. When, therefore, he accuses me of being guilty of continuous neglect in this connexion, he convicts himself of the same offence. The fact is that the housing accommodation at the Capital is the same to-day as it was two years ago, or even at the time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> was elected to this  Chamber; but until about a fortnight ago he apparently visited the Capital wearing peculiarly coloured spectacles, and only then did he discover that something was wrong. Why he only recently made that discovery is for him to explain, as I have quite enough to do to explain my own actions. </para>

                            <para>- The housing accommodation at the Federal Capital is just as good and just as bad now as it has been in the past. In the present circumstances of this country, it is not too bad, and it exactly conforms to the economic policy that is being adopted in carrying out works there. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> would not have us go to the expense of erecting costly dwellings in a place from which they might eventually have to be removed? In view of the temporary nature of the work there, the men employed at the Capital must be prepared to submit to the same treatment as that to which those employed on other works are subjected - to no better, and no worse. They are living in the same class of housing accommodation as is provided for men who are employed in other places, north, south, east, and west. Why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> should have so lately discovered that something special ought to be done, I fail to understand. I say again that the character of the work has to be considered. At the present time an inquiry is being held whether certain works should be carried on or whether they should not, so that we now, if ever, are in a state of transition. The men there are housed, if not better, certainly no worse, than men in a similar position employed elsewhere. I myself have been on public work, and I know what housing accommodation means, so that I speak from experience. I may say that, as the Minister controlling the Department, I have not had a single complaint from these men about the housing; but it would appear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> like others of his party, are going around striving, in a foolishly misguided way, to sow the seeds of discontent in the minds of men by leading them to suppose that they are ill treated. In the absence of any complaints from the men, I advise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> to postpone his extraordinary solicitude until we hear something through the proper channel. </para>

                    <para>As to the forty-four-hour week, when I took charge of the Department I declared that I would adhere rigidly and firmly to the principle of arbitration. and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> thinks that he can succeed in inducing rae to get over, under, or around any arbitration award he will be disappointed. The door of the Arbitration Court is wide open, and if the men desire a shorter week they have a proper tribunal to which to apply. I am not a slavish advocate for either a forty-four-hour week or forty-, eight-hour week, though eight hours a day is a very good general arrangement. We know that for some classes of work eight hours a day is too short, while for other classes of work it is too long, as will be recognised by any one who knows anything about labour in its most irksome and arduous form. If the men do apply to the Arbitration Court, I believe that, in equity and good conscience, the Court will grant them fair hours of employment. As Minister, I am not going to interfere in any way, for, in the. first place, it would obviously be impossible for me to interfere, and, in the second place, I am wedded to the principle of arbitration. I feel that I am the best and truest champion of the workers in the attitude I take, though <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Grant</inline> professes to be their more ardent and staunch friend.- </para>

                            <para>- Judging by the report in to-day&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> at that meeting it was declared .that the cost of the works was mounting <inline font-style="italic">up,</inline> while it was admitted, though there- is a forty-four hour week, with high wages, there is not the degree of- efficiency we&#34; have- a right to expect. By some means or other, this meeting sought to blame some one else for the undesirable results. We are told on the one hand, inferentially, that the wages are too high, on the other the work is not accomplished satisfactorily. These wholesale statements about the condition of affairs up there ought not to be so unreservedly accepted; we have to be careful what we are doing. We cannot expect the Territory to make progress if we have these continuous demands. &#62; </para>

                            <para>- I realize that. All I desire is to call attention to the fact that the statements made at the meeting cannot be taken side by side. We must remodel our ideas if we desire to make the Northern Territory a progressive portion of the continent. I myself worked for y earl* in Northern Queensland, which is exactly similar country, and, therefore, I know what tropical Australia is like. In my opinion, it is a place where a man can do an honest day&#39;s work just as well as anywhere else ; and unless we desire to encourage an undesirable condition of affairs, we must reconsider our position. In regard to works under my control, the Department* is trying to hold the scales fairly between the taxpayers of Australia and the men who; in the Northern Territory, depend on their wages for a living. We shall give a fair wage, and in return shall expect a fair day&#39;s work. &#39; If we do not get that fair day&#39;s work, then on the heads df the workmen will recoil ? he responsibility for the stagnation in the development of the Territory. </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot allow the Minister&#39;s declaration of policy about the housing of the workmen to pass without question. When an honorable senator brings before us the fact that the Commonwealth &#39;employees are badly housed, the complaint is entitled to . fair consideration. I agree with the . Minister that, in the past, workmen have been badly housed; but the day is gone when men were satisfied with houses of ,rag and tin-cans. In a great work such as this, which will give employment for many years, the question of the housing of the men has for too long escaped attention. As to the Minister&#39;s attack on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> - for it is nothing less than an attack - I may say that that honorable senator did bring this matter before the Senate on a previous occasion. </para>

If the men are badly housed, then any reasonable man will agree that the housing should be improved; and we, as a Senate, ought to see that it is.

                            <para>- I would insist on that all the time; and the only way to get model service is to remove real grievances. If we desire to get good service, we must not treat men as though we felt they were &#34; out &#34; all. the time to &#34;best&#34; the. Commonwealth ; if they are treated in a straightforward, manly way they will give us a straightforward, manly return. Like the Minister, I have had experience of workmen, and my opinion is that men work according to habits they contract in their training, and. that it ia&#62; as difficult for a quick man to work slowly as for a slow man to work quickly. There ought to be no feeling displayed on the present&#34; occasion, because we know that the redress of grievances before Supply is one of our privileges. The Commonwealth at the Territory is undertaking an immense, work ; and it would be money well expended in building, not palaces, but good common-sense workmen&#39;s cottages, which, I am sure, would pay interest on the cost of construction. Nobody is asking that the men should be given these houses. At Jervis Bay the Government built 8 by 10 galvanized shanties, with cement floors. I ran my eye over the timber, and reckoned them to have cost about &#163;S each ; and yet the men were charged a weekly rental of 6s. Talk about sweating! In a Government Department which is*&#34; likely to carry out public works for many years to come, it is false economy to allow men, particularly in a rigorous climate, to exist in houses that are not well constructed. It makes all the difference in the world in their efficiency if they are comfortably housed, instead of having to battle with the elements all night. The Minister would do well to &#39;call for an inquiry into this matter, and to have snapshots of the buildings obtained. &#39; I merely rose to enter my protest against the unfair reception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> request by the Minister. </para>

                        <para>. - This matter is capable of an easy explanation. I understood from my colleague that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley&#39;s</inline> statement this afternoon was that a woman who was entitled to a separation allowance, and whose husband was at the front, had not received it, and that the paymaster had told him she was not entitled to receive it. Such a statement is not correct. When the separation allowance was instituted in the early stages of the war, it was made payable to the wife and family only while the husband was in the Commonwealth, on the ground that only then would the husband come home frequently and put the family to the expense of maintaining him. For some time, the separation allowance ceased when the soldier left the Commonwealth. We saw, however, that the regulation was not equitable, and that the home had still to be maintained, and the Government, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was a member, amended the regulation. </para>

                            <para>- That appears to have been a distinct injustice to those men. Whilst the men were in camp in Australia, even though they did not go to their homes, their wives were receiving that allowance. It does not seem that there would be anything wrong in the Government paying to these men the amount &#39; that should have been paid in separation allowances to their wives and children between the date they embarked for service abroad and the introduction of the new regulation on the 1st May, 1915.  I  am satisfied that not one member in either branch of this Legislature would raise  a  word of objection if the Government were to make that payment, but would regard it as an act of ordinary justice. </para>

                        <para>. - In the present polluted state of the political atmosphere, it does not seem that any useful purpose can be served by harrowing the dying Ministry, because, after all, any promise Ministers may make to-night will probably expire with their term of office. - But. there is a matter of immediate importance to which I should like to direct the attention of the Minister for Defence, and that is the closing down of the Clothing Factories in Melbourne, Sydney, and elsewhere, involving the dismissal of thousands of hands, principally women. It may be that there is an enormous surplus of clothing in the Commonwealth, and that the Government do not wish to be unnecessarily overstocked; but, on the other hand, it is evident that . there is a big shortage of .clothing and of  labour in England. .That being so, we ought to take advantage of our position to keep our hands employed, and&#34; send our surplus products overseas. I am in possession of information from the front that, when men are wounded and sent to the hospital, their own clothes are usually destroyed because they are bloodstained, or otherwise unfit for use. The Australian soldier prides himself on being well found, and I think the Commonwealth Defence authorities are fully entitled to credit in this respect, because our men are clothed better than any other soldiers in the world. We ought to maintain that superiority, and see that our men are properly uniformed at the hospitals, instead of being shabbily dressed as they say they are, or, as an alternative, being obliged to purchase some other clothing resembling the Australian uniform.  I  have here an extract from a letter which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on the 26th January from Private A. E. Dinger. It is as follows : - </para>

                        <para>Our boys are not receiving fair1 treatment in regard to uniforms. When we leave hospital we are given a suit of Tommy&#39;s uniform, which fits where it touches, the same as the English soldiers wear. If- our own uniform, that is, 1 the Australian issue, is required, we must- pay for it. It costs about  &#163;5  for  a  full suit of Australian issue. I .do not think that is fair to the men. Our old uniforms are usually torn and bloodstained (mine was) when we leave the trenches wounded, after having been in the field three months, and I think we are entitled to  a  new one. Our second uniform, which we brought from Australia with us was taken from us in Egypt. The people of Australia should buck against that. </para>

                    <para>Seeing that we have a great accumulation of uniforms in the military stores here, there is no good reason why we should not send some of them immediately overseas, to he available for our soldiers when required, and replenish the stocks here by re-engaging those thousands of women who have been put off in our factories during the last fortnight. A great deal of distress exist? both in Melbourne and Sydney in consequence of this action, and the position can be relieved in the manner I have indicated. Our soldiers in England have to pay for uniforms when they come out of the hospital, but they should be able to get those of Australian manufacture, with which they are well satisfied, free of charge. . There is no reason in the world why this reasonable request should not be complied with. I know there was a time when it could not be done, because we were then sending so many men away that it took the Government all their time to supply uniforms; but that pressure has been relieved, and for the future there should be no. difficulty whatever in supplying the requirements of all our reinforcements, and, in addition, sending a fair stock of uniforms to be held in- reserve in England, so that when our men are sent from the front to a hospital they may be supplied with a uniform of Australian manufacture free of charge. I feel sure that this matter has only to be mentioned to the Minister to be rectified, more particularly if by doing so the Government can relieve distress amongst thousands of people who are unemployed at present. </para>

                        (Western Australia -Minister for &#39; Defence) f 10. 5&#93; .-The matter raised by the honorable senator was mentioned earlier in the debate by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant.</inline>
                        It is not a fact that English- uniforms for service conditions are issued to the Australian soldiers. What&#39; has been done is this,: We have only one Australian hospital in England - the hospital at Harefield Park - so that when our soldiers are returned from the front &#39;wounded, many, of them are sent into British War Office hospitals, distributed all over Great Britain, and which are under the i control of the War Office authorities. We pay to the War Office so much per day for each Australian soldier, but we neither provision him, find him medical attention, nor supply him with a uniform when he comes out. That is all done by the British War Office authorities; and it is obvious that it would not be a wise policy on the part of the Commonwealth to have forty or fifty quartermasters for .those hospitals to supply uniforms to any half-dozen or dozen Australian soldiers who might be under treatment there. In such cases, therefore,, our men receive the English-made uniform, but on service they are almost wholly supplied with uniforms made in Australia. In cases where we  were deficient in one or two articles of clothing we appealed to the War Office to supply them; but that deficiency was not due to. any inability on our part to make uniforms. It was because we were not always able to send them overseas to arrive at the right time. Do honorable senators realize the nature of the shipping difficulty, and what it means ? We have been subject to that inconvenience, and so we have not always been able to get our supplies away in time. We have been building up huge stocks, not only in Australia, but in Great Britain also, so that to-day there is no necessity to turn out as large a number of uniforms as formerly, because we have built up our reserves.

We also informed the War Office we were able to turn out saddlery, and when that offer was turned down we  i  asked them to send it on to our Allies. </para>

I -want now to  remove  any misapprehension that may exist as to Commonwealth activities. The Commonwealth factory has not been curtailed in its operations, but is going full speed ahead. Some of the contractors, however, are not now getting the orders they previously secured, and I suppose they have been obliged to slacken off, but obviously it would not be wise for the Commonwealth to build up larger stocks of uniforms than are likely to be required. </para>

                            <para>- I will look into the matter, but I point out again that those men only had to look at their conditions of enlistment to see that they were not entitled to a separation &#39; allowance when they left Australia. That regulation was subsequently reviewed, and at a still later date the separation allowance was increased. It might, therefore, be argued that this increase should be carried right away back. I  can  only say that I will give consideration to the representations which the honorable senator has made; but if the men were under any misapprehension it was due to their ignorance of the conditions Under which they enlisted, and because they, did not give that attention to it which they might very well have done. </para>

I am aware of the fact that this work  wa3  begun when there was a dearth of employment in the Newcastle district in consequence of the coal trade having slacked off considerably, and that it was undertaken to provide employment, but there is still need for the same consideration, as about 200 men are out of employment iri that district. I ask whether the work undertaken at the outset has been completed, or whether the Government have abandoned the idea of develop ing the Naval Base at Port Stephens or not? </para>

They responded to the call of duty, they registered themselves for military service, but when they went back to their former positions at the end of their month&#39;s training they found the places had been jumped by  other men. We had an assurance from the Government that they would take steps to rectify this injustice, and I would like to know if anything has been done. </para>

                        <para>. -  Before the debate is closed I wish to reply briefly to one or two of the questions which have been raised. First, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> raised the question of mixing the old-age pension and the war pension. I shall not deal with .that matter specifically, but I  will bring it under the notice of the Treasurer, because a good deal of trouble can probably be avoided by means of administration. I am not in favour of making a mixture of two pensions to any one person. If it is a case of the war pension not being high enough, it is the duty of Parliament to increase the amount to those persons who have rendered service to the country. I am opposed in principle to the payment to any person of two pensions. If one pension is not sufficiently high, it is to the discredit of Australia, and Parliament ought to take the responsibility of increasing it. If it is a case of the old-age pension, the amount is based on the fact that a certain income is being earned. Personally I have not been in sympathy with that restriction, but the finances of the country have always prevented an extension of the pension to those in receipt of more than a certain income. In my opinion the question would be better dealt with by increasing whichever pension is insufficient to meet the requirements or necessities of the individual concerned rather than by mixing two pensions to one individual. </para>

                            <para>- The getting away of the wool clip is a big job. Probably no bigger commercial undertaking has ever been entered upon in Australia in the limited time at our disposal, and worse than all, with the limited number of ships which are controlled by the British Government. One of their requests to Australia is to save as much space as possible. We have been saving hundreds of thousands of miles of sailing by not sending any ships to more than one port if we could possibly get a full loading at one port. It is remarkable how many new ports for the shipment of wool people want to establish as soon as the Government take over this business in Australia. This request is not confined to Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- It applies all round Australia. The point is whether it would be an advantage to send a boat to Geraldton, or whether it would be more advantageous to utilize some of the coastal boats to bring the wool to Fremantle. As regards the handling and the classification of the wool, which I may say is divided into 312 classes, and the question of shipping, the best advice we can obtain in Australia is that it is better to concentrate the whole of the wool of Western Australia at Fremantle. That policy has been carried out, and considerable objection has been raised there. The Committee advised the Prime Minister against taking the wool from. Geraldton direct to the Old Country. I have received numerous complaints in writing from representatives of Western Australia, and the Prime Minister has promised definitely a further inquiry into the advisability of using Geraldton as a direct port of shipment for wool. I expect to receive an answer within at . least a couple of days, and will be pleased to let <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> have a copy of the report which is submitted to the Prime Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> brought up the question of the pensions paid to the blind. I do not think that the treatment of the blind is a party matter. I believe it is the desire of every person in Australia who has a heart that blind persons should suffer ho disadvantage. I have never been very favorable to the charitable institutions employing cripples, but at the same time I believe that, under the system which preceded the grant of pensions, those institutions did the best they could in all the circumstances, and probably in many cases kept the old people from poverty and starvation. But to-day, with the newer conception of life, I am inclined to think that there is a good deal of force in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> said. I feel sure that every member of the Senate is in sympathy with his suggestion, if it can be managed financially. That also I will bring under the notice of the Treasurer, and see that consideration is given to it. </para>

                            <para>- I would like to include them all. If I could have my way there would not be any conditions imposed in regard to the payment of pensions, except as regards age. In reference to the question of the Northern Territory, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> brought up, the re-appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> is now  under the consideration of the Cabinet. I am not able to anticipate its decision, but. the matter will be dealt with at a very early date. &#39; Regarding the question of uniform rolls, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> was so keen about, I may say that whatever fate the future may bring, the Electoral Office is now in possession of a unanimous recommendation by the whole of the States in favour of .uniform rolls and cooperation. A decision at these Conferences has not been recorded .a dozen times, but once only. That decision was unanimous, and I am glad to say that a Bill has been prepared, and is now in the Electoral Office waiting to be introduced whenever Parliament gets an opportunity to deal with it, which I hope will be very soon. I do not think that I have opened up any new ground.&#39; I have endeavoured to briefly answer most of the questions which have been raised, and if I have overlooked any matters, I can assure honorable senators that no discourtesy was intended. </para>

                        <para>.- I thank the Assistant Minister for the reply he gave regarding the matter of the wool clip. . So far as the question of the war pension and the old-age pension is concerned, I am not at all satisfied with the reply. The honorable senator informed the Committee that he will bring the matter under the notice of th~e Treasurer. In view of the fact that the Leader of the Senate assured me when the War Pensions Bill was being debated that, should it be found to conflict with the Old-age Pensions Act, the Government would bring down an amendment, I think it is a matter for the Cabinet itself to determine, and not for a particular Minister to deal with. I did hope-that the Assistant Minister would have made a statement of that nature rather than tell us .that he would refer the matter to a particular Minister. Now the Treasurer may consider that, owing to the scarcity of money, it may not be wise to give the two pensions, but I think that the good sense of this Parliament is behind my request, and the promise of the Minister of Defence that the Government would bring down an amending measure. </para>

                            <para>- I repeat that in the statement I referred to the Minister for Defence made the promise that if such a thing occurred an amending Bill would be brought down. I hold the honorable senator to that promise, and contend that it is the duty of the Government to see that the two pensions are separated. Both are earned in a certain way. A claimant for an old-age pension is entitled to the pension by virtue of citizenship, and the fulfilment of certain conditions, .while a claimant for a war pension is entitled to the pension for other reason&#39;s. This is not a question for the Treasurer, but a question for the Cabinet to consider. </para>

I desire to move a request for a reduction of each item by a percentage as it comes along, but it will be very difficult to do that if the schedule is put as a whole. Suppose, for instance, that I want to move that the item for contingencies for the Senate be reduced by &#163;50, and later, that the item for contingencies for the House of Representatives be reduced by &#163;70, how can I get an opportunity to move the two requests unless the items are put separately ? </para>

                    <para>. - Earlier in the evening, I was ruled out of order by the  Chairman  of Committees, when desirous of making certain remarks; I hope that what I wish to say now may not be considered out of order. No doubt, on the motion for the first reading of the Supply Bill, I had an opportunity similar to that which now presents itself to deal freely with matters affecting the public weal&#39;, but I did not avail myself of it. What I was trying to say earlier in the evening was that the Win-the-war party had been discussing for more than six weeks whether the war could be won by forming a Coalition&#39; Ministry consisting of six Ministerialists and five Liberals or a Ministry consisting of six Liberals and five Ministerialists. The party is further divided, some believing that success for the Allies and a victory for civilization can best be achieved by choosing four salaried Ministers from the Ministerial side, and the same number from the Liberal side, making two other Ministerialists and one Liberal Ministers without portfolio. I believe that there are more than twenty aspirants for office in the Liberal party. The I.W.W._ sympathizers have been charged with &#34; going slow,&#34;&#39; but they are nothing to the Win-the-war party, which in eight weeks, has achieved nothing. There was a meeting at 8 o&#39;clock this evening, and a few. minutes ago the party was divided into factions. There were the Cook faction, the <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest faction, and the I.W.W. - that is, the I, William Watt - faction; and they have been quarrelling among themselves as to the method by which the number of seats in Cabinet allotted by the Ministerial party shall be filled. Some wish to follow the old method of leaving the selection to the leader of the business. The managers of the of the business. The managers oi business, apparently, have not conducted things in the way some men in the room, who call themselves business men, approve of. To proceed on the old lines, though it would be unbusiness-like  in the view of some, would speedily enable them to come  to terms  ; but there are some members of the party who want the team to be selected by ballot, and because there is strong opposition to the suggestion to make a selection by ballot, two or three gentlemen who represent constituencies in the State of Victoria are putting up the fight, of their lives. I do not know when they will finish their job, but when it is finished the Ministry will be constituted, and, if I am correctly informed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> will lose ho time in leaving the shores of Australia in order to be present at the Imperial Conference. . It is not that two gentlemen are required to represent Australia at the Conference. The difficulty is that the Liberal party are very watchful, and a bit suspicious about the other chap, and these managers think it good business that one of their representatives should be present at the table where the deliberations will take place in order to watch the other fellow, and that during the absence of their leader things must be watched here. These gentlemen are all for winning the war! No one would say that they are concerned about their own  elevation, or about the next elections ! These matters would be about the last to concern them. They are not concerned .about, portfolios. Not at all ! That is why they are still at their meeting. They are not concerned about the next elections. No ! That is why they are so seriously engaged to-night in devising ways and means whereby <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKissock, Senator Blakey</inline> and I may be sent to the right-about at the next election. I do not know whether you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> know* what their scheme is; but it is reported that the proposals before these gentlemen to-night have been considered and decided upon by the Ministerial party, of which you are a member. They say they are concerned, nob about the next election, but about winning the war. They also have due regard for. economy, and on that account one of their proposals, which will meet with the unanimous approbation of every man who is anxious to see proper economy in Australia, is to have a single election for the Senate! It will cost about &#163;.100,000; but a matter of &#163;100,000 is a mere bagatelle to the formation of a new Government that is going to win the war and save the Allies and civilization from ruin and disaster. The present Ministers came into office with a war policy, and it is an admission of their weakness and inability to do anything when they say that they are unable to do what they came into office to do except with the assistance of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, the so-called Emperor of the West ; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen, Mr. Glynn,</inline> and a few others who are not yet fixed. With the assistance of these gentlemen, the war will be won - I am talking about the European war - but in order to win it they say that it will be necessary to engage in a political war in Australia within a few months. They are hopeful that, with the candidates they will put forward, they will be able to win additional seats in the Senate, and part of the scheme outlined - so the man in the street has told me - is that if they happen to dish my two colleagues and myself in Victoria, and can pick up a seat in another State, they will have won their war ! They will have captured this Chamber, and in order, not to win the war, but to save their political skins, and hold on to the sweets of office, they will appeal to the Imperial Parliament fox an extension of the life of the House of Representatives. It is a&#39; scandalous proposal to have a single election. The people of Australia will express themselves in no uncertain way in respect to a proposition, not for winning the war, but for capturing the Senate in order to save the skins of. the gentlemen now on the Ministerial bench, and those who are in consultation with, them, by prolonging their parliamentary life. While  these negotiations are being carried on, all domestic legislation in Australia has been shamefully neglected, with the result that there has been a partial stoppage of works undertaken by the Commonwealth in the different States. It would seem to be part and parcel of the scheme. </para>

                        <para>- I believe this is a part of a well-laid scheme to bring about economic conscription. Municipal authorities and State Governments are stopping works, and the Commonwealth Government is following the example, with the result that in Victoria at the present time the condition of affairs in the building trade, not to speak of other trades, is worse than it has been at any other time during the last three decades. There are between 1,400 and 1,500 carpenters alone out of employment within the Melbourne metropolitan area, and hundreds of workmen in other spheres of activity are also out of employment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and the Minister for Defence may laugh, but I ask them how they would like it if they were following their old occupations in the mine and at the carpenter&#39;s bench, and found themselves out of work, as some unfortunate men outside have been for the last seven or eight weeks, and in some cases for three or four months. </para>

                        <para>- I expect that I shall be able to get a crust if I am put out of my job, as the honorable senator was, I have no doubt, when he was thrown out of his employment. I was never more serious than I am now when discussing this topic. It is heart-rending to any man in the Labour movement to be able to do nothing for excellent citizens and highly competent workmen, who appeal to him day after day, to try to get some work for them. What are the Government going to do ? Are they going to stand idly by and see the army of unemployed increase day by day, not by-hundreds, but it may be in a short space .of time by thousands. Any man who would treat- this matter light-heartedly must be destitute&#39; of any feeling at all. I will guarantee that in Victoria - and I speak particularly of, the metropolitan area. - there is an army of from 5,000 to 10,000 competent men seeking employment to-day, and unable to get it. If the so-called policy of economy is continued by the present Government, the misery at present existing amongst the working classes must continue and increase. I make a special appeal to the Government, if they remain in power, .to do something on behalf of the army of unemployed. Many, of the men unemployed in the building trade have sons and relatives at the front, and many of them have lost sons and relatives in the war. It is a poor recognition of the services of the sons and relatives of these men that those whom they have left behind them should receive no consideration when they are out of employment. .It is all very well for the Government to say that they have not stopped Commonwealth works, but some time ago, in delivering a financial statement in another place, the &#39;present Treasurer said that he expected to make a saving .of &#163;740,000 this year by not proceeding with works which it was previously intended should be proceeded with. </para>

If the world has not moved any faster than that the Labour movement does not count for much. In years gone by, as the honorable senator knows, shearers had to live in huts that were unfit for human habitation, and yet &#39;he tried to convey in the speech he made to-night that what was good enough for them in his day, twenty-five years ago, ought to be good enough for them to-day. He said further that an eight-hours day is too short. That is a nice statement for a Labour man to make. It is a nice statement from a man who accuses me of talking &#34; flapdoodle.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The unemployed question is the question of all questions. If it is solved every other question is of minor importance. The present Government and people generally profess to be extremely anxious about the men who are returning to Australia from the front. I speak with some .knowledge of the subject, as a member of the State War Council of Victoria, when I say that men are returning to Australia by every boat, and are being discharged by the Defence Department from time to time. Although there is a desire on the part of most people to find employment for the re named discharged soldiers, it is impossible to find employment even for all of them, whilst the difficulty of finding employment for civilians is very much greater. What should the Government do? Should they wait until the war is over to strike out in a new direction ? Should they not rather proceed here and now to provide for such works as will not only give employment to the men who are out of work at the present time, but will insure the reemployment of all the men who return to Australia after the war is over? That is what ought to be done here and . now. The Government say that the difficulty in the way &#34;is that of getting money, but I contend that they would find little difficulty in financing big propositions, if they went about the business in a whole-hearted way. During the discussion of the Supply Bill We had speeches from two or three honorable senators who referred to the Northern Territory. I have never wavered in the&#39; opinion I have expressed with regard to the possibilities of that extensive Territory of the Commonwealth. There is a golden opportunity for the Government to go in for big works in that area. Why did we take over the Territory ? Was it to look at it and play with it ? During the whole of the time we have had control of the Northern Territory we have done little or nothing with it. It is about time we made up our minds to do something with it, and we can only do that by undertaking big things. When we speak of developing the Northern Territory we must talk, not of hundreds or of thousands of pounds, but of millions. </para>

I was not prepared to agree to give the Government something in the nature- of a blank cheque. v&#34; Again, it was due to our party that Ministers, before asking for the third reading of the Supply Bill, should have stated whether any definite arrangement had been arrived at with the Liberal party. </para>

The Supply Bill is still before the Senate, and he must not anticipate discussion upon it. </para>

                    <para>- I observe the wisdom of your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and I shall deal now with the political situation. Any party .presuming to rule the destinies of Australia should take the Parliament into its confidence with regard to what is transpiring. Towards the end of the discussion to-night there was quite a jubilant, if not an arrogant, note sounded by some of our honorable friends opposite. That was not the correct attitude for them to adopt, considering the position of the political machine from a governmental stand-point. Parliament should have the last word on the very important matters involved, and should know what is being done. Had we agreed to the third reading of a certain measure to-night we should not have had any information as to the political situation, seeing that the Liberal junta is still sitting. </para>

                        <para>- I was rather inclined to think that if any one was to accompany <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to London it would be <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> That honorable senator is rather anxious about the matter.  His  seat as a representative of New South Wales is somewhat in jeopardy, but if he accompanies the Prime Minister to London the sentimental aspect may be strongly in his- favour. With the sneers of the Minister for Works to-night in regard to those who are advocating the eight hours&#39; principle, I have no sympathy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> said that eight hours a day was too much -in some occupations, and not long enough in others. He did not reply to an inquiry that I made by way of interjection as to whether he would name a few of those occupations in which eight hours&#39; work per day was not enough. Most honorable senators, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> have worked hard for very many years in various occupations, -and are familiar with the varied experiences of those who follow what might be called&#39; a varied life in Australia. At any rate, I have never struck an occupation in which eight hours a day was not sufficient, no matter how light the work may have been. The Minister for Works and Railways may sneer, but even in such a light occupation as harrowing, if a man works honestly, at the end of eight hours he will have had enough. In preaching against ten and twelve hours a day being worked in the cane-fields of Queensland, we always adopted the attitude that if a man did not accomplish a fair day&#39;s work in eight hours he would not accomplish it in twelve. Instead, of indulging in generalities, the. Minister should have enumerated a few of the avocations in which eight hours labour daily is not sufficient. </para>

                        <para>- And <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Lynch is crawling after Joe Cook and John Forrest. When the honorable senator and those with whom he is associated find themselves in an extremity, they endeavour to vent their spleen on their erstwhile supporters - on the men who formed the ladder upon which they have climbed to success.. I object to the Prime Minister leaving Australia without instructions from this Parliament, because very important questions will doubtless be considered at the Imperial War Conference. One of these -questions was mentioned in the newspapers this morning. It was there stated that the disposition &#39; of Australian trade and products may come up for consideration at that gathering, and I notice that at a farmers&#39; conference at Wangaratta, a resolution was carried affirming that its members would not consent to the sale of their produce unless they had direct representation on the Wheat Board, or were able to give instructions to the Australian delegate who would attend the Imperial Conference. That is to say, they would not sell their produce even to the&#39; Imperial Government in the same way as the wool clip has been sold. I do not go &#39;that far, but, I hold that, upon such questions as the cession or exchange of territory, for example, the voice of Australia should be heard. Only the other day, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward, speaking at the &#34; Windy &#34; Club, I think, said that Australia and New Zealand would never let go their hold upon the islands which they have conquered from Germany. In all probability, the Australian representative at the Imperial Conference will have to answer for Australia upon that question. It is a&#39; question upon which there is a great divergence of opinion, and, therefore, our representative should not commit Australia to any specific course of action until his views have been indorsed by this Parliament: Need I remind honorable senators that France, one of our Allies, which is often extolled by us, has a law in operation under which no territory can be ceded, exchanged, or acquired without the sanction or ratification of Parliament. Are we going to give a free hand to our delegate to make bargains on behalf of Australia, whether he be <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes, Mr. Tudor, Mr. Fisher,</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> ? </para>

Another ( reason  why  we should have a clear pronouncement from the Government is that we desire a definite statement regarding the Tariff. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> sneers at those who gave him his first step in life - at the workers who paved the road which he has since travelled - he should advance some reason for his action, and not be content to say, airily, that the hours worked in some occupations are too short and the wages are too high. I do not believe that the wages are too high in any occupation, and I do believe that eight hours a day is quite long enough for any man to work. </para>

He said that &#34;he was a disciple of arbitration, and that into the Arbitration Court he would go. I wish to tell him that, since the works , at the Federal Capital were commenced, no Government has yet paid the men employed on them the wages awarded by the New South Wales Arbitration Court. I desire to see those wages paid in the future. I refer to the wages and conditions of sewer miners; and, as I say, no Government has yet paid to them the wages fixed in the Arbitration Court award. I have been doing my best in the matter; and although Ministers have come and gone, some of them&#39; with a great flourish of trumpets and promises, never have I been able to get more than&#34; the stereotyped reply, which, though signed by them, I do not think they have read. I hope that the Government will see that the arbitration awards are carried out in their entirety. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to again call the attention of the Government to the supply of wheat to Tasmania for milling, purposes. This is a matter I made the subject of a question this afternoon, and also on two days last week ; and I do not know that the Government really appreciate the gravity of the situation. The position amounts almost to a bread crisis - a breakfast table crisis. I tried yesterday to get into communication with one of the Ministers, who was otherwise engaged; but I. think that an urgent telegram that I received from the Premier of Tasmania on Saturday will disclose the seriousness of the position. That telegram has since been followed by another urging that joint action should be taken by the senators representing Tasmania. As honorable senators know, however, Tasmanian senators who go home at the week-end cannot return to Melbourne until the Wednesday, so that to-day we are not in our full strength. The telegram I received on Saturday from the Premier of Tasmania was as follows: - </para>

                <para>Following telegram addressed Prime Minister yesterday, begins, Wire received. Regret decision of Wheat Board. Position this State now is Ils. Must close next week some relief not given. </para>

                <para>Deputation mill employees waited on me this morning, urging something be done prevent unemployment. My Government realize seriousness of situation, but cannot accept responsibility. Federal Wheat Board control wheat supplies, and have fixed price for same at rates which will not allow flour to be manufactured and sold here at proclamation rates. State is now faced with shortage of flour supplies. </para>
                <para class="block">That, I take it, is the conclusion of the telegram to the Prime Minister from the Premier of Tasmania, and the latter then goes on to say - </para>
                <para>Must respectfully urge you take steps to safeguard interests this State, and integral part of Commonwealth. Kindly confer with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Elliott</inline> Lewis. Address, Menzies&#39; Hotel, Monday. </para>
                <para class="block">So far as I understand the matter, the&#39; wheat produced in Tasmania is not by itself usable for milling purposes for the, making of bread, and it must be mixed with a large proportion of the harder wheat from the other States, such as South Australia. In Tasmania there are splendid crops of wheat, averaging, I think, 19 bushels to the acre, as against 9 or 10 bushels in South Australia; but, while the Tasmanian wheat may be used for biscuits, fowls&#39; food, and other purposes, it is not good for milling. Tasmania is an importing State so far as wheat is concerned. I understand that wheat is supplied at Williamstown at 4s. 9d. f.o.b., and the non-producing States have to buy at that figure, and, in addition, pay freight and transport. The result is that by the time the wheat gets to Tasmania, instead of being 4s. 9d., it is something like 5s. 9d., or, at least, 5s. 3d. At the latter price this means 6d. on the 4s. 9d., or 11 per cent, more than the cost to the millers in Victoria. The result is that the Victorian millers can dump into Tasmania just as they please. At this late hour I do not wish to press the argument at. any length, but merely mention the matter in order that the Government may take it into their serious and immediate consideration. As I say, the Victorian millers can dump in what they want; and if the figure be &#163;11 10s., or the proclamation price for the selling of flour, that means about &#163;1 less than in Tasmania ; but once they capture the market the Tasmanian people do not know where they are. Now that representations have been made by the Premier of Tasmania to the Prime Minister, this matter ought to be looked into, for it is one not raised in the&#39; last few days, but one in connexion with which I have been in communication with the Department -since before April of last year. </para>

There is a complete lack of flexibility in the matter. It is stated on the highest authority - that of the Premier of Tasmania. - that the Tasmanian milling industry will come to an end if a greater element of flexibility is not introduced into the working of the Wheat Board, so far as its operations extend to Tasmania. I take it that the Wheat Board was constituted under a war power, and that the fixing of the price of flour is under a similar authority. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to express my disappointment with the condition of affairs in Tasmania in regard to the supply of  breadstuffs.  I realize that a State of the Commonwealth so close to the other wheat-producing States ought not to be penalized to any extent. A declaration was made that the price of wheat throughout the Commonwealth should be, approximately, the London parity, less the freight; and why Tasmania should be penalized to the smallest&#39; extent I am at a loss to know. I am fairly well occupied with the work of my own Department without being called upon to understand the working of. the Wheat. Board, but I promise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> that I will bring this matter before my colleagues immediately, with a view to a readjustment to meet the interests of the people of Tasmania. I cannot see why Tasmania should be penalized any more than the northern parts of Queensland and Western Australia. </para>

                    expressed an almost nervous desire to have something done to relieve the unemployment in Melbourne. There is no justification for the honorable senator addressing those remarks to the Government in such a way as to, suggest that we are not doing as much as we might do. As I interjected, the Government are straining every, nerve to provide all the work possible, particularly in the metropolitan areas, in order to absorb the men who are unfortunately out of employment. I have written to the  chairman  of the Public Works Committee, asking him to get that body to inquire with all expedition into the works referred to it, with a view to absorbing upon them as much artisan labour as possible. I have also addressed to the officers in charge of the transcontinental railway construction at Port Augusta an inquiry as to what openings there are. for carpenters.- . The reply I have received is that the Departs ment is fully staffed there, and that there will be ,no immediate openings. I&#39; further endeavoured to have put in hand at once&#62; the work of shifting certain buildings and equipment from Williamstown to the Flinders Naval Base ; but I found that the Naval authorities had not yet decided upon the shifting of those buildings. I would remind honorable senators that it is not the desire of the Government to curtail employment to the extent of the saving of a single sovereign. fI never knew a Government, whether Liberal or Labour, that would not, to the extent of its power, relieve distress when confronted with it; and I resent any suggestion that the present Government are wanting in sympathy v with those who are out of work. It must be patent that the question of providing employment is one of finance. There are developmental works in the inland areas that should be proceeded with if possible; but, in connexion with railway building, for instance, we find that we can get enough rails to finish the transcontinental railway only by the application of special strategy to the contracting company. We have endeavoured to provide as much employment as possible along that railway. The Senate must be aware that, even when
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs</inline>
                    was Treasurer, altheugh certain works had been approved by Parliament, it was found impossible to expend within &#163;900,000 of the amount autherized. I did not hear any particular complaint urged then about -the action of the Government in not pushing on with public works. I do not know, whether unemployment was&#39; rife then or not, but the fact remains that Parliament had said, &#34;Let this much money be spent,&#34; but owing to the fact that the Government could not get the money the expenditure was &#163;900,000 short of the authorization. The same conditions and. causes are in operation today, and in view of the circumstances X hope senators will realize that we do not possess the philosopher&#39;s stone with which to turn will into gold. We asked the people to lend us money, and we received a fair response; but I do not know whether the advocacy of some gentlemen in this Chamber that no interest at all should be paid did not have an effect upon those who. have surplus money to invest. The honorable senators who adopted that attitude must accept their share of the blame if the- Government cannot got money enough for its requirements. It is no pleasure to the Government to defer the putting in hand of public works, or for me to have men clamouring every day for employment which 1 am unable to give. The present situation is most unfortunate, but we are doing our level best to carry out all works authorized by Parliament to the extent of the money at our disposal. No more than the Government have done, and are doing, can be done at the present juncture. Of course if we can get more money, and honorable senators will assist us in that regard, it is hard to say at what rate of speed we shall proceed with&#39; the carrying out of works in the future. But for the time being, it is useless to promise to do more, when we cannot get the money. The Government are the victim of the abnormal circumstances which obtain to-day.
