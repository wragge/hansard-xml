# Commonwealth of Australia Hansard

These are Hansard XML files downloaded from the [Parliament of Australia website](http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/summary/summary.w3p;adv%3Dyes;orderBy%3D_fragment_number,doc_date-rev;query%3DDataset%3Ahansardr,hansardr80;resCount%3DDefault) by [Tim Sherratt](http://timsherratt.org). The original harvest was run in 2016. A complete reharvest was undertaken in April 2019. Some of the file names have changed between harvests.

The files are made available on the Parliament website under a [CC-BY-NC-ND licence](http://www.aph.gov.au/Help/Disclaimer_Privacy_Copyright#c).

Currently this repository includes files for the House of Representatives and the Senate from 1901 to 1980. The Hansard file format changes after 1980.

Browse the files or [download a zip file](https://github.com/wragge/hansard-xml/archive/master.zip) of the lot (it's big). For convenience there's also individual zip files for each year.
