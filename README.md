# Commonwealth of Australia Hansard

These are Hansard XML files downloaded from the [Parliament of Australia website](http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/summary/summary.w3p;adv%3Dyes;orderBy%3D_fragment_number,doc_date-rev;query%3DDataset%3Ahansardr,hansardr80;resCount%3DDefault) by [Tim Sherratt](http://timsherratt.org).

## Harvesting history

- The original harvest was run in 2016.
- A complete reharvest was undertaken in April 2019
- A harvest of 1998 to 2005 was added in 2020. 
- A reharvest of 1998 to 2005 was run in August 2023.
- A reharvest of 1901 to 19080 was run in May 2024.

Note that some file names change between harvests and some files are split or added.

The files are made available on the Parliament website under a [CC-BY-NC-ND licence](http://www.aph.gov.au/Help/Disclaimer_Privacy_Copyright#c).

Currently this repository includes files for the House of Representatives and the Senate from 1901 to 1980 and 1998 to 2005. No XML files are currently available for 1981 to 1997. Open Australia provides access to [Hansard XML files from 2006 onwards](http://data.openaustralia.org.au/).

## May 2024 note

A reharvest of 1901 to 1980 was run in May 2024. Most if not all of the file names seem to have changed with version flags now added, eg `_v4`. Unfortunately the new versioned urls don't redirect to the old forms. The addition of the version flags seem to indicate that corrections and improvements are being made to the xml. I've noticed, for example, some changes to the internal xml structure of files, as well as standardisation of things like quotation marks. This process seems to be ongoing ­– some urls changed as I was in the process of harvesting them! This means that this repository might not reflect the current state of Hansard, but I'll try to reharvest at more regular intervals from now on to pick up these sorts of changes.
