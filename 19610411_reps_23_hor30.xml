I am quoting from the finding made by that organization. </para>

              <para>-  It is their statement. Is it not beyond doubt that this general depres sion is the result of measures adopted by the Government to reduce only sections of the economy such as imports and commercial building? In view of this, has the Government considered the. use of economic measures which will restrict only those sections that the Government wants to restrict and not the economy as a whole? </para>

            <para>- The honorable gentleman has. used the term &#34; depression &#34; as descriptive of the current economic situation. I know that the word &#34; depression &#34; has a very sensitive significance for honorable gentlemen opposite, but how anybody whose party was in office in a period during which unemployment rose to 30 per cent. can describe less than 2 per cent of registered unemployment as a &#34; depression &#34; I cannot understand. Such a description would, I believe, offend the understanding of most realistic observers. The situation inside. Australia, while representing a decline from. the. peak activity towards the. end of last year, would still be regarded, by most countries of the world as one of continuing, steady prosperity. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is true that some adjustments, which have been uncomfortable and painful in certain sections of the economy, have been a necessary consequence of the measures adopted by the Government. But I believe that most observers, looking around Australia at this time, will have come to the conclusion that, in view of measures taken to prevent a boom from developing into a bust, the situation is remarkable, not for how much hardship has occurred, but for how little dislocation has been experienced. There is undoubtedly a very much healthier basis to the whole economy at the present time. The Government is not merely watching the position closely, but is taking whatever measures seem to be appropriate to ensure that our progress is steady and well sustained. </para>

            <para>- The housing situation has been thoroughly studied by representatives of the Reserve Bank of Australia in consultation with the Treasury. There have also been appropriate consultations between Commonwealth departments. In addition, there have been contacts between the Commonwealth Government and representatives of the State governments concerning the over-all housing situation in each State. As a result of these discussions there is to be, as I understand it, in Victoria and in other States, an increase in the level of lending for housing purposes by the savings banks, including State savings institutions and the Commonwealth Savings Bank. In addition, the Governor of the Reserve Bank has communicated some views to the trading banks on the question of housing. The trading banks have I believe, honoured very faithfully the terms of the directive conveyed to them towards the end of last year. The result of their observance of this directive has been revealed in their advances figures, but they have been reminded that included in the general directive was an intimation that lending for a social purpose such as housing should not be curtailed, and that, within the limits of their resources, lending for housing should now be increased. </para>

Is it a fact that the company responsible for the construction of the Chevron Hilton Hotel in Sydney was in grave financial difficulties recently and that it owed &#163;600.000 to various contractors and sub-contractors? If this was so, is it a fact that special action was taken by the Reserve Bank of Australia or the Government, or by somebody in authority in the Commonwealth Trading Bank or in some other bank, to make credit available to this organization so that it could pay its debts? If this is a fact, what qualifications did the claimant company have that are not possessed by lots of little people throughout Australia who need financial assistance to help them out of their financial difficulties in these days of the credit squeeze? </para>

In respect of the particular matter to which he refers, the Commonwealth Government has neither given direction nor made any intervention. So far as I am concerned, the relationship of banker and client between the organization in question and whatever bank or banks it may be dealing with is a matter of the company&#39;s own private concern and I have not sought to interest myself in it. </para>

Is it a fact that certain graziers are voluntarily proposing to make some contribution towards this campaign pending the adoption of a more comprehensivescheme? Can the right honorable gentleman give an assurance that the amounts subscribed in making such a contribution will be deductible for income tax purposes? Finally, does the Government takethe view that this promotional campaign is vitally important to the increasing of Australia&#39;s export returns? </para>

            <para>- It is a fact that some activity of the kind referred to by the honorable gentleman is occurring in the ranks of the graziers. I do not know how extensive or representative it is. Last week, in Melbourne, I received a group of representatives of grazing interests who told me of this campaign and intimated&#39; to me that there would be very good support for it and that quite substantial funds would&#39; be forthcoming for use by the appropriate instrumentality for the promotion of the sale of wool. I was asked specifically whether I would examine the question of whether voluntary payments of this kind, provided that they were directed towards promotional or research purposes, would be deductible in the assessment of the income tax payable by the donors. I havesince discussed this matter with the Commissioner of Taxation and have conveyed to those who saw me a ruling to the effect that payments of this kind would be deductible. I hope that this will prove some practicable encouragement to greater promotional efforts of the kind that these people have in mind. </para>

            <para>-  I direct a question to the Treasurer. Did the right honorable gentleman recently announce that the intake of migrants into Australia would be increased . from 115,000 to 125,000 a year? Does this mean that Victoria will be expected to absorb more migrants than previously? If this is so, will the Minister take the necessary action to ensure that the serious unemployment situation which exists in Victoria at present will not be further aggravated by any increase of the intake of migrants into that State? </para>

              <para>-  I have just said that the announcement was made in 1959. I was correcting a misunderstanding on the part of some honorable gentlemen opposite by reminding them that the announcement of the Government&#39;s decision had been made at that time. I have every reason to believe that my colleague, the Minister for Immigration, has been successfully maintaining since that date the level of immigration that was then announced. As to the situation in Victoria, 1 did not follow clearly the detail of the honorable member&#39;s question. I know it is a matter for some satisfaction on the part of the Premier of that State and his colleagues that Victoria, apparently, is attracting a rather larger proportion of migrant settlers than other States. This has produced some growing pains for Victoria, but the Victorian Government gladly accepts them as an inevitable consequence of the developmental process that is going on there. I remind honorable members that the formula for reimbursements to the States which was arrived at in 1959 or early in I960 provides for full effect to be given to population increase, and also for a betterment factor which will have the effect of increasing reimbursements to certain States as time goes on. These provisions should assist Victoria to provide the necessary facilities for its growing population. </para>

Also, is it a fact that David Jones Limited, due to what the Prime Minister described at the time as business acumen and foresight, was able to anticipate the introduction of import licensing a few years ago and arrange, before the restrictions became effective, for the importation of goods valued at an amount running into seven figures? Is it a fact that David Jones Limited has again anticipated a change in Government policy by announcing, just prior to 15th November, 1960, its decision to increase its capital by a sevenfigure amount by the issue of bills, debentures, &#38;c, thus qualifying for taxation deductions of the amount of annua! interest payments involved in this new capital? </para>

            <para>- The advance policy announced by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia in November last still applies. This policy calls for continuing restraint in trading bank lending, especially in relation to the financing of imports and the more speculative forms of business activity, while catering for the essential requirements of primary and other export producers, and for housing. In the present quarter of the financial year, there is normally an increase in outstanding advances because of seasonal factors. It was with this in mind that the banks were asked in November last to achieve a substantial reduction in outstanding advances by the end of the March quarter - that is, during the period when seasonal factors normally operate to cause some decline in outstanding advances. </para>

            <para>-  I should like to ask the Minister for Social Services whether any alteration has been made in the period during which a pensioner can earn at the rate of fi 82 per annum without affecting his pension. Does the Minister know that pensioners are being notified that if in any two weeks the income of a married couple exceeds &#163;7 a week, they must immediately notify the department? In the past pensioners have been allowed to earn at the rate of &#163;182 or &#163;364 for a married couple during any period, provided that the maximum permissible income was not exceeded for the full period of twelve months. Has any alteration to this policy been made? </para>

Honorable members will appreciate that there was a time when the means test was exclusive to income, on the one hand, and to property on the other. With the introduction of the merged means test, as from 9th March last, it is possible that the property means test can be affected by the income means test and vice versa. To that degree it is possible that in an application for a social service benefit the rate of pension can be affected, and any change in circumstances should be notified without delay, but apart from that there has been no alteration. </para>

            <para>-  My question is directed to the Postmaster-General and is supplementary to a question asked by the honorable member for Wimmera. Is he aware of the considerable unpopularity of the new country telephone books? Does he realize that a constituent of mine living in southern New South Wales can look up the number of a subscriber in Bairnsdale, but has to buy another book to look up the number of his next-door neighbour who lives 300 yards away? As most businessmen in country areas either have to use about three of the new books or one old book - and many of them have decided to use the latter - will he revert to the old system when directories are next printed? </para>

            <para>- The honorable member refers to the country directories which have been issued since the inauguration of the new telephone system. It is correct that certain representations have been made from many quarters showing that there is need for some further investigation of the best way of producing a directory which will give the fullest information, embracing the new telephone zones and districts which have been established. I can assure the honorable member that the department is watching this development very carefully in order to ensure that any anomalies and difficulties which the operation of the new system indicates will be rectified when new directories are issued. </para>

In view of the fact that all Labour speakers during the recent by-election campaign for the Liverpool Plains seat in the New South Wales Parliament made very strong play on the effect of the Government&#39;s economic measures, do the results of this by-election not indicate general public approval of the need for those measures, and also deliver a severe blow to Labour propagandists? </para>

I can assure the honorable member that I have arranged to discuss this matter with my colleague this week. Overproduction is primarily a matter for the growers. I know that the growers in northern Queensland are concerned about this, and in fact have initiated a move in relation to it. That move has my blessing. </para>

Does the right honorable gentleman know that exservicemen are entitled to sit for an examination for permanent appointment to the Commonwealth Public Service up to the age of 55 years? Does he know also that English immigrants to Australia who served with the British Army and in some cases fought alongside members of the Australian Imperial Forces, the Royal Australian Air Force and other branches of the Australian armed services are refused the same opportunity to enter the Commonwealth Public Service on a permanent basis? As these ex-servicemen fought for the same country and the same cause, will the Prime Minister, as ministerial head of the Commonwealth Public Service, consider allowing British ex-servicemen the same benefits that apply to Australian exservicemen in this connexion? </para>

This is due to the very stringent precautions that are always taken by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories to ensure both the potency and the safety of the vaccines.

In connexion with the economic and financial squeeze instituted by the Government recently, will the Minister now acknowledge as a rather remarkable coincidence the fact that proceedings were actually pending regarding a claim for basic wage adjustments when the Government took its action? Will he agree that the attitude of the Government appears to be not as neutral as counsel represented to the court? Furthermore, will the Minister admit that it is principally thousands of good Australian workers, dismissed from their employment, who have suffered the greatest loss as a result of the Government&#39;s credit squeeze policy? </para>

            <para>- Naturally, the Government wishes to see the Commonwealth Development Bank equipped with capital adequate to the functions that it was intended it should discharge. From time to time, with that objective in view, we examine the capital situation of the bank and those periodical reviews will continue to be made. I can assure the honorable gentleman that we are conscious of the important and growing part that this bank is playing in the affairs of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- In the course of a statement which I hope to have leave to make to-night I propose to say something about Laos. I do not think that this is an occasion for exaggerating some differences that may exist, because out of the South-East Asia Treaty Organization conference there came, I think, a remarkable degree of unity, and the proposals that have been made recently by the Government of the United Kingdom have, as the honorable gentleman knows, been fully concurred in by the United States of America. I hope to say something - comparatively brief - about the Laotian position this evening. </para>

            <para>- Our Dutch visitors are, as the honorable gentleman realizes, to be here for only a limited time, but I shall certainly make inquiries to see whether their itinerary may be broadened. So far as concerns Western Australia, of which State my honorable friend is such an adornment - as well as being such an enthusiast for immigration into Western Australia - I think that the honorable gentleman will realize that in the last few months the Commonwealth, in conjunction with the Government of Western Australia, has vigorously resumed immigration there with, I think it can be claimed, a real measure of success. All those who are coming into Western Australia at the present time are being almost instantly absorbed into the expanding economic life of that community. I shall see whether the Dutch investigators can go to Western Australia, but in any case I can assure my honorable friend that Western Australia will never be overlooked by this Government so far as the peopling of its vast spaces is concerned. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to bring the judges of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory under the ludges&#39; Pensions Act 1948-58. I recently introduced into the Parliament a bill to establish the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory on a statutory basis. That bill is designed to replace the existing Supreme Court Ordinance 1911-61, under which the present Supreme Court of the Northern Territory functions. The ordinance provides for a pension for the judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, with the same benefits as those provided under the Judges&#39; Pensions Act. When a court is created by the Parliament the pensions payable to the judge or judges of the court is ordinarily provided for in the Judges&#39; Pensions Act. This bill seeks to continue that practice and to add to the list of judges who  are  covered by the Judges&#39; Pensions Act judges of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. The bill also seeks to insert a new provision to be numbered 4a (2.), the purpose of which is to make clear that when a judge serves in more than one court the act will provide only for one pension on his retirement. Clause 4 of the bill enables previous service as  a  judge appointed  under  the Supreme Court ordinance to be counted as service under the Judges&#39; Pensions Act. I commend the bill to the House. </para>

        <para>As the Opposition indicated during the second-reading debate, the purpose of this amendment is to make this amending legislation effective as from 16th November, 1960, the date on which the sales tax on motor cars was raised from 30 to 40 per cent. That was the date on which the Government introduced these emergency measures, as it called them. </para>
        <para>In introducing this bill, the Government, in effect, is admitting that it made a colossal mistake by increasing the sales tax. We believe that, as a matter of morality and justice, now that the mistake is being corrected, those unfortunate people who bought motor cars between the 17th November, 1960, and the 22nd February, 1961, should be reimbursed the amount of the additional sales tax. 1 think that there were between 50,000 and 60,000 people who paid the increased tax. The bill of course, reduces the tax from 40 per cent to 30 per cent., but the purpose of the Opposition&#39;s motion is that the bill shall not operate merely from 22nd February, but will date back to the time in November, 1960, when the Government increased the tax. </para>
        <para class="block">The <inline font-weight="bold">CHAIRMAN (Mr. Lucock).Order!</inline> I point out that this bill does not deal with the sales tax on motor cars. This is the measure which deals with the sales tax on motor cycles and motor scooters. </para>

            <para>- Yes. Between 16th November. 1960. and 22nd February, 1961, some 50,000 or 60,000 people bought motor cars and paid 40 per cent sales tax on them. They paid anything from &#163;80 to &#163;100 more for a motor car than they would pay for the corresponding model after 22nd February, 1961. We suggest that the increase in sales tax was a mistake on the part of the Government and we believe that, as a matter of justice the people who have been penalized by that mistake should receive a refund of the excess sales tax paid. Legally, the additional amount paid was not &#34; excess &#34; because the law provided that 40 per cent sales tax should be paid from 16th November 1960, to 22nd February, 1961. The Opposition asks that this legislation be made retrospective to 16th November, 1960, so that those people who paid the additional sales tax will be legally entitled to have it refunded to them. </para>

          <para>. - I hope that I have not misinterpreted what the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crean)</inline> was putting. He used the argument that the imposition of the 40 per cent rate was a mistake and that the introduction of this legislation acknowledged that it was a mistake. The Government strenuously rejects any interpretation of that kind being put upon its actions. The truth is that the additional tax, operating in conjunction with other measures, has achieved its intended purpose which was to reduce the level of activity in the motor industry - a level which had reached boom proportions. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is unnecessary to re-state why this action had to be taken. Lifting of the tax increase on and from 22nd February. 1961, was, in effect, no more than a compliance with the undertaking given by this Government at the time of the imposition of the additional 10 per cent that the situation would be kept under review and that relief would be granted as soon as such action was shown to be justified. The Government became convinced, after a close review of the matter in February, that its policy could be adequately implemented from then on by other means, and it therefore took action promptly to lift the additional tax, which, I repeat, had clearly served its purpose. </para>
        <para>The granting of refunds of the 10 per cent of additional tax paid would be contrary to all precedent. It is all very well for honorable gentlemen opposite to try to score some popularity with those who have been affected by the additional tax, but Labour did not display that attitude when it was in office. There has been no exception to this practice since the sales tax was first introduced in 1930. Since that time there have been many occasions on which the rates have been reduced and the invariable policy of successive governments, as expressed in the law. has been that on such occasions there shall be no refunds of tax paid or payable on transactions occurring before the date of reduction.It is obvious of course, that any attempt to make refunds and to ensure that they went to the persons who actually bore the impact of the tax would involve much practical difficulty in the verification of claims. Moreover, it is axiomatic that the revenue must be protected on occasions such as these from inroads into past collections. </para>
        <para>It is not without relevance to mention that, as a result of the imposition of the additional 10 per cent, of the sales tax, through its effect in reducing the sales of motor cars, collections diminished by an estimated &#163;1,500,000. Refunds of the additional 10 per cent, of tax to all who purchased cars during the relevant period would cost about &#163;3,800,000. Therefore, the total revenue loss if refunds were granted would be of the order of &#163;5,300,000. in this instance, it is not readily apparent to me how the denial of similar requests could be justified on future occasions when rates of tax are reduced or increased in respect of other classes of goods if refunds were granted in this instance. Invariably, when rates of tax are varied, some people get an advantage and others are put at a disadvantage. This, I fear, must be regarded as inevitable. </para>
        <para>After close consideration of the question, the Government finds itself unable to depart from the long-established practice in these matters. </para>

          <para>- Before I call the honorable member for Port Adelaide, I should like to point out that this bill is not concerned with the reduction of the rate on private motor cars from 40 per cent, to 30 per cent- That will be covered in the resolution before the Committee of Ways and Means. Previously, the House debated the bill and the resolution together. This bill is concerned mainly with motor vehicles of a kind used for commercial purposes; motor cycles, auto-cycles, motor scooters, and side cars and side boxes for attachment to those goods; and parts and accessories and the like. The reduction of the rate on private motor cars from 40 per cent, to 30 per cent, will be dealt with in the resolution which will be before the committee at a later stage. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. THOMPSON</inline>(Port Adelaide; &#91;3.34&#93;. - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> I shall bear in mind what you have said and I hope that 1 shall not be out of order. When 1 was speaking to a big motor dealer in my district recently, he said that these continual changes involving the imposition of additional tax at one time and the removal of the additional tax a short time afterwards had put the dealers in a position in which they did not know where they stood. 1 told him that the increase of about &#163;75 or &#163;80 on a Holden motor car as a result of the additional 10 per cent, of the sales tax would not stop a person from buying a new car so much as the effect of the credit restrictions would stop him,. The dealer said: &#34; But he does not have to pay that. We will increase our trade-in allowance on the good second-hand car that he turns in as part payment. We will give him perhaps an extra &#163;50. So he will have to pay only about &#163;30 more. When we sell the car which he has traded in, we shall get back the extra payment that we have made in respect of it. But we are now in a position in which we cannot get back the extra &#163;50 on a car which we took in before the rate of sales tax was reduced, and we shall lose approximately &#163;50 on each such car. As a result, we have had to write off several thousand pounds. This situation is brought about by continual changes almost from day to day.&#34; </para>
        <para>Another person told me of his experience as a private seller of a car. He had intended to sell it for a certain amount, and when the rate of sales tax was increased, he raised his price accordingly. The car that he was selling was almost a new one. He told me recently that the sales tax rate had been reduced just too late to help the person who bought the car from him and that the purchaser had paid him the additional amount above the original price for which the owner had intended to sell the car. The seller of the car said to me, &#34; Had the rate of sales tax been reduced two or three days previously, I would not have made anything more out of the sale, and the man who bought my first-class second-hand car would have saved about &#163;75 &#34;. </para>
        <para>I am not arguing at the moment about the alteration of the rate from 40 per cent, to 30 per cent., but only about the date from which the reduction shall operate. For the sake of that argument, this bill and the other one which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> have mentioned are similar. If we pass this bill as it stands and set the date of operation at 22nd February, 1961, we could not consistently oppose the fixing of the same date of operation for the other bill at a later stage. It is all very well to say that we shall deal later with the alteration of the rate on private cars from 40 per cent, to 30 per cent. In the circumstances, I ask that the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crean)</inline> on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> be agreed to. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> stated that this amendment, if agreed to, would require refunds to be made, and apparently he has made up his mind that the Government cannot make refunds. I make no bones about it: That is what I think is behind this. The intention is to give back to those who paid it the additional tax that was paid. That can be done only if the date of operation of this bill is taken back to the date in November last on which the rate of tax was increased, as is proposed in the amendment. I trust that the Treasurer will consider the matter further. </para>
        <para>The right honorable gentleman said that the action sought by the Opposition would create a precedent. I say to him that precedents have been established before. I recall an occasion when Australian National Airways Limited owed quite a large amount of money and we passed a measure to relieve it of the obligation to pay nearly &#163;500,000. That was done to benefit one company. When the Government and its supporters talk about retrospective legislation, they ought to realize that retrospective legislation has been enacted in the past to benefit certain people that the Government considered should be benefited. I think similar action on this occasion would be only fair and just. </para>
        <para>I do not know whether the Treasurer has kept in mind that a lot of people who paid the additional tax only to see the rate reduced soon after will wait in future before purchasing anything, if they consider that there is any likelihood of a reduction in tax rates. If, as the Minister stated, the Government felt that it had achieved what it wanted by reducing the sales of motor vehicles and the amount of labour employed in the motor industry, why does it want to keep the money that it collected in respect of the additional sales tax? It could say: &#34; We have done what we wanted to do. We do not want to make a profit out of it and we shall give back to those who paid the additional tax the money to which they are justly entitled.&#34; I realize that when money is collected to enable a government to run the country&#39;s affairs, that money cannot be disposed of willy-nilly, but the Government ought to acknowledge the fact that justice not only should be done, but also should appear to be done. </para>
        <para>A man came to show me his new car, and while he was showing it to me, saying that he had obtained it that afternoon, a neighbour came out and said, &#34; I have just heard on the wireless that the sales tax is to be reduced from to-morrow morning &#34;. Do you call it justice, after a responsible Minister has said that the increased sales tax is to be continued, for people to be mulcted in that fashion? If the Minister had said, &#34; The Government is going to consider the matter &#34;, this man, and others in like circumstances, could have waited another week or so. The Minister gave less than justice to people who, on the basis of statements made on behalf of the Government, and by the Treasurer himself, that there was no likelihood of the tax rate being altered, went ahead and bought vehicles. I do ask the Minister to consider again what he has told us is the decision of the Government with regard to the refund of the extra tax paid. </para>

The matter of the increase of the rate of sales tax on motor cars to 40 per cent, in November, followed by the reduction to 30 per cent, in February, is completely separate from the matters with which we are concerned in the bill now before us. The committee will be able to discuss those other matters later. </para>

He also referred to the rate of tax on motor cycles and scooters, and he went on to mention that registrations of new motor vehicles were at the rate of 330,000 a year. Then, replying to the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crean),</inline> he endeavoured to justify the whole action of the Government in relation to this matter. He did not deal specifically with the technicalities of this bill; he tried to justify the whole policy of the Government in increasing the sales tax on motor cars and later reducing it. </para>

That matter was referred to because of convenience. As to what the Treasurer said in this committee, I allowed him a certain amount of latitude, because he was replying to what had been said by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. I allowed both the honorable member for Melbourne Ports and the Treasurer to go a little wider than they normally would have been allowed to go on this bill. When the resolution is before the committee, as I have said, honorable members will have an opportunity to discuss the other matters that have been referred to. The committee at the moment is confined to what is contained in this bill. That is how the Chair rules. </para>

        <para class="block">The Opposition again points out that the matter before the committee arises from certain measures which the Government adopted on 16th November last. The rate of sales tax on passenger motor vehicles and one or two other items was increased from 30 per cent. to 40 per cent. This was stated by the Government to be necessary because of the economic emergencies existing in the community at that time and it was part of a scheme of remedies propounded by the Government. The Opposition opposed the legislation when it was introduced and argued that, as the Government had taken repressive credit measures which would achieve its objective, this was an unnecessary second barrel, as it were, used when the victim had already been shot down. </para>
        <para>The events of the ensuing three months showed that the views expressed by the Opposition in November last were correct. The Government belatedly recognized the harshness of its action and admitted in effect that it had made a mistake on 16th November. Like the many other mistakes that the Government has made, there were victims of this mistake. The victims in this instance numbered, according to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt),</inline> between 50,000 and 60,000. They were the people who bought motor cars between 16th November, 1960, and 22nd February, 1961, when the rate of sales tax was 40 per cent. instead of the previous 30 per cent. Each of those persons paid, according to the type of vehicle purchased, between &#163;80 and &#163;100 more than he should have paid. The magnitude of the mistake was some &#163;5,000,000 collected from 50,000 or 60,000 individuals. </para>
        <para>The Opposition suggests that as a matter of justice, the Government, apart from admitting its mistake, should refund to those who bought motor vehicles in this period the difference between 30 per cent. and 40 per cent. We have moved this amendment so that the reduction in the rate will run not from 22nd February, 1961, the date of recognition of the mistake, but from 16th November, 1960, the date the mistake was made. In that three months or so, we had 50,000 to 60,000 victims of the Government&#39;s mistaken policy. The Treasurer argues that there is no precedent for this action.  Of  course there is no precedent for it, because there has never been an occasion in the whole history of the Commonwealth when any government has been so stupid as to bring down a measure of this kind as an emergency and then have to eat its words three months later, admitting that the imposition of the increased tax was a mistake. Of course there is no precedent for what we are asking, but there is no precedent either  for  the mistaken and stupid policy pursued by this Government. </para>
        <para>Therefore, we say that, having admitted the mistake, the Government should do justice to those upon whom the mistake inflicted a financial burden. It is not impossible to find out, through car dealers and others, the people who bought motor cars in this period. We suggest that justice should prevail over administrative convenience in this matter and that the refund should be made. </para>

          <para>.- This is an important piece of machinery which gives effect to the Government&#39;s change of policy on the increased sales tax between 16th November and the date when this resolution brings the increase to an end. The sole reason given by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Ho it),</inline> who is no longer in the House to continue with the debate, for the change in this procedure and the refusal to consider a refund of the tax to those who paid it, was that there is no precedent for such a refund. The Opposition wants to say quite clearly that there is no precedent for this tax, either. There is no precedent for a refund, but there is no precedent for a 98-day sales tax in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia. This places 50,000 or 60,000 persons in the special position of being affected by a 98-days sales tax; and a good many of those people found it necessary, because it happened to be the beginning of the year, to replace vehicles which normally required replacement at about the beginning of the year. They were especially affected by this tax. They were not people who could have chosen to buy a car then or delay the purchase, but people who were especially obliged, as this was the beginning of the year, to take the action they did. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>If this had been a normal change in the sales tax, one that would have lasted for half a year or a year, there would be no case for a refund. But it is quite wrong for the Treasurer to rely upon the noprecedent argument. There is no precedent for a refund of sales tax paid, but there is no precedent for a sales tax increase and then an elimination of this kind, lt is not a matter of being wise after the event. When this measure was proposed on 15th November last year the Opposition gave consideration to the proposal to increase sales tax on motor vehicles by 10 per cent. The Opposition was quite clear in its attitude to that matter and said that it would not be necessary to increase sales tax to achieve the effect the Government wanted to achieve; and I think events have proved the Opposition&#39;s claim. The increase in sales tax by 10 per cent, was <inline font-style="italic">not for</inline> revenue purposes. At the tune of proposing this increase the Treasurer made it quite clear that it was not being imposed for the purposes of revenue but was being imposed to divert resources from the motor car industry where the Government had suddenly found there were excess resources. </para>
        <para>Had this tax been imposed for revenue purposes there would be a case to retain that revenue, but as it was imposed for a purpose other than revenue it seems to me that there is very little justification to retain the revenue. Assuming that this tax has had the effect which the Government says it has had - that is to remove resources out of the motor car industry - then the effect has been achieved. If the Government did not impose this increase for revenue purposes why does it not agree to the amendment now proposed by the Opposition? But of course this removing of resources - this afternoon the Treasurer used the expression &#34; removing of resources from the industry &#34; in the economic jargon he is in the habit of using - meant that men lost their employment and for some weeks had little or no income. Perhaps they had to move from a place like Geelong to a place like Broadmeadows, and when they arrived, their jobs were gone. </para>

            <para>-  I am dealing with a matter that was raised by the Treasurer when the Minister was absent. This economic jargon that Ministers have the habit of using is something they ought to have second thoughts about. My remarks at the moment have precisely this to do with giving the tax back: If the tax was not imposed for revenue purposes but for these other purposes the Government should refund the tax. One final point that I want to make is that the Government adopted two measures to deal with the motor car industry, an industry that it had waffled expand for ten years, which it had encouraged to expand and had taken pride in expanding, and then, all of a sudden, found that it had expanded too much. Tt then adopted two measures to deal with the situation. One of those measures was the credit squeeze and the other was the sales tax increase. If it was necessary to have both to achieve this effect we have now not got both but only one. If it was necessary to have the sales tax increase -to take resources out of the motor car industry, what is to prevent them going back into the motor car industry now? If the credit squeeze was not enough, why will not those resources go back and create the very condition .that the Government wanted to prevent by .this legislation If the sales tax, on the other hand, was necessary, why is the Government removing it by this resolution? </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The Government&#39;s position on this question is quite contradictory. The Government cannot have it both ways. If the sales tax increase was necessary it should still toe necessary, and if it was not necessary it should never have been imposed. The probability is that the credit squeeze was the real factor which affected the motor car industry; and if that is so that is all the more reason why the tax collected from those persons who were affected under this legislation- some &#163;4,000,000 to &#163;5,000,000 - should be refunded to those who paid it. I there/ore support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. .Crean)</inline> which would have the effect of refunding the amounts paid in tax by those persons who were unfortunate enough to be affected by the stop and go policy of the Government. </para>

          <para>.- I support the amendment. I am surprised that the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne)</inline> has given such a short reply. It is true that earlier this afternoon we had some sort of an apology from the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> as to why he did not contemplate the action now proposed by the Opposition. During the eleven years I have been a member of the Parliament I have never listened to a weaker explanation than that given by the Government on this occasion. It is quite apparent that the Treasurer was feeling thoroughly discomforted, because he realized that he was the architect of the Government&#39;s present position. After three months and three or four days it was realized that a gross injustice had been perpetrated on a section of the Australian public and on a section of Australian industry. There is not the slightest doubt that the Government realized it had committed a cardinal mistake and decided to rectify it as early as possible. The Labour Party has no objection to the rectification of the mistake, but there is no reason why the people who were the victims of the mistake should be deprived of about &#163;85 per person as the result of the Government backing the wrong horse on this occasion. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Treasurer, in his apology, stated that there had been sales tax increases before, and that when the rate had been reduced no refund was made to the people who paid the increase. That is perfectly true, but honorable members should not forget that in the ordinary course of events sales tax alterations are made only as Budget proposals. I have no recollection since I have been a member of the Parliament of a government coming in half way through a financial year and reducing a sales tax implemented under the preceding Budget. That has never been done before, and therefore it is useless for the Treasurer to say that a refund of sales tax has never been given. Never before, after only three months, has a sales tax been reduced; and that, in itself, is a condemnation of this legislation in the eyes of everybody, including members of the Government. </para>
        <para>The Government&#39;s attitude to-day is one of sheer obstinacy. It refuses to acknowledge that it made a mistake. Apparently it thinks that it has never been guilty of making a mistake, but it did make a mistake and it has not the courage to admit this publicly. The Government made a grave public mistake because after only three months it decided to rectify the position and introduced amending legislation. </para>
        <para>We have been told that it would be against the precedents of the past to accept our suggestion. Are we always to be bound by the precedents of the past? Have we to accept every decision of the Government because it is following a procedure that was adopted 50 years ago and has never been departed from? Must we allow the dead practices of the past to dictate our actions in the year 1961? A decision made by the Parliament in 1907, 1927 or 1937 is not necessarily good enough for this Parliament in 1961. After all, conditions change and the point of view of the public and of the Commonwealth change. I am never impressed when any one in this chamber tells me that you cannot do this or you cannot do that because it has never been done before. Good gracious me, this is supposed to be a progressive Parliament! We are here to legislate for the current generation. That being so, we must always be ready to cut across the precedents and practices of the past and we must always be prepared to implement something that has not been implemented before. It is idle for any one to say that because something was not done in the past it cannot be done now. Any one who speaks like that must be stamped as a dyed-in-the-wool reactionary. </para>
        <para>The diminution in sales of motor vehicles was not brought about by the increase in the sales tax. If a person wants to buy a motor car an additional &#163;80 will not make much difference because he is determined to get the car and 80 or 90 per cent, of sales are made on a credit time-payment basis. There is not the slightest doubt that the decrease in the sales of motor cars was brought about by the credit squeeze. The Government knows this and the Treasurer had to admit it this afternoon when he said that the legislation now before us was introduced because the Government had decided to use other methods in the future. One of the other methods, of course, is the continuation of the credit squeeze because the Government realizes that by the credit squeeze it is achieving the objectives that it set out to achieve in November last year when it increased the sales tax. I am satisfied that the increased sales tax had very little effect upon the sale of motor cars. </para>
        <para>In his weak-kneed apology to-day the Treasurer told us that it would not be practicable to refund the additional sales tax. Good gracious me, does he not know that he is dealing with business firms which are efficient and which keep complete records of sales of motor cars? When a firm sells a motor car it obtains the name and address of the purchaser and many other details. Any person buying a motor car is asked 101 questions - at least I always am when I buy a car - and this information is filed away and used later. Two or three years after purchasing a car a salesman calls upon you to try to sell you a new one. He tells you that the latest model has many improvements on the car that you bought two or three years previously. It would be merely a matter of office administration, and in two or three months 99.9 per cent, of the people who paid the additional sales tax could have it refunded to them. To claim that it would not be a practical act of administration to refund the money is merely begging the issue. </para>
        <para>The Government knows that it made a mistake. It is in a very deep hole because it has been reprimanded by friend and foe alike, and the least that it says about the matter the better. The Minister for Repatriation merely stated that the Opposition&#39;s suggestion was not acceptable to the Government and resumed his seat. He is bound by Government policy, but he should have shown a little consideration to the committee and explained in detail why the Government is not prepared to accept the very fair suggestion that has been made by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. </para>

          <para>.- I am very pleased to welcome the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bird)</inline> back into the House. I am glad that he has returned because he will give a little stiffening to a very supine Opposition. At the same time I should like to chide him for the arguments that he has advanced. He said that we are a progressive Parliament and that we should not look to the past, but time and time again the Opposition throws up at us the wonderful measures that were passed by the Chifley Government when it was in office. The honorable member referred to reactionaries. If any people in this chamber are reactionaries they are the Opposition members. </para>

        <para>I was rather amused to hear the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cairns)</inline> say that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> talks economic jargon. That is the one thing that the Treasurer does not do and the one thing that the honorable member himself does do. No one talks more economic jargon than does the honorable member for Yarra. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cairns)</inline> stated that there was no precedent for sales tax being imposed for 98 days. There is a precedent for putting on sales tax and there is a precedent for taking it off. No precedent is broken whether a sales tax is imposed for 98 days or for one year. What an extraordinary argument! Unfortunately, unlike the Opposition, this Government does not have the advantage of a crystal ball. The tax was imposed for a specific purpose. If any one in Australia did not realize the menace to the general economy of the tremendous growth of the motor car industry, he was not following the economic trend. </para>
        <para>This Government has to create conditions in which 150,000 or more new jobs are available each year. This can be done only by a broad fiscal policy and not merely by creating jobs. If one section of industry is expanding at boom proportions at the expense of the other sections, the Government must take remedial action. The Opposition has accused us of being reactionary and has proposed that we should adopt a laisser-faire policy and allow the motor car industry to go on and destroy the economy. </para>
        <para>The Opposition&#39;s argument is that the increased sales tax should be refunded because it was not imposed for revenue purposes. Does the Opposition suggest that customs duties, which are not imposed for revenue purposes, should be refunded to importers? When one examines the Opposition&#39;s arguments, one finds that they have no basis. The Opposition is merely trying to obtain popular acclaim from a number of people who paid extra for a car, but those who bought cars at a time when the Government was trying to dampen down the industry surely were not assisting Government policy. They bought a car simply because they wanted one. However, I am sympathetic towards those people who found it necessary to buy one. </para>
        <para>The Government could have adopted the laisser-faire kind of policy that has been suggested by the Opposition or it could have taken steps to remedy the position. </para>
        <para class="block">We were buying an average of 700 cars a day and that figure suddenly increased to 1,000. Can any one claim that this country could afford that rate of progress. If any one does, he has very queer ideas about the absorptive capabilities of the national economy. The industry was reaching boom proportions, yet the Opposition claims that we should not have taken any action. </para>

            <para>- Of course you do not say it but you are trying to imply it in your argument. All Opposition members are not on side. The honorable member for Yarra wants the Government to refund the additional 10 per cent, sales tax to the people who bought a car during the period in question, but the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crean)</inline> stated to-day that the man who bought a car during this period obtained an additional &#163;50 for his trade-in, so actually he lost only &#163;30. However, the Opposition wants the Government to return him the full &#163;80. Opposition members cannot have it both ways. They are batting on a very sticky wicket. The whole trouble is that they have not prepared their case. The man who bought a car during this period was prepared to pay the additional sales tax because, according to the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, he received for his trade-in &#163;50 more than he would have received otherwise. However, I feel sympathy for the dealers. On a Holden car, the buyer would lose &#163;30. These statements are supported by the evidence of the Opposition. Honorable members opposite want a refund of the full amount of &#163;70. What about the man who received &#163;50 more for his trade-in? The Opposition&#39;s case is not very strong, and I am glad that the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bird)</inline> ha&#171; returned to the chamber to stiffen the Opposition a little. </para>

            <para>- He was not mentioned before. I have been replying to the Opposition&#39;s case. Sales tax was increased by 10 per cent, not only to dampen down consumption of local motor cars but also to cut down the number of motor vehicles imported into Australia. The Opposition will find that in the next three or four months, because of the Government&#39;s economic measures, the national economy will be stable again. Employment is increasing. Each year this Government has, in effect, provided an additional 150,000 jobs or more. That has been going on for twelve years. So the Opposition will find that gradually the Government&#39;s economic measures will take effect. </para>
          </talk.start>

        <para>This irresponsible Opposition has not been prepared to assist the Government. Every time the Government has introduced economic measures, the Opposition has attacked it. In each case, the attack has gradually weakened. The people have seen the correctness of the Government&#39;s decisions and have recognized its courage and given it their support again. That will happen in this instance. That is why 1 asked a question on this matter earlier to-day. I did not do so to gain any party political satisfaction. I asked the question simply to provide an opportunity to show that the people have begun to recognize the need for the Government&#39;s economic measures. If that was not the case, would not the parties we support have lost the Liverpool Plains by-election? Every Labour supporter who spoke in that campaign attacked the Government&#39;s economic measures and the wheat plan because Liverpool Plains is a big wheat-growing area; but to their horror, the supporters of the Labour candidate have found that the people believed there was a need for these economic measures. </para>
        <para>I have considerable sympathy for the traders who were caught by the increase in the sales tax and had to pay the extra amount involved; but most traders had an opportunity to use a floor plan. If they adopted such a plan, they did not have to pay the tax. If the additional sales tax was refunded, a serious precedent would be established. It could be applied to such consumer goods as refrigerators, washing machines and television sets. When a tax goes down or up, it generally happens on the day the Budget is presented. A tremendous amount of merchandise is involved, and the dealer or the public can gain or lose by changes in taxes announced at Budget time. If the additional sales tax under discussion was refunded to a man who bought a car, a precedent would be established and there would be a clamour to have it applied every time rates of sales tax were reduced. </para>

            <para>- I withdraw the statement. The position is that this Government has raised a certain amount of money by increasing the sales tax on motor cars temporarily, and now it should return the additional money to those who bought motor vehicles during the relevant period, following its decision to remove the additional 10 per cent, tax which it imposed only in November. All honorable members have received complaints from electors who were caught by the rise in the sales tax. I have had many representations made to me. The arrogant statement that was made by the Minister at the table should not be accepted by the people. Supporters of the Government claim that it has achieved what it set out to achieve. What did it set out to achieve? First, it said that too much money was being spent on motor cars and that too much steel was being consumed by the motor vehicle industry. It adopted two measures. First, it increased the sales tax on motor vehicles from 30 to 40 per cent.; and secondly, it introduced a credit squeeze. Now the Government has reduced the sales tax to 30 per cent. The reason for the reduction is that the big motor vehicle combines - General Motors-Holden&#39;s Limited and the Ford company - put pressure on the Government. Actually, the Treasurer did not make a statement when the sales tax was reduced; it was the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> who bowed to the wishes of the big motor car monopolies. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>As to the credit squeeze, those two combines will not be affected because they can make their own finance available and so maintain the sales of Holden and Falcon motor cars. Thus, there, will continue to be an upward surge in the sales of motor vehicles; so the Government has not achieved what it set out to achieve. Once again, the motor vehicle industry will be a drain on the steel industry of Australia and once again, it will impose a greater burden on our export earnings. Huge increased quantities of petroleum products will have to be imported. The Government did not set out on a pattern of education. The Opposition&#39;s policy has not been one of laisser-faire. We have advanced a progressive and positive policy. We have said previously on many occasions that the sales tax on motor cars should be applied on a sliding scale according to petrol consumption. The sales tax should be lower on cars which consume less petrol. If a luxury motor car travels only 15 to 18 miles on a gallon of petrol, the sales tax on such a car should be increased. Thus, the people would be educated to buy a worker&#39;s motor car that the Australian people can afford. That is an indication of what we would do. That is a positive policy. </para>
        <para>Let us look at the record of this Government in relation to sales tax. When the Chifley Government went out of office in 1949, the rate of sales tax on a motor car was 8 per cent. By November last year, the rate had risen to 30 per cent. Then this Government increased it to 40 per cent, until, under pressure from the monopolistic motor vehicle interests, the Government relented and reduced the sales tax to 30 per cent. Those monopolies will not be affected because they can make finance available for the purchase of Falcon and Holden motor vehicles. Many of the small dealers outside the Holden or Falcon networks cannot sell motor cars. Consequently, they will be affected; but, in whole, the position of the country will not be any better. Our export balances will be affected by the increased imports of petroleum products. The steel industry will be affected. Steel which should be going into more essential industries will be absorbed by the motor vehicle industry. This is one of the issues that this Government has not faced and will not face - the issue of priority, of where money should flow within the community in the best interests of our development. The Government is a laisser-faire government. When we on this side are elected to office we will be a progressive government, because we have some vision, we have some feeling for this country, and we are aware of its capabilities for development. We will face up to that position. </para>
        <para>Lastly, I should like to say that surely the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne),</inline> who is now at the table, will take back to the Treasurer and his Cabinet colleagues the message from this debate that the Government should relent in regard to its stupid decision to retain the &#163;5,000,000 which it has been able to steal from the unfortunate purchasers of motor cars in that tragic period between November and March. Surely the Government will not be so foolish as to retain this &#163;5,000,000, and surely honorable members opposite will support the Opposition&#39;s amendment. </para>

          <para>.- It is quite obvious that the Labour Party seeks not to effect a refund of sales tax but to gain, by this amendment, some cheap political publicity. I can support that statement by saying that never before has anybody on the Labour Party side advocated a refund of sales tax or any other tax. No Labour Government, or, for that matter, any other government, has ever refunded money. So, the only reason that presents itself for this sudden outburst from honorable members opposite is that the Opposition actually believes that the Government made a mistake in imposing the increase of sales tax originally. Whether that is right or wrong - and I believe it to be wrong - the fact is that the only foundation upon which the Opposition&#39;s so-called logic is based is that the Government made a mistake. Upon that rock honorable members opposite have built their case for the amendment. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I say that the Government did not make a mistake by imposing the increase of sales tax in November. This is borne out by the fact that the purpose of the tax was to deter people from the unnecessary purchase of motor cars. That that effect was achieved is evidenced by the reduction of demand for motor cars during the period in which the increased tax operated. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cairns)</inline> asks if this effect has been achieved as desired, and if the increased tax was not imposed for revenue purposes, why we should not refund the increased tax collected during the period. Well, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, the</inline> very purpose of the tax would be defeated if the precedent were created of refunding a tax imposed as a deterrent. If people knew that the Government would later refund taxes imposed as deterrents to the purchase of certain commodities there would be no deterrent effect to be gained. I think that that is the whole crux of this matter. The crux of the matter is not, as the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bird)</inline> has said, that it would be practicable to refund the amounts collected. That is entirely beside the point. The point is that a tax imposed as a deterrent would ceases to be a deterrent as soon as people realized that the amount collected would be refunded later. </para>

          <para>.- I support the Opposition&#39;s proposal that the Government refund the increased sales tax collected on motor cars between 16th November, 1960, and 22nd February, 1961. The money involved could, of course, be refunded. There is no doubt that it appeared most unlikely to people who bought motor vehicles during that period that any government would contemplate imposing an increase of tax of that sort for such a short period. Nothing in our history provides any precedent for that brief imposition of such an increase of tax. In fact, many people came to members of the Parliament - I am sure that many came to members on the Government side as well as to members on the Opposition side - and asked them whether they thought that the increase of sales tax on cars to 40 per cent, was to be only a very brief, temporary measure. I am sure that no honorable member thought that any government would be so flybynight, so inconsistent and so irrational as to impose such an increase of tax for such a short period - on in November, off in February. In reaching their opinions in this matter honorable members also took account of the fact that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> had stated that the purpose of the increase was not the raising of revenue. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Like other honorable members, I have been inundated with letters of protest regarding this tax. I have sent many of these letters on to the Treasurer. They show that many ordinary people in the community have been the victims of the increased tax, and that large amounts of money are involved. They show that among those who have suffered are people who saved for a deposit on a motor car and bought their cars during the time when the increase of tax operated. In many cases the people involved are the kind of people who need very sympathetic consideration from any government. </para>
        <para>One would gain the impression from the Government&#39;s attitude that cars are not one of the ordinary necessaries of life in Australia - that a car is a luxury which should be taxed excessively whenever the Government has the inclination to do so. But the fact is that in this country, probably more than in most countries, cars are very necessary. </para>
        <para>I cannot help but feel that the Government&#39;s original action in increasing the tax was itself inflationary. This, of course, was one of the reasons why the Opposition opposed the increase when it was first mooted. There are so many people in the community who are able to pass on to the consumers any increase in sales tax or other charges, and thus add to the cost of living of the ordinary person. The butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker, and all people in business in fact do this. Yet the Government claimed that the purpose of the increase was anti-inflationary. </para>
        <para>Sales tax is a transferable tax, as has been proved throughout this country&#39;s history. It can always be passed on, and so. by increasing sales tax, the Government would not be going towards the objective of reducing inflation. And inflation is very fundamental to this problem, because it is inflation which has contributed to our inability to export sufficient to enable us to pay our way. Our cost structure has been affected by the inflationary conditions, and although we are now unable to export sufficient to pay our way we are still importing too much. So the Government&#39;s answer was to curb the motor car industry. In the process it has aggravated the inflationary trend, because people have had to pay more for cars. To-day, as a result of our very complex taxation system, there are many people who are able simply to transfer increased taxes to the consumer while they themselves are able to gain tax concessions from the Government. So I seriously contend that the Government is not making much progress towards the solution of inflation. It went into this thing in a foolhardy and indifferent way. When all is said and done, when we are dealing with the motor car industry we are dealing with an industry which employs 330,000 workers, or about one-seventh of the Australian work force. There can be no doubt that the Government had the objective of bringing about a substantial retrenchment of employment in this industry. When you play so dangerously with an industry involving one-seventh of the Australian work-force you are doing something that brings about a decline in our economic position. The Government has caused a loss of confidence throughout the community. </para>
        <para>I was interested to listen to the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anderson)</inline> explain that the purpose of the increased tax was to dampen down the buoyant conditions in the car industry. The honorable member said that the Opposition had no alternative propositions to make. Of course, we have plenty of propositions. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Uren),</inline> the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cairns)</inline> and the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crean)</inline> have all indicated the Labour Party&#39;s great interest in the fundamental necessity to increase Australia&#39;s exports and minimize imports. We have proposes to stimulate the steel industry. We have heard nothing from the other side of the chamber in that regard. Honorable members opposite have spoken about the two import contents of car manufacture - steel and petroleum. If they are both considerations, it is necessary to look at each of them when thinking about the national development programme. </para>
        <para>The Opposition has proposed that a. people&#39;s steel industry should be developed, and we think that a great deal could bedone to bring down the price of petrol by establishing a Commonwealth oil refinery. We have made other proposals which would materially affect our balance-of-payments problem and make increased sales tax unnecessary. We have talked about the need to stimulate the coal industry. At present, the Government is allowing that industry todecline seriously. It is not examining the possibility of developing by-products from coal which would increase our exports and obviate the necessity to hit the car industry in such a savage way. </para>
        <para>In effect, the Treasurer said that Australia was devoting too much of its resources to the motor car industry. That was another reason given for the increased sales tax. He said that resources in excess of what the country could afford, having regard to its other requirements, were being swallowed by the car industry. The Opposition has suggested that if that is the case the position could be remedied by the reimposition of import controls. Why did the Government lift those controls in February of last year when it was so easy to anticipate the state of affairs that led the Government to impose additional sales tax on motor cars? </para>
        <para>The motor car industry has become an aunt sally for the Government. What the honorable member for Reid said was true. In the lifetime of this Government sales tax on motor cars has been increased from <inline font-style="italic">8i</inline> per cent, to 40 per cent. The Chifley Government&#39;s tax was 81- per cent. In October, 1950, under this Government, the tax rose to 10 per cent. Tn September. 1953, it was doubled to 20 per cent. However, it was soon reduced to 16} per cent, just after a general election. On 15th March, 1956, the present Government increased this tax to 30 per cent., as a &#34; temporary &#34; measure. But this so-called temporary impost remained until November, 1960, when the Government tossed it up to 40 per cent. What is the reaction of the motor car industry? Recently a report of the Chamber of Automotive Industries of New South Wales said this about the Menzies Government - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>For the record, when the &#34; Little Budget &#34; was introduced in 1956, the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> G. Menzies, said unequivocally that the 30 per cent sales tax then imposed on motor vehicles was &#34; a temporary restraint on the motor industry.&#34; </para>
          <para>We accepted ,ne Prime Minister&#39;s word, just as we accepted his  dictum  that the temporary 30 per cent, impost, unfair as it seemed, was for the good of the nation. </para>
          <para>Neither did we protest too much when we were told later that some Government members, both inside and outside the Cabinet, had been in favour of a 25 per cent, sales tax on motor vehicles. </para>
          <para>In fact this <inline font-style="italic">great</inline> industry, with its vast staffs and wide ramifications, has continued to support the Government through the ups and downs of its economic policy, which we believed honestly intended for the good of Australia, although we protested and warned  responsible  people against high discriminative taxation. </para>
          <para>But now our belief in the Government&#39;s sincerity has been strained too far, and our feeling has become one of disgust. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The members of this organization are not traditionally Labour people. The statistics provided show th: t the Government has been hitting the motor car industry terribly hard. The total tax imposed on it has been &#163;144,000,000. Sales tax alone has totalled &#163;77,000.000 and even before the 10 per cent, increase 47 per cent, of sales tax from all sources came from motor cars. We find it very difficult to see how the Government can justify its attitude. By way of customs and excise on petrol, for example, the Government has been taking &#163;241,000,000 from the car industry and has been returning only &#163;174,000,000.&#39; </para>
        <para>The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN.Order! The honorable member&#39;s time has expired. </para>
        <para>BARNES (McPherson) &#91;4.45&#93;.- Obviously, the Opposition is having great difficulty in finding arguments to support its proposal. First of all, the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bird)</inline> said that we could forget the past. I think that that is a very wise argument for the Opposition to advance because if we remember the past we recall that when Labour was in office we could not even buy a car on which to pay sales tax. If we could find a car somewhere, we could not buy petrol to run it. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Uren)</inline> suggested that the large motor firms had not suffered and that in some way they had influenced the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> to remedy the sales tax position. To suggest that large motor firms such as General Motors-Holden&#39;s Limited and the Ford company have not suffered is completely ridiculous. We know that they have had to reduce employment because new cars which were piling up had no market. By December, 1960, the sales of cars had dropped by over 40 per cent. There was an improvement last month, but sales were still down 30 per cent, or 35 per cent. </para>
        <para>Members of the Opposition have suggested that a mistake was made by the Government. That is their version of a mistake. They got this idea from the press. The increased sales tax on motor cars was imposed by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> to bring about a certain level of car sales. When the tax was increased he promised that as soon as that level of sales had been achieved the tax would be removed. Of course, no one knew when that time would come. I think that members of the Opposition and our metropolitan press have panicked the public into making the effect of these measures far more severe than ever was expected. Responsible newspapers such as the &#34; Financial Review &#34; which we look to for guidance and to see trends in the financial world, have joined in putting the argument that we have heard from the Opposition, But facts are running against the press and the Opposition. The very effect which the Government set out to achieve is being accomplished. Our balance of payments has swung in our favour. Our import position is improving and, despite the claims of the Opposition, our unemployment position is improving. </para>

          <para>- It is undoubtedly so. Members of the Opposition are disappointed, I feel, to find these measures being successful. After all, the Government has a responsibility to preserve the prosperity of Australia and keep employment at the high level which has existed. We have never had a run of such prosperous years as we have had since this Government has been in power and had we not done something to preserve that prosperity we should have been condemned by the people. The Government had the courage to act instead of waiting, as one member of the Opposition stated that it could have waited, until the next Budget to increase the tax. That would have been too late. The boom would have burst. Tens of thousands of people would have been unemployed. After all, the tremendous sales of cars were affecting other sections of the community. They were affecting primary industry. A report by one of the larger retail firms recently blamed the tremendous sales of cars and the financing of those sales in the last part of last year for the drop in retail sales. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>After all, these measures are achieving the results which the Government intended to achieve. We do not like to see taxes rise, of course. This Government has endeavoured all along to reduce taxes within the limits allowed by the requirements of the economy. The Opposition makes this plea for a refund of the additional sales tax which has been paid, but, unfortunately, it does not mention some things such as the case mentioned by the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anderson),</inline> who told us of the country dealer who financed his own floor plan and who is now in a very unhappy position as a result. Honorable members opposite do not mention cases like that. They have no concern for people in that position. </para>
        <para>In conclusion, I say that the arguments that we have heard to-day from the Opposition in support of the amendment are very poor indeed. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">.- Mr. Chairman,</inline>the honorable member for Mcpherson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnes)</inline> has accused the Opposition of putting very indequate arguments in support of its case. Apparently, he was sound asleep in his seat in the chamber when the honorable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. L. R. Johnson)</inline> addressed the committee a little while ago and outlined the constructive methods by which Labour would have tackled the problem. The Government, however, has not even remotely looked like adopting one of our suggestions. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I am quite certain that the Government has lost its way. It is just like a man fumbling about in the dark for a light switch. But the light switch will not be turned on until this Government has been removed from the treasury bench and a government with vision and understanding of the country&#39;s problems is put into office. The Ministers in this Government live in ivory towers, even if they do not live in ivory palaces. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> is not even present now to hear what is being said. We noticed at question time to-day even the Prime Minister&#39;s lack of a grip on the country&#39;s problems. He could not even answer the questions that were put to him. That is most unlike the Prime Minister, who found himself unable even to fob off a question with some sarcastic remark. Obviously, the Government has lost its way and, in respect of this issue, has taken the wrong turning. </para>
        <para>The sales tax on motor cars affords a glorious example of its blind stumbling. It went down the wrong road a considerable distance and then suddenly realized that it had gone the wrong way. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> in a dramatic announcement made just before he went overseas, left the Treasurer and every other Minister stranded when he said, &#34; We are going to remove the additional 10 per cent, of the sales tax on motor cars &#34;. That announcement was one of the greatest shocks that this country has ever received. Only the day before, in Melbourne, the Treasurer had been stating all the reasons for which the Government had increased the sales tax, like the true advocate of Government policy that he is. Then, within 24 hours, the Prime Minister reversed the whole thing and the Treasurer&#39;s argument fell like a pack of cards about his ears. </para>
        <para>Where is this Government going? The increase of the sales tax was a horrible mistake. Indeed, I suggest that &#163;3,800,000 has been taken out of the pockets of purchasers of motor cars in Australia under false pretences. That is why we ask the Government to refund the additional tax that was collected. The increase was not decent, in the first place. It constituted an unjust tax. I recall vividly the fanfare of trumpets that sounded throughout this country when the measure authorizing the increase was being considered by the Parliament. When the bill reached another place, it seemed in danger of defeat, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman.</inline> What happened? A track was worn from the Prime Minister&#39;s office to the offices of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> They seemed likely to dig their toes in, as we say, and reject the bill in defiance of the Government. I visited the gallery of the Senate to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> speak at the secondreading stage of the bill in that chamber. 1 have never heard a more sincere speech than that in my life. He said the very things that we on this side said in this chamber when we had the bill before us and voted against it. Indeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> said, &#34; 1 do not care what happens to me; I shall vote against this measure because it is unjust &#34;. He stuck to his guns, and he won the admiration of very many people throughout Australia. </para>
        <para>One would have thought that that bill would have transformed the Australian scene from darkness to light - from night to day - there was so much fuss about it. Yet, only 98 days after its date of operation, the Government suddenly decided to wipe it off the statute-book. The whole thing was a horrible mistake, and the people who were caught up by it ought to be refunded the money they paid under false pretences in respect of the additional sales tax. All that this Government shows to the country to-day in its administration is indecision, uncertainty and insecurity. The business world is completely uncertain about the future. Business people cannot make longterm plans while the Menzies Government is in office because its changes of policy are so frequent. </para>
        <para>During the 98 days for which the tax increase operated, 54,000 cars were bought, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman.</inline> Did not the Government want the purchasers to buy those cars? Was that the reason for the increase of the sales tax? Had the buyers refused to purchase these cars, the motor industry would have had to close down almost entirely and not only 6,000 workers but a great many more would have been put off. If the people who in fact bought the 54,000 motor cars were not supposed to buy them, who was to buy them? The Government gave no direction at all. It just introduced a blanket measure which hit everybody. It hit the needy and those who urgently required cars just as much as it hit those who were not so urgently in need of them. All were lumped together. The purchasers of the 54,000 cars must have required them urgently to buy them at such expense in the circumstances. The Government claims that&#39; a great deal of the spending on motor cars is unnecessary, spendthrift and wasteful. But I remind the Government at this stage that it was its own administration that a few years ago encouraged the motor car industry to expand. We well recall the various measures that were introduced in this Parliament to boost the motor industry - an industry which I have heard the Treasurer and the Prime Minister describe as magnificent. </para>

            <para>- I shall tell the honorable member. First, the Government encouraged the motor industry to expand when it made the double taxation agreement which was worth &#163;50,000,000 or &#163;60,000,000 to overseas investors in Australia. Most of this money was spent in the motor industry as a result of a deliberate act of this Government. That was its first measure designed to encourage this great industry to expand. Secondly, the Government increased depreciation allowances from 3.8 per cent, to 7 per cent, of the gross national product. In terms of money, this meant an increase from &#163;100,000,000 to &#163;475,000,000 in depreciation allowances. Thirdly, the Government, by reducing company tax by ls. in the &#163;1 in 1958, further encouraged the motor industry to expand. All these measures were designed, in effect, to give a blood transfusion to this great industry. But, just when it was getting on its feet, one might say, the Government imposed the vicious increase of the sales tax in order to hamper the industry again. As a result, about 6,000 workers were added to the ranks of the unemployed. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>From every stand-point, the increase was scandalous. I hope that the people will not forget it in December of this year. What is the use of criticizing the Prime Minister now? I appeal to those people who are greatly concerned about this matter to carry their protest right through to the ballot-box, as was done in 1949. If they do that, they will show that they mean what they now say. And let us not be fooled by these newspaper editorials that we read. I tell my constituents and the various Labour supporters to whom I talk that the newspaper proprietors will vote for the Government parties on 9th December next just as they have done so many times before. They will not take their protest right through to the ballot-box, despite their editorials. </para>
        <para>The Treasurer says that there is no precedent for such a refund as the Opposition suggests. What about the scandalous Ansett-A.N.A. deal which was discussed in this Parliament a couple of years ago? That involved the refund of hundreds of thousands of pounds by a deliberate act of this Parliament. Yet the Treasurer says that there is no precedent for refunding &#163;3,800,000 to those unfortunate persons who were forced to pay it. </para>
        <para>The words used by the Treasurer in speaking of this sales tax measure are like all his words. They do not seem to have any sting in them. The Treasurer has lost his punch. He is on the defensive all the time. At question time in this Parliament day after day he is on the defensive, and now it seems that he speaks in defensive tones all the time. The speech he made to-day was of the same defensive kind. However, we will keep him, and his Government, on the defensive until, after the next election, we have a new government in Canberra, which we sorely need for the sake of the economy. </para>

            <para>- All right, 98 daysbut how often have we heard Opposition members suggesting that when a measure is placed on the statute-book it is never taken off? As honorable members opposite are complaining at the fact that this increased sales tax was in operation for only a short time, 9S days, are we to take it that they wanted it retained for a long time? Did they want it to be imposed permanently? As the Opposition says that this rate of tax was in operation for only a short time, so short that it was not worth imposing the increased rate, we can take it, perhaps, that they would have been happy if it had been in operation for a long time. The honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duthie),</inline> being an uncompromising optimist, has suggested that Labour will again come to office in this Parliament. If, by some chance, it did so, then perhaps it would retain an increased rate of sales tax for an indefinite period, perhaps for another 30 years. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I was interested also in some remarks made by the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Uren),</inline> lt is noteworthy that most of the Opposition back-benchers have taken part in this debate, so that the Labour Party is evidently not pushing its amendment very strongly from the front bench. The honorable member for Reid suggested that when the Labour Government went out of office in 1949 the rates of sales tax were very low compared with their present levels. Of course, everybody knows that that is correct, but let us consider the state of the Australian economy at that time. The country was in the doldrums. There was no progress, and Australia was going down to decay and degradation. The population was very much smaller than it is to-day. We are now paying out so many more millions of pounds for social services and in every other department that a good deal more revenue is necessary at this time. Everybody knows that this is so, and if the Labour Party did happen to gain office in this Parliament it could not cut sales tax and other taxes to the extent that it says it would, while still maintaining the economy at its present level. No government could substantially reduce taxes in this way without depressing our standards of living to a significant extent. </para>
        <para>What is the real position with regard to this sales tax on motor cars? In November of last year 31,865 new vehicles were registered. In December, after the new rate of sales tax had been introduced, the number fell to 22,368, and in January to 16,254. It is no use beating about the bush when discussing this matter. The Government imposed the additional sales tax so as to reduce sales of cars. It achieved exactly this purpose. The measure had an immediate effect. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> said very clearly that as soon as the Government was satisfied that sales of cars were falling at a satisfactory rate, the rate of tax would be reduced to its normal figure of 30 per cent. When the relevant information came forward - and, no doubt, the Treasurer had the figures at his disposal before they were available to us - the tax was again reduced to 30 per cent., 98 days after it had been increased. That is the whole story. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for Wilmot talks about needy people buying cars. Did anybody ever hear such a suggestion as that? </para>
        <para class="block">Normally, any man who buys a motor car is either fairly well off or is in a business which requires the use of a motor car. Apart from these if a man buys a motor car, on a small deposit, while he is in a needy position, there is something wrong with his outlook. </para>
        <para>One honorable member asked: Why did the Government remove import controls? That question is very easily answered, lt did so to give the main providers of our national wealth, the primary producers, a chance to exist. We are selling most of our primary products on world markets, and import controls were lifted in order to give the primary producer a chance of buying a few things at world market values, instead of in our own high-cost, highstandardofliving economy. Often in this Parliament I have said - and a perusal of &#34; Hansard &#34; will verify my statement - that we must foster and build up our secondary industries, but that we must never do so al the expense of primary production, because this country&#39;s progress is based soundly on the primary industries. As secondary indus.trie cannot export, owing to our high costs of production, we must continue to depend on primary industries for our future stability. That is the complete answer to. the question why import controls were removed. </para>
        <para>Certain honorable members have said that this tax was not imposed as a revenue producer. That is quite true, and I understand the Government said at the time of increasing the tax that it was not intended as a revenue producer. When the rate of tax rose from  30  per cent, to  40  per cent, the number of cars sold fell considerably. Sales fell to such an extent that the amount of revenue received from the tax, even at the higher rate, was probably less than it had been when the lower rate was in operation. All these factors need to be taken into consideration, and honorable members opposite will see the position quite differently if they look, at it from a logical stand-point. </para>
        <para>What is the position of people who bought cars at the higher rate of tax? I have some of them in my own electorate, of course, and they would, naturally, like to have their money refunded. I, personally, and, I am sure, every member of this Parliament, would be happy to see it refunded. </para>

            <para>- They get justice. Sales tax and other taxes have never been refunded in the past. I want to put this very clearly: If I were the one man in this Parliament who could decide that the money should be refunded, by voting against the Government, I would vote with the Government, because if I did not I would be voting against the Government on a money bill, and I would probably put the Government out of office. I owe it to the constituents in the primary producing area I represent to keep this Government in office and to keep out the socialists. However, my vote will not decide whether this money shall be refunded, and do honorable members think for one moment that I will vote for the refunding of this money simply to attract some kudos to myself? As I have said, I would not vote against the Government if my vote were the one to decide the issue, so in the position in which my vote will have no significant effect on the result I will not cast it against the Government just to have people say, &#34;Turnbull is a good fellow &#34;. I have some national responsibility in representing the primaryproducing electorate of Mallee, and I believe that this Government, by reducing the sales of cars and bringing into force certain credit restrictions, is doing the very things that are needed in this country to foster primary industries. I am very happy to see the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bird)</inline> in the chamber again. He is a great fighter, but he represents a metropolitan area, as do many of his colleagues. They either represent metropolitan areas or are dependent for a majority on a vote from part of their electorate which is in the city area. They are fighting a battle that is different from the battle I am fighting. I would not have a dog&#39;s chance of winning an election in the electorates of Yarra or Batman, but the honorable members for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cairns)</inline> and Batman would not have a chance of winning in my electorate. </para>

          <para>.- Some very interesting points have emerged from this discussion and I think the most interesting of all was that raised by the honorable member for Mallee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull).</inline> He let the cat out of the bag in saying that import controls were removed in February, 1960, to suit the interests of primary producers. We have been wondering what it was that brought about this fantastic position, and now we know. It is quite significant, I think, that all those who have participated in this debate in defending the Government&#39;s position have been Australian Country Party members. We have heard from the honorable members for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anderson),</inline> McPherson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnes)</inline> and Mallee. Liberal Party members are completely silent on this matter. The Country Party is ganging up to defend this situation, led by the Minister for Trade <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> who is the strongest character in the Government. He has dominated the Government and, at an enormous cost, has imposed upon it a policy to suit a few people in the country. Where are the defenders of the Government in the Liberal Party? The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forbes),</inline> who is interjecting, has had plenty of opportunity to speak but has not taken it. Other Liberal Party members also have failed to deal with the consequences of the Government&#39;s action. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>We know what happened when import controls were removed last year. There was a flood of imports. This had two results. It had an adverse effect on secondary industry in the cities, where 90 per cent. of the people live. We know how adversely affected they were. We know that the Chamber of Manufactures has just completed a survey of those industries and we know that, according to the survey, &#163;272,000,000 worth of capacity in Australian industry is unused. We know that the survey shows - I mentioned this in a question to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> to-day - that there has been a great decline in industry. We know that factory wages have declined by 9 per cent. </para>

        <para>Several points come within the scope of the ruling. They were raised by Government supporters and require an answer. </para>
        <para class="block">We heard from the honorable member for Hume the suggestion that people who bought motor cars whilst the increased sales tax was being levied deserved what happened to them; they knew they should not have bought a motor car because this was contrary to the Government&#39;s intention. I first heard this argument raised in the corridors by supporters of the Government. They thought they would justify the refusal to return this money by saying that those who purchased motor cars during this period were offending against the Government&#39;s intention. The argument is now brought before the committee and apparently has the official imprimatur at least of some Government supporters. </para>
        <para>Let us examine the suggestion that people should not have bought motor cars during this period. Apparently 54,000 people bought motor cars whilst the increased sales tax was imposed for 98 days. If the honorable member for Hume is correct, these people should not have bought motor cars. Which of them should not have bought motor cars? The whole 54,000? If they had not bought cars, the motor vehicle industry would have closed down because it would not have been able to sell any motor cars. Should some of these people have refrained from buying motor cars? Presumably that would be the honorable member&#39;s argument. If so, which of them should have refrained? </para>

            <para>-  I will deal with your needy ones in a moment. How many of the 54.000 should have declined to buy a motor car? Half of them? If so, which half? What a ridiculous proposition to make! What an impossible position is created for the purchasers of motor cars when they are told that some of them should have desisted from buying motor cars! The honorable member does not say who should have refrained from purchasing vehicles. The proposition need only be stated for every one to realize how completely impossible it is. It is the kind of proposition that one would expect to come from Country Party members who have given very little thought to matters they have raised in this debate. The honorable member for Mallee spoke of needy people. </para>

            <para>- When the honorable member for Wilmot had spoken about needy people buying motor cars, the representative of the country squatters, the honorable member for Mallee, said that no needy people buy motor cars. The only inference to be drawn from his remarks is that needy people should not buy motor cars. It must be very interesting for people who work in the cities to know that a Country Party member holds the view that needy people should not have motor cars. I shall describe some of the needy people who have motor cars. Some people cannot do their jobs without a vehicle. If they had not bought motor cars, they would have lost their jobs. I know of people - not one or half a dozen but a dozen - who in the early part of 1961 faced the problem of not being able to obtain an appointment to a job unless they were able to buy a motor car. They had to buy a motor car and they had to pay the extra 10 per cent, sales tax. </para>

            <para>- Is it that only people who live in the country are entitled to have motor cars? That is the implication in the remarks of the honorable member for Mallee. What about other needy people? There are people who have been working and saving all their lives to get enough money for the purchase of a motor car. Surely they are entitled to have a motor car so that they can take their families out for a drive! They are needy people. These Country Party members who have the Government in a stranglehold through the strength of the Minister for Trade and who are imposing this reactionary policy on the voiceless Liberal Party members, do not believe that needy people in the cities are entitled to motor cars. </para>

        <para>Much has been said in this debate about the success of the Government&#39;s measures and at various times we have been asked what the Australian Labour Party would do. Other Opposition members who have spoken in this debate have shown pretty clearly what we would do. The alternative  to the Government&#39;s action is not, as the honorable member for Hume said, that Labour would do nothing. We have shown very clearly that the Government was aware of this excessive and undue expansion in the motor vehicle industry. The Government was aware of it, and encouraged it. It encouraged General Motors-Holden&#39;s Limited. Ford and all the rest of them by the kind of thing which the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duthie)</inline> mentioned - by a fantastic increase in depreciation allowances and a fantastic change in the double taxation agreement, which put hundreds of millions of pounds, directly or indirectly, into the hands of overseas investors. The Government encouraged them by leaving company taxation where it was and then finally reducing it in 1958. All these things were done to expand the motor car industry. </para>

          <para>.- There are a few things I wish to take up with reference to what the honorable member for Mallee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull)</inline> said. I support the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cairns)</inline> in saying that the cat was let out of the bag in respect of increasing the flow of imports into this country. The honorable member for Mallee said that was done to help the country interests. What about the manufacturing industries, the big industries which employ the great mass of the workers in the country? In my electorate one firm which employed 2,600 persons last June now employs only 1,200. In the textile industry, the employees of the firm of Davies Coop, in the electorate of Parramatta, which is represented by a responsible member of the Cabinet, were working a five-day week but those employees and members of every textile industry union have now been cut down to a four-day week. That is the responsibility of the Govern ment. In addition to increasing the sales tax on motor cars from 30 per cent. to 40 per cent., the Government opened the country to a flood of imports and introduced a credit squeeze. Those measures are bound up together. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Members of the Country Party are the only supporters of the Government who have spoken in this debate. No city representative in the Liberal Party has spoken in this debate. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Browne)</inline> although a member of the Liberal Party really represents Country Party interests. Indeed, at the next election the Country Party will probably nominate its own candidate for the Kalgoorlie seat, which is the biggest electorate in Australia. The honorable member for McPherson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnes)</inline> said that in the days of the Chifley Administration people could not afford to buy motor cars or petrol. That was a transitional period following the war, and the Chifley Administration adhered to a level and balanced economic policy. It maintained full employment and balanced the flow of imports and exports. The truth is that this Government since it took office in 1949 has had an adverse balance of trade amounting to &#163;1,800,000,000. That is the record of this Government. It has gone into a deficit of &#163;1,800,000,000, a great deal of it brought about by the importation of motor cars and petroleum, which increased year after year. We have a problem in this increased use of imported petroleum products and we have tried time and time again to explain how it can be dealt with. The honorable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. L. R. Johnson)</inline> pointed out that the Government increased the sales tax on motor cars from81/2 per cent. in 1949 to 30 per cent. by 15th December last, and then by another 10 per cent. The Government has increased aggregate collections of sales tax from only &#163;39,000,000 in the financial year 1949-50 to &#163;1 80.000,000- the estimate under its last Budget. A few months ago the Government brought in this sales tax increase from 30 per cent. to 40 per cent. on motor vehicles, which gained it another &#163;5,000,000. </para>
        <para>The Opposition&#39;s amendment says that the Government was wrong in increasing the sales tax on motor cars; that action did not solve the problem. We voted against the proposal and said why we did so. Now that the Government has decided to take our advice and reduce the sales tax to 30 per cent., all we ask it to do is to refund the &#163;5,000,000 which it has collected to persons who bought motor cars during the period of the increased tax. We say that the 54,000 people who bought motor cars in that period did so because they had to. The statement of the honorable member for Mallee that they should not have bought them is a lot of rot. </para>

I ask the honorable member to get up on his feet if he wants to answer me, instead of interjecting like a Mallee duck. The money collected under the increased sales tax should be given back to the people from whom it was taken. All this amendment asks the Government to do is to refund the money to the 54,000 people who purchased motor cars and had to pay the increased tax. I am very pleased that the Government has accepted the Labour Party&#39;s advice and has reduced the sales tax from 40 per cent, to 30 per cent. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-  I shall return to the resolution which the committee is now debating. The Opposition, by its amendment, is seeking to have refunded the additional 10 per cent, sales tax that was imposed on motor vehicles on 16th November, 1960, and subsequently removed. The Government cannot accept the amendment for reasons which were stated by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> this afternoon, and to which I shall refer again now. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The Opposition&#39;s arguments depend upon three assertions, first, that the additional tax was of short duration; secondly, that in the opinion of the Opposition the additional sales tax was a mistake; and thirdly, that the fact that a refund of the tax would be contrary to precedent is, in the Opposition&#39;s opinion, unimportant. None of these arguments is acceptable. The first assertion that the tax was of short duration and so should be refunded contains neither logic nor common sense. The honorable member for Yarra, if I understood him correctly, stated that he would not have objected if the tax had gone on for six months or for twelve months, and that he would not have claimed that it should be refunded. In principle, what possible difference is there between a tax which has operated for three months and a tax which has operated for six months? There is none! The same reasons for not refunding a tax which was reduced after six months apply with equal force to one which was reduced after three months. </para>
        <para>To the Opposition&#39;s second assertion that the increased tax was a mistake we give a firm denial. The truth is that the increased tax, together with other financial measures, achieved its purpose which was to dampen down the rate of increase in the activity of the motor industry. The purpose, I emphasize, was not to dampen normal activity or even a normal level of increase in the industry&#39;s activity, but to dampen the rate of increase which, in November of last year, had reached about 30 per cent, per annum. Even the honorable member for Yarra would not argue seriously that that rate of increase could be sustained in the general interest. It had to be dampened and restrained, and it was. When the tax was increased in November the Government undertook to review it and to remove it as soon as practicable. We have done so after three months. But the Opposition complains that the tax was imposed for only three months. Presumably it would have complained less if the tax had gone on for longer. Indeed, the honorable member for Yarra conceded that. The Government has discharged its undertaking. </para>
        <para>As to the Opposition&#39;s third argument that the matter of precedent is of no importance, presumably because the increase was small and was levied for only a short period, I point out to the Opposition that since 1930, when sales tax was first introduced in this country, rates have been reduced many times. Invariably the policy of all governments has been that reduced rates shall apply only from the time of reduction, just as increased rates apply only from the time of increase. It is an essential element of sales tax, just as it is of customs and excise duties, that changes must come without notice and must apply immediately. If a precedent were established in this case, presumably on the ageold argument that it is only a little one, how could a similar claim possibly be rejected logically in other cases? </para>
        <para>There are also other objections to refunding the tax. There is the practical one of making the refund. Several Opposition speakers have argued that there would be no practical difficulty in finding the persons who paid the tax and refunding it to them, but that overlooks the fact that some of the motor cars have been re-sold in the three months. To whom would we make the refund, the original owner or the man who has bought the car from him? Perhaps a more serious objection, as the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anderson)</inline> pointed out, is that an increase in the level of sales tax on new cars affects the price of all cars, new, nearly new, old and very old. The whole car market is affected. How could any one follow the ramifications of an increase of this kind and try to refund it? What justice would there be in selecting one group of people and rejecting the other? </para>
        <para>It is correct that this tax was not imposed for revenue-producing purposes, but another practical difficulty in adopting the Opposition&#39;s suggestion is that although the tax was not imposed for revenue purposes it has had an effect on revenue, and if the tax were refunded the effect on revenue could not possibly be ignored. The additional tax caused a drop in motor car sales and, as a result, a reduction in revenue of about &#163;1,500,000. </para>

            <para>- I have already pointed out that although we did not impose it for revenue-producing purposes it has had inevitable effects on revenue which cannot be ignored. The refunds would cost about &#163;3,800,000, so the total loss to revenue would be over &#163;5,000,000, an amount which certainly cannot be ignored. </para>

            <para>. - by leave - What I am about to say will cover some of the more important matters with which I was concerned during my recent overseas journey. On my way to London I had the advantage of meeting both  President  Kennedy and the new Secretary of State, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dean</inline> Rusk, in Washington. Our conversations were quite extensive, but of course private. But it is, I think, proper to say that the new  President  has a most alert interest in Australia and its problems. In particular, we discussed the problems of Seato and Laos, and relations between the democratic world and the Communist powers. I told him about our policies and activities in Papua and New Guinea and about the position of West New Guinea. I naturally seized the opportunity thus presented of making a comprehensive series of remarks along lines which are familiar to members of this House. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I hope it will not be thought an impertinence, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, if</inline> I say that nobody can fail to be impressed by the liveliness of mind, vigour of approach, energy and desire for results, and forceful personality of the new  President.  The atmosphere of our meeting was warm, friendly, and helpful. My clear belief is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kennedy</inline> will not rush to conclusions, that he will be at pains to ascertain the facts, and that when he decides the decision will be his. I subsequently saw a good deal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rusk</inline> in Bangkok, where, with our other colleagues, we worked in close consultation with most fruitful results. In my opinion, Australia can regard the new Secretary of State as a very able thinker and negotiator, and as a good friend to us. </para>
          <para>I then proceeded to the Prime Ministers&#39; Conference in London. All of the Prime Ministers who attended that conference have now returned to their home lands, and most, if not all of them, have given their account of what went on. The Prime Minister of New Zealand and I are later, for we both attended the Seato meeting in Bangkok. It is now my right, and, more importantly, my duty, to make my report in the Australian Parliament, at the earliest opportunity after my return. </para>
          <para>What I have to say will fall into three parts. I will first say something about the disarmament sections of our London communiqu&#233;, a document which I propose formally to table for the information of honorable members. I will then speak of the events concerning the imminent departure of South Africa from the Commonwealth; an event of great historic importance, on which I will speak quite frankly but, I believe, with moderation. Finally, I will briefly discuss the meeting of the Seato Council of Ministers, a meeting largely concerned with the current situation in Laos, and the attempts now being made to secure a fair and peaceful settlement. </para>
          <para>Turning to disarmament, there are several comments which I would like to make upon the statement of principles to which we agreed and which appear in the annex to the communique. But before I do so, let me say that this overshadowing problem of disarmament is of crucial and urgent importance. It touches the hearts and minds of all men and women. We therefore devoted great attention to it. Against this background, these are my comments: </para>
          <para>First, disarmament resolutions can give rise to false hopes unless they are immediately accompanied by action, with concurrent effective inspection and control. </para>
          <para>Second, nuclear, and what we are pleased to call conventional armaments must be dealt with simultaneously so that at no stage will any country or group of countries obtain a significant military advantage. </para>
          <para>Third, expert consultations must take place during the currency of political negotiations for a treaty - and I emphasize, concurrently - and should be, in their main aspects, concluded before any general treaty. To make general declarations about disarmament at a time when the techniques of inspection and check had not been worked out or agreed upon would be very dangerous. The Communist powers would retain full control of their own forces, while in democratic countries recruiting would tend to disappear, and the public support for defence expenditure would, on the general promise of disarmament, tend to weaken. There would, I imagine, be great practical difficulties in securing, by inspection, the abolition of small arms and other conventional weapons in a vast country with authoritarian control over the movements of people and the reporting of news. Such difficulties must be provided for as part of a treaty, and not left to subsequent negotiation. </para>
          <para>Fourth, we must consider with care the implications of the clause in the communique - All national armed forces and armaments must be reduced to the levels agreed to be necessary for internal security. Some nations may claim that, having regard to their population, territory, and social circumstances, comparatively large &#34; forces and armaments &#34; are needed for internal security. Others may need very little. Yet armed strength is relative, not absolute. The threat of war may well continue on a reduced level of armaments, unless those armaments, at that reduced level, provide a reasonable balance which will discourage aggression. </para>
          <para>Fifth, assuming as 1 do that the processes of negotiation, in the full sense that I have described, will be lengthy and obviously difficult, I would wish to see a start made with one matter which, if it could be solved, would do much to create a new and hopeful atmosphere. I refer to the proposed ban upon further nuclear tests. The nuclear powers have already made some progress in this field. There is no reason why, with goodwill and good human sense, success should not be achieved. With nuclear weapons confined, as they are today, to the control of a few powers, the danger of nuclear war is reduced. Should more and more nations come into the field, the dangers of irresponsible use would be materially increased. </para>
          <para>There are many other aspects of this vast problem which deserve the consideration of this Parliament. All I have tried to do at this stage, and in a brief compass, is to indicate a few matters of what I believe to be of singular importance. </para>
          <para>On the question of South Africa and the Commonwealth I am indeed sorry that I cannot be as brief as I would wish. During the proceedings in London there appeared every day, in some newspapers, so-called reports of our deliberations which were so false as to be absurd; some of them no doubt found their way to Australia and may have affected many minds. It is therefore necessary, while not attributing particular views to particular Prime Ministers, to put the record straight. </para>
          <para>South Africa, having decided to become a republic, formally applied for permission to remain a member of the Commonwealth - not to be admitted to the Commonwealth, but to remain a member of the Commonwealth. On the precedents already established in the cases of India, Pakistan, Ceylon and Ghana, there could be no technical ground for refusal. But some, not all, of the Prime Ministers indicated that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd</inline> had already indicated his willingness on this occasion to engage, under a later item, in a full discussion of South Africa&#39;s racial policies, they would prefer the question of continued membership and the question of racial policy to be discussed together. This - though <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd</inline> clearly desired that the question of continued membership should be first determined - was accordingly done. The debate was full, it was frank, it was courteous. </para>
          <para>However wrong we thought his policies, nobody at the London conference could or did challenge <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd&#39;s</inline> own sincerity. </para>
          <para>I pause here to say that this debate having occurred, and there being now no secret about the opinions expressed by others, I feel relieved of my previous inhibitions about public statements, and will therefore, before I conclude, state my own condemnation of apartheid, and my reasons categorically. </para>
          <para>At the end of this discussion in the conference, a communique was drafted, after considerable debate about its terms, and after various suggestions and amendments. I took an active part in the drafting. The broad nature of the draft was that we first set out that we saw no technical constitutional ground for refusing the application, but that we had debated, with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd&#39;s</inline> consent on this occasion, the matter of racial policy. We then went on to summarize the criticisms that had been made, and the nature of the replies made by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd.</inline> We then concluded that, notwithstanding those replies, we adhered to our criticisms. </para>
          <para>There were things about the draft which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd</inline> did not like. He availed himself of an adjournment to consider whether he could accept it, the whole idea in the Prime Ministers&#39; Conference being that the communique is a unanimous document. </para>
          <para>I can say for myself that I believed that if <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd</inline> could accept the draft which we had thrashed out, the issue of membership would be decided in his favour. Indeed, I thought this was the reason for the adjournment. After studying the draft, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd</inline> saw <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmillan,</inline> and said that, with some possible verbal and minor amendments, he would accept the draft, thus making it a unanimous record. On our resumption. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmillan</inline> announced this with, I thought, some natural satisfaction. I say quite confidently that both he andI thought everything was clear; that the effect of agreement upon the communique&#39; would be that South Africa stayed in. </para>
          <para>It was at this closing stage that several of the Prime Ministers disclosed a final line of attack. Two wanted the communique to conclude with a declaration that South Africa&#39;s policies were incompatible with membership of the Commonwealth. That seemed plain enough. </para>
          <para>Another agreed, and added that he reserved the right to move for expulsion, or to withdraw his own country. Another stated quite frankly that he would attack South Africa&#39;s policies and membership at every possible opportunity. I need not elaborate. There could be no mistake about the intensity and sincerity of the views stated. As the discussions proceeded, it became clear to me that, unless South Africa changed its policies, a considerable section of the Prime Ministers wanted South Africa out. Speaking for myself, I wanted it in, for the reasons whichI will state a little later. </para>
          <para>Once more <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd</inline> withdrew to consider his position. On his return he said he felt he had no option but to withdraw his application. He made a few pointed comments on policies in some other countries, but he accepted the inevitable. Technically, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd</inline> withdrew. But in substance he had to withdraw unless he was prepared to depart from policies which however criticized are the settled doctrine of his own Government. </para>
          <para>In a section of the Australian press a great effort is being made to show that on these matters I am at loggerheads with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmillan,</inline> and that it follows that I must be wrong. This is indeed a curious attitude for Australians, but I will devote a few minutes to dealing with it. I have now studied very carefully the &#34; Hansard &#34; record of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmillan&#39;s</inline> speech in the House of Commons on March 22nd, in order to ascertain what differences of views there may be. I have said that South Africa was, in substance, put out. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmillan</inline> said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There was no question of the expulsion of South Africa, for it became apparent to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd</inline> himself that he could not serve the Commonwealth or help it&#39;s unity and coherence in any other way except by withdrawing his application. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I have, myself, stated the facts in their sequence, and what I regard as the inevitability of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd&#39;s</inline> withdrawal. The House will make up its own mind as to whether there is here a difference worth prolonged debate. Indeed, I note that in a speech by Lord Home, recently circulated by the United Kingdom Information Service, he said, &#34; This week a foundation member of the Commonwealth had to leave the Commonwealth &#34;. </para>
          <para>Again, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmillan</inline> said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There are some who think that the Commonwealth will be gravely and even fatally injured by this blow. I do not altogether share this view.  1  do not share it at all. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is not a difference about the facts; it is a difference of personal opinion as to the consequences of the facts. I deeply respect <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmillan&#39;s</inline> opinion, and I most sincerely hope that it turns out to be right. But, discarding the word &#34; fatally &#34;, which is not mine, I retain my right to offer my own opinion that the Commonwealth has been injured and not strengthened by the departure of South Africa. If I had not thought so, I should not have been wasting time in efforts to keep South Africa in. Nor, I imagine, would anybody else! I would like to elaborate my reasons for my own attitude. They depend, I believe, upon a basic concept of the Commonwealth which I was not able, and am not able, honestly to abandon. For I believe in the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>Despite what has happened, it has much to do for us and for mankind. </para>
          <para>But, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, before</inline> I deal further with the Commonwealth aspect, I must somewhat abruptly turn, because it is necessary to illustrate what I will thereafter say, to recent events in the United Nations. </para>
          <para>Having regard to the events of the last few days in the United Nations General Assembly and its committees, and having further regard to what some regard as a switch of policy by Australia, I crave leave merely to state the facts, which I hope will be allowed to speak for themselves. Having stated them, I will return to the Commonwealth issue, which was the sole matter to which the apartheid debate related in London. </para>
          <para>In the Special Political Committee of the United Nations, on 4th April - a week ago - there was a general discussion on apartheid. The particular resolutions to which I will refer later were cabled to us and received by us on the morning of Wednesday, 5th April, with an indication that the vote might take place some time that night. Our representative, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hood,</inline> made a speech which accurately expressed our ideas. He did not - and, in view of some newspaper observations, I repeat &#34; not &#34; - say how Australia would vote on any specific resolution. He said nothing to indicate how we intended to vote on the more moderate - the three-power - resolution. </para>
          <para>For the benefit of honorable members and, indeed, for the records of this House - because this is an historic matter - I will quote in full what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hood</inline> said. He said this - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Although the description of this item has not changed since the last time the Committee debated the policies of apartheid in South Africa, certain events since 1959- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That matter had been last debated in 1959-  have understandably injected an increased degree of urgency to which all of us are certainly bound to pay attention. For one thing, the procedures of the Security Council were for the first time invoiced on this matter a year ago. More recently the outcome of a meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London three weeks ago is fresh in the minds of everyone and the prospect that the Union of South Africa will shortly cease to be a member of the Commonwealth has been copiously referred to during this debate. </para>
          <para>However, it is the General Assembly consideration that is relevant to this at the moment. The Commonwealth aspect is a quite separate thing. It. has to be remembered also that the Security Council still has before it the question in the form in which it was submitted following the Sharpeville incident in March, 1960. What then is the right way for the General Assembly to treat the item? </para>
          <para>We have at issue here the clear disregard by the Union of South Africa of many previous strong expressions of the views of the General Assembly that the policy of apartheid is repugnant to Charter principles almost universally accepted. The provisions concerning human rights are one of the most notable objectives set out in the Charter, and any failure in their observance wherever it may occur is indeed legitimately a matter for the concern of all. The Australian Government has stated that it feels a most serious disquiet at the racial policies which have been practised in South Africa, and that it deplores the results of the application of these policies, one tragic example being the events at Sharpeville last year. </para>
          <para>With the vast majority of world opinion, we neither support nor condone policies - that is deliberate policies - of racial discrimination - and we can understand the strong feelings which have led so many delegations once again to express their condemnation of the practice of apartheid in the Union. Furthermore, in addition to the questions of principle involved, the policy of apartheid is, as the Prime Minister of Australia has said, unworkable. We can at the very least hope that through what one  speaker  yesterday described as enlightened self-interest, South Africa will come to a realisation of this. </para>
          <para>The question arises whether the General Assembly this time and in the circumstances that have arisen since 1959 should go further in stressing its repeated requests that the Union Government should revise its racial policies to remove some of the flagrant contradictions that these have brought about with some of its obligations under the Charter. It must be pointed out in this connection that the Charter does expressly set a limit to intervention by the United Nations in a field of essentially domestic jurisdiction. In addition to those limits, there are further limits set by the Charter to the powers of the General Assembly. While there may be marginal ground here, many times fought over and contested, we should still pause before embarking on any course which would in effect throw away the whole intent and purpose of the limitations specifically put into the Charter. The Australian delegation, as in the past, will keep this consideration very closely in mind in examining proposals which are or may be put before the Committee. </para>

          <para class="block">We felt, and feel, no difficulty in opposing such a resolution, for the reasons so concisely stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hood.</inline></para>
          <para>The other resolution, put forward  by  Ceylon, India and Malaya, was much more moderate in tone. It deplored the racial policies of South Africa and some consequences of their enforcement; it deprecated policies based on racial discrimination; it requested, in paragraph 3, action by member states, within the Charter, to bring about the abandonment of these policies; it affirmed that such policies violate the Charter and the Declaration of Human Rights; it noted, in paragraph 5, that &#34; these policies have led to international friction and that their continuance endangers international peace and security &#34;; it called upon South Africa to bring its policies and conduct into conformity. </para>
          <para>The time for decision was, as is not uncommon under United Nations procedures, very short. I consulted my senior colleagues. The resolution had been up before - in the previous Assembly in November, 1959, when Australia had abstained. The United Kingdom on that occasion opposed the resolution. In the events that had happened and were happening, we instructed the Australian Ambassador to the United Nations to vote for this resolution, having first reserved our position on paragraph 3 - the one about taking steps - as it then stood, without a reference to action being &#34; within the Charter &#34;, and on paragraph 5. </para>

            <para>But, having made this clear, the Australian delegation will record its vote in favour of the Resolution. This it does so as not to have its position misinterpreted. It does not support the policy of apartheid and it joins with other countries in calling upon the Government of the Union to bring its policy and conduct into conformity with its obligations under the Charter. To achieve this result, it is, we think, necessary to vote for the resolution as a whole. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Indeed, that was the plain common sense of it. </para>
          <para>I may say, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> the resolutions have now been voted on. The one which we voted against - the one calling for very stringent sanctions - had a simple majority in favour, but not the necessary majority. It was supported by five Commonwealth countries as well as by 42 others. Those who voted against it included the United Kingdom, Canada, ourselves, New Zealand and the United States of America. The other resolution was adopted by 93 votes in favour to one against, Portugal being the country to vote against it. </para>
          <para>It has been said, and we are all well aware of it, that this action contradicts my attitude towards South Africa&#39;s membership of the Commonwealth. Clearly, therefore, the difference between a Commonwealth matter and a United Nations matter must be cleared up. </para>
          <para>The General Assembly of the United Nations is a deliberative, not an executive body. It offers opinions, which are, of course, entitled to great weight. If it chooses to offer views upon the conduct or policy of any country, those views will be offered, with every member nation free to speak. Resolutions are proposed, and votes are taken. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth is a different matter. It is, in a loose but real sense, a special organization under the head of the Commonwealth, the Queen. Its membership grows out of a special history, and is not conditioned by rules or procedures of the United Nations. Members stand in a very special relationship one to another - a relationship quite different from that of members of the United Nations. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth has hitherto existed without resolutions or votes, except in such a case as that which arose in 1949, when India became a republic and when a new constitutional structure or practice was adopted unanimously. The Prime Ministers meet in private for a frank exchange of ideas and information. They have discussions of an intimacy which is quite impossible in the United Nations. They frequently exercise more influence over one another than they perhaps realize at the time. Their strength is in their very variety. In a paradoxical sense, part of their strength is in their differences - of history, of background, of traditions, of personality. They advocate their own views, but they do not sit in judgment. This year there were suggestions made by some Prime Ministers that the Commonwealth should &#34; show what it stands for &#34; by propounding a code of principles, or a new Bill of Rights, observance of which would presumably become a condition of new or continuing membership. I want to state quite dearly that I most strongly opposed any such notion. I said that it would give rise to problems of interpretation under a host of changing circumstances; that it would encourage legalisms in a body previously happily free of them; that it could well lead to charges and countercharges of breach; and that the old happy and profitable search amid differences for unities and understanding would be replaced by an emphasis upon disagreements. The British Commonwealth, I said, could not long survive such a development. </para>
          <para>I went on to say, as I say now, that a written code of principles could not stop short at racial problems, which are in any event not peculiar to one Commonwealth country. It would presumably set out some of those great elements which are part of our heritage; the rule of law, the sovereignty of Parliament, no imprisonment without trial, an uncontrolled press. </para>
          <para>The famous Balfour formula of 1926, which set out for the first time to define the Commonwealth, used various expressions which are to-day either inaccurate or not generally accepted, expressions like - &#34; within the British Empire &#34;, &#34; a common allegiance to the Crown &#34;, and &#34; British Commonwealth of Nations &#34;. But the other elements in the formula remain unabated in either strength or significance. They are those which describe the member nations of the Commonwealth as -  autonomous communities equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs. </para>
          <para class="block">Here we have the recognition of sovereignty, of complete self-government; a right which we properly insist upon for ourselves in all matters within our jurisdiction, and therefore one which we must recognize and defend for other Commonwealth countries. They can, and do, choose or permit their own forms of government, authoritarian or democratic, and their own legal and social institutions and policies. This basic truth is occasionally forgotten. Yet it is vital to the Commonwealth structure and spirit. I make no apology for having maintained and expressed it at the certain risk of misrepresentation. And let me say quite plainly that in defending this truth I felt that I was defending my own country, its sovereign rights and its future. To do this was no academic exercise; it seemed to me to involve the self-government of Australia. </para>
          <para>When in this House last year, after the tragic incidents at Sharpeville and Langa, after world-wide expressions of horror, and before the Prime Ministers conference of May, 1960, the matter came up for debate, I stated the position of the Australian Government. In substance I said that the South African policy of apartheid, or separate development of two races living in the same country - a policy the opposite of integration - was a matter of domestic jurisdiction and that I would not publicly comment upon it. It would, of course, have been easy to have joined in public comment, and personally acceptable, since, like all honorable members, I was horrified by the dreadful events to which I have referred. </para>
          <para class="block">But the view which I took, though severely criticized at the time, was, I venture to say, correct. The policy of non-interference in the domestic affairs of another country is at the very root of Commonwealth relations. </para>
          <para>So far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the principle stated by me in Canberra was acted upon at the 1960 conference. Notwithstanding world-wide protests about apartheid, arising out of the Sharpeville matter, that conference, when the matter was raised urgently at the very outset, issued a statement, unanimously, affirming the practice that conference would not discuss domestic matters. In the final communique - a unanimous document - we said - and I quote only two passages, both short - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commonwealth is an association of independence sovereign States, each responsible for its own policies. </para>
            <para>Whilst reaffirming the traditional practice that Commonwealth conferences do not discuss the internal affairs of member countries Ministers availed themselves of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Louw&#39;s</inline> presence in London - <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Mr. Louw</inline> was representing the Prime Minister of South Africa -  to have informal discussions with him about the racial situation in South Africa. During these informal discussions <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Louw</inline> gave information and answered questions on the Union&#39;s policies and the other Ministers conveyed to him their views on the South African problem. The Ministers emphasized that the Commonwealth itself is a multi-racial association and expressed the need to ensure good relations between all member states and peoples of the Commonwealth. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I know of nothing which has happened since May. 1960 - since that unanimous declaration - to convert the internal affairs of South Africa into a matter warranting intervention by the Commonwealth, except that it has been widely debated, and the policy roundly condemned. </para>
          <para>I hope that nobody will suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd</inline> admitted that apartheid was no longer a domestic matter. What he did - let us be fair - was to face the fact that on this occasion, with his continuation of membership application before the chair, debate about apartheid was inevitable. </para>
          <para>However, the departure of South Africa has happened, and I have no heart to enter into needless arguments about it. But let us, who are within the covenant of the Commonwealth, make no mistake. The issue concerns more than South Africa; it concerns the whole character and future of the greatest international partnership the world has yet seen. </para>
          <para>One should, perhaps, hesitate to speak of J. C. Smuts, the great Commonwealth man, who, be it remembered, first expressed the policy of separate development in South Africa, but whose contribution to freedom cannot be reckoned inferior to that of any man now engaged in public affairs. But in 1960, after the Prime Ministers conference and on invitation by the University of Cambridge, I delivered the first Smuts Memorial Lecture. I had intended to quote a passage from it, but I will confine myself to a couple of paragraphs which are appropriate. I was talking about the Prime Ministers&#39; Conferences, and I said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We do not deal with the domestic political policies of any one of us, for we know that political policies come or go with Governments and that we are not concerned with Governments and their policies so much as we are with nations and their peoples. If we ever thought of expelling a member nation of the Commonwealth it would, I hope, be because we believed that in the general interests of the Commonwealth that nation as a nation was not fit to be our associate. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">These words come back to me to-day. Under inexorable pressure, South Africa is out of the Commonwealth. It is not the Verwoerd Government that is out. It is the Union of South Africa; the nation evolved by the great liberal statesmanship of 1909; the nation of Botha and Smuts; the nation from which, in two wars, soldiers fought side by side with our own, the 1st South African Division being alongside our 9th Division at El Alamein; the nation which provided lines of supply to the Middle East at a time when the Mediterranean was an acutely dangerous sea; the nation, over 45 per cent. of the voters of which recently voted to remain within the direct allegiance to the Throne; the people, three-quarters of whom, as men of colour, to whom we have a great and brotherly responsibility, might reasonably be presumed to find some of their future hopes of emancipation in the membership of the great Commonwealth. I hope I may look to my fellow members of this Parliament to share in my sorrow at these unhappy circumstances. </para>
          <para>I therefore now turn, as I said I would, to a statement on apartheid, a statement now rendered both permissible and necessary. I preface it by emphasizing that I was not, in London or here, concerned to defend apartheid, which, indeed, I condemn. My great object was to defend the interests, as I saw them, of my own country. </para>
          <para>I deeply resent the attempt that has been made in some quarters to suggest that, as I wanted to keep South Africa in the Commonwealth, I should be taken to favour or condone the shooting of natives at Sharpeville. That incident shocked the world, as it shocked me. I am against apartheid; against some of the modern manifestations and practices because they offend the conscience; against it as a basic policy because it seems to me to be doomed to a most terrible disaster. But we are a fairminded people, I hope, and we should try to understand how the basic policy came to be adopted, and what it was originally designed to achieve. What I will say will be by way of explanation and certainly not by way of defence. </para>
          <para>In 1917, while in London as a distinguished member of the War Cabinet, Smuts made a notable speech on South African problems. It is well to look back on it to see why this basic policy was ever adopted. In the course of his speech, he said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Instead of mixing up black and white in the old haphazard way, which instead of lifting up the black degraded the white, we are now trying to lay down a policy of keeping them apart as much as possible in our institutions. In land ownership, settlement and forms of government we are trying to keep them apart, and in that way laying down in outline a general policy which it may take a hundred years to work out, but which in the end may be the solution of our native problem. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was how Smuts stated it in the early days of this deliberately adopted policy. In our thinking this idea is now outmoded; it is much too severely applied; humane modern political ideas are against it; it will fail disastrously. </para>
          <para>But in every country in which there are large numbers of people of different races, millions of European stock, millions of coloured stock, the problem must arise as to whether there should be separate development, or integration, with equality of political and social rights within the same geographical area. This, to me - and I still refer to the original policy, not to these later developments - is essentially a problem of statesmanship. It has moral aspects if, in the pursuit of one policy or the other inhumanity is practised, injustices occur, or the dignity of man is debased. But the initial judgment is one of statesmanship. The problem exists in many countries, but it is most acute in South Africa. I am profundly grateful that we do not have it in Australia. </para>
          <para>It is against this background, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> I criticize what South Africa does about a problem which is its problem, not ours. </para>
          <para>I think that the policy will, if it continues to be applied as it is now, end in the most frightful disaster. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd</inline> told us in London what his Government is doing, in the fields of health and education in particular, for the Bantu, both in the Bantu territories or &#34;homelands&#34;, and in the ordinary provinces. He demonstrated that South Africa was spending very much more on these purposes than any other African country. He saw the Bantu, in the territories, coming up by stages to self-government, as we see the people of Papua and New Guinea. But he saw no prospect of equal political rights for the Bantu living and working in the ordinary provinces. Nor did he seem to me to envisage - if, indeed, such a thing be practicable, and I would think it is not - a complete territorial as well as a racial division of South Africa, so that all members of each race might be completely selfgoverning in their own place. As he knows from what I have said to him more than once, both in conference and out of it, I think there is a fatal flaw in this policy. The more zealously the Union builds up the minds and bodies of the Bantu, the more certain will it be that the day will come when, conscious of their own human dignity, their capacity and their strength, they will no longer tolerate the status of second-class citizens. And, when that day comes, they will demand their due, not in an atmosphere of evolving friendship, but with hostility and, for all we know, violence. The ultimate conflict, as I said in London, may be bloody and devastating. </para>
          <para>There are, to us, certain astonishing things in the application of the policy which have, I think, done much to alienate world opinion. One of them I, and others, earnestly discussed with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd</inline> in London. The Union does not accredit or receive diplomatic missions to or from Commonwealth countries in Asia and Africa. This discrimination is, to me, offensive to the great countries concerned. I pointed out that there is great value in such exchanges, and that to deny them is to suggest some notion of racial superiority, intolerable in form, and utterly unjustified in fact. I did my best to point out to him that even this one diplomatic step would do something to lessen the tension which we all wanted to see relaxed. But <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd</inline> was adamant on this point, as on others. He felt that there would be a grave risk of &#34; incidents &#34; arising from public opinion and private action. I said, in vain, that it was better to accept these risks than to incur the certainty of mounting hostility. </para>
          <para>A phrase has been coined to the effect that I have &#34; equated &#34; apartheid and Australia&#39;s immigration policy. This is quite untrue. Indeed, it is arrant nonsense. One policy, the policy of apartheid, relates to a discriminatory policy in respect of people already permanently resident; the other, our own, to a discrimination in the admission of persons for permanent residence. I hope I do not need to be told that the two things are quite different. I have always been grateful to my friend the Tunku Abdul Rahman, the Prime Minister of Malay, for his warm and helpful recognition of the validity of our policy and of our right to adopt it. </para>
          <para>But the whole point that I make is that, while I believe that our immigration policy is both wise and just, is based not upon any foolish notion of racial superiority, but upon a proper desire to preserve a homo- geneous population and so avert the troubles that have bedevilled some other countries, it is a domestic policy. And the right to determine our domestic policy is part of our sovereignty as a member of the Commonwealth. In short, what I have been saying is that the rule of non-interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign communities in the Commonwealth, once broken, may be broken again in the future. Such a development would concern us all very deeply. </para>
          <para>Before leaving the London conference, I would like to say that in the course of a general review of the world situation, several of the Prime Ministers mentioned the matter of Continental China. No conclusion was either sought or arrived at, reports to the contrary in a section of the press being quite untrue. But I think it my duty to the House to put it in possession of the views presented by me. I said that I thought there was much loose talk about recognizing Continental China as if the problem admitted of a simple answer. I pointed out that we have here a complete nest of questions. Diplomatic recognition, for example, was a bi-lateral matter. Some nation might be unwilling to recognize in this sense, while being willing to admit Continental China to the United Nations. But then there were further considerations. Was Continental China to include Formosa? Were the inhabitants of that country to be handed over to the control of the Communists? And then, supposing that Continental China accepted, as a condition of admission to the United Nations, the exclusion of Formosa - the &#34; two Chinas &#34; idea - was Formosa, as an independent nation, to be cast into outer darkness, or was she to become herself a member of the United Nations? Who was, in any such  events,  to have the permanent seat on the Security Council, with its right of veto? And, sup- posing that, as  many  nations feel, the Security Council should be broadened by the addition of further permanent and tem- porary members - I have heard countries like India, Pakistan and Brazil mentioned - should the new permanent members be permanent in the sense of not needing to be re-elected, or should they also have the veto? I have re-stated these points to the House as a warning against over simplification, and not as containing any suggestion that Australia&#39;s policy on the matter is in process of change. Our policy was stated fully in this House by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey,</inline> as he then was,  and  that statement stands. </para>
          <para>After the conference. I attended a meeting with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Heath,</inline> the Lord Privy Seal, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Selwyn</inline> Lloyd, the Chancellor of &#39; the Exchequer, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Soames,</inline> the Minister for Agriculture, on the problem  of  the European Common Market, and its relation to the Free Trade area, that is the problem of &#34; the seven &#34; and &#34; the six &#34;. As honorable members know, our position is that, so far from complaining about the six-power treaty we have seen in it great political as well as economic value. But we believe that some wider association which would include Great Britain is desirable if Western European unity is to be achieved and maintained. But we have our special interests to protect, particularly our exports of primary products both to Great Britain and Europe. I made it clear to the United Kingdom Ministers that before any negotiation calculated to lead to an offer or &#34; agreement in principle &#34; - that familiar phrase - took place, Australia expected the fullest consultation. In that sense, I said, consultation was essential when ideas were in process of formulation, and not after they had become either fixed or presented. I received an explicit assurance that this rule should be observed. There was also agreement to my suggestion that our officials should meet to examine whatever specific proposals might be put forward within a month or two. </para>
          <para>Subsequently, I was able to have a talk with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> about the possibilities of Australian entry to the London loan market during 1961. As honorable members know, Treasury approval is needed in such matters. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> was most helpful and favorable, subject of course to amounts and details which always have to be worked out near the chosen time for an issue. Incidentally, I found that our London stocks were strong in the market; and our credit good. </para>
          <para>Finally, I speak of the Seato meeting at Bangkok. Among those present were the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, the United States of America Secretary of State, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, and the foreign ministers of France, Pakistan, Thailand and the Philippines. The principal subject was Laos. That country&#39;s future, in or out of the Communist orbit, is very important. It is one of the countries covered by the South-East Asian Treaty. It has a long common frontier with Thailand, a member of Seato. It is vulnerable to aggression from North Vietnam and Communist China. The civil conflict is conducted by relatively small forces, and, in its own way, life goes on. In such circumstances, communism has a happy hunting ground. But for Seato, Laos is important in terms of defence. It provides a test of the significance and effectiveness of a treaty organization created to resist Communist aggression. For, if Laos passes into Communist hands, where does the process end? There are grim thoughts in this for Australia. </para>
          <para>The conference proved to be both understanding and invigorating. All representatives went away feeling and saying that Seato had been given new significance and force. We finally evolved a resolution which was, in spite of some anticipations of differences and difficulties, unanimously approved. I had the satisfaction of playing an active part in its drafting and acceptance. It has been published, but I table it formall for the information of honorable members. </para>
          <para>At this stage, I will content myself with a few observations - </para>
          <para>We all agreed with the proposals made by the United Kingdom to the Soviet Union, that there should be a cease-fire, a revival of the International Control Commission to supervise the cease-fire and the stabilization of the local scene, and an international conference of the kind which gave rise t&#60;* the Geneva Accords in 1954. </para>
          <para> We all felt that there should be created in Laos a more broadly based government which could, by commanding wide support in Laos, eliminate avoidable causes of international strife. </para>
          <para>We made it clear that we did not wish Laos to become a satellite of either the Communist or the nonCommunist Powers. We desired it to be independent, united, sovereign and neutral. We felt that if Laos were unalined with any power or group of powers, no good excuse would arise for further Communist intervention. </para>
          <para>We had, and I now more than ever have, great hopes that the Soviet Union would accept the United Kingdom proposals. But we affirmed that, should there continue to be an active military attempt to obtain control of Laos, members of Seato are prepared, collectively and in the terms of the treaty, to take whatever action may be appropriate in the circumstances. We all hope and believe that no military intervention will be necessary. There can be no actual commitment of forces except by the decisions of governments. I say this because I would wish to dispose of any idea that Seato is either truculent or aggressive. But it is necessary to say that if, unhappily, collective Seato action is forced upon us, we will need to act together , or find Seato weakened and destroyed. </para>
          <para class="block">I must not dwell on these possibilities. At present, we have high hopes of a peaceful settlement and should concentrate our efforts upon it. </para>
          <para>Before I conclude, I would like to say two things: The first is that this statement of mine, though inevitably expressed very largely in the first person - since I have been actively and personally concerned in these matters, and have no desire to escape my great personal responsibilities - expresses the views of Cabinet, which has taken a full share in its preparation. </para>
          <para>The second is that I have had no desire to rehearse differences, or merely to criticize decisions already taken. But over a period of a quarter of a century, it has been my privilege to have something to do, or say, or write, about the Commonwealth. It is something dear to our hearts. It means, and will mean, much for sanity and tolerance in a grievously troubled world. </para>
          <para>We shall play our part with as much vigour and determination as in the past. We maintain our faith in the Commonwealth, inits value to its member nations, and in its ability to make constant and notable contributions to the peace and prosperity of the world and of all its peoples. &#39;Controversies have arisen about myown attitude towards recent events. It is, if I may say so, only justthat my reasons for my views should be plainly stated to the Australian Parliament, which has given me its generous confidence for so many years, and to the Commonwealth of which I have tried to be a loyal servant. </para>

          <para class="block">This is a very important debate. The Prime Minister spent a considerable time telling honorable members and the nation of the part that he played at the Prime Ministers&#39; Conference, and at several other international gatherings, in matters of very great importance to the world. In respect of what was done in relation to disarmament; in respect of what was done in relation to the United Nations and the Congo, and in respect of all the efforts that are being made to establish peace in Laos as a selfgoverning independent neutral country, there can be no objection by any one, but on the question of South Africa about which the Prime Minister spoke for so long, I have a good deal to say because the Opposition does not agree with the conclusions that the Prime Minister has reached and will offer quite a lot of convincing evidence to prove a case contrary to that which has been made by my right honorable friend. </para>
          <para>On 22nd March last, I had the honour to initiate a debate, as a matter of urgent public importance, on the arrogant and provocative statements made by the Prime Minister after the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#39; Conference on the question of South Africa. In that debate I was followed by my colleagues, the honorable members for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen)</inline> and Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Allan Fraser)</inline> but we were the only Opposition members who were permitted to participate in the debate. Six days previously the Minister for Trade <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> who was then Acting Prime Minister, made a statement to the House in reply to a question that I had asked him concerning South Africa&#39;s decision to leave the Commonwealth of Nations. On behalf of the Government he stated that he regretted South Africa&#39;s decision and, speaking for the Opposition, I agreed with what &#34; he had to say. I remember saying too that everything should be done to strengthen and nothing should be done to weaken the Commonwealth of Nations. I also expressed the hope that one day South Africa, under another Prime Minister and with a reversal of its policy of apartheid, would rejoin the Commonwealth of Nations. </para>
          <para>I am sure that no one - not even Ministers and Government supporters, no matter how much they may have applauded the Prime Minister to-night - expected him to criticize and to condemn in such extravagant language what was said at the Prime Ministers&#39; Conference. The statement that he made in London at his press conference on Sunday, 19th March, and the speech that he delivered to the Australia Club at the Savoy Hotel on the following night, were so remarkable as to be almost unbelievable. It might have been well if all that was said could be forgotten, but unfortunately what was said was so provocative and challenging and contained so many implied reflections upon other member nations, including African and Asian nations, that not only did the Prime Minister harm himself and his own reputation but he also gravely harmed Australia&#39;s reputation and embarrassed us greatly with other members of the Commonwealth and with the nations of South-East Asia. </para>
          <para>How badly he damaged our association with the Commonwealth of Nations was evidenced quickly by the action that was taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmillan,</inline> the British Prime </para>

I am not claiming that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmillan</inline> was right in charging the right honorable gentleman with that offence but the inference is very clear that that was what he meant. Yet the Prime Minister to-night spoke in almost affectionate terms of his friend, the British Prime Minister! There is not the slightest difficulty, however, in convincing every purblind Liberal and even the most backward member of the Country Party that the British Prime Minister categorically denied the Australian Prime Minister&#39;s statements on at least four or five important and major counts.

What shocked  the conference  was that the policy of the present South African Government appeared to set up what  wewould  regard as an inherited practice. Inherited from the past perhaps as a philosophy of action for the future. </para>

He said that what had happened to South Africa in respect of apartheid could happen to us in respect of our white Australia policy. </para>

I know that he has been having a very bad time from the newspapers lately, but I think that he has deserved most of it. He has brought the trouble on his own head. In his measured tones to-night, and in that splendid rhetoric of which he is capable, and in some oratorical passages too, he has sought to extricate himself from all of it, and has said &#34; Macmillan and I are friends again. Everything is quite all right in our Commonwealth. We are all working for the Commonwealth.&#34; If he had thought that way before he went to London recently, and had behaved accordingly, he might have been able to be more helpful to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmillan</inline> in the work he was attempting to do. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister has referred to disarmament, and I want to say something on that matter too, because every member of this Parliament - certainly every member of the Opposition - is vitally concerned with the success of any scheme, under the control of the United Nations, to bring about universal disarmament and the banning of the nuclear weapon. No nation has a monopoly of that desire. The Russians fear the use of nuclear weapons just as much as does the West. Every human being would like to see an end put to war. You have only to consider the enormous waste that is taking place at the present time in order to see how suicidal it all is from any point of view. </para>
          <para>In the European-descended world, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> - the civilized world, as we like to regard it - we are spending practically all of &#163;148,500,000 a day, or just on &#163;6,300,000 an hour, on arms, armaments and armies, and the United States and the Soviet are spending between them about 73 per cent, of this huge total. The United States figure is 55 per cent, of the United States Federal budget and about 9.2 per cent, of the gross national product of the United States. The Soviet is said to be spending &#163;18,900,000,000 a year, or something like 49 per cent, of the total Russian budget, on war preparedness and defence. This amounts roughly to 12 per cent, of Russia&#39;s gross national product. Communist China is spending about 6 per cent, of its gross national product on its military forces. This amounts to &#163;2,700,000,000 a year. </para>
          <para>If world-wide disarmament were achieved, if there were a ban, under the auspices of the United Nations, on the production of nuclear weapons, and if the ban were universally observed, at least 15,000,000 men now serving in armies, navies and air forces would be available to fight want and disease by increasing the production of goods and food. There are about 3,000,000,000 hungry people in the world to-day and these could all be properly fed, and all the sick could be provided with medical care if the vast expenditure on arms were halted. That expenditure is costing the world &#163;18 a year for every man, woman and child now living. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, I</inline>turn now to the events of last October, because in our motion we refer to those events. Honorable members will recollect that at the end of October last year the Prime Minister made a special and urgent flight to attend the United Nations because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Khrushchev</inline> and other important world leaders had decided to be present at a meeting of the General Assembly. It is no exaggeration to say that when he left this country most Australians hoped that the Prime Minister would help to find the solution of the problem of a Summit meeting. I personally wished him well. To the consternation of everybody, however, immediately on arrival in the United States he went into conference with  President  Eisenhower and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmillan,</inline> and sold them on the idea that he should move an amendment to the Afro-Asian five-power resolution calling for a Summit meeting. He neither met nor tried to meet those who had put down this resolution. In the result, Australia got four votes for its amendment out of a possible 97, and those four votes were duty votes. The unworldly Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt),</inline> seeking to explain what had happened, said that Russia would have voted for the amendment but did not want to offend the Afro-Asian bloc. It never seemed to strike the Prime Minister, or the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Garfield Barwick)</inline> or the Treasurer, all of whom were personally in New York at the time - all on urgent public business, of course - that the AfroAsian bloc should not be offended or insulted or made to feel inferior in any way by anything Australia did. The Prime Minister described their resolution as useless and in the end it was withdrawn. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nehru,</inline>after he had made a blistering attack on our Prime Minister, withdrew his motion.

The Prime Minister said that he believed the resolution to be useless because the United States  President  and the Soviet Premier had both said that neither would meet the other except under conditions that were obviously not capable of being reconciled; but, as everybody knows, if the resolution submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nehru</inline> and his friends been passed, neither the American nor the Russian leader could have ignored the decision. The weight of world opinion would have been against whichever one of them refused to attend a meeting which the other was prepared to attend. By helping to pass the resolution which his fumbling, heavy-handed methods destroyed, the right honorable gentleman would have been doing what the smaller powers wanted done and what he himself envisaged when expressing his views on the functioning of the United Nations during the debate in the House of Representatives on 5th September, 1945.

            <para>If, when we say that a nation is neutral, that it will not under any circumstances take arms in any conflict which does not concern the protection of its own immediate boundaries, it seems to me to be a notion hard to reconcile with the charter of the United Nations which contemplates under certain circumstances the use of combined force in terms of the charter itself. </para>

          <para class="block">I answer the Prime Minister by saying: What can India do? What can Ceylon do? They have no forces. They have no strength. India has 400,000,000 people and most of them are starving. They have no great resources. Men such as Nehru are saving their nation from communism. The attitude of the Menzies Government is to drive these people into the arms of the Communists. The Prime Minister must know that what he has said is a complete distortion of the situation. The neutral powers have striven to remain independent of either large power grouping and, at the same time, to strengthen the United Nations. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister&#39;s condemnation extends also, I presume, to the age old neutrality of Switzerland and Sweden and implies a criticism of the Austrian acceptance of a neutralist position.  His  criticism must have stunned a man such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nehru</inline> because without neutrality much of what has been accomplished to keep the world at peace could never have been achieved. Nehru has played his part in helping to preserve peace in the world. If it were not for the neutral powers, the United Nations would never be in a position now to take the preventive steps that it has taken in the Congo, Laos and, earlier, in Korea and the Middle East. </para>
          <para>I do not wish to delay the House very long. It has been generous to me. But at least I have something to offer by way of constructive criticism on behalf of the Opposition and on behalf of those whom we have the honour to represent. If the Prime Minister were a statesman he would not behave as he does at almost every international gathering that he attends, be it the United Nations or the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#39; Conferences. He should be seeking ways and means to strengthen and expand the influence of both these bodies which are so vital to our very existence and, on the broader plane, so vital to the peace and happiness of mankind. </para>
          <para>Why has our travel-stained, speech-happy Prime Minister never tried to do anything about Malta, now at cross-purposes with the the United Kingdom Government? Why has he not tried to bring Burma back into the Commonwealth, or to unite the 32 counties of Ireland, now unhappily partitioned, and bring that country back into the Commonwealth? All that the Prime Minister wants to do is to follow a policy of fragmentation, cutting countries off one by one until the only people left will be those who are eligible for membership of the Carlton Club in London. Unfortunately, the foreign affairs policy of the Menzies Government is the private property of the Prime Minister. He makes it and changes it as he likes. He does so without reference to principles or precedents. It is largely an opportunist policy which varies with his moods. Both he and his Government are deserving of censure for this lamentable state of affairs. If honorable members opposite want to hear support for what I have said they need only walk the streets of any city of Australia and observe the reactions of Australian people - decent, honest, Australians, working for a living and proud of their work - to the Government&#39;s actions in international affairs. The Government is just as likely to be defeated at the next general election on its foreign affairs policy, with its many reversals of attitude, as it is on its internal policy and its many changes and reversals. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister of Australia could say anything on international affairs and the Asin and African peoples, as well as the Americans, would regard his observations as proving that he is completely, pathologically, incapable of understanding the developments that have occurred in international relationships in the twentieth century. The Prime Minister cannot understand the Asian people and the Asian people have given up all hope of trying to understand him - at least since October of last year. What the Prime Minister said in London after the Prime Ministers&#39; Conference on the South African issue has destroyed whatever influence he or his Ministers, past or present, ever had  in  Asia. </para>

          <para>I thought for a while that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> was going to confine his remarks entirely to South Africa&#39;s withdrawal from the Commonwealth of Nations. I must say that I was very pleased when he touched on the other points which had been dealt with by the Prime Minister in his long and much appreciated address. I believe that what the Leader of the Opposition said will give cause for debate on both sides of this House, but the amendment which he has proposed will not be acceptable to this House or, indeed, to the people of Australia. Before I conclude, I shall foreshadow a further amendment which I intend to move later when the one at present before us has been disposed of. </para>

Obviously, he did not give close attention to it, because he could not have made the statements which he did make if he had paid any attention at all to the speech as it was delivered by the Prime Minister or as it was circulated in roneoed form.

In view of the fact that we have already lost what we term an initial member of the Commonwealth, surely the other members of the Commonwealth must have cause for reflection on the need to establish likewise a Commonwealth Relations Office within their own spheres of influence in order that the ties of the Commonwealth may be tightened rather than loosened. </para>

          <para>The Opposition has stated that we have had a complete reversal of policy on the part of the Australian Government. The Leader of the Opposition expressed himself on this in typical classical Calwellese. as reported in the &#34; West Australian &#34; of Monday, 10th April. Referring to the Australian vote in the United Nations, that newspaper reported - </para>

            <para>Federal Opposition Leader Calwell said yesterday that the decision of the Menzies Government to vote against apartheid in the United Nations was completely opposite to the attitude adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#39; Conference and subsequently. &#34;The Prime Minister&#39;s argument was that the question was a matter of domestic concern to South Africa only &#34;, he said. &#34; In this respect he was consistent, because Australia put up the same attitude last year and previously when the matter was under discussion at the United Nations. &#34;The Government&#39;s acrobatic feats on its foreign as well as its domestic policies have made Australia the laughing stock of both the British Commonwealth and the United Nations.&#34; </para>

          <para class="block">This is the theory that you cannot win. and it should be looked at in the light of what actually happened as we have been told in the statement made by the Prime Minister this evening. Obviously, there has been no reversal of the Government&#39;s opinion. In the first place, the attempt to retain South Africa in the Commonwealth was an attempt to retain her in the family of the Commonwealth. In the light of the development of conferences of Commonwealth Prime Ministers since the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, this was an idealistic move to assist, not the people who were responsible for the policy of apartheid, but the people who were the victims of that policy. This was the move for which the Prime Minister has been condemned by the Opposition. </para>
          <para>What has been the history of this resolution before the United Nations since it was first brought up in 1952? Australia originally voted against it, as did the United </para>
          <para class="block">Kingdom. For the last two years, Australia has abstained and the United Kingdom has still voted against it. This year, the United Kingdom voted for it, and so did Australia. At that stage, of course, South Africa was not a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. So the accusations that are made of a turnabout in policy are quite fallacious and stupid. Australia is in a position to make her decisions on foreign policy, and to make them in the best interests of the. people concerned. </para>
          <para>I wonder what the attitude of the Opposition would have been to-night if Australia had voted with Portugal against the resolution moved by the three powers. If you study the 25-power resolution, you will find that after deploring, deprecating, affirming and noting certain matters, it then sets out the line suggested to be taken, and it is obvious that any nation would vote against it. The fifth paragraph of the resolution proposed by the 25 member nations recommended that all States should consider taking steps to break off diplomatic relations with the Union Government or refrain from establishing such relations, to close their ports to all vessels flying the South African flag, to prohibit their ships from entering South African ports, to boycott all South African goods and to refrain from exporting goods to South Africa. Honorable members may remember that there was an attempted move in this House to have the Australian Government place a ban on the import of all South African goods and to ban the export of goods to South Africa. This in itself would have been the quickest possible method of penalizing the people of whom honorable members opposite declare themselves to be in favour. Hardships would have been imposed, first, on the Bantu people of South Africa to whom, they say, we are opposed. The whole of this resolution shows that there was no turnabout of opinion at all by the Australian Government. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition spoke about disarmament, which had been mentioned in the Prime Minister&#39;s speech. I, too, believe that idealistically the world needs disarmament, but it seems strange to me that people do not realize that we of the Western world and of the British Commonwealth have never raised forces with the idea of aggression. The whole of our armaments are designed to protect ourselves from threats arising from other parts of the world. </para>
          <para>It is quite useless to talk about disarmament until we have a complete agreement between the main nations concerned to adhere to the rules laid down by a United Nations disarmament committee. It is quite obvious to every one who has studied this problem over the years that the Soviet states have consistently refused to accept openskies inspection. I invite honorable members to recall the outcry that arose in parts of Australia at the shooting down of a U2 spy plane. Why was it necessary to send that aircraft over Russia at that time, and to send similar aircraft on like missions during the preceding five months? It was necessary because it was felt that the Soviet states were likely to be aggressors. They were the ones threatening world security and refusing open inspection of their armaments. If it is considered wrong in the minds of some people to send such aircraft in those circumstances, all I can say is that it is not considered to be wrong in the minds of the great majority of Australians, who want to ensure their own future security. </para>
          <para>We have seen statements in the press of Australia, since the Prime Ministers&#39; Conference, suggesting that the Prime Minister has been arrogant in his approach. In this connexion I suggest that honorable members look at the concluding parts of the statement made to-night by the Prime Minister, dealing with the situation in Laos, When the right honorable gentleman was met at the airport by a newspaper man seeking an interview - and it is quite obvious that the Prime Minister did not seek a press interview - he said that he was to report to this House the facts surrounding his overseas mission. Imagine the consternation and perturbation of the Opposition if the statement which he made to-night had been made to the Australian press for dissemination in the way that the press thought fit. In fairness to the Prime Minister it should be realized that he has given us a full statement on matters concerning Laos, and he has given it in the place in which it should have been given, and where members of this Parliament were entitled to hear it. </para>
          <para>Let me turn again to the amendment moved by the Opposition, which suggests, among other things, that we have done great harm to the nations of South-East Asia. I heard the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt),</inline> by interjection, refer to the harm that had been done in the past in the Philippines and other parts of South-East Asia by rather foolish utterances made by honorable members who now sit opposite when they were on this side of the House. </para>
          <para>There is also in this resolution a request that the House censure and remove the right honorable gentleman from the office of Minister of State for External Affairs. As I said at the beginning of my speech, I believe that in the heat, excitement, sentiment and political partisanship existing at the present time, this matter has not been looked at in its proper perspective. When history is written and the matter is looked at in retrospect, I believe that the Prime Minister will be accepted as a person of whom this country may be justly proud for his efforts overseas on our behalf, not only for his efforts at the Prime Ministers&#39; Conference, but also for his efforts in cementing friendly relations with the American Administration. Surely the Opposition cannot criticize the proposition that the Australian people should be on friendly relations with America, with the future so much in doubt. Only last week I received a letter from the Union of Australian Women protesting at the establishment of military bases in the north of Western Australia. In replying to that letter I said that there were no such military bases, but that I had heard there was a radio station, and I would say that I appreciate the co-operation of the American defence forces in ensuring that the Pacific is a safe place in which to live. </para>
          <para>In conclusion, let me foreshadow an amendment in the following terms, which I will propose at a later stage: - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This House welcomes the cordial relations established by the Prime Minister with President Kennedy and senior members of his Administration. It commends the Prime Minister for his efforts, at the conference of Prime Ministers in London, to preserve the unity of the Commonwealth, and for his vigorous expression of Australia&#39;s views on matters of vital concern to Australia at this conference and at the Seato conference in Bangkok. </para>
            <para>This House places on record the appreciation of the Australian Parliament and people for his distinguished service in these and other important directions in the course of his recent overseas mission as head of the Australian Government. </para>

            <para>.- The resolution of which the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chaney)</inline> has just given notice is strikingly ironical. If one thing emerges more clearly than any other from the personalized diplomacy of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs, it is that he has left us more friendless and made us more misunderstood than anybody could have dreamt of even only five years ago. Australia, during his regime as Minister for External Affairs, has not heeded America&#39;s advice on colonial issues. The Government changed its policy in the United Nations only when the United Kingdom changed its policy. It did not change its policy when  President  Kennedy made it quite plain that he intended to adopt a different- attitude on colonial issues from that taken by his predecessor, ex-President Eisenhower. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> showed very clearly how far out on a limb the Australian Prime Minister has now got himself in the Commonwealth and in the United Nations. He quoted several statements showing how <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmillan</inline> directly rebuffed the Australian Prime Minister and repudiated his remarks. But there are other examples of this. A striking one occurred when, on 19th March, 1961, at a press conference in London, the Australian Prime Minister said - </para>

          <para>The fate of the Commonwealth is a matter of very great sentimental as well as practical significance to Australia. The Commonwealth is the best bridge - in many ways it is the only bridge - between the Europeantype countries on the one hand and the countries of Asia and Africa on the other hand. It is the only bridge between countries which have a complex industrial society and long-established political institutions and on the other hand countries which are seeking to establish industrial and political societies along the lines which Britain did so much to transmit to them. The Australian Prime Minister has gone out of his way to suggest that the Commonwealth has been weakened by the defection of South Africa. We should make it quite plain in this Parliament and in this country that the Commonwealth is stronger for South Africa, under its present outlaw government, leaving the Commonwealth. We all agree that the Commonwealth would be stronger if a South African Government representing the free will of all the inhabi tants of South Africa were in it, but it is because there is no chance of this coming about under the present regime that South Africa is out of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para class="block">The Commonwealth now is more worthwhile than it was a month ago. The only Prime Minister in the last month for whom our Prime Minister has had any word of real praise is the Prime Minister of South Africa. 1 shall recall some of the fulsome tributes our Prime Minister has paid. He said that he is a man of obvious honesty, great courtesy and great lucidity, that his arguments &#34; did him very great credit &#34;, that he comported himself &#34; with very great dignity &#34;, that he &#34; expressed his own case very powerfully &#34;, that he speaks &#34; with great sincerity &#34; and that &#34; he is a man of singular integrity, a most impressive man&#34;. To-night, the Prime Minister recalled the comradeship between our countries during the last war at Tobruk and El Alamein and so on. What was <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd</inline> doing during the last war? What was he doing in the Transvales, which he owned and controlled at that time? The Prime Minister said - not here but at one of his press conferences - that he was not an apostle of apartheid. That may be, but he certainly appeared to the whole world as its chief acolyte. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister has at last to-night deplored the Sharpeville incident. When the Labour Party raised this matter in the House a year ago, he said that we should wait until the royal commission had reported on this matter. He said that the South African Prime Minister had done what any Australian Prime Minister would do and that is appoint a distinguished judge to inquire into the matter. This inquiry concluded on 24th January last and a summary of the report was contained in the &#34; Sydney Morning Herald &#34;. Incidentally, the &#34; Age &#34; carried the same summary, so it appears in two sources which the Prime Minister would find equally palatable. The summary said - </para>

          <para>How much longer must we wait? Tonight, after consulting with his colleagues, he has apparently come to see that his arguments and his excuses are no longer tenable. </para>
          <para>The question of apartheid not only arose in the Commonwealth. There is also thequestion of the attitude Australia should take on apartheid as a member of the United Nations. Let it be understood forthwith that the United Nations will no longer tolerate the excuse of domestic jurisdiction on these matters - nor should it. Not only has Australia subscribed to the Declaration of Human Rights but we have also subscribed - it is in our statutebook - to the Charter of the United Nations. The charter in articles 55 and 56 makes plain that all members pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in co-operating with the organization for the achievment of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion. We are all committed to this policy and have been since 1945. </para>
          <para>South Africa undertook this enactment and has never carried it out. I know it will be said that this is purely a pious or a precatory statement in the charter. The fact is that in all the various language versions except the English language the same words were used in these articles as are used in the other articles which impose legal obligations on members of the United Nations. And the leading international lawyers appointed to tribunals such as the World Court and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights by Britain and France have subscribed to that point of view - that Articles 55 and 56 of the charter impose on members the legal obligation to see that there is no discrimination, on the basis of race, between any of the people within their borders. It is not a question of domestic jurisdiction and it is a shabby subterfuge still to assert that it is. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister now says that there was no change in our view in the United Nations, and that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hood</inline> addressed that body he did not say how we were going to vote - for or against South Africa&#39;s policy of apartheid. Of course, he did not. He expected to abstain, as Australia ignominiously did at the session before last. &#34;That was intended; and it was typical of the slick subterfuges to which the Prime Minister resorts on these occasions. </para>

          <para>It is not sufficiently realized that Australia, as I said at the commencement, is getting more misunderstood and more friendless with every participation by the Prime Minister in international affairs. In the Suez affair we lined up with three other countries. Last year in the United Nations on the Australian amendment - that is the one which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nehru</inline> exposed - we lined up with four others. Let me further illustrate our isolation by giving details of voting in the first part of the current session. In this early part of the session there were 52 roll calls and on those Australia and the United Kingdom always voted together, but Canada voted with ui&#171;n&#187;Jy 33 times, New Zealand only 39 times, Pakistan only 26 times, Ghana and India only four times, Nigeria only three times, Malaya only fifteen times and Indonesia, our neighbour, only four times. Ireland, with which we have historic ties, voted with us only 24 times, and Burma, with which we also have historic ties, only six times. The United States voted beside us only 43 times out of 52. We have been in minorities varying between two and nine out of 99 nations. </para>
          <para>The plain fact is that as shown by the way we vote in the United Nations we do not consult or value the views of other members of the British Commonwealth, or of Seato or of any .other association. We are becoming more and more friendless, particularly since President Kennedy has come into office and has voted against the colonial powers on Angola and South-west Africa and so on. We were still abstaining on the question of South-west Africa last week. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister has shown himself to be more out of touch with world affairs than any of his predecessors. He has been less successful and more disastrous, internationally, than any other Prime Minister we have ever had. He reels from rebuff to rebuff and his failures are becoming more frequent and more resounding. He takes each reverse with worse grace. The tides of colonialism and racial domination have receded and they have left him, like a stranded whale, moaning and forlorn. We cannot afford to carry this burden any longer. He should resign before he brings Australian still more into odium with the rest of the world and its associates in the Commonwealth, in Seato and with all our neighbours. </para>

            <para>.- We have heard in the speech of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitlam)</inline> a very bitter attack on the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> But from where does the Opposition get its information on foreign affairs? That is a point I would like to make. On all economic matters the Opposition has quoted exhaustively from newspaper reports. From what other source does Labour, in opposition, get its information? Only from newspaper reports, and it quotes newspaper reports on every single measure in this House, Members of the Opposition have only one source of information; they have to rely on the newspapers. It is interesting to note that fact because some people are not foolish enough to rely on newspaper reports. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We have heard from the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition an attack, again and again, on the Prime Minister&#39;s two speeches in the United Nations. Here is a case where he made headlines in the American press, and the headlines were entirely complimentary and said that he was doing a great job. At the same time we have a State Labour Minister of State, the honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sheehan,</inline> who was present at both the Prime Minister&#39;s speeches in the United Nations, telling a civic reception in Young - he said it also in the Parliament in Sydney - that when he was there he was so impressed with the magnificent speech of the Prime Minister that he. was proud to be an Australian. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sheehan,</inline> the Minister for Health in New South Wales - a Labour Minister - at a civic reception in Young said, &#34; I was proud to be an Australian when I heard this speech made, but when I came back to Australia I found that the whole of that speech was grossly misrepresented &#34;. Yet, on that basis Labour produced its urgency motion - on the say-so of a newspaper report. </para>
          <para>What sort of Opposition to a federal government is that on the vital matter of external affairs? What was the resolution that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> spoke so strongly against? It was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nehru&#39;s</inline> resolution. Let us see who supported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nehru.</inline> We have Soekarno of Indonesia, Tito of Yugoslavia and Nasser of the United Arab Republic. Those were the people who supported India in this resolution to require the  President  of the United States of America, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eisenhower,</inline> on the eve of his resigning, to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Khrushchev.</inline> Here was a man on the point of resigning and who could not commit his nation at all; yet the resolution demanded that he negotiate with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Khrushchev.</inline> What kind of equality of negotiation was that when it was the result of weakness? Was that the kind of resolution to be expected of any elder statesman? After all, our Prime Minister is regarded in the world to-day as an elder statesman, a man with a profound knowledge of human feelings, and a man with a history of negotiations. He is the man who in 50 or 100 years will be talked of as an historical figure, but the people who have criticized him will be lost in the oblivion of time. </para>
          <para>We have a Labour State Minister, an able man, who states that the Prime Minister made a magnificent speech, yet speaker after speaker from the Opposition side have derided him. The Opposition should not forget that the right honorable gentleman is the national Prime Minister, and that they are not helping the nation nor giving support politically by talking about our Prime Minister in this way. The Labour Party view is the view of the press from which it derives its opinions. </para>
          <para>As to the London conference, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition stated that the Prime Minister had said that it was a bad thing to weaken the Commonwealth of Nations by forcing out South Africa. The Labour Party used for its own purposes the statement of the British Prime Minister who said that he did not agree with that point of view. These are not matters of fact; they are matters of opinion. But we have this fact: The Prime Minister of Australia, an elder statesman, has years of experience in Prime Ministers&#39; Conferences while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmillan,</inline> although a very able man, is still much younger in these matters than is the Prime Minister of Australia. </para>
          <para>Tunku Abdul Rahman, a man of great stature whom I admire immensely, and who will I think unite the three races of Malaya into one multi-racial nation, has suggested that South Africa&#39;s departure will not weaken the Commonwealth. However, he also is a new boy. As I have said, these are not matters of fact; they are purely matters of opinion, and in these matters I am prepared to back the opinion of our own Prime Minister. </para>
          <para>In any case, why not reason this out for ourselves? The Prime Ministers agreed not to argue about the domestic policies of member nations. Honorable members will recall the speech that was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd</inline> when he returned to South Africa. He claimed that his country was forced out of the Commonwealth because of intense bitterness and vindictiveness by others. It cannot be claimed that our Prime Minister made that statement; it was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd</inline> himself. Nearly all members of the Commonwealth have some problem of a similar nature in their own country. Ceylon, Ghana and India each are confronted with difficulties of some kind. To-day the Afro-Asian members of the Commonwealth do not want South Africa in it; to-morrow they themselves may be under criticism. This procedure could cause great trouble for future Prime Ministers at future conferences. </para>
          <para>I agree with our Prime Minister that it is very sad that South Africa should have left the Commonwealth. He made a point that must be borne in mind by the Opposition: It is not a government that has been excluded from the Commonwealth, it is a nation, 45 per cent, of which is composed of English speaking people and 55 per cent, of Afrikaanders. Then there is the great mass of native races in that country. The Prime Minister referred to the historical relations between South Africa and Asia, and stated that we had fought side by side in two wars - at Deville Woods in the First World War and at El Alamein in the Second World War. Do you think that that means nothing to us? But the honorable member for Werriwa referred to it sneeringly. Our relations with South Africa should not be forgotten. The present Government of that country will not always be in control and we should be patient until it is changed. But to me it is a tragedy that a foundation member of the British Commonwealth of Nations has left it. Those are matters that the Prime Minister, with his wealth of experience, has very rightly deplored. There is no question in my mind that he does not agree with apartheid, which is a policy that we would not care to advance. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition spoke very strongly about disarmament and cited numerous figures to indicate the enormous sums of money that are being spent on instruments of war, but he forgot to say what his solution of the problem is. All he said was that there is a need for disarmament and he dismissed the question from his mind because he claimed that it is a matter for the United Nations. The Prime Minister&#39;s speech was a reasoned careful expose of what we must expect i&#34; relation to disarmament. </para>
          <para>Consider the attack that is being made ai present on the United Nations structure. The Soviet bloc is attacking it constant!&#39; in an endeavour to create disorder and to weaken its effectiveness. The Leader of the Opposition agrees with the Government and with the rest of the world that we must have disarmament, but what protection will there be if the United Nations <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> rendered ineffective? In view of the deliberate attack that the Soviet bloc is making in an effort to destroy the executive of the United Nations, should we disarm and then take the risk of suddenly finding that the United Nations is sterile and unable to help us? Is that the kind of statesmanlike approach that the Labour Party has to disarmament? Or has it not read the latest report in the press and so cannot state its policy until it finds out what the press thinks of disarmament? </para>
          <para>The position in Laos could be very dangerous for Australia. I think that the determination of our Prime Minister and the forthrightness of the communique which was issued from the Seato conference is of first-class importance. There is a tendency on the part of the Opposition to use for its own purposes various aspects of foreign affairs from which it hopes to gain political advantage. At present South Africa is in the limelight. Many people feel unhappy about the situation that has arisen and in relation to which Australia has taken a stand. But that stand will be misinterpreted, and the Opposition will always refer to the tragedy of Sharpeville. I have heard the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen)</inline> and every member of the Opposition who has spoken on this subject refer time and time again to Sharpeville. The honorable member for Werriwa referred in a sneering way to the report of the royal commission on Sharpeville. The incident at Sharpeville was not ordered by the Government; so far as I know it was the error of an excitable police officer. But the incident at Sharpeville is minor when compared with the horrors of Tibet. 1 challenge any honorable member to find in &#34; Hansard &#34; one single condemnation by the Opposition of China&#39;s action in Tibet. I can assure the House that there is not one reference to Tibet, but Sharpeville has been mentioned in every speech by Opposition members. Sharpeville was an ugly incident which involved the killing of some 130 people, but in Tibet thousands are being murdered, children are being taken from their families and people are being exiled from- their country. Genocide of the worst order is being practised. Curiously enough, these horrors are being perpetrated by an ally of the Soviet. No reference to this matter by members of the Opposition appears in any debates on external affairs. </para>

              <para>-  Yes, the right honorable gentleman has done so time and time again. So also has every other member of the Government. The honorable member will find that every single supporter of the Government has deplored the treatment of Tibet but never once has the honorable member himself ever done so. The situation there has never been deplored by the honorable member for Parkes, or by the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward);</inline> if he knows where Tibet is. We have this continued harping on one episode because it might have political significance, irrespective of the value of such: comment to Australia and the world. We never hear any comments from the Opposition on the young freedom fighters of Hungary who were put into gaol at fifteen years of age and held there until they were eighteen because the death penalty in </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Hungary can be enforced only on persons who have reached the age of eighteen years. When these young freedom fighters reached their eighteenth birthday they were quietly executed. We have not heard one word from the Opposition about Hungary because Hungary is in the Soviet bloc. The same Opposition now claims that the Prime Minister should be relieved of office and that those who now sit in Opposition should take over control of external affairs. </para>
          <para>I have travelled in Asia as have many members of the Opposition. How are Australians regarded in Asia? They are regarded with the highest respect. Does that bear out the opinions that have been expressed by the Leader of the Opposition and his deputy? Australia is highly respected in Asia just as we respect the Asians. The Malayans have a very warm affection for the Australian people and we reciprocate that feeling. The first Malayan legation building erected outside Malaya in any part of the world was built in Canberra by Tunku Abdul Rahman Would the Tunku have done that if. he did not respect us? Would he not have built a legation building in Great Britain, India or Germany? The fact is that he built such a place in Canberra because he has a warm regard for the Australian people. He knows, that we are his friends and that the Malayans are our friends. If you go to India or any part of Asia, you find that we have the respect of the Asian people. Why? The answer is: Because of this Government&#39;s foreign policy. Our Government is closely associated with Asia. It is in the interests of Australia that our friendship should be placed among the Asian people. The Opposition cannot deny that Australia&#39;s prestige is high everywhere in Asia. </para>
          <para>If you examine the censure motion thai has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition, you find that it is not supported by any factual criticism but only by a repetition of the opinions of leader writers in the press. What value can be placed on such a motion? This Government has earned a reputation among coloured people for fair dealing. Our prestige is high in Asia because the Prime Minister and the Cabinet are respected in the Asian countries. I am very proud of our Prime Minister. He has come to be regarded in the world as an elder statesman.  His  word has carried great weight in world councils. He was criticized in a minor vote on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nehru&#39;s</inline> resolution only because the delegates to the United Nations did not have time to refer to their governments for instructions on how to vote. The Opposition in this House has done a great disservice to Australia by its attacks on our foreign policy. It takes no part in external affairs. This should be a non-party matter but the Opposition derives all its background on external affairs from newspaper reports. </para>

              <para>The Pacific Islands Regiment was raised  in  1944 and included the Papuan Infantry Battalion which was raised in 1940, and the 1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion. It was disbanded late in 1946 by which time five native infantry battalions had been raised. The regiment was raised again  in  May-June, 1951, on a permanent basis. </para>

              <para>The first post-war pay scale for native soldiers was issued on 14th March, 1951, and is shown  in  Table 1 appended. In accordance with Government policy, the rates were based on the pay and allowances of the native constabulary as promulgated in the &#34; Territory of Papua and New Guinea Gazette &#34;, No. 50, of 23rd December, 1950. It is emphasized that pay rates for native soldiers are assessed on an &#34; all found &#34; basis; that is, in addition to pay they receive free accommodation, rations, clothing, tobacco, soap and transport and, in certain circumstances, free rations and accommodation for their families. </para>

              <para>The first pay increase became effective from 1st June, 1955, the date on which similar increases were provided for the native constabulary. At the same time, because the original native pay system was &#39;becoming unwieldy with the expansion of the regiment and the introduction of additional trades, a group classification system was adopted. The increased rates for the respective groups are set out in Table 2 appended. During 1959 it became evident that certain anomalies existed in the native pay system, and a complete review of native conditions of service was carried out. This resulted in a recommendation being made for  a  revised pay structure, including the addition of a new, higher pay group. A rise in pay was effected by the member moving from the grouping held under the old pay structure to the next higher grouping in the new system, subject to qualification in his particular skill. The new pay scales, which are appended as Table 4, were approved by the &#39;Executive Council on 10th January, 1961, with retrospective effect to 1st July, 1960. Following agreement between employers and employees under which the wages of natives employed in private enterprise in the Territory were increased from 2nd January, 1961, a complete review is being made by the Papua and New Guinea Administration of pay and conditions of service for natives employed by the Administration, including members of the Royal Papuan and New Guinea Constabulary. Pending completion of the review, interim adjustments were made to the rates of pay of the natives with effect from 2nd January, 1961. Similar interim increases were made to the rates of pay of native soldiers of the Pacific Islands Regiment, effective from 2nd January, 1961, hut their rates of pay are also being reviewed simultaneously with natives of the Administration. The interim pay rates for the Pacific Islands Regiment are appended as Table 6. </para>

For example, it would not be possible to provide a fire service without providing training in the techniques of fire fighting and of operating the necessary equipment. It is for this reason that the department when preparing its estimates includes the above costs as part of the administrative, maintenance or operational costs of the organization, i.e., it does not isolate them as far as in-service training is concerned. However for administrative purposes it does isolate the costs of training carried out by agencies external to the department, e.g., flying training and training at universities and technical colleges.

        <para>Schools are established in all States to train  staff in the methods of installing and maintaining telecommunications equipment used by the department in providing telephone, telegraph and radio facilities. Prior to 1929, trainees attended technical colleges or other approved institutions, but by that date it was becoming increasingly evident that developments in the telecommunication field were drawing away from the type of course conducted by the colleges and institutions. Those institutions were geared more toward heavy direct and alternating current working, whereas telecommunication work was developing toward light currents and high frequencies. Consequently, much of the subject-matter included in technical college courses was redundant so far as departmental requirements were concerned, and, in the years between 1929 and 1954, departmental training facilities were extended and attendance at technical colleges progressively reduced. Since 1954, the complete training course for technicians-in-training has been conducted within the department, and this has permitted of a reduction in the theory content of the course by eliminating all matters not directly related to telecommunication practices. </para>

Where an officer attends a part-time training course, of, for example, one or two hours weekly over, several weeks, his. salary during these short training periods is. debited against his, normal branch classification account and not against training costs..

            <para>The Commonwealth Literary Fund awards fellowships to persons who have proved their capacity to do creative work in the field of literature. These fellowships are awarded to persons who have submitted proposals for a literary project. At present the value of a fellowship is approximately &#163;1,000 and usually three are awarded each year. The purpose of the fellow ship is to enable the writer to devote sufficient time to complete the project for which the fellowship was granted. The fund also assists in the publication of some manuscripts which have outstanding literary merit. Literary quality is the dominant criterion in providing such help. Insofar as scholastic works can and do on occasion have literary merit, the fund&#39;s activities in this particular field have some significance in education and research. The Office of Education is concerned with activities in a number of educational fields but does not itself conduct any educational institutions or carry out any programmes of training. The office was created by the Education Act of 1945 and its estimated expenditure for 1960-61 is &#163;222,600. The office is concerned with international relations in education, language work and migrant education programmes, the provision of information and advice on aspects of Australian education and with the secretariat work of the Commonwealth Scholarships Board and the National Advisory Committee for Unesco. It also plays a part in the administration of training schemes for students from overseas, e.g., training under the Colombo Plan. In carrying out these functions the office works in very close co-operation with other government departments and with State education departments. This is particularly so with migrant education, the administration of the Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme and the various international training schemes. The office also has the responsibility for expenditure on the Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme, estimated at &#163;2,487,000 in 1960-61; the scheme of Commonwealth co-operation in education, estimated at &#163;50,000 in 1961; and the </para>

            <para>The Public Service Board, as the central personnel authority for the Commonwealth Public Service, has a general responsibility for training and educational matters in the service. The nature of the board&#39;s participation or control varies with the scheme in question,but as far as possible, departments are encouraged to provide their own training in accordance with their individual requirements. To this extent, the board exercises a general oversight over departmental training, acting as an adviser and providing assistance as required. In addition, the board provides training for departmental officers in a number of specialized and general fields, arranges conferences of training staff, provides a central information service on training matters and conducts a variety of educational schemes. These activities are directed, as with a number of other functions of the board, towards improving the overall efficiency of the service but are not administered through any special educational institution.

In conformity with the intention of the act, which is to provide an eligible person with one home only, it has never been the practice to consider applications for the transfer of an existing loan to another home and applications for second loans have been considered only in exceptional circumstances. This policy was reviewed and affirmed by the Government in 1956 when it was decided that the granting of second loans would be limited to cases of grave emergency. </para>

The services may place orders overseas for specific items of equipment where there are significant economies in doing so and where there is no over-riding defence reason for it to be produced in Australia. It is not considered appropriate to give publicly detailed information on all the items mentioned. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for the Navy has provided the following answers: -  1. (a) The equipment to be used in a diving operation is invariably assembled, checked and tested by the diver who is to use the equipment. It is further checked by the supervisor in charge of the diving operation immediately before use, and is again checked and examined immediately after use. Cb) All diving equipment in current use is examined and tested weekly, in addition to those tests in (a) above, (c) Individual components of the apparatus are further tested periodically in accordance with maintenance specifications prepared by the manufacturer, the frequency of these tests will vary for each component, (d) In addition to the above, every item of diving equipment and breathing apparatus, whether in current use or in store, is surveyed annually by a qualified diving officer to ensure its suitability for operational use. 2. (a) With the exception of the circumstance described in paragraph (d) under, all divers are connected with the surface by lifeline: they are not necessarily accompanied by another diver actually in the water, (b) The lifeline is normally attended on the surface by an attendant, who is invariably a qualified diver, or in the case of a particular operation, the lifeline is attached to a float which is kept under surveillance by the attendant, (c) In addition to the &#34; attendant &#34;,  a  second diver is kept dressed in diving gear and immediately ready for diving whenever a diver is down, and a second attendant is provided for this &#34; stand-by &#34; diver. A qualified diving officer supervises the diving operation, (d) The exception referred to above is the occasion when divers are &#34; free swimming &#34;, i.e. without lifeline, but in this circumstance they are in company with  a  second diver and attached to him by  a  &#34;buddyline&#34;. </para>

              <para>It will be seen that, in order to send one diver down, a total of one diving officer and four divers are required, and &#39;.his number ensures the maximum degree of safety and least risk to the diver under water. The diver is, of course, in constant communication with the surface through his lifeline which, by a laid down code of signals, relays all the diver&#39;s requirements. 4. (a) The regulations provide that the attendant on the surface checks frequently that the diver is all right. The frequency of checking provides that there would be sufficient time to bring the diver to the surface, on his lifeline, in the event of a failure of which the diver was unable to give warning, (b) The precaution against a failure of which a diver can give warning is the provision of the stand-by diver: in the event of, say, the diver becoming fouled on an underwater object the stand-by can be sent to free him immediately, (c) There is, therefore, no advantage to be gained in having a second diver in the water, but much to be gained by having him rested and with full supply of air, ready on the surface. </para>

          <item label="(b)">
            <para>The regulations governing diving operations have been compiled after a great deal of operational experience by the Navy with a view to ensuring the maximum safety of the diver, and it is considered that no circumstance has been overlooked. Practices in emergency procedures and drills are an integral part of divers&#39; training and are thoroughly undergone before an operational dive takes place. </para>
