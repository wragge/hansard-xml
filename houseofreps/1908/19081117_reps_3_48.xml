          <para>.- I should not rise on this occasion, were it not for the urgency of the matter to which I desire to call attention. I have received the following copy of a letter written by the Queenscliff Town  Clerk  to the Secretary to the Department of Home Affairs - 1  am directed by my Council to state that they have received an intimation from the contractors, Messrs. Wilson and Sly, thatthey are about to commence some works in one of our reserves - Queenscliff - in connexion with the Defences. My Council are entirely in ignorance of what these works arc, or what portion or what extent of land it is proposed to take, and, although they do not pretend for a moment that they can prevent the Government resuming possession of land urgently required for the proper protection of the State - they do maintain that in common courtesy they should be considered in the matter, and informed as to the proposed curtailment of their reserves. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The land in question was permanentlyreserved for recreation purposes many years ago, and the Borough Council are trustees of the same, and have spent a considerable amount of money in fencing, &#38;c, from time to time, to make these available for the public; and if any portion of them is to be resumed by the Government, my Council are of opinion they should have a voice on the matter, so that the interests of the public they represent may be safeguarded. </para>
        <para class="block">The letter is dated 16th November. The present Minister of Home Affairs pro- bably knows nothing of this matter; but it is a very high-handed action for the officers of his Department to take possession of a reserve vested in a municipality without informing the council. In this case, the first notice received was from the contractors authorized by the Department. This reserve is held by the council as trustees for the public. It has planted trees and effected other improvements, and, in ordinary courtesy, councillors should have been notified by the Department of the intended action. I trust that the Minister will look into the matter, and give the assurance that such a thing will not happen again. </para>
