        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WENTWORTH</inline>(Mackellar) &#91;10.55&#93;. - In the few minutes that remain for this debate, I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Downer)</inline> and the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> E.  James Harrison) about the necessity to complete swiftly the short standard guage rail link between Broken Hill and Port Pirie. At present, the 4-ft. 8?-in. standard gauge Commonwealth line which goes from Port Pirie to Kalgoorlie, and also from Port Augusta up towards LeighCreek, is isolated from the rest of the standard gauge transport system. If we could provide the small link that is missing,we would be able to move rolling-stock on and off that line in case of emergency, and that is important. Let me say also that we should, concurrently, do something about providing a standard gauge line from Port Pirie to Adelaide. I think that could be done by converting one ofthe two 5-ft 3-in. lines which at present run down virtually in parallel. It would not be a very difficult matter to arrange. As the committee knows, the line running northwards from Port AugustatoLeigh Creek is at present being converted from 3 ft 6 in. to 4 ft.8? in. to permit coal traffic to be handled with greater economy. If, as I say, we had a standard gauge line from Port Pirie to Adelaide, that would give us a clear flow of coal traffic from Leigh Creek to Adelaide. It would also allow the rocket range at Woomera to be connected directly with the workshops at Salisbury which service it. Then if we completed the link, as I have suggested, from Broken Hill to Port Pirie, we would be also able to run standard gauge trains from Brisbane and Sydney right to Adelaide. I know these are matters which require money, but I do not believe they require an exorbitant amount of money. I believe that the works I suggest are economically desirable and stand by themselves as commercial propositions, but far addition, they would add considerablyto the defence potential of Australia. </para>
      <para>There is just one other point that I should like to make in the couple of minutes that remain. I agree with the honorable member for Blaxland that one of the great features in the operation of the Commonwealth railways has been the introduction of diesel-electric locomotives. </para>
      <para class="block">There is a good story to. be told in that regard, andI believe that the Government and the Commonwealth Railways. Commissioner have something tobe proud of. The lessons learned should be applied more generally to the railway systems of the various States. There is one other factor. The trans- Australian railway is a long through run, and the railways should be concentrated much more on the long through runs, rather than on the short hauls. It is probable that, for short hauls, other forms of transport can operate effectively. It is particularly on the long uninterrupted runs that the railway comes into its own, and we should be concentrating on that aspect. </para>

            <para>Payments up to 90 per cent. of the value of work completed efficiently are made to builders as they desire, providing there is a reasonable value of work completed. In some cases, payments are made weekly, in others fortnightly, having regard to the rate of progress by the builder. No payment would be made, of course, until the foundations were laid, but after that there is no set period and the builder can obtain progress payments frequently if he so desires, providing his progress is satisfactory. In special advance cases, i.e., where the applicant enters into the contract with the builder and an outside architect is employed, the only inspections by the division are when the builderrequests a progress payment and the applicant&#39;s architect certifies that the work has been done. Payments by the applicant to the builder or other value contributed direct by the applicant with the division&#39;s approval are taken into consideration in the 90 per cent. </para>

            <para>The Commonwealth Government vacated the price control field some years ago in favour of State governments. The State prices authority lifted all controls on zinc and zinc manufactures in May last since when the local prices have fluctuated in conformity with the London metal market as is the case with other metals such as lead and tin. The sole Australian producer of zinc dust is Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Limited, who advise that the current price of sine dust is &#163;144 15s. a ton f.o.b.Risdon in 10-ton lots. This would roughly be equivalent to &#163;168 in New South Wales depending on the margin added by distributors. When price control was lifted in May last, the f.o.b. Risdon price for zinc dust was &#163;116 a ton. It is many years since this price was so low as to allow distributors in Kew South Wales to sell at &#163;86 a ton. </para>

          <para>The Universities Commission has decided not to award benefits under the Commonwealth scholarship scheme to students undertaking a part-time course in any year in which the benefits are less than &#163;10. As a result  of  this decision scholarships which would be taken up by such students may  now  he awarded to students who can derive substantial benefits from the scholarship as, for instance, full-time students entitled to a living allowance. Generally the type of student who is excluded  from  benefits under this decision is a part-time student who either has private means or is in employment. The Universities Commission, however, has discretion in this  Hitter  and <inline font-style="italic">v</inline> prepared to &#39; consider, with the students&#39; interests in mind, the case of  able  students whose studies are being prejudiced because of financial hardship. This would include cases in which a student is in employment and is having financial difficulty in meeting his commitments. Such cases may he referred to the Universities Commission by the Education Departments who are responsible  for  the detailed administration  of  the scheme. The honorable member can be assured that South Australian students arc not penalized by the operation  of  the minimum benefits rule. Tn general, students at the University of Adelaide are required to pay more than &#163;10 in fees whether their courses are on a full-time or a part-time basis. If, however, there are special circumstances which result in students being required <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> pay  less than &#163;10 in any one year, students concerned should, if they feel that their studies are prejudiced through financial difficulties, raise  the  matter with the Education Departmentof South Australia who may, after examination, refer it to the Universities Commission. </para>

            <para>.  All surplus stocks of ammunition, explosives, andempty ammunition components are declared for disposal to the Department of Supply. An inter-departmental committee considers all such items issued by disposal, and recommends the method of disposal. The policy followed is that no item, dangerous to public safety or security, is permitted to reach the hands of the public; as much material as possibleis diverted to useful channels, and as much metal&#39; as economically possible is recovered for sale as  scrap.  In general, all cartridges, powder filled fuzes, and large calibre shell are broken down or boiled out and the metal recovered for sale as scrap. Filled shell of small calibres are normally sentenced for destruction. Explosive items, which are found to be in a dangerous condition, are disposed of by demolition or by dumping in deep seas. </para>
