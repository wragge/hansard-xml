If this is so, will the Government inquire into the matter, especially in view of the fact that further appointments have recently been made to the taxation branch on account of the increase of work involved in the administration of the sales tax? </para>

            <para>- The honorable member being wise in his day and generation notified me of his intention to ask these questions, and I am, therefore, able to let him have the following replies: - (1) Yes; (2) The Government does not make any payment to the Superannuation Fund until a pension becomes payable. The proportion of pensions paid by the Commonwealth is at least SO per cent. In many cases it is much more. This is caused by the fact that at the commencement of the scheme, the older employees were permitted to contribute for the first &#163;104 of pension at the reduced rate for age 30 years, the Commonwealth bearing the greater proportion of the pension. To quote a striking instance, the Commonwealth&#39;s share in one case was &#163;102 of the total pension of &#163;104., No superannuation pension has been reduced by a greater proportion than 20 per cent, of the Commonwealth&#39;s contribution. </para>

            <para>- The position, as I understand it, is that the Treasury issues instructions to the various departments regarding the acceptance of treasury bonds in payment on amounts due on war service homes. It is pointed out that if bonds were accepted for war service homes repayments, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to refuse their acceptance for other payments due to the Commonwealth, such as income tax, land tax, sales tax, telephone rentals, &#38;c. If bonds were accepted in payment of these services it would be necessary to eonvert them into cash for the purpose of receiving the money due to the Government, and this could be done only by selling the bonds on the market. If this were  done on a large scale, as quite likely it would be, it would have the undesirable effect of depressing the market for Commonwealth securities. </para>

            <para>- What are the conditions and rates of premium paid by occupants of war service homes for the insurance of the properties? Is it possible for the Minister to state the total amount paid to insured persons with respect to fires and other damage to their homes, and what is the amount to the credit of the fund? It is generally believed that the amount is considerable, and that therefore the premium rates should be reduced. I do not expect a reply off-hand, but I would be glad to have an answer to my question on the adjournment of the House ? </para>

          <para>. - Representations have been made to the Government to the effect that the provision in the bill which authorizes a company to deduct from dividends payable to preference shareholders the special income tax of 10 per cent. which may be payable by the company on its income from property out of which dividends to shareholders may be distributed, will not assist a company which has already distributed that particular income, because the provision in the bill does not permit the company to charge the tax against future dividends which may become payable to the company. The intention of the provision is to enable a company to recover the income tax from the preference shareholders. It is now realized that the provision is defective, and the  amendment now proposed  is  submitted by  the  Crown  Law  Department to provide  the  desired remedy. So far as I understand the matter, this is a draftsman&#39;s amendment, and it is designed to give effect to the intention which Parliament had in mind when the bill was passed. I move - </para>

        <para class="block">This amendment is necessary to secure that interest on treasury-bills which are issued or renewed at reduced interest comparable with the rates of interest to be paid on converted stocks and bonds of the Commonwealth Loan, shall receive the same treatment as regards rate of income tax in future as was accorded with respect to loan interest by section 20 of the Debts </para>
        <para class="block">Conversion Act 1931. On the 31st July, 1931, the Australian banks renewed Commonwealth treasury-bills in Australia for an amount of nearly &#163;21,000,000. About two-thirds of those bills are held by the trading banks. On previous occasions, treasury-bills have been discounted  at 6  per cent., but on this occasion the banks were asked to discount them at 4 per cent., the rate provided under section 17 of the Debt Conversion Act, being a 331/3 per cent. reduction compared with 22&#189; per cent. applying to ordinary debt. The banks asked whether, if they discounted the bills at 4 per cent., they would enjoy the same privileges in regard to income tax as if the Debt Conversion Act had been in operation onthe 31st July, 1931. It was found that if the acf had been operative on that date, the banks would not have obtained any reduction of tax, because section 20 of the act, which fixes the maximum rate of income tax which may be imposed on interest on converted loans, does not apply to interest on treasury-bills. When the measure was being finalized,  it was  decided to deal fully with treasury-bills under section 17 of the act, and subsection 2 of that section definitely states that the other provisions of the act shall not apply to treasury-bills. That has had an unexpected effect, because this differential treatment of interest on treasury-bills was clearly unintentional. It was intended that, if the banks discounted bills at the rate  of  4 per cent., they should receive treatment similar to that accorded to those who converted ordinary bonds. They were not  to  be subject to special income tax on property, or to a further increase on the rate of normal taxation above the rates in. force in 1930-31. It is impracticable now to amend the Debt Conversion Act to meet the situation, so that  a  suitable provision should be inserted in the bill  to  amend the Income Tax Assessment Act. This amendment, in the opinion  of  the taxation experts, gives effect to the intention of Parliament when the bill  waa  before the House on a previous occasion. </para>

          <para>.- In section 20  of  the Commonwealth Debt Conversion Act it is provided that the interest  on  new securities taken in pursuance  of  the conversion authorized by the act shall not be subject to Commonwealth income taxation beyond that payable under the legislation referred to in the section, and shall not be subject to income tax under the law of a State. This new clause, by which it is proposed to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act, extends the exemption to treasury-bills which are Commonwealth securities held by the banks. It provides that, the interest on these bills having been reduced from 6 per cent, to 4 per cent., it shall be free from the taxation specified in section 20 of the Debt Conversion Act. One can understand the reason for applying that provision to the treasury-bills now current. They represent moneys lent to the Commonwealth, and are on the same plane as ordinary Commonwealth bonds. The insertion of this provision would only put the holders of treasury-bills on the same footing as the holders of converted bonds. </para>

If honorable members examine the clause, however, they will see that the exemption from further taxation is not confined to the interest on treasury-bills on which the interest has been reduced, but may apply at the discretion of the Loan Council to treasury-bills issued on or after the 31st July, 1931. </para>

            <para>- Nothing is said about the rate of interest. I presume that, in exercising such discretion, the Loan Council would have regard to the rate of interest being charged, but that the liability of interest to income taxation should be dependent upon the decision of the Loan Council, introduces an element of bargaining regarding the applicability of the ordinary law of the land which is, perhaps, undesirable. In future, apparently, when accommodation is sought from the banks, it will be open to the Loan Council to say whether or not the interest payable on treasury-bills should be subject to certain forms of income tax. There is a very important principle involved. I. realize that this power to exempt interest from State and Commonwealth taxation will help the Government to get money on better terms, but we should not forget that treasury-bills may be issued to other institutions than banks. Dp to the present, the FederaIncome Tax Act has been administered by the Commissioner for Taxation, and if income is taxable according to the act, the tax must be paid. The object behind this amendment is good, but I doubt whether Parliament should delegate to the Loan Council authority to say when income tax shall be paid. </para>

          <para>. - When the Financial Emergency Bill was before the House, the group to which I belong opposed the proposal that certain sections of the community should be relieved of the payment of further State taxation. We considered that in accordance with the declared policy of the Government during this time of crisis no section should receive preferential treatment. We opposed the giving of such treatment to bondholders, and now oppose the giving of it, to private banking institutions. &#34; No such relief has been given to&#34; other sections of the community affected by the plan. They must pay all the various kinds of taxation, direct and indirect ; but throughout these emergency measures a tendency has been displayed to go out of the way to protect those who, in my opinion, need no protection whatever. The financial institutions wield at the present time an economic power greater than that of Parliament itself, and on that ground alone, I oppose granting to them preferential treatment of any kind. It may be argued that, as we have extended concessions regarding income taxation to those bondholders who will convert their holdings, it is only logical to extend the same concessions to the private banks which have agreed to accept a lower rate of interest on the treasury-bills they hold. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> said that this clause, proposed merely to bring all sections into line. When we were discussing the conversion of bonds, the argument stressed by honorable members opposite was that we should not make the conditions on bondholders too severe, because many of them were far from wealthy. Whatever force there may have been in that contention as applying to ordinary bondholders, the argument cannot by any stretch of the imagination be  made to apply to the private banking institutions, which hold treasury-bills issued by the Government. Ever since the war these institutions have been reaping enormous profits from their trading operations. The figures are available, and cannot be refuted. During the war, and since, the banks have been in clover. They have, indeed, such a grip on the monetary system of this and other countries that they have been able to manipulate it to their own selfish ends. I contend therefore that, although certain concessions were granted to bondholders in a previous measure there is no reason for extending them now7 to private banks. </para>

        <para>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> questioned the wisdom of placing in the hands of the Loan Council power to determine whether or not the interest on treasury-bills shall be exempt from certain taxation. I also question the wisdom of such a course, &#39;and I point out that if power of this kind is to bo vested in outside authorities independent of Parliament, we might as well dissolve both the Commonwealth and the State Parliaments altogether. </para>

            <para>- That may be the opinion of the honorable member for Warringah. I hold a different opinion, and I am entitled to do so. Just now it suits the honorable member for Warringah and his friends that certain bodies outside Parliament should dictate the policy of this Parliament and the State Parliaments; but the pendulum may later swing the other way, and then, if this practice has become established, the honorable member may have cause to regret that he did not protest against it now. To-day the Loan Council is the real governing body of the Commonwealth. Even when we were discussing in this Parliament the measures designed to put into effect the Premiers&#39; plan, the Prime Minister told us that we could not alter the proposals of the conference in any way, because they had been agreed upon by the Premiers and others present at that conference. This, the Parliament of the Commonwealth, is thus made subservient to a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. Under such conditions there was hardly any purpose to be served by discussing the emergency proposals in this Parliament at all. As has been pointed out, we have .probably not yet heard the last of emergency plans. Already the Premiers of South Australia, Tasmania and other States are talking of the failure of the present plan, and, no doubt, other plans will be submitted in due course, thus bearing out the truth spoken by mc and others associated with me when <inline font-style="italic">wis</inline> were discussing the present plan. It is wrong that the Loan Council should have power to say whether certain forms of income taxation shall or shall not be paid. The Government supporters have their way to-day, because they have a majority on the Loan Council which enables the policy enunciated by that body to be given effect. Perhaps within a few years this Parliament will have a different political complexion, and in that case the power that this Government uses to-day to suit its own interests will be used by us to suit our interests. </para>

          <para>. - If .taxation were at the nadir instead of at the zenith, there might be some ground for complaint in this matter ; but as no one expects income taxation to be any higher than it ia today, it seems to me that the concession&#39; now being made is more nominal than&#39; real. We are inclined to magnify this apparent concession. The remarks of the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> were somewhat irrelevant, as no real concession is being made at the present time. </para>

            <para>- I deny that any preparation is being made for concessions to any section of the community. The only point that is arguable at the moment is whether tho Loan Council should be the deciding factor in a matter of this kind. I can conceive that some circumstances may arise in which it may be necessary to vary the procedure; but I am willing to trust tho Loan Council, particularly in view of its present composition and voting strength. I feel that the council has recently carried out important work in a business-like manner. Some one must be .trusted and regarded as an authority  in determining the particular class of treasury-bills to which this clause shall apply. It is possible that the Commonwealth Parliament may be the best judge in a matter affecting the Commonwealth revenue; but I am not prepared to raise any serious objection to the Senate&#39;s amendment. </para>

          <para>. -  It is realized and admitted that the duty which is imposed upon the Loan Council under this clause is, from a certain point of view, anomalous ; but the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> has rightly pointed out that this function has to be discharged from time to time by some responsible authority. I suggest that for practical reasons it it not a function that ought to be discharged by this Parliament as a whole. The particular class of treasury-bills to which the clause applies will have to be determined for the purpose of keeping guard over the rates of interest. The main purpose of the Senate&#39;s amendment is sound, and not objected to. Theonly criticism of the amendment relates to the power which is given to the Loan Council; but I am informed - and, naturally, I have to depend entirely upon the views of experts - that this matter has been carefully explored to ascertain the best method of giving effect to the intention of the clause. I hope that the committee will accept the amendment. </para>

The rolls are obtainable only upon the continent, and the duty which it is proposed to impose upon them is practically prohibitive. It will not benefit any considerable manufacturing industry in Australia, and will not increase employment to any great extent. </para>

              <para>- I confer with nobody on tariff items. There has been altogether too much conference on the various tariff items, and too little consideration of the general public. The report of the Tariff Board on gold leaf shows clearly that only one manufacturing firm would benefit by this duty, and that is a family concern which provides employment for only four persons who are not members of the family. I do not believe in using the tariff for the purpose of building up monopolies of this kind. Paragraph 10 of the report of the board, which refers to our sole manufacturer of gold leaf, reads as follows :  - </para>

The company is quite evidently not disadvantaged by reason of the existing duty, for it has been able, so far, to cope with outside competition. I protest against the granting of a monopoly in this industry to what is virtually  a  family concern. </para>

            <para>.- This increase of duty has not been granted hurriedly. When the application for the increase was first made to me I hesitated before I referred it to the Tariff Board for investigation and report. However, I did ultimately submit the matter to the board which in its report made the following comments :  - </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The board sees no  reason why the Australian  requirements  in gold leaf should not be produced  locally. The  raw  materials  are available  in  the Commonwealth and  in  the production of the leaf considerable labour is involved. </para>
            <para class="block">Gold beating is a trade-calling for special training and experience. In view of the fact that in the past the local demand for skilled men has been limited, and there has also been little opportunity for training operatives locally, it occurred to the board that if the desired additional protection were granted the local manufacturers might find themselves unable to produce to any great extent owing to lack of suitable labour. However, since the inquiry the board has been satisfied that the necessary labour would be available. </para>
            <para>From the evidence and samples submitted the board is of opinion that the quality &#39;of the local product is. satisfactory, and docs not lose by comparison with any of the imported leaf. </para>
            <para>The evidence as to the competition as regards price is not altogether conclusive, but there is, in the opinion of the board, little doubt that, under normal trading conditions, the locally-produced&#39; leaf would be at a disadvantage in this respect in competition with the overseas leaf, more especially that from Germany. </para>
            <para>An assurance has been given by the applicant that if the desired additional protection is granted, it will not take advantage of 8 llc&#93; protection to increase its selling prices beyond those current at the time of the board&#39;s inquiry, other than may bo found necessary by reason of. fluctuations in the prices of the metals used. He stated also that if the duties sought are imposed a reduction in selling prices is anticipated as the result of increased output. The evidence indicates that the selling prices of the local leaf have been reasonable, having regard to costs of production. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>It is difficult to assess what the added cost to users would be if the desired duties are provided, but on the figures before the hoard it would appear that even if the prices of the leaf, current at the time of the inquiry, arc maintained, some additional cost to conBurners will be entailed. The board is satisfied, however, that such added &#39;cost would, on the basis of the average selling prices of the imported leaf, be relatively small in comparison with the amount that would be expended in direct labour in the production of the goods locally. Furthermore, as already stated, the whole of the raw materials used are of Australian origin. </para>
          <para>The board considers that the industry is worthy of encouragement and that the rates of duty sought by the applicant are justified by the circumstances. </para>
          <para class="block">Some honorable members have severely criticized me at times for disregarding the reports of the Tariff Board. On this occasion I have given effect to the board&#39;s recommendation, but I am still subjected to criticism. </para>
          <para>The manufacture of gold leaf was com menced in Australia some six or seven years ago. The history of the local company clearly indicates that headway cannot be made against the free importation of British gold leaf and foil, and a duty of 15 per cent, on foreign -importations. The company has achieved remarkable results considering the competition with which it had to contend. Seven operatives were employed in the industry prior to the imposition of the new duties, and it is estimated that 80 hands would be required to supply Australian requirements. </para>

          <para>It will be seen that the new duty is only 10 per cent, on gold leaf from the United Kingdom, whilst 40 per cent, has been imposed on the foreign leaf, an increase of 25 per cent. A comparison of prices has shown that a 10 per cent, duty is sufficient to allow the local manufacturer to compete successfully against the United Kingdom. These duties should assure that practically the whole of the local demand will be supplied with gold leaf of Australian manufacture. </para>
          <para>The Australian product, made almost wholly by hand, is of excellent quality, and many users were prepared to support the local industry, but owing to the action of their competitors in importing their requirements of gold leaf at a lower price than that for which the local manufacturer could supply, they were forced to emulate their example. </para>
          <para>The rates now imposed are those recommended by the Tariff Board, which held an inquiry into the industry. It cannot bo said that the Tariff Board is a body which errs on the side of recommending unnecessarily high duties. </para>

            <para>.- Thi3 appears to me to be one of our &#34;backyard&#34; industries. The value of our imports of gold leaf and foil in 1929-30 amounted to &#163;17,536. At present, our one firm is producing slightly over 4 per cent, of what its proprietor estimates to be Australia&#39;s requirements. So that it will be seen that the total market in Australia is approximately &#163;18,237. Gold leaf is an article for which there cannot be a very extended market in the Commonwealth. It is stated in the Tariff Board&#39;s report that, besides the members of his own family, the proprietor of this business has, at the present time,  two adult male gold beaters and two female gold cutters engaged in the production of gold leaf, but that it is estimated that 80 employees would be necessary to produce the gold leaf requirements of the Commonwealth. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There are differences of opinion as to the quality of the gold leaf which can be made, but the critical point that I see in the report is this: The industry was established in Australia in 1924, and for the last three years the manufacturer has been producing an average of 10,000 leaves a week. He stated, in a sworn statement, that if the requested duty is granted there will be no increase in the present selling price, except, of course, that caused by the fluctuation of the gold market. The industry has been able to manufacture and compete with the imported article without a duty. It has the benefit of being on the spot, and of paying no exchange, which now amounts to 30 per cent. How in the world can it be suggested that such an industry can fairly ask for a dutyof 30 per cent. British, 30 per cent. intermediate, and 40 per cent. general tariff? Most of our fold leaf requirements come from the United Kingdom, their value being &#163;9,595 in 1930, while our imports from Germany were, for the same period, &#163;5,905. The manufacturer has been able to carry on without a duty, and develop the industry to its present standard, and there is nothing in the report to indicate that he will not be able to go further in future without a duty. </para>
          <para>Mr.White.  -  The answer is that Germany would dump gold leaf in Australia at a price against which this firm could not compete. </para>

              <para>- That paragraph indicates that, without tariff protection, the manufacturer has built up his business to its present standing. I do no! accept the proposition that Australian industries are to be free from all competition. I am glad to learn that this industry established itself against competition, and it is far better that it should continue as at present, than that a tariff barrier should be set up on the assurance that there will be no increase in the selling price apart from fluctuations in the price of gold. Honorable members know that it is becoming practically a common form to say that there will be no increase in the selling price of protected commodities. 1 should think that there would not be any such increase in this instance. If the industry obtained the benefit of a duty and secured the local market, there should definitely be a reduction in price. It is always possible to find somespecial reason such as changed business conditions or the like to justify an increase in price. I admit that, generally, these are bona fide undertakings ; but, speaking generally, if under ordinary conditions of fair trading a man is able to obtain more for his commodity he will do so unless there is competition. I do not blame this manufacturer for endeavouring to obtain a duty; but it is surprising to me that the Tariff Board should have presented a report that is not justified by the evidence appearing in that report. </para>

We have heard honorable members on this side who profess to be protectionists putting up a splendid case for strong concerns, and gallantly - fighting the efforts of the Country party to bring down duties. In this instance, because a new industry has been brought to Australia by an English family, it is not to receive any encouragement. Apparently the family may pack up and go back to Great Britain. So far as I know, there are no manufacturing industries in the electorate of Kooyong. </para>

          <para>This industry has asked for protection in the way that is laid down in the statutes of the country. The firm of H. Stagg and Company, which has its business at Ripponlea, in my electorate, intimated to me its intention of applying to the Tariff Board for protection. I asked what were the circumstances, was given information similar to that embodied in the report of the Tariff Board, and recommended that the firm should go ahead with its representations. The Stagg family came from Birmingham to start this little .industry in Australia. After all, it should not be dismissed as a &#34; backyard &#34; industry simply because it is small. We cannot expect to have many Broken Hill Proprietary Companies in Australia. With only a few hands, principally drawn from the family, the. firm began operations in the Commonwealth. As has been pointed out, the value of the total importations of gold leaf into Australia for the year 1929-30 was &#163;17,536. </para>
          <para class="block">Faced with overseas competition, largely German, the firm made application for protection, and on reading the report of the Tariff Board, I am struck by the modesty of the applicant. Instead of asking for a duty of 50, 60, and even 100 per cent., as some larger and more powerful firms do, the applicant asked for merely a duty of 10 per cent. British, and 40 per cent, foreign, and that in relation to gold leaf only. Foil and other products mentioned in the Tariff Board&#39;s report are still being admitted free. There are very few items in the tariff that are admitted free, or even at a duty so low as 10 per cent. The board recommended that the protection asked, for should be granted. Our aim should be not only to increase the population of Australia, but to encourage the establishment of new industries. This gold leaf industry has been established by an immigrant family, and its appearance here proves that industries will migrate from Europe Ja Australia if given reasonable protection </para>

              <para>- That is so. This firm is capable of supplying Australia&#39;s requirements of gold leaf, and it has promised to reduce the price of it. It is certain, also, that sooner or later it will have to -meet internal competition. As the firm can supply the local market, applied for only a modest duty, and promised a reduction of price, I make no apology for supporting an industry that deserves protection, and sought it in the right way. </para>

            <para>. -  The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> should have apologized for the weakness of the arguments with which he supported the claims of a small industry in his own electorate. If I were the proprietor of the industry I would expect my representative in this House to make out a stronger case in my favour. The honorable member said that we should support the weak as well as the strong. Presumably that is the sort of Christian appeal he makes to the commercial firms with which he has dealings, and I can imagine the replies he receives from hard-hearted business men. We are told that this duty is necessary to enable the industry to compete against overseas competition. The testimony of the Tariff Board is that the firm is already successfully competing, and during the last three years has produced at the rate of  10,000  leaves weekly. The industry is already established, without capital we are told, and is able to hold its own against outside competitors. Now the Minister proposes to grant to the firm a monopoly by shutting out all overseas competition. The honorable member for Balaclava says, that, notwithstanding the higher protection that is granted, prices will be reduced, but the Tariff Board says - </para>

            <para>It is difficult to assess what the added cost to users would be if the desired duties are provided, but on the figures before the board, it would appear that even if the prices of the local leaf current at the time of the inquiry are maintained some additional cost to the consumers will be entailed. </para>

          <para class="block">That is a flat contradiction of the statement by the honorable member for Balaclava.

            <para>. - There is an amusing aspect of this discussion. The industry to which the item relates is conducted in the electorate of the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White),</inline> and I have no quarrel with the representative of that division for supporting the claims of his constituents. As a general rule it is the duty of honorable members to put before Parliament the claims of the people whom they represent, a fact that the honorable member for Balaclava is sometimes inclined to overlook. He told the committee that the manufacturer of gold leaf interviewed him, and stated that he thought of applying to the Tariff Board for a protective duty. The honorable member cordially said in effect, &#34;Yes, goahead. &#34; Then as an afterthought he asked, &#34; What are the circumstances of your industry?&#34;. In other words, he recommended the manufacturer to apply for a duty without having any knowledge of the facts on which the claim would be based. Gold leaf is used principally for signwriting, and the stamping of leather. It may be that the additional duties will restrict the use of gold leaf, and I ask the Minister to inform the committee of their likely effect upon other industries. It is possible for the decrease of employment in them to outweigh greatly the additional employment given in the production of gold leaf. </para>

              <para>- I am dealing -with the request of a firm engaged in the manufacture of an article which waa on the free list. The firm was threatened with the danger of having to close its doors unless it received the protection asked for. The duty provided is less than that on almost any other item in the schedule. The arguments advanced in this chamber against the duty are, first, that this is a backyard industry, and not worth protecting; and, secondly, that since it has been able to keep going since 1924, it should not need protection. But honorable members cannot have it both ways. If this is a backyard industry, it is nevertheless a useful one, and we should be prepared to support an industry, however weak it may be, financially or otherwise, in preference to industries not yet established. I have frequently seen honorable members support a duty for a proposed new industry, the success of which was only problematical. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In reply to the argument that, as this industry has been able to keep going since 1924, it should not need protection, I point out that the duties on gold leaf that have been imposed are very light, being 10 per cent. British preferential, 30 per cent. intermediate, and 40 per cent. general, and the duties n.e.i. are British preferential free, intermediate free, and general 15 per cent. The object of the duties is to retard the business of continental manufacturers of gold leaf, to prevent them from dumping it into Aus tralia. The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> said something about the Australian firm interested in these duties being engaged in business in my electorate. I consider that it is the prerogative of any elector to approach the member for his district on any matter. In this instance I referred the firm in question to the proper authorities, namely, the Tariff Board, as I hope any other honorable member would do. That board is composed of experts, who are competent to take evidence on a matter of this kind, and arrive at a decision. The request made to the board was most modest, and the evidence on the matter is clear. To continue the paragraph regarding the probable increase in price which the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> left unfinished, the board in its report remarked - </para>
          <para>The board  is  satisfied, however, that such added cost would, on the basis of the average selling prices of the imported leaf, be relatively small in comparison with the amount that would  be  expended in direct labour in the production of the goods locally. Furthermore, as already stated, the whole of the raw materials used are of Australian origin. </para>
          <para>The honorable member also stated that these duties would prohibit the importation of gold leaf, but I cannot imagine that that would be the result. The business will be shared between the British and Australian industries, and the Government will gain some much needed revenue. On examining the report of the Tariff Board one notices that the application for these duties was opposed by Alfred Lohmann, manager of Lohmann and Company, Hardy&#39;s Chambers, Hunter-street, Sydney; David Logan Leslie, representing Ideal Agencies, Bond-street, Sydney; and by Arthur Peter Turner, commercial traveller, employed by Lohmann and Company. So, although one firm made the application for duty, as stated by the honorable member for Warringah, they were only opposed by two firms of importers, the third person being an employee of one of the importing firms. David Logan Leslie stated in evidence - </para>

            <para>. - In  discussing the previous item, the Minister took great credit to himself in adhering to the recommendation of the Tariff Board, and in view of the rarity of such an occurrence, credit is certainly due.  I  point out, however, that the Tariff Board recommended that sub-item c be not altered. It relates to&#34; wrought iron and malleable cast iron fittings for pipes, and cast iron fittings for pipes of less than 2 inches internal diameter &#34;. The duty imposed in the November, 1929, schedule was directly contrary  to  the board&#39;s recommendation.  It  is equivalent to an increase of 250 per cent. on galvanized iron fittings, and 200 per cent. on black iron fittings. Since these extortionate increases have been made, the Australian manufacturers have increased their prices on two occasions. The extent of the increase may be judged by the following example:  - In  November, 1929, the price of half-inch galvanized &#34;T&#39;s &#34; made in Australia was 9d., less 65 per cent., or 3.15d. net. On the latest price list, the price for the same article is 9d., less 50 per cent., or 4?d. net, an increase of nearly 50 per cent. All the prices of locally-made fittings have been increased from 20 per cent. to 50 per cent. This is particularly interesting in view of the promise given by many firms that, if increased duties were granted, increased prices would not result. In this connexion, the following extracts from the evidence given by manufacturers at the inquiry made by the Tariff Board are interesting :  - </para>

            <para>Wrought iron and malleable oast-iron fittings for pipes.-  and after the word &#34; pipes &#34; comes the comma. It then goes on -  and cast-iron fitings for pipes of less than  2  inches internal diameter. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The presence of this comma has induced the department to interpret the item to mean that wrought iron and malleable east-iron fittings for pipes of all sizes shall pay the duty, the limitation of less than 2 inches applying only to cast-iron fittings. The item should be worded, &#34; Fittings of wrought iron, malleable cast iron, and cast-iron for pipes of less than 2 inches internal diameter.&#34; Then the meaning would have been clear. </para>
          <para>The imposition of a duty at a specific rate per lb. on this item reveals an extraordinary lack of consideration of the effects of such a duty. Of malleable castiron fittings, there are 5,000 different varieties and sizes carried in stock in Australia, while the range manufactured in Australia comprises only 261 lines. On the remainder, duties which can only be described as fantastic, have to be paid. As the value per lb. weight of the fittings varies immensely with the different varieties, a duty of ls. per lb. might represent anything from a moderate impost up to 600 per cent, or 700 per cent, on the value of the goods. If the users have the alternative of buying locally-made fittings, the hardship imposed upon them would be restricted to the excess coat of the local article ; but as only 261 lines out of 5,000 stocked in Australia are produced locally, it has been necessary, during the past eighteen months, to pay these absurdly excessive duties of up to several hundred per cent, on those articles which have to be imported. For most of the types of fittings not made in Australia, the demand, though regular, is not large. For this reason the manufacture of anything approaching the entire range may never be attempted here, and certainly will not be attempted while costs of production in Australia render the exportation of such goods impossible. </para>
          <para>These fittings are used for either water, gas or steam pipes. The sufferers, therefore, are those engaged on building, water, irrigation, and gas undertakings. The farmer installing pumps, windmills, &#38;c., and irrigating his land, is a particularly heavy loser by these duties. The fittings are an absolute necessity to him. His requirements are usually in the larger sizes, of which the proportion manufactured locally is even less than of the sizes below 2-in. diameter. There is no justification for the proposed duties, amounting to ls., ls. 3d. and ls. 6d. per lb. on galvanized iron fittings, and to 9d., 10d., and ls. on black fittings. The Tariff Board recommended that there should be no alteration in the ad valorem duty of 35 per cent., 45 per cent., and 50 per cent. I move - </para>

            <para>. - I support the amendment of the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson).</inline> It is proposed in this item to change the duty from an ad valorem to a fixed duty of so much per lb., and its effect will be to increase the duty, in some instances, by as much as 400 per cent. The Government appears determined to impose this duty, irrespective of whether the articles are being made here, or of the uses to which they are being put. The new duties have been in operation for seventeen months, but still only 261 of the 5,000 varieties concerned are being manufactured locally. Owing to the variations in weight relative to value, the goods affected are totally unfitted for the application of a duty based on weight. The duties impose an almost intolerable burden on the primary producers, because the articles subject to the duty are used wherever water, gas or steam pipes have to be installed. The farmers who install pumps and windmills, and who irrigate their land, will be severely affected. The duties are being raised, in some instances, by as much as 600&#39; per cent, and 700 per cent, in order to protect the local manufacturers, although it has been shown that they make only 261 items out of a total of 5,000. The Minister stated, with great satisfaction, that he had acted in accordance with the recommendation of the Tariff Board regarding the last item, but what has he to say when confronted with the recommendation of the board, as quoted by the honorable member for. Gippsland, that there should he no variation of the duty on this item. </para>

              <para>- Has that later report been circulated? The only report available is that issued in 1927, and in that report the board recommends that the duty should not be varied. If the Minister has a report issued only three months ago, copies of it should be in the possession of every honorable member in this House who is interested in the subject. Tariff board reports are not the exclusive property of the Minister; they are the property of this House. Unless the Minister produces the report of which he speaks, no credence can be given to his mere statement that he is acting in accordance with the recommendations contained therein. It is a gross misuse of parliamentary privilege for the Minister to retain a report of the Tariff Board, and to refuse to reveal its contents to other honorable members. The amendment of the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> is a reasonable one, more particularly with regard to the misplacement of a comma, which enables the department to interpret the provisions of the act in a way not originally intended. At the time the Tariff Board made its investigation the duties asked for were 9d., 10d., and ls. per lb. The duties are now ls., ls. 3d., and ls. 6d. per lb. galvanized, and 9d., 10d., and ls. other. What justification can there be for this increase of duty? If the Minister has in his possession a report which shows that there has been a change of opinion on the part of the Tariff Board, then in simple justice to the board he should produce it. </para>

              <para>- If there is no such report the Tariff Board should have been asked to make another investigation. The report now available was made in 1927, and the duties were imposed in 1929. Since then conditions have changed. This increase of duty is entirely unnecessary. It imposes a severe disability, not only upon the primary producers and those engaged in the building trade; but also upon other citi zens, who are being called upon to pay prices considerably in excess of what they are entitled to pay. Although it is being constantly reiterated that the increased duties are not taken advantage of by the manufacturer in increasing his prices, let me say that in 1929 the price of a half -inch galvanized T made in Australia was 9d. less 65 per cent., or 3.150d. net. In the latest price list the price for the same article&#39; is 9d. less 50 per cent., or 4&#163;d. net - an increase of nearly 50 per cent, in the net price. Since the imposition of the new duties all local prices have been increased from 20 per cent, to 50 per cent, to the consumer, the home builder, and everybody engaged in plumbing in its various ramifications, including gas and electrical fittings. That action is unfair, unjust, and unwarranted. </para>

          <para>Malleable iron fittings are manufactured in Australia from raw materials wholly of Australian origin, and the Australian factories are capable of producing Australia&#39;s requirements of fittings up to and including six inches. Cast iron fittings for pipes of the size covered by the item are also manufactured in Australia, but wrought iron fittings are not at present produced locally. Wrought iron fittings definitely compete with malleable fittings produced in Australia, and as a general rule it can be stated that for every ton of wrought iron fittings imported an. equivalent quantity of Australian malleable fittings is displaced. Representatives of gas companies .claim that malleable fittings are not suitable for gas reticulation in view of the greater liability to corrosion, and the fact that they will not stand the same bending strain, but local manufacturers are emphatic that malleable fittings are more suitable than wrought iron fittings for gas reticulation,  and are prepared to submit their fittings for test alongside any imported malleable steel or so-called wrought-iron fittings. It is stated also that gas companies used Australian malleable fittings during the war period when imported fittings were not available, and &#39; did not submit any complaint regarding the unsuitability of the Australian fittings. </para>

          <para class="block">After the amendments made to this item by the tariff resolutions of November, 1929, and December, 1929, this firm increased its output by 30 per cent., and increased its employees to the same extent. This state of affairs continued until July, 1930, when the effects of the depression caused a diminution of output.  At  present the output is only half of  what  it was for the preceding twelve months. Stocks are gradually being worked out in certain sizes, and it will not be long before they will have to be  replenished,  when it is expected increased production will result. The firm of Andrew Thomson &#38; Scougall Ltd. increased the number of its employees by 56 per cent, immediately after the increased tariff was imposed, but owing to the depression the company has been working half time with a reduced staff for the past few months. It is anticipated, however, that with the restoration of normal times, the staff will be at least quadrupled. </para>
          <para>The Tariff Board reported on the industry in 1927, and recommended no variation in duties, as a comparison of prices indicated that Australian fittings were not being undersold by the imported fittings. Subsequent to the receipt of the board 3 report in 1928, Australian manufacturers were compelled to make substantial reductions in prices - Edward Weir Ltd. had reduced the list price of their black fittings by 14 per cent., and that of their galvanized fittings by 26 per cent. - in an endeavour to maintain trade. Later in 1928 the Tariff Board held an inquiry into the question of the application of the provisions of the Industries Preservation Act to malleable tube fittings, and as a result&#39; of the board&#39;s report, these fittings of German origin were gazetted under section 4 of th, Industries Preservation Act, as the evidence indicated that they were sold for export at a price less than the domestic market price. </para>

Such a large increase should not be made except for very substantial reasons, and no such reasons have been given by the Minister. I have been furnished with a statement, signed by eight representative firms which use this tubing in their businesses. It reads as follows : - </para>

            <para>Welded conduit tubing is, as far as we cao ascertain, manufactured in Australia only by the Amalgamated Conduits Proprietary Limited, of Melbourne. This firm is now producing i-in. and J-iu. sizes, and we are informed that they will shortly have 1-in. in production. With regard to the other sizes in common demand, i.e.., li-in., lj-in., and 2-in., we aru informed by a representative of the manufacturers that these will not be in production for at least six months, and even then it has not yet been decided whether any or all of these sizes will be produced. </para>
            <para>The prices at which the Melbourne manufacturers are offering their |-in. and i-in. conduit tubing to us as wholesalers of electrical materials is considerably less than the prices at which we could import from English manufacturers, exclusive of customs duty. </para>
            <para>Welded conduit tubing is used extensively for the installation of electrical connexions to a vast range of electrical appliances, including the following: - Motors and generators, transformers, switchgear, heating appliances, lighting installation, and particularly where outdoor installations of any typo are necessary. </para>

            <para>We therefore strongly protest against the imposition of the new rates of duty, which we consider altogether unnecessary for the following specific reasons: - </para>

          <para class="block">In view of the fact that the goods of this class which are already being manufactured in Australia can be sold for less than similar imported goods, exclusive of customs duty, there is no reason why any duty should be imposed. Certainly no additional protection is required by those engaged in the industry. </para>
          <para>Another reason why these duties should not be imposed in this general way is that certain sizes of conduits required in Australia are admittedly not being manufactured here. In fact, it is doubtful whether the manufacture of them will ever be undertaken, and, if it is undertaken, whether it will be profitable. In these circumstances I cannot understand why the Government should inflict- these veryheavy increased duties on the users of these pipes, for the only effect will be that the prices which the consumers will hove to pay for these goods will be increased substantially. </para>
          <para>Tubing of this description is required for the installation of electrical machinery and appliances of all kinds, and if these duties are insisted upon, the cost of such installations must be heavily increased. We are doing our best to reduce the cost of production . in this country by the introduction of electrical appliances and machinery of all kinds, for the purpose of helping the Australian citizens to do their work as comfortably and as efficiently as- possible. Apparently, the Government has no desire to assist in the achievement of these ends. It certainly seems to have no desire to extend the introduction of electrical appliances in homes for the relief of housewives and domestic workers. Its only desire, apparently, is to increase prices to the Australian public, irrespective of whether the added imposts can be justified or not. The statement from which I have already quoted also contains the following observations: -  (4.) The imposition of the proposed duties is in our opinion altogether unjustified as the local manufacturer has not yet proved that  he can successfully manufacture this commodity, particularly so as he is entirely dependent upon the importation from abroad of the steel strip necessary for the manufacture which gives employment to a very infinitesimal number of people only. </para>
          <para>There is only a comparatively small demand for these products, and it is most unlikely that large amounts of capital will ever be invested in the manufacture of them in Australia. In these circumstances, increased duties cannot be justified. There is no Tariff Board report to assist honorable members to form an opinion on this subject, and we are entitled therefore to accept the views of the users of these pipes which are definitely against any increase in these duties. </para>

          <para>The sum of &#163;15,000 has been invested by the Automatic Tube Company Limited, of Melbourne, in plant for the production of these tubes, and it is in a position to produce annually tubes to the value of &#163;25,000. The applicants for the increased duty hope to be in a position eventually to supply the whole of the Australian requirements of welded conduit tubes, the value of which they estimate to be &#163;35,000. At present, very little welded conduit of local manufacture is being sold, because of the fact that very few new buildings are being erected, and practically all importers are well stocked. When trade conditions brighten there is little doubt that the volume of business will quickly exhaust existing stocks, and enable the local manu facturer to meet the demands with welded conduit at prices satisfactory to users. </para>
          <para>The rates mentioned in the schedule in respect of 152d are the same as  the  deferred rates under 152a. Prior to  the  incorporation of a special heading  for  automatic welded conduit tubes, these goods were classifiable under item 152a, and the applicants would have had to wait for the imposition of the deferred duties, which in turn depended on the progress  of  the wrought iron and steel pipe and  the  tube industry, before they could hare secured the desired protection. I think that the committee should agree to  the  item. </para>

            <para>,- I oppose high duties when applied  to  phantom industries such as this. Conduit tubes are essential for the construction  of  city buildings and for general building purposes, and if these duties are agreed to, there will be a further retardation of. building activities. From what the Minister has told us, this industry has not- yet been established, and it is problematical whether it will be. Already excessive taxation is adversely affecting the building industry, and when primage duty, sales tax, and shipping charges are added to this proposed 40 per cent, duty under the British preferential tariff, the additional impost amounts to over 100 per cent. In difficult times like the present, unnecessary duties such as these could well be waived, and protection given only to the industries which have established themselves. </para>

            <para>. -  I should like to have heard a reply by  the  Minister to the arguments of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill).</inline> The Minister made a statement indicating in rather general terms  the  reason why this increase in duties is proposed by the Government. The honorable gentleman <inline font-style="italic">failed to deal</inline> with the specific and very important remarks of the honorable member for Warringah. This is a proposal to increase the rates of duty on welded conduit pipes and tubes  to 40  per cent. British, 55 per cent, intermediate, and 60 per cent, general tariff, from free, 5 and 10 per cent, respectively. Those are very sudden jumps of duty, and one might expect some particularly special reason to justify their  imposition on an article which enters into the construction of nearly every building in &#39; our cities and towns, and many of the buildings constructed in the country. The honorable member for Warringah said that the users of this article have informed him that the prices at which the only manufacturer in Australia is offering f-in. and $-in. conduit tubing are considerably less than those at which tubing could be imported exclusive of the customs duty. If that is so, it is plain that the matter should be very carefully examined before the proposed increases are agreed to. </para>

          <para>It is hardly a matter for wonder that the existing depression in the building trade has been greatly aggravated by the increased cost of many building materials and appliances, resulting from the operation of this schedule. During the last three years building has decreased in Melbourne by 85 per cent., over a tenmile metropolitan radius. I am aware that there are many reasons for that, and I - do not suggest for one moment that any particular impost or series of imposts in the tariff is entirely responsible for the position. However, having regard to the enormous amount of unemployment in the building trade, it is as important to consider that trade, as it is- to consider a relatively small industry such as this. In sayang that, I am not decrying the industry. I am glad to see it established in Australia. At the same time, its interests and those of scores of other minor enterprises, cannot be compared with the interests of the building industry, either in respect of the number of men- to whom employment is given or to the benefits conferred on the community. Sales taxes, primage duty, tariff increases and the general depression have all had their effect on the building trade. Numerous tariff increases are being made for relatively small industries, which will inevitably increase the burden of the Australian consumer, without conferring a corresponding benefit on the industry concerned. </para>
          <para>I admit that I do not approach these matters from the point of view of the Minister. Apparently he considers that, prima facie, any request fbr protection is to be granted. In these matters one has to consider and balance the advantages and disadvantages. In this case it is not contested by the Minister that certain important sizes of welded conduit pipes and tubes are not manufactured at present&#39; in Australia. </para>

              <para>- The Minister says that an admission may be made under by-law. I recognize that there has to be a certain amount of flexibility in regard to some customs items, but the provision in the tariff under which free admission may be granted of articles which cannot be commercially manufactured in Australia is the source of as much difficulty and misunderstanding as any other provision in our law. In some cases it may be that it is impossible to have a customs classification which is sufficiently precise to obviate the necessity of occasionally utilizing ministerial discretion, but wherever it is- possible the items should be precise and particular. </para>

          <para>If it be . a fact that certain conduit pipes above f-inch are not made in Australia, this item should, for the present, be confined to sizes manufactured here. It is all very well to say that applications can be made for admission under by-law. Since I have been in this Parliament I have had brought to my notice a number of cases of persons importing goods who looked at the tariff schedule, saw an item there covering what they were importing, and paid the duty in the ordinary way. Of course it was accepted. I do not suggest that the officers of the Customs Department are to say to importers, &#34;You should make an application to get this in free &#34;. That is not their job. They are there as revenue collectors. A considerable time after the importers discover that, had an application for admission free been made, it might have been granted. In my experience, the department has not looked kindly at applications for retrospective free admissions. The result is that, in order to protect themselves, importers have had to employ customs agents. It would be better to confine this duty to the articles which are at present made in substantial quantities in Australia. </para>

            <para>.- The importations of these goods have been recorded separately only for the last two years, and practically only since the increased duties have been in operation; consequently the figures before honorable members do not indicate the extent of the importations prior to the increases. The proposed amendment is made to give further protection to the manufacturers of cast-iron soil and rainwater pipes from 2 inches to 6 inches internal diameter, and fittings therefor, and the rates proposed represent increased British preferential and general tariffs by 20 per cent., 15 per cent. respectively. No alteration is proposed on the pipes and fittings covered by sub-items  a  and c. The Tariff Board furnished a report in October, 1927, and recommended the duties incorporated in the present schedule. The board expressed the opinion that the industry could not compete, owing to the low landed duty-paid cost of British cast-iron soil and rainwater pipes and the higher Australian manufacturing costs due to high wages, short hours, and greater costs of raw materials. In January, 1930, information furnished by the . Iron&#34; Foundry Employees Association indicated that only 20 pipe moulders were employed in Victoria out of a total of 300. In Brisbane one firm which employed 128 men early in 1928, was in January, 1930, employing only 60. </para>

          <para class="block">Prior to the imposition of the increased duties, Australian manufacturers were relying for their orders mainly on the preference given by municipal councils and like bodies to products manufactured in Australia, but it was found that because of the financial stringency many of these bodies were placing their orders in the cheapest market. Only by appealing to their patriotism were orders for local firms obtainable. The importation figures show that the ad valorem duties are effective inasmuch assuch demand as exists is being supplied by local manufacturers. </para>

            <para>.-I have no objection to the proposed duties. This industry is already well established in Melbourne; for the last 30 years local foundries have been producing all requirements, and have supplied pipes to some of the biggest waterworks in the Commonwealth, including the goldfields water scheme in Western Australia. There is plenty of competition, and prices are keen. </para>

              <para>- I  am  their  representative.  It was found that  the  item of  the 11th  December,  1929,  imposed hardship in  the  case of certain hoods which, through not coming within the terms of sub-item  g,  fell under sub-itemf, and became liable to a duty of 60s. a dozen. The amendment already made in the subitem by the committee did not quite meet the situation; but the wording now proposed will meet the conflicting interests of the millinery trade in both New South Wales and Victoria, and certain hoods of a class not made in Australia will now be admitted at 24s. per dozen, in lieu of 60s. When I was in Melbourne recently T visited the factory of Headwear Proprietary Limited, one of the largest establishments for the manufacture of women&#39;s hats, and the manager told  me  that he is well satisfied with the item  as  amended a few days ago. Whereas his factory employed only seventeen hands in 1929, it now employs 200, and they are working overtime. After a good deal of trouble, the department has drafted an item which, apparently, meets with the satisfaction of the manufacturers in Sydney and Melbourne.I move - </para>

            <para>.- If the increase of employment to which the Minister referred could be attributed to the latest amendment of the item, its claim to our approval would be much reinforced; but that can hardly be so, as the amendment was introduced only a few days ago. I do not profess to be an expert on the subject of fur, felt, panama, and pandan hoods. The Minister has assured us that everything is all right; but I wonder how many honorable members who heard his explanation understand what they are asked to do. We are informed by the Minister that the milliners of Sydney and Melbourne concur. I have no suspicion of them ; but, naturally, they will look after their own interests, and for that I do not blame them. In reply to a question asked by the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill),</inline> as to whether the consumers are satisfied, the Minister made one of the best jokes of the season by saying that he was their representative! The only evidence before the committee is that the milliners who are directly affected by these changes approve of them; so does the Minister; and possibly some honorable members know what they mean. I unfortunately am quite unable to make up my mind regarding the merits of the proposal. If the committee is not being left in the darkness, it is being asked to legislate in rather dubious twilight. </para>

              <para>- The Minister&#39;s claim that he represents the consumers is the greatest joke he has perpetrated this session. All we know is that a departmental expert has come to an arrangement with manufacturers in Sydney and Melbourne, and they have agreed that certain duties are fair. After all, the expert is a departmental officer. Is that the way in which a tariff schedule should be prepared? These manufacturers have fixed up their own duties. </para>

            <para>.- I suggest that the Minister should postpone the item. It appears that there is to be added to item 114 o a certain type of hats which were not formerly included. Instead of there being merely an ad valorem duty, there is to be a fixed rate of 18s., 20s., and 24s. per dozen. It is suggested by the Minister that this meant a reduction in duty, but we have no proof of that. If the 24s. had been intended to apply to item 114 <inline font-style="italic">v,</inline> which relates to felt hats, in respect of which there is a fixed as&#39; well as an ad valorem rate, going up to 60 per cent., one might have regarded the item with a certain amount of satisfaction; but we have a fixed rate of 18s., 20s. and 24s. per dozen on an item on which formerly there was no fixed rate. This requires further explanation by the Minister, before the committee can accept his assurance that this represents a reduction of the duty. </para>

On artificial silk and silk in the piece there are duties of 25 per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per cent., which apply to all articles of silk; hut necktie manufacturers have been in the habit of buying the cheaper class of silk, and the increased duty is seriously interfering with their business. I have received a letter from the Britannia Tie Company, Melbourne,which states - </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The Associated Tie Manufacturers of Victoria and the Associated Tie Manufacturers of New South Wales have requested the Minister to put our raw material into a sub-item 106 (d), thereby separating our silk and silk and art-silk piece goods from the general item ofsilk piece goods. Under the present item, our raw materials are dutiable at 30 per cent. for silk, and 35 per cent. where it contains artificial silk. The Minister has viewed this factory, and at my special request he sent officers of the Customs Department to investigate the books of the various tie manufacturers, who were able to prove that they were not able to carry on under the present rate of duty. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Most honorable members will applaud any reduction of the tariff, which is now pressing heavily on all sections. In the case which I have brought under notice, the factory has been established for many years. The workers have been employed under ideal conditions, but they have been reduced to a low ebb because of this increased duty. In Canada, there is a special duty covering silk for the manufacture of neckties. The position might be met by an item on the following lines - &#34;Woven fabrics, wholly or in chief part by weight of silk or artificial silk, or both, imported in the web in lengths of not less than five yards each, by manufacturers of neckties&#34;. A duty of, say, 10 per cent. less throughout would be appreciated, and would allow these factories to resume. There would be no loss of revenue, but on the contrary a probable increase through the stimulation of business in this industry. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; but their raw material is not manufactured in Australia, and they have to pay high duties on  it.  In the Canadian tariff there is a special provision for dealing with cases of this kind. In order to meet the position, I have agreed  to  introduce a new sub-item  k.  I have satisfied myself that the request for a reduction of duties is reasonable, and I submitted a proposal  to  a sub-committee of the Cabinet, which approved of  it.  I move - </para>

          <para class="block">This amendment is for a reduction of duty on piece goods of a class or kind not produced in Australia, imported for use in the manufacture of neckties. On silk piece goods the reduction will be 10 per cent. general tariff ; on artificial silk piece goods, 5 per cent. British preferential tariff,  74  per cent intermediate tariff, and 10 per cent. general tariff; while on woollen piece goods the reduction will be much more considerable. The purpose of the amendment is to relieve the tie manufacturing industry of part of the duty on its jaw material. The industry was able to carry on fairly successfully under the old rates of revenue duty, but since the imposition of the increased revenue duties under the old item itself, and under the primage resolution, it cannot pass on the added&#39; cost to the public, because the public is not in a position to pay the increased prices demanded. The amendment proposed is in accordance with a practice which has been followed in Canada for a number of years. I could, of course, admit these materials under tariff item 404, under which the duty is, British, free, and general tariff, 10 per cent.; but it is considered that those rates are too low. </para>

            <para>.- Has the Minister received an assurance from the manufacturers that any relief obtained from the reduction of the duty will be passed on to the public in the form of lower prices? Necktie manufacturers already enjoy a very considerable measure of protection. I do not complain of that, because they, in common with other clothing manufacturers, are entitled to protection. The present duty on neckties is 6s., 7s. and 7s. 6d. per dozen, or 60 per cent., 65 per cent, and 75 per cent, ad valorem. That is a very generous measure of protection, especially when we realize that the raw material employed in the industry is mostly artificial silk which, to some extent at any rate, competes with wool, one of our own staple products. In my opinion, the revenue is entitled to more than a 10 per cent, duty on the raw material used in this industry. I am not disposed to support the proposal for reduced duties, unless the Minister can give an assurance that the public will benefit by lower prices. The Minister said that the workers, owing to reduced wages and salaries, could not afford to pay as much for their clothes as previously, and they are, therefore, entitled to benefit by any reduction of duty. </para>

            <para>.- The  only doubt I have regarding the wisdom of this proposal is that the raw material upon which, the duty is to be reduced enters into competition with wool. I am at present wearing a tie which, I think, will compare favorably with any tie produced in any part of the world, and it contains 95 per cent, of wool. </para>

            <para>.- I support the amendment moved .by the Minister. What is needed in this country more than anything else at the present time is to provide employment for our workers, and if we make raw materials cheaper, the manufacturers will be able to provide more employment. It is amazing to me that anyone who supports the Labour party should object to this proposal, the object of which is to assist a local industry so that it may keep in employment all those at present engaged, and absorb some of those now out of work. In the past extraordinarily high duties have been imposed on this raw material, and it is proposed to grant some measure of relief, while retaining a duty which will return a substantial revenue to the Treasury. The honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. C. Riley)</inline> seems to be afraid that the workers may not derive any benefit in the way of cheaper prices for the finished article, but I am convinced that competition is so keen nowadays that reduced prices will follow immediately on the reduction of duties. The cost of living figures show that there have been enormous reductions in two items - rent and wearing apparel, and the goods we are now considering constitute an article of apparel. We need all the revenue we can get at the present time, and if we prohibit the importation of goods we derive no revenue from them at all. </para>

            <para>. - I suggest that the Minister should go through the whole tariff schedule, and enumerate, for the benefit of the committee, all the items covering raw materials not manufactured or produced in Australia, so that we may deal with them all at once. It is unfair, in my opinion, to select for special treatment one item of raw material not produced in Australia, while the schedule is full of other items equally deserving of favorable treatment. This afternoon I brought under the notice of the Minister several items which are not being produced in Australia, and will not be produced here for a considerable time, but the Minister does not offer any relief in respect of them. In the present instance a heavy duty has already been imposed on imported ties, but the local manufacturer finds that, because of the excessive duty on silk, the only silk which he can afford to import is&#34; of a most inferior quality - the mere rags and tatters and ends. The tie manufacturers are unable to produce in Australia anything like the article which they produced before these heavy duties were imposed, when they were able to compete satisfactorily with the best  Spitalfield  and other English ties. It is necessary to encourage this industry by providing it with raw material at a reasonable cost, and the amendment of the honorable member for Balaclava has that object in view. These palpable errors in the tariff are a clear indication of its unscientific preparation, and this is one glaring instance out of a tremendous number of others. </para>

That he is conceding something on this item, is no reason why we should feel grateful to him. This is a matter of policy. It is either fair or unfair. It is in the interests of Australia or it is not. I shall vote for the amendment, because it is in the interests of Australia to decrease the duty on the raw material for Australian ties. Raw materials that we do not produce here should be admitted at a low rate of duty or duty free, if necessary, in order that our industries may be encouraged and established. </para>

Of course that goes&#39; without saying. As the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> has said, prices will fall because of the keener competition within Australia. It might be as well for the Minister, if the amendment is carried, to indicate to the trade that in giving this concession the Government expects in return a concession in the price to the consumer. The honorable member appreciates though, that if there is a reduction in duty of 10 per cent, on the raw material, it does not follow that there should be a similar reduction in the wholesale and retail prices, because any reduction would only be a fraction of that. </para>

There are no engineering difficulties in the manufacture of fishbolts, and they are used largely in our railway systems. Although the quantity imported is not considerable, the duties have been increased to safeguard the Australian market for the local manufacturers. There  is practically no difference between the manufacture of fishbolts and that of ordinary bolts and nuts, and the duties imposed are in accordance with the recommendations of the Tariff Board for the protection of the holt and nut industry of Australia. </para>

            <para>.- I wish to refer to lawn mowers under  subitem  161 b (1) about which there has evidently been a misunderstanding.  This  increase of duty was imposed without  full  inquiry being made and I suggest that the words &#34; or petrol driven &#34;  he  deleted from the item. Electric  lawn  mowers are made in Adelaide, but petroldriven motors have not yet been manufactured in Australia. I believe that  in  a few instances imported parts have been assembled here. The largest users of petrol-driven mowers are municipal councils, which have large areas of grass to mow. This additional duty will mean that many of these councils will be unable to afford the expense  of  maintaining large plots of grass,  and as  a result more men  will be  thrown out  of  work,  men of the type that it is most difficult to employ. At present, petrol-driven mowers pay a duty of 20 per cent. The costs are: 33 per cent. exchange; 20 per cent. ad valorem duty, which is equivalent to 25 per cent.; 10 per cent. primage duty; 6 per cent. sales tax, and 10 per cent. shipping and other charges. That is approximately an additional cost of 85 per cent. which, if increased by another 10 per cent., as is now proposed, will make it impossible for the municipal councils and other users to purchase this sort of machine. Furthermore, I would point out that the few experimental machines which have been assembled here have no range in sizes, although the sizes of the imported machines range from 16 to 42 inches. If this increased duty is imposed, the Government will lose a revenue that it urgently needs at the moment. I am of the opinion that the words &#34; or petrol driven &#34; crept into this item in this large schedule by accident and that petroldriven lawn mowers should come under the n.e.i. classification until such time as they can be produced economically in Australia. </para>

          <para class="block">This amendment gives effect to the recommendations in the Tariff Board&#39;s reports of the 3rd October, 1929, and the 2nd April, 1931, and in respect of hand mowers will result in a reversion to the 1921-28 rates of duty on mowers with train gears and those specially designed for the combined purpose of trimming and edging, which are types not being manufactured in the Commonwealth. Petrol-driven lawn-mowers, which were included in paragraph 1 of sub-item b by the resolution of the 26th March, 1931, at rates of 30 per cent., 40 per cent., 45 per cent. are omitted from that paragraph by the present amendment and will become dutiable under paragraph 3 at rates -of 20 per cent., 25 per cent., and 30 per cent. The Tariff Board&#39;s report, which was received subsequent to the tabling of the March resolution, showed that no evidence was tendered at the inquiry by the local manufacturers of petrol-driven lawn-mowers in favour of increased duties, and, as investigations by departmental officers indicate that the industry, as at present established, is not capable of supplying certain of the Commonwealth&#39;s requirements, especially in the large lawn-mowers used by municipal bodies, the Government feels that the retention pf the duties on petrol-driven lawn-mowers proposed on the 26th March last would amount to an unjustifiable tax on public undertakings. </para>
          <para>The manufacturers who had intimated their intention to manufacture petrol- driven lawn-mowers found on further investigation that they could not undertake the work. Consequently there is no good purpose to be served by retaining the existing duty. </para>

            <para>. - While the Minister seems willing to give consideration to municipalities and other users of petrol driven lawn-mowers, he is not prepared to give similar consideration to the unfortunate householders who spend their Saturday afternoons pushing hand lawnmowers over their lawns. These individuals are considered when an election is imminent; but at other times they are made the victims of unnecessarily high charges for the manufactured goods that they must buy. The increase in the duty on hand lawn-mowers is from ad valorem 20 per cent. British, 25 percent. intermediate, and 30 per cent. general, to ad valorem 45 per cent., 55 per cent., and 60 per cent. respectively. The immediate result of the imposition of the new duties was a loss of revenue. Under the old rate of duty local manufacturers were selling hand lawn-mowers for 10 per cent. less than the landed cost of the imported article so that an increase of the tariff  was not warranted. Many of the parts required for the locally-made article have to be imported, so that the industry is largely an assembling and fabricating enterprise. Some of the companies manufacturing these mowers showed highly developed powers of anticipation, for just before the imposition of the new duties, the price of locally-made hand lawnmowers was increased by 10 per cent. Twelve-inch hand mowers, which cost 31s. 6d. prior to the imposition of these duties, are being sold to-day for 42s. 6d. Comparative prices for 14-inch hand mowers are 35s. and 45s. In my opinion the only result of these increases in duties has been to increase the cost of lawn-mowers to the general public, and to reduce the revenue of the Government. Seeing that, prior to the imposition of these duties, the price of the locally-made mowers was 10 per cent, lower than the price of the imported mowers, the Government should not have taken this step. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I regret that the interests of the consuming public are receiving very little consideration from the members of this committee. We hear often enough what the manufacturers of Melbourne and Sydney, jointly and severally, think about various propositions that are made for increase of duty; but we are never told how the members of the general public view such proposals. The Minister seems to give less consideration to the welfare of the general public than any other honorable member of the Parliament. In view of the fact that we have to import many of the parts required for making lawn-mowers, and that much of the raw material has also to be obtained from abroad, I cannot understand the attitude of the Government. I enter my emphatic protest against the imposition of these duties, because the only people who will benefit by them are a few manufacturers and a limited number of workers engaged in the industry, and many thousands of other workers will be penalized by them. </para>

Our imports of lawnmowers are valued at &#163;100,000 per annum, and I submit that this money should not be allowed to go out of Australia. What applies to hand lawnmowers applies, in my opinion, with equal force to petrol-driven machines. The policy of this Government is to prevent the importation into Australia of any goods that can be manufactured here. For my part, I would prefer to see some of our unemployed pushing hand lawnmowers than to see &#34; large petrol-driven machines in use. It has been said that the retention of this duty on petroldriven lawn mowers will penalize local governing authorities. Those bodies are unable to find the wherewithal to purchase blue metal to repair their roads, let alone buy petrol-driven machines to cut lawns. The committee should not concern itself about that matter, but instead should endeavour to do something that will make employment for our own factories and workshops. I am in touch with a manufacturer in New Zealand, who has a patent covering lawn mowers, and is willing to undertake their manufacture in Australia, if conditions are satisfactory here. </para>

Riley)</inline> deals with them as one item, and the Minister has moved an amendment that covers the whole of them. I think that if the honorable member for Cook had expert knowledge of petrol-driven lawn mowers he would not adopt his present attitude. I have personal knowledge of these machines, which are made in sizes of from 16 in. to 42 in., the latter being practically comparable with a motor car. If it were possible to manufacture them in Australia my own firm would be prepared to engage in that activity. However, the demand for such machines is limited. I point out to the honorable member for Cook that the Melbourne City Council employs some80 men for lawn maintenance, which would not be possible if it did not use petrol-driven lawn mowers. </para>

              <para>- Only for special work. Prior to the introduction of petrol-driven lawn mowers, it was not practicable to cut the large areas that they mow now. Very few petrol-driven machines have been made in Australia. Some experimenters have attached a motor-cycle engine to a lawn mower, but the result has been an indifferent machine. The Tariff Board has already inquired into and arrived at decisions with regard to electricallydriven machines now being made in Adelaide, and the hand-driven lawn mowers manufactured in Melbourne and Sydney. It is only reasonable that we should accept the Minister&#39;s amendment. Motor-driven mowers cost as much as &#163;250, so that exchange, primage duties, sales tax, packing charges, and so on, amount to a formidable imposition. The Government would lose a substantial amount of revenue if the duty were prohibitive. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline></para>

            <para>. - I protest against these duties being increased from 20 per cent., 25 per cent. and 30 per cent. to 45 per cent., 55 per cent. and 60 per cent. Spray pumps are used by orchardists, whose purchasing costs may be greatly increased by the proposed duties. I point out that the difference between the first set of duties and those now proposed is very much greater than would appear from a superficial investigation. Since the 1921- 28 schedule was brought down,local manufacturers have enjoyed tremendous advantages from the protection afforded by a 10 per cent. primage duty, and an exchange of &#163;30 10s. per cent. The 20 per cent. duty provided in the early schedule actually amounted to a protection of 22 per cent., as it was imposed upon a value of &#163;110 instead of &#163;100, in conformity with the practice of adding 10 per cent. to the invoice price. Working on that basis the present duty of 45 per cent becomes 50 per cent., to which must be added the primage duty of 10 per cent., and the exchange advantage of &#163;30 10s., making a total of &#163;90 10s., British preferential rate. I submit to the Minister that there is no necessity for that tremendous increase, which can only result in great hardship being imposed on primary producers. I oppose the sub-item, and think that the committee should vote it out. </para>

            <para>. - I think that I shall be able to remove the misunderstanding that evidently exists in the mind of the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson).</inline> These goods can very easily be manufactured in the Commonwealth, and it was anomalous that they should be dutiable at such low rates. One of the largest manufacturing companies, which had twenty-five employees engaged in making these articles, stated that if granted adequate protection, it would increase its staff by 100 per cent. It subsequently forwarded information that this had been done, due to the increased orders received. However, because of the depression, only twelve additional hands are at present employed. It also gave an undertaking that prices would not be increased. The company anticipated that with the increased trade which would accrue as a result of the increased duty imposed it would be able to sell at lower prices. Further plant has been installed which is wholly of Australian manufacture. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Since this industry was established in Australia it has been the means of reducing the purchase price of the goods to the public by from 5 per cent, to as much as <inline font-style="italic">33$</inline> per cent. The new duties have enabled firms to launch out in the manu-  facture of several lines which previously were not made in the Commonwealth, such as knapsack sprayers and barrel sprayers for orchards, which are now being manufactured successfully at highly satisfactory prices. </para>
          <para>The March, 1931 schedule added to this sub-item atomizers and vaporizers of the type used for spraying insecticides. When the June, 1930 schedule was tabled covering increased duties on certain spray pumps, one large company erroneously assumed that the new duties applied to atomizers and vaporizers of the kind used for spraying insecticides, and accordingly placed a large order with the local manufacturers at the time, stating that the order would have gone abroad if - the duties had not been imposed. This order brought about the employment of an additional 25 hands. Those facts indicate that the local product is satisfactory, and that while the goods can be imported at a low rate of duty, even though the local prices are competitive. Australian manufacturers cannot expect to extend their activities. Our manufacturers have reduced prices by upwards of 30 per cent., and the fruitgrowers are much indebted to them. Before these secondary industries were established, the primary producers were mulct by importers, who bought goods abroad at very low prices, and made fabulous profits in the distribution of them. The Australian manufacturer sends his travellers into country districts and sells direct to the orchardist, and the agents, who formerly obtained a big rake-off in respect of imported sprays, are now eliminated. </para>

            <para>.- I was glad to hear from the Minister of the extension of this industry. That indicates the way in which the protective policy should operate, namely, by increas ing the market for the local product, and reducing its price. But the Minister went on to say that the local industry cannot be expected to extend unless competition from overseas is excluded. To that proposition I am not prepared to accede. The possibility of external competition is beneficial to the consumers, and promotes the efficiency of our industries. What the Minister has said does not confirm the need for the duty now proposed. On his own showing, it is prohibitive. </para>

              <para>- Quite so. Meanwhile primage is an additional protection; so also is the heavy exchange. I would like to be able to believe that at an early date normal trading conditions between Australia and the rest of the world will be restored. I am unable to do so, and while extraordinary conditions continue we must legislate with due regard to them. Most of the duties in this schedule were first imposed in November, 1929. A duty of, say, 40 per cent., which was regarded as necessary and justifiable then, has now become 80 per cent, because of the operation of primage and exchange. Nobody can justify the imposition of an 80 per cent, duty when, after full inquiry, the Government was satisfied that 40 per cent, would suffice. The committee should take into consideration existing factors, and vary the schedule as those factors change. I see grave danger in ignoring the elements of increased primage and exchange. If as industry is producing and selling under  the equivalent of 80 per cent. protection in addition to freight how will it fare when normal conditions return? I fear that in agreeing to a schedule based upon the conditions in 1929, which have since completely changed, we are giving to some industries encouragement, to the extent of almost the prohibition of competition, which further experience may not justify. We may indeed be doing a great disservice to those industries. Accordingly it seems to me that some of the duties are too high as protective measures, because df the radical change in conditions since they were first introduced. It is a mistake airily to wave aside primage and exchange as merely transient factors. Even if they are likely to pass soon, we should legislate with regard to the actual commercial conditions under which manufacturers are operating, and not upon a basis which has in fact disappeared. </para>

              <para>- If the industry is operating so successfully, this additional protection is not needed. The Minister has stated that primage duties and exchange are only passing factors, but I cannot see any indication of their removal in the near future. Parliament should legislate to meet existing conditions, and not base its tariff policy on optimistic guesswork as to what may be the economic circumstances in the future. This item involves a fundamental principle, which is worthy of special consideration, and, therefore, should be dissociated from ordinary tariff policy. Having knowledge of the actual facts I can assure the committee that even though the wholesale prices of spray pumps may have been reduced to the extent that the Minister has stated, the reduction is not reflected in the retail prices paid by the users of these machines. I ask the Minister to give further consideration to this item with a view to making these duties conform with the existing conditions of exchange, which, so far as we can see, are likely to last a considerable time. </para>

            <para>.- The proposed additional protection to the local manufacturer of spray pumps is fully warranted. I am an orchardist and represent a fruit-growing area, in which more spray pumps are used than in any other electorate in Australia. The orchardists in my district prefer the product of local manufacturers, who understand our requirements and cater for them. </para>

              <para>- For several years. The prices have been reduced, and we believe that if the Australian manufacturers secure the whole of the trade, they will lower their prices still further. Those who use spray pumps recognize that the home market is the best market for their produce; if they buy their implements of production outside of Australia, they are damaging the market for their own products. The primage duty and adverse exchange are only temporary factors and the manufacturers have not taken advantage of them. The prices of many commodities have been reduced. The manufacturers realize that the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> will not tolerate any hanky-panky tricks, and they know if they take advantage of the increased duties to advance their prices, they will not enjoy this protection very long. If we want to preserve the local market for our own producers, primary and secondary, we should do everything possible to prevent the importation of goods that our own people can. manufacture efficiently. </para>

If that is so, why should the duty be increased by 20 per cent.? This is but another instance of the willingness of the Government to grant any increase of duty asked for. I am not a rabid protectionist, nor am I a freetrader; but if we go on increasing duties at the present rate we may go too far. I agree with the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> that, in considering tariff matters, we should have regard to the exchange rate and to production costs. If we continue the present policy of extreme protection, the experience of honorable members may resemble that of the Gadarene swine, which &#34; ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters &#34;. </para>

              <para>- I point out that no increase in duty has been made with respect to power pumps. The increase is on the smaller sprays that are operated by hand or foot, and I wish primary producers in a small way of business to be able to purchase their sprays on a reasonably competitive basis. I am entirely in agreement with the honorable member for Franklin that it is desirable to use Australian-made sprays. I merely wish to have a &#34; rate of duty imposed which will make it impossible for the local manufacturer to profiteer. I con tend that the duties of 20 per cent., 25 per cent., and 30 per cent. provided on power sprays would be sufficient to cover hand and foot-operated sprays. It has been said that the 10 per cent. primage duty and the 30 per cent. exchange are merely temporary; but it is doubtful whether those charges will be reduced for a considerable period. We should take such factors into consideration in framing the tariff. If there should  be  a fall in production costs in future,  wecould  make such an adjustment as might: then be considered necessary. I move - </para>

            <para>. - The Tariff Board recommended that the duties under this item should be 22&#189; per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per cent. ; butthe Government has fixed them at 45 per cent., 55 per cent., and 60 per cent. Thus the Government has doubled the Britishpreferential rate recommended by the Tariff Board. On some tariff items, the increase is even greater than that. Item 164  a  relates to churns and cheese presses, and item 164  b  covers &#34; Churns, n.e.i. &#34;. Under the 1921-28 tariff,all churns, whether hand or power-operated, were bracketed itogether, and the British preferential duty was 22&#189; percent; but to-day that duty applies only to churns operated by hand, those operated by power having to bear a duty of 45 per cent. The duties on pasteurizers, which are included in this item, were originally &#34; Free, 5 per cent., and 10 per cent. &#34;. The board recommends that the British preferential tariff should be 22&#189; per cent., but under the present tariff the duty is 45 per cent. It seems inexcusable that the Government should grant twice the duty recommended by the Tariff Board, more particularly in connexion with machinery used for the production of a commodity very largely exported. These pasteurizers and jacketed vats and power churns are all used in the manufacture of butter, and this year our exports of butter have been even greater than the quantity consumed locally, the first time an our history that this has occurred. </para>

              <para>- Many persons are employed in manufacturing articles required by the dairying industry, and those persons are consumers of butter affected by the Paterson scheme, which provides what is practically a bounty of between &#163;3,000,000 and &#163;4,000,000 for the butterproducers. I have no fault to find with that. I represent a large dairying district and, in my opinion, the dairyfarmers are entitled to what they . are getting. We cannot expect them to work forsixteen hours a day, and sell their butter at a price to compete with the product of coolie labour. We have pledged ourselves to the White Australia policy, and we should not shrink from what is necessary to put it into effect. If there was not a market here for a large proportion of the butter produced, the Paterson butter scheme would be unworkable. I ask the honorable member for Gippsland to withdraw his amendment. All we ask is that the butter factories, which are benefiting under the Paterson butter scheme, shall buy Australian-made machinery. </para>

A few years ago- the combined churn and worker was manufactured only in the United States of America. An Australian firm obtained from the American manufacturers the right to manufacture in this country on a royalty basis. By the exercise of Australian ingenuity, the machine has been greatly improved, and the locallymanufactured article is in use practically throughout the whole of Australia.

              <para>- At the present time, the Australian industry is protected by the high rate of exchange, the primage duty, arid the 50 per cent, surcharge imposed for the purpose of adjusting our trade balance. All these advantages are of a temporary character, but the tariff schedule, we hope, will be permanent. Every one who has studied world affairs knows that, owing to the world depression, the manufacturing countries of the world are trying to push their goods on to new markets, and unless we take steps to protect our own industries they will be ruined. I am prepared to gO before any audience of dairymen, as I have done before, and defend the protection of Australianmade dairying machinery. </para>

            <para>.- It appears to me that it would be very difficult for the dairymen to object to paying increased prices for manufacturing machinery, if such increased prices were demanded as a result of tariff protection. The butter-makers of Australia have evolved a self-protective system under which they enjoy a favorable local price, so that it ill becomes them to complain because they are asked to pay a higher price for Australian-made machinery. At the same time, I feel that the protection which the butter-makers have given themselves by their own action, without any legislative assistance, is so high that they may shortly over-reach themselves. </para>

          <para class="block">Kopha butter, articles which, until a little while ago, were not seen in Australia. Indeed, most Australians became acquainted with them for the first time when they went abroad. In recent years, however, we have been getting down to a lower order of food substances. The quantity of such substitutes used is increasing from month to month. It may be that before very long the dairymen will not be in such a happy position as they have been in for some time past. </para>
          <para>The articles with which we are now dealing have been made in Australia for a long time. One of the oldest established industries  in  Victoria is a  churn  manufacturing concern, and it has got on in the past without very much assistance from the tariff. In the case of ^pasteurizers and jacketed vats or tanks, &#39;capable of use as pasteurizers, a rather remarkable thing has taken place. The Minister said that manufacturers found that they were being undercut by the admission of these articles under item 160 a, and an application was made for an increase of duty. If honorable members look at the memorandum before them they will find that it was proposed to amend 160 a by a resolution of this House introduced on the 21st November, 1929, proposed rates being 3 per cent., 5 per cent., and 10 per cent. That was under the regime of the present Government, and at that time, evidently, the Government was not impressed with the need for altering the item dealing with pasteurized vats and tanks capable of being used as pasteurizers. In 1931, however, it is proposed to increase the duty on these articles from free, 5 per cent., and 10- per cent, to 45 per cent., 55 per cent., and 60 per cent. That is an enormous increase. It is really amazing. However well the dairymen are doing, one cannot help feeling some apprehension that there may conceivably be an increase in price. </para>

              <para>- I remember a few minutes ago, when we were discussing the item of spray pumps, that the Minister read from a prepared statement that there had been reductions in various classes of spray pumps and similar articles, varying from 5 per cent,  to  33^ per cent., but before he finished his speech he said that there had been a reduction in price to 33J per cent., as if that were the general reduction. He said that at least half a dozen times, so his statements as to reductions in price cannot be regarded as very accurate. This is a tremendous increase of duty and when one takes into account the exchange and primage duty, which cannot be ignored, it seems to me that in spite of the other considerations to which I referred at the outset of my observations, the Minister has not succeeded in justifying this increased duty. Some rate of duty is probably justified, but it seems to me that the Minister always misses the precise point - the particular amount of duty proposed. There surely must be a reason why the duty should be 45 per cent, rather than 10 per cent., 15 per cent, or 30 per cent., but we hear nothing about that at all. We have been asked to accept this increase of duty as fixed arbitrarily by the Government. Certainly no reason has been adduced to justify the proposed increased rates of duty on any item that has to-day been discussed by the committee. </para>

          <para>The rates proposed in the resolution of the March schedule of 1931 were based on the recommendation of the Tariff Board, which arrived at its conclusion on the evidence at its disposal. The board was asked to report on the necessity for the increased duties under item 170a. 2, but several prominent local manufacturers of dredging and excavating machinery were under the impression that the inquiry was in connexion with a request for additional duties to those imposed by the Government, by resolution of the 11th December, 1929, and, accordingly, did not attend the inquiry. The result was that the board, fully justified in the circumstances, recommended a reduction of the rates on dredging and excavating machinery of over1&#189; cubic yards capacity. The rates suggested by the board appear in the March schedule of 1931. The Government is satisfied, however, that those manufacturers who failed to attend the Tariff Board inquiry constitute almost important section of the industry, particularly in the manufacture of dredging and excavating machinery of large capacities. The admission of such machinery over 2 cubic yards capacity at rates of, free,British preferential tariff, and 15 per cent. general tariff, under the March resolution, was an unexpected blow to the industry, and it is quite evident that the report tendered by the board is not a true reflex of the position. The amendment now moved is in agreement with the rates imposed in March, 1931, so far as machines up to and including1&#189; cubic yards capacity are concerned, and agrees with the 1921-28 tariff rates in regard to larger machines. The Government has referred the question to the Tariff Board for further inquiry in the light of the additional information supplied. The rates proposed in the amendment represent an increase of 17&#189; per cent. British preferential tariff, and 20 per cent. general tariff, on machines up to and including 1&#189; cubic yards capacity, thus increasing the margin of preference accorded to Great Britain by 2&#189; per cent. Dragline excavators and steam shovels to the value of approximately &#163;25,000 per annum, are at present manufactured in Australia, principally of a capacity up to1&#189; cubic yards, and these machines are giving every satisfaction, so that purchasers of imported excavators of the type covered by the item must be influenced solely by the lower price of the imported machine. The business which Australian manufacturers have obtained up to the present is mainly due to the preference over and above the tariff protection accorded to Australian manufacturers, given by Government bodies and municipal councils to machines of Australian manufacture. It may be mentioned, to indicate the efficiency of one of the Australian manufacturers - Armstrong, Holland Limited - engaged in the manufacture of excavating machinery, that roller-bearing concrete mixers, manufactured entirely in Australia by that firm, are available at prices lower than those of similar machines manufactured in the United Kingdom. Given efficient protection, there is no reason why similar conditions should not operate in respect of excavating machines. The deeper one probes into this item, the clearer it becomes that this protection is justified. </para>

            <para>.- This class of machinery is, indeed, important in a new country like Australia, where roads are being made and railways constructed. It is heavy machinery, which has a large natural protection. There is no reason at all why Australia should not make this machinery as well as any other country, and apparently we are doing so. The demand, however, is for machines of about 1 cubic yard capacity or under. This class of machinery is, under sub-itemb, to be charged a high duty - 45 per cent., 55 per cent., and 60 per cent. The Tariff Board reported that only about six of these machines are required annually, and the point is whether it is worth while handicapping ourselves in respect of road construction by imposing such a heavy duty on this particular class of machine. The Australian manufacturer is substantially confined to the smaller machine. The Tariff Board reports that in only one instance has a machine of over 2 cubic yards capacity been manufactured in Australia, and that the maker does not expect to manufacture another. Therefore, machines of over 2 cubic yards capacity will rightly be admitted free so far as Great Britain is concerned. With respect to the smaller machines, the Tariff Boardsays - </para>

            <para>Evidence is conflicting in regard to the matter of  price.  The Victorian manufacturer  Admitted  that he could compete  in  price inde pendent of the preference given to local manufacture by government and municipal bodies. He recognized that his firm had lost sales to imported machines because of inability to supply on demand. </para>
            <para>The New South Wales applicants submitted figures to show that they were beaten in price by importing firms. The board considers that the imposition of the duties now recommended should give the local manufacturers the market in the smaller machines, and, if this should result, a reduction in the selling price of the locally-made machines should be possible. </para>

          <para class="block">The board did not recommend an increase in duty on the smaller machines. The Minister explained why he does not propose to follow that recommendation. It was a strange explanation. It was that the manufacturers did not know that the board was inquiring with respect to machines of over1&#189; cubic yards and up to and including 2 cubic yards capacity. The board made its report onthe 30th June, 1930, and since then the manufacturers have informed the Minister that they had not expected the report, and were considerably shocked when it was published. The Minister, without referring the matter again to the Tariff Board, has overruled its recommendation, which in this case was in accordance with the evidence, and has asked the committee to agree to a large increase in duty on machines of over1&#189; cubic yards and up to and including 2 cubic yards capacity. </para>

              <para>- What facts were ascertained as the result of that investigation? The mere making by manufacturers of an application for additional duties means nothing to me. It is perfectly natural for them to obtain additional protection if they can, human nature being what it is. Such an application is in no sense evidence that additional duties are needed. </para>

The locally-manufactured lines are as efficient as the imported lines, but owing to the cost of raw materials, and the low wages paid in the particular competing country, local manufacturers are unable to secure a reasonable proportion of orders. The action taken in imposing the increased duty on these goods is part of the policy to rehabilitate the engineering industry.

        <para class="block">Under the existing law a refund of tax is made where there is a sale of goods which is subsequently written off as a bad debt, and the refund can only be made where tax has been paid on the amount for which the goods were sold. The bill now contains several&#39; provisions which have the effect of imposing the tax on amounts other than the sale price of goods, for example, on the wholesale selling value of goods which a manufacturer sells by retail. It would be inequitable to refuse a refund of tax where a manufacturer incurs a bad debt in respect of goods which he has sold by retail, and upon which he has paid tax on some other value than the actual sale price. This amendment will enable refunds to be made in any case where goods upon which sales tax has been paid have been sold, and the whole or any part of the sale price has subsequently been written off as a bad debt.

        <para class="block">In some cases which have been brought under notice, sales which will be subject to the increased tax of 6 per cent, are being made under contracts which were made years prior to the inception of sales tax, and contained provisions to the effect that the agreed prices should not he altered unless an alteration in the marketprice of the goods took place. Such contracts might be construed aB containing express provision to prevent the vendor from adding the increased sales tax to the agreed price. It is considered that vendors should not be called upon to bear the full burden of the tax in cases where they fixed their prices without any knowledge that the  Governmentintended  to introduce the sales tax. Some such vendors have carried the burden of the 2&#163; per cent, tax for the last twelve months, but the increase of the rate of tax to 6 per cent, is so serious that vendors, in some cases, will be unable to continue in business unless something is done to enable them to pass on the tax to their purchasers. It is considered, however, that where the parties to a contract specifically agree that the prices shall not be altered on account of sales tax or of any alteration in the rate of sales tax, they should be bound by their agreement. The effect of the amendment will be that unless the parties to a contract have incorporated some such specific stipulation in their contracts, a vendor selling goods on or after 11th July under a contract entered into prior to that date will be in a position to. pass on the increased rate of 3&#163; per cent, to his purchasers. </para>

        <para class="block">The amendment which provides for the exemption of &#34; agricultural and mining machinery and implements, including spare and duplicate parts &#34; would, if persisted in, mean a loss of revenue for the current year of approximately &#163;200,000. The additional exemptions already granted by the Government since the estimates of revenue from sales tax for the current financial year were taken out, will result in a reduction of the estimated revenue by from &#163;500,000 to &#163;750,000. If the &#163;200,000, involved in the exemption of agricultural and mining machinery, is added to the loss resulting from the exemptions already granted, it will be necessary for the Government at an early date to increase the rate of sales tax all round, with the consequence that the general public, including those who are now claiming the benefit of this exemption, will have to make up the loss involved by the granting of the exemption. The support given to the claim for this exemption on the ground of the existing exemptions of tobacco, cigars, wines, &#38;c, are based on an entire ignorance of the incidence of the special duties of  excise  and customs which have been imposed on those commodities. The excise dutiesimposed last year on tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, &#38;c, amounted to increases of duty of from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent., and the customs duties which were imposed in respect of importations of similar goods amounted approximately toadditional duties of 50 per cent. TheSales Tax Assessment Acts Nos. 1 and <inline font-style="italic">5r</inline> in substance, impose duties of excise and of customs respectively. Any possiblefield of revenue from sales tax to be received from such commodities was .excluded by the fact that customs and excise proper had already occupied the whole of the possible field of taxation. The Government realizes that the sales taxation which is being imposed is severe and onerous. I assure the committee that every possible exemption has been most carefully considered. In view of the fact that the committee previously discussed and rejected a proposal to exempt agricultural and mining machinery, it would be embarrassing for it to recede from that position. </para>
        <para>The amendment which provides for the exemption of &#34; materials for use in the manufacture of spraying and wheat pickling preparations &#34; would, if granted, involve a loss of revenue of approximately &#163;5,000. It would be extremely difficult to justify exemption of these materials, iri&#34; view of the refusal of exemption to other classes of goods equally worthy of consideration, e.g., sheep dips, other insecticides, and manufactured spraying preparations. </para>

          <para>.- I support the amendments made by the Senate. It appears to me that while a sales .tax for revenue producing purposes can well be levied on finished products such as boots, hats and similar articles, it is entirely wrong to impose it upon machinery which is used for primary producing purposes. It merely adds to the cost of production. </para>

          <para>. -  Ordinarily, I am prepared to support any measure to assist the primary producers and reduce their costs of production, but if agricultural and mining machinery were exempted from the sales tax, the revenue would suffer to the amount of  &#163;200,000,  which would have to be recouped by increasing the rate of sales tax on all other sections of the community. In the long run, even the primary producers would not benefit from such a procedure. Under existing circumstances, it would not be fair to tax all other sections of the general public at a higher rate than  6  per cent. in order to exempt the agricultural and mining communities.

            <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave-</inline> To-day the honorable the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister a question without notice relating to certain returned soldier employees, including two limbless men, of the Federal Taxation Office, Melbourne. I have made inquiries, and find that the Public Service Inspector in Melbourne has pointed out that it is necessary to dismiss seven returned soldiers, including two limbless soldiers, in order that they may be replaced by permanent officers from other departments whose services are not required by those departments on account of diminution of work, and who are being transferred to the Taxation Department. Under this arrangement, four returned soldiers mentioned would be replaced on the 19th August, 1931, and the remaining three on the 30th September, 1931. The Second Commissioner of Taxation reports that the returned soldiers have given good service for some years, and would not be dismissed in ordinary circumstances.  The matter is before the Prime Minister, as Acting Treasurer, for consideration, and has not yet&#39; been dealt with. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave-</inline> To-day the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister a question without notice regarding the position of the Commonwealth in relation to the AngloGerman Civil Procedure Convention of 1928. As promised, I have made inquiries, and have ascertained that this convention, which provides for the reciprocal facilitation of the conduct of legal proceedings between persons resident in the territories of Great Britain and Germany, is under reference to the State governments for consideration as to whether they are prepared to give effect to the provisions of the convention with a view to its extension to Australia. Replies have so far been received from Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania, and action is being taken with a view to expediting the conclusion of this matter. The matter is also receiving attention so far as the territories of the Commonwealth are concerned. Similar conventions with France and Belgium are in operation in Australia, and conventions with Czecho-Slovakia, Spain, and Sweden, in addition to Germany, are at present under reference to the States. The Commonwealth Government, of course, cannot take any final action with a view to the extension of the Anglo-German Convention to Australia until the necessary machinery for giving effect to it has been brought into existence in the States and Territories. </para>
