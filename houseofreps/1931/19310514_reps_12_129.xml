            <para>- Can the Minister for Defence inform the House of the amount of subsidy paid to Westralian Airways under the contract made by the last Government for an east-west airmail service? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Mr.CHIFLEY. - The honorable member was good enough to advise me of his intention to ask this question, and I have been able to obtain some of the information he seeks. The east-west air mail contract is for a period of five years, from April, 1929, but the service did not actually commence until June of that year. The subsidy is based on mail loading. Under the contract, payment at tbe rate of 12s. 8d. per lb. of air mail matter, up to a minimum of 600 lbs. per trip, is paid,irrespective of the weight actually carried; that represents &#163;39,520 per annum. If &#39;the weight of mail carried averages over 800 lb. per trip for a period of four months, the payment is made on the basis of 12s. 8d. per lb. for 1,200 lb. for the rest of the contract. If the weight of mail exceeds 600 lb., the actual weight carried is paid for at the rate of 12s. 8d. per lb. Certain other payments, amounting to about &#163;700, and including a refund of a portion of the sum expended on an advertising campaign, have been made. It is understood that other amounts have been paid by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department for the carriage of ordinary delayed mail at freight rates, but this information is not available in the Defence Department. </para>

            <para>- Some time ago the Government requested the Public Accounts Committee to inquire into the disabilities of Tasmania and South Australia, and I understand that it has since asked the committee to report upon the disabilities of Western Australia. The committee, when inquiring into South Australia&#39;s claim, included three representatives of that State, and when dealing with Tasmania&#39;s position, two representatives of that State. As Western Australia is not represented on the committee, I ask the Prime Minister whether he will ask the committee to defer its inquiry into the circumstances ofthat State until the inclusion of at least one representative of Western Australia in its personnel? </para>

            <para>- The right honorable member for Cowper has not passed on to the Government any suggestion or information as to how it can gain access to the large funds to which he referred. It is true that he recently made reference to a mythical &#163;25,000,000 of gold that might be available to a government which had the endorsement of the Nationalist party. On the question whether a change of government or the restoration of what the right honorable member for Cowper calls confidence in Australia would result in a reduction of interest rates to 3&#189; per cent., let me say that during the time he was Treasurer of the Commonwealth the interest rate increased year by year, and reached its highest point during the last year that he was in office. </para>

Is it not also a fact that in 1929 the right honorable member for Cowper, in his capacity as Commonwealth Treasurer, redeemed the loan raised by the present Treasurer at &#163;5 12s. per cent. at a much lower rate of interest, although at that time interest rates were less favorable than in 1924? </para>

              <para>-Notwithstanding the boycot, and other difficulties which the Government had been encountering for many years, the money it desired was raised at the average rate of interest payable by the Australian States, and other similar borrowers in London. The comparison of that loan with the loans raised in London prior to that time is unfair. The market, at the time, was becoming increasingly difficult for the raising of Australian loans. A few weeks after the Queensland loan was raised a still higher rate of interest had to be paid. The loan raised by the Queensland Labour Government in that year, and in succeeding years, compared as to terms favorably with loans raised by the right honorable member for Cowper or the Treasurer of any Australian government. My answer to the honorable member for Corangamite, that it was ridiculous for the right honorable member for Cowper, or any other responsible member of the House or. responsible citizen elsewhere, to suggest that the mere change of government would bring about a reduction of interest rates, was quite correct. </para>

            <para>- I have seen the report referred to by the honorable member. So far as I know, representations have not been made to the Commonwealth Government in regard to the holding of such a conference. I have no doubt that the Prime Minister would be pleased to arrange for representation at the conference if an invitation is received. This is a most interesting matter. It is apparent that it is now recognized that the gold standard is not giving full satisfaction to its sponsors, and that resort will have to be made to a multiple standard. </para>

            <para>- The meaning and purpose of the retail price index numbers computed by the Bureau of Census and Statistics is sometimes misconstrued. This is due in great measure to the fact that a more or less definite wage value has been attributed to these indexes by industrial tribunals throughout Australia, and more particularly by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The wage value given to the index numbers is a matter for which the Statistician&#39;s Bureau is in no way responsible. The bureau does not, by virtue of its index numbers, determine the &#34;cost of living,&#34; or what a &#34;fair basic wage&#34; should be. The purpose of the index numbers is to provide a ready and effective means of measuring retail price variations over stated periods of time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">The method by which the bureau compiles its index numbers was adopted after full and careful investigation of the methods adopted in other countries. The system is mathematically sound, and has the endorsement of world-wide authorities as a simple and effective means of measuring price variations over a period of time. The prices being treatedin the same way in respect of every date of collection, and the &#34; composite &#34; unit or list of commodities being kept constant, the method adopted provides a true index of the variations in prices between any given dates. </para>

            <para>- On the 1st May, the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> asked me a question without notice in regard to a report which had appeared in the press regarding a test undergone by a German aeroplane fitted with a single-cylinder Diesel engine, and the use of crude oil in connexion therewith. Information in the possession of the Department of Defence indicates that the production of a Diesel type aero en gine using crude oil or oil extracted from coal has been engaging the attention of internal combustion engineers for a number of years in America, England, and on the Continent. The department states that very considerable progress has been made, and the underlying principles of the problem are now well understood, but there are certain basic disabilities which make for difficulty in the direct application of the principle to aero engines. Nevertheless, certain firms have ventured to put an engine on the market and others are in process of developing an engine. The American Packard, the English Beardmore, Typhoon, and the German Junkers are instances of engines which have been built and put into service, but although each has had some measure of success it cannot be said that the type at present shows more than promise of future success. Other firms such as Messrs. Ricardo and Rolls Royce have experimental engines under test. The development of this type of engine is being followed with keen interest by the Defence Department. Following upon the publication to-day of a press cable from London relative to certain action by the Admiralty in regard to calling tenders for supplies of oil from coal, the matter is being made the subject of further investigation by the Commonwealth Government. </para>

          <para class="block">Fridays has been 11 o&#39;clock. The proposed alteration would provide only an additional half -hour for the sitting of the House, but I remind the Prime Minister that honorable members are not idle now during the time preceding the commencement of the sitting at 11 o&#39;clock. Members have a great deal of work to do, and it will be agreed that during these time of stress member&#39;s correspondence is much greater than in normal times. Eleven o&#39;clock is a suitable time for most members, and should be adhered to. The Prime Minister has not suggested that the session will be shortened if this extra time is added to the Friday sitting. He has not indicated how long he anticipates the tariff debate to last, or what business is to be brought down. His proposal means only that another half-hour will be taken off the time available to honorable members for dealing with matters claiming their attention. In my opinion, we should not depart from the present practice. </para>

            <para>.- I support the motion. My only regret is that it does not provide for sitting on Mondays. In my opinion, the work of Parliament would be performed with much greater despatch if members were obliged to remain in Canberra during the whole time that Parliament was in session. The present interruptions to the continuity of the work of Parliament are excessive. </para>

              <para>- I support the proposal as an instalment of what I hope is to come. At present we meet on Tuesdays,Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, but on Friday afternoon honorable members disperse, most of them going to Sydney or Melbourne, whence they do not return until the following Tuesday. Parliament and the country would be better served if they remained in Canberra. Business would be more expeditiously despatched, and the Canberra hotels, which are now practically empty throughout the weekend, would yield a better return. A full staff has to be kept in those hotels to maintain them in an occupiable condition, and the cost of running them is high whether members remain here or not. Moreover, if members stayed in Canberra, railway accommodation on Friday afternoon and evening would not be overtaxed as it is now. Members could do their work in Canberra as easily as in Sydney or Melbourne. The present arrangement, while convenient for those honorable member&#39;s who can visit their homes in Victoria and New South Wales, prolongs the session, and has the effect of keeping honorable members representing the more distant States away from their homes longer than would otherwise be necessary. </para>

              <para>- The constituents of the Attorney-General can be reached by telephone and letter in precisely the same way as can those of the honorable member for Fremantle. The idea that this national capital, because it is situated close to the cities of Sydney and Melbourne, may be regarded as a suburb of those cities, is an affront to national sentiment. In my opinion, the sessions should be shorter, but the number of sitting days increased. </para>

            <para>.- I have no objection to starting half an. hour earlier on Fridays, because I believe that when we sit we should do a day&#39;s work. The addition of an extra half-hour is a step in that direction. We usually adjourn early on Friday to allow members travelling to Sydney to get away by the afternoon train. Those of us, however, who do not leave until the evening, could well continue sitting for a longer time. If this half-hour is to be added, I hope that we shall do something better with the time than we have done up to the present. </para>

              <para>- I am not finding fault with the Government. We have been arguing for hours about duties on brandy, gin and whisky, when the people are rapidly reaching the stage when they cannot buy even bread. Those tariffs will not assist in any shape or form to provide employment for the people. They were originally imposed with the bona fide desire to create additional employment. I was a member of the Government which introduced them, and I believe that they would have achieved their purpose had conditions been normal. However, the Minister for Trade and Customs, who has fought so hard for them, has on a number of occasions had to admit disappointment because his hopes have not been realized, not because of any intrinsic defect in the schedule, but because of the serious economic depression from which the country is suffering. In my opinion, a great deal of time has been, and will be wasted by honorable members on both sides of the House over the discussion on the tariff, and I recommend that there should be an agreement to validate the whole of the proposals, for what they are worth, so that Parliament may settle down to more important tasks, and devote a greater amount of time to the endeavour to find relief for the unemployed.

            <para>.- The Prime Minister intimated that, prior to 1917, it was the practice of the House to meet at 10.30 a.m. on Friday morning. That is quite correct. The time of meeting was altered to 11 o&#39;clock, because it was found impossible for the Ministers in charge of the various departments to transact their business in the short interval at their disposal before Parliament met on Friday. Of late years, and especially since the Parliament removed to Canberra, the undesirable practice has grown up of Ministers bringing their departmental work to the House and transacting it here. As a result it is rare to see a Minister in the chamber, other than the Minister in charge of the measure before the House. That is not as it should be. I recognize that there are times when Ministers must absent themselves from the chamber, but as they are in charge of the business of the House, they should be here to see that it is properly transacted. If meeting at 10.30 instead of 11 o&#39;clock will result in Ministers further absenting themselves from the chamber, I am opposed to the change. The House of Commons has frowned upon the practice. </para>

          <para>The receiving of  deputations while the House is in session is another undesirable practice that has been carried out to a very considerable extent in recent years, in this Parliament.

          <para>I am at variance with the honorable member for Fremantle in one matter. I am not in favour of the House sitting continuously. I envy those honorable members who find it possible to visit Sydney, Melbourne, and other centres during week-ends, and so come into contact with the outside world. The one weakness of Canberra, from the stand-point of parliamentary work, is that members are isolated when living in the Federal Capital, and have no opportunity to meet representative citizens in the metropolitan cities, to discuss present and prospective legislation. If the suggestion of the honorable member for Fremantle were agreed to, honorable members would suffer to a still greater extent. I am of the opinion that the additional half-hour that the Prime Minister desires to add to our labours is neither here nor there. However, if the right honorable gentleman thinks that it will assist in expediting the work of this chamber, I give it my hearty support. </para>

            <para>.-r- I have no objection to raise to the proposal of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> but I ask the right honorable gentleman to give consideration to a suggestion that was put forward a few days ago by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> who, incidentally, is a medical man. When the House agreed to certain alterations&#39; in the Standing Orders which curtailed the time limit imposed on speeches, the right honorable gentleman suggested that the Government might very well consider the rising of the House automatically at, say,  10.30  p.m. or thereabouts each night. It seems to me that if honorable members were not compelled to sit too late, the business of the House would be transacted more effectively. While I have no objection to the House meeting at  10.30  on Friday morning, and strongly &#39; support any change that would facilitate the despatch of the business of Parliament, I urge the Prime Minister to consider the proposal of the right honorable member for Cowper. </para>

            <para>. - The Government considered the advisability of the House meeting at  10  o&#39;clock on Friday mornings; but the very reasons advanced by the honorable members for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> and Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bayley),</inline> that honorable members have correspondence to attend to and Ministers have to deal with departmental matters, caused it to fix upon  10.30  as a compromise. While the additional half-hour on Friday mornings does not appear to be a very important extension of our working time, it will amount in the aggregate to a. considerable increase, and should help Parliament to expedite the transaction of its business. I do not think that it is possible to keep the House in session every day in the week. I know the difficulties under which Ministers labour in coping with their administrative duties as things are. It is quite true, as was said by the honorable member for Oxley, that Ministers have to consult their officers and attend to departmental work while the House is sitting. That is absolutely unavoidable. In addition, their time is taken up with conferences and other matters, which, if not attended to during the sitting hours of Parliament, would occupy the attention of Ministers until the early hours of the morning. It would not be humanly possible to continue to work under such conditions.  1  point out, too, that there are a number of departments still in Melbourne, and the Ministers in control of them must visit them during week-ends. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - About two  weeks ago  the Loan  Council  met, and made a suggestion that there should be a conference of party leaders to consider the nation&#39;s financial and economic position. It was subsequently agreed that a special committee should be appointed to go into the subject, gather details, and report  back  to the Loan Council; also that  a  Premiers&#39; conference might with advantage be held to consider that report and other matters. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I was questioned on the subject in the House, and suggested that it would be much better if these economic and financial problems were considered in this chamber. I have since gone into the matter very thoroughly, and am more than ever convinced that that would be the wiser course to. follow. From discussions with State Ministers I have learned that many of the subjects which would be brought before the suggested conference of party leaders would relate to matters affecting certain Parliaments only. A conference of party leaders from all parts of the Commonwealth to discuss detailed matters of local or very restricted interest, would occupy probably six months, during which the business of all Parliaments would be held up. It is true that there are some subjects which affect both Commonwealth and State Parliaments, but they can be most appropriately discussed at a Premiers&#39; conference. If the Premiers in conference were of opinion that others might be brought into consultation, such a proposal could be considered. But I am convinced that each Parliament should consider a number of subjects affecting the economic and financial position of Australia. I have suggested before, and I do so now, that the members of this Parliament should meet in conference. I may be answered that we are conferring each day in the ordinary course of parliamentary business; but that is not so. In Parliament we meet as a government party and an opposition party. In the main, parliamentary business is initiated by the Government, and is discussed by members, divided into two principal parties- Governmen and Opposition. </para>

              <para>- I have never received any similar offer. Certainly, I heard of a proposal which I interpreted as. a suggestion for a coalition government, but which I subsequently learned was not so intended. No suggestion has ever been made to me that the members of this Parliament should meet in conference to consider the financial and economic problems of Australia. But even if, after receiving such an offer and rejecting it, I am now seeing the light, honorable members should not complain. It is never too. late to mend. I suggest to honorable members that it would be better for them to listen to what I have to say and then express their judgment on it. Let us try to give to each other credit for sincerity. We have to deal with the most serious financial and economic problems that have ever confronted this country. In suggesting that the Government should confer with the Opposition I am not admitting, as some newspapers represent, that we are incompetent or have failed. </para>

              <para>- I have never believed that all the wisdom of this Parliament reposes in one group of men, nor am I foolish enough to shut my eyes to the fact that a deadlock has been reached between the two chambers. We have to ask ourselves whether we should permit the present impasse to continue, or do  what we can to give immediaterelief to the people. The two sections which are most hardly hit are those who are unable to get employment, and the men on the land; both are sufferingacute distress, and we have to devise means of helping them. I am not claiming that honorable members supporting the Government are the only persons who have sympathy for those who are distressed. I believe that genuine concern for the workless and the embarrassed primary producers is in the hearts and minds of every honorable member and every section of the community. Our task is to reconcile some of our differences in order to afford a measure of relief, even though it be of only a temporary character. I said on a former occasion that, instead of meeting in the formal atmosphere of a Parliament, we should meet in conference, suspend the StandingOrders, and have a frank discussion. </para>

              <para>- The objection may be raised that a conference of all the members of this Parliament would be unwieldy ; but I do not think it desirable to startselecting delegates, because honorable members, regardless of the party to which they belong, are equally representative of the people. I am willing to invite the Senate to participate in our deliberations. That chamber could attend in full strength, or could appoint representatives from both parties. I have in mind a general frank discussion, devoid of party feeling. </para>

              <para>- An official record also would be taken. No harm could comefrom allowing the light ofpublicity on all our doings.After a general discussion theconference might decide to appoint sub-committees representative of bothchambers to investigate specific matters. If this proposal is acceptable to the Opposition the conference might meet next week ; or, if that is too soon, a week later. If possible, delay should be avoided, and I would prefer that the conference should start on Wednesday next, leaving Tuesday for the arrangement of details, and the circulation amongst members of as much information as can be obtained. Further details could be mutually arranged; but the Government would like the conference to start promptly, in order to avoid the possibility of clashing with a proposed conference of Premiers. All information available in the departments would be at the disposal of honorable members. </para>

              <para>- That would be determined by the conference. In a preliminary discussion we could decide the time limit for speeches, the hours of sitting, who should preside, and the outside experts whose services should be co- opted. In the discussions honorable members would not be tied down rigidly by the usual parliamentary precedure. I in not propose at this stage to discuss our economic and financial problems, but they would be submitted to the conference at the commencement of its deliberations. Anagenda paper would be prepared on which every honorable member could place his proposals. We would not meet as Government and Opposition, but merely as 76 members of Parliament, plus those members of another place who might care to attend. Those who were sufficiently interested could attend and make suggestions as the conference proceeded. </para>

              <para>- The Imperial Conferencemeets in open session, and a general discussion takes place. Specific subjects are referred to committees. No decisions are registered unless there is general agreement, but the conference does allow of the frank expression of views, and the making of helpful suggestions and proposals. However, that is a detail, to be decided by the proposed conference. I am afraid that if the conference were to resort to divisions in order to register decisions it would be reverting to the ordinary procedure of Parliament; we would not have the freedom and frankness of discussion that is desirable, because a member might fear that he would be contributing to a decision which neither the Government nor the Opposition could implement. In the final analysis a government or opposition has to accept responsibility; but in order that we may inform our minds and exchange our views in a freer and more practical way than we are able to do in this House, I suggest this conference. </para>

          <para>Honorable members may say that we have discussed in Parliament the economic and financial problems; but how have we discussed them? Mainly on censure motions, which produce the wrong atmosphere for mutual agreement. The finances are dealt with, to some extent, in the budget debates. The Treasurer, after weeks of work with his departmental officers on the Estimates submitted by each Minister, makes a statement to the House of the financial policy of the Government. A discussion follows on party lines. I suggest that if we are to discuss the finances we should do it in conference before budgets are formulated. The Government would be prepared to place before a conference all information relative to the budget, and any proposals for departmental changes. All information, without reservation, would be put before the conference, and individual members could, without prejudice, submit any proposal they thought fit. </para>

              <para>- It would be easy to destroy by recriminations from either side the spirit that is behind any suggestion to meet a national crisis. I could make quite as apt a retort as the honorable member can, but I do not think that it would be fitting to do so at this stage. There is no need for a sacrifice of principle by either side, and I do not suggest that the Opposition should sacrifice its fixed convictions and principles merely to meet the convenience of the Government. Yet surely a frank exchange of views without party spirit would bo helpful. There must be in the combined wisdom of this Parliament ideas that have not been disclosed or discussed. I do not suggest that in conference we should stand off at long range, making speeches to one another. If we do that no good purpose will be served. My suggestion is that there might be an exchange of ideas across the table, and an examination of one proposition after another. The departments and individual experts would be at our service. In this way we might create for the electors a much more hopeful outlook than they have to-day. I do not suggest a coalition government, because I do not believe in coalition governments.We could confer in this chamber, and at the same time maintain our allegiance and pledges to the electors and to our various organizations. Surely it is our duty to those of our people who are in distress to seek some solution of our pressing problems. At such aconference we could discuss many  vital issues. The members of this Parliament, in conference, should be able to arrive at some means to enable immediate relief to be given in emergency cases. </para>

              <para>- My suggestion is an effort in the direction of helping this Parliament to govern. This Parliament will govern better if we deliberate as a conference at least for one week. We can then discuss subject after subject, and problem after problem. We can examine frankly every emergency proposal, treating each other&#39;s suggestions with respect and as a sincere effort towards the solution of our problems. </para>

It will invite every honorable member to do the same thing.

              <para>- I shall certainly attend the conference with an open mind, though not with a blank mind. Every honorable member should attend the conference to suggest remedies for our financial ills, and those suggestions should be examined frankly and fairly. It would be of no use to attend the conference with our minds made up not to accept any suggestions. All suggestions put forward should be discussed on their merits. It is possible that in conference we may come to some agreement, and fashion a policy that will to some extent relieve the present situation. There is no reason why we should not confer. If the object of the conference were to fail, we should only have wasted one week of the time of this Parliament; but I cannot believe that our time would be wasted. </para>

              <inline font-style="italic">. - by leave</inline>- I am naturally suspicious of any &#34; come-together &#34; movement, particularly in view of the divergence of opinions among the various parties in this House. More information is required by honorable members as to the details of the proposal of the Prime Minister. His statement gives the impression that the policy of the Government has failed, that the Ministry is at the end of its resources, and that it is powerless to meet the present situation. It is not right for the Government at this serious stage of our affairs to put up the white flag. The people in my electorate, which is composed mostly of workers, have made great sacrifices in the present crisis, and I am not going to be a party to any movement which will not restore to them what has been taken away, more particularly when a large section of the community has made no sacrifice at all. The Government has not by any means explored all the avenues of relief that are open to them under its constitutional powers, and I am therefore not at the moment prepared to accept the proposal for a conference of honorable members. Before any final determination is made, I hope that more information will be given to honorable members. </para>

          <para>. - It is customary, when an alteration of the agenda paper is intended, to notify the members of this House, so that when they enter the chamber they may be prepared to discuss the subjects that are brought forward for consideration. On a previous occasion when the Prime Minis ter changed the order of the business, my colleagues and myself protested against his action, and he then promised that, in future, notification would be given of any proposed changes in the business paper, so that all honorable members would know in advance the intention of the Government. The Prime Minister has honored that promise on one occasion since then, but to-day an alteration is being proposed without any notification having been given to honorable members. I do not know whether the members of the Opposition have received any notification. </para>

The Government is responsible for notifying honorable members of the business to be placed before the House, and the programme set down on the notice-paper which has been distributed to honorable members should be followed. Otherwise considerable inconvenience may be caused. The Prime Minister has failed to honour an undertaking which he previously gave to this House, and for that reason I oppose the motion. </para>

          <para>. - I deeply regret that the committee is being asked to approve of the motion, although I realize that this is because of the action taken by another place. The people whom I represent wall now realize that an honorable senator who has been elected Leader of the Opposition in another place is unworthy of his position. Until another place has a leader with a wider vision than that possessed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> it will not be possible for us to tackle Australians problems effectively. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has turned his back upon the ladder which enabled him to ascend to his place in this Parliament, and to the position he holds in the political life of Australia. Nothing that emanates from a Labour representative has any good in it, in the opinion of that gentleman. In this instance his attitude is purely antiNelson; and it is anti-Nelson because Nelson is a Labour representative. The spineless attitude adopted by the members of another place who were elected to a conference with managers elected by this chamber is to be deplored. That conference reached a unanimous agreement; but now, in order to enable one man to vent his spleen upon the party responsible for his advancement, they have allowed themselves to be overruled. </para>

We have heard a good deal in this chamber, and a good deal has been said in another place, about repudiation. In my opinion, the members of another place have been guilty of repudiation of the grossest kind, for they have repudiated the agreement made with certain honorable members of this chamber in regard to this bill. The decision of the conference of managers was unanimous, but because Nelson was connected with the proceedings the honorable senator to whom I have referred, will not agree to the decision that was reached. What does this honorable senator care about the welfare of the Northern Territory ?  His  only desire is to hit back at Nelson. </para>

            <para>- It is time the people whom I represent were told the facts. It appears to me that honorable senators opposite represent the interests of a very small section which operates in a very big way; I refer to the Vestey interests. These interests knew very well that if this bill had been passed in the form in which it left this chamber, hundreds of small cattle-owners - men who run from 300 to 3,000 beasts- would be able to secure representation on the advisory council. I resent the scurrilous remarks made a day or two ago on this subject by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> in this chamber, and by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in another place. That it is incorrect to say that union organizers and agitators would be elected to the proposed advisory council is shown by the representation on the existing councils in North and Central Australia. The Government desired to give the primary producers representation, but the Vestey interests have been able, through another place, to prevent it from doing so. I hope that I shall some day have an opportunity to give publicity to what I know about the Vestey interests, and the part that they have played in hindering the development of the Northern Territory. </para>

            <para>- They will not be able to retaliate when I can say what I know. The Vestey people never talk about labour conditions when I am about. The action taken in another place has deprived the settlers of the only vestige of representation that they might have had for the purpose of giving advice as to the best means of developing that country. I know that the Government will accept the Senate&#39;s amendments, because it is essential in the interests of economy to save &#163;8,000 a year by the abolition of the North Australia Commission, which is now impotent to carry out its proposals. But the time will come when this Parliament will rue the day when it let the pioneers in the territory down. I challenge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce, or anybody else, to tour the territory with me, and show that union organizers would be represented on the council. I extend the same challenge to Vestey&#39;s, or to any other interests in the territory. This part of Australia will eventually make good, not because of any assistance that has been given by various administrations, but in spite of all governments. The settlers have the will to conquer, and the day will come when the people of Australia will marvel at the fact that for the last 20 years the territory has been shackled by the legislature. I trust that, immediately the bill has been passed, some measure of representation will be given to the settlers, whether they be miners, pastoralists, or agriculturalists, so that they may be able to extend to the authorities advice based upon the knowledge that they have obtained as the result of half a century&#39;s personal experience of the problems of that country. Whatever policy is adopted in the future, the settlers must eventually be granted local responsibility. </para>

I have stated that if the commission could have obtained the money required to carry out its proposals, good would have resulted, but an impossible position has arisen,because the commission, composed of four or five men, and having a great retinue of officers, has no funds with which to give effect to its policy. </para>

          <para>.:  -  I sympathize with the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> in his anxiety to substitute some other authority in place of the North Australia Commission. While I agree with him that it is necessary to have some such advisory body as -has been rejected in another place, I cannot understand the attitude of the Government in regard to the bill. I will support the honorable member for the Northern Territory in any action he may take to induce the Government to drop the measure. The members of the commission are well able to carry out the work required of them. They have now an intimate knowledge of the potentialities and needs of the territory, and their experience would have been of great value in promoting its development. The commission is highly qualified to deal with mining development, but that subject was not entrusted to it. When the commission was appointed, laymen naturally expected that very soon the mineral possibilities of the territory would be developed. Had the present Government not suddenly determined to abolish the commission, they could have secured excellent results from its members by broadening their powers. The honorable member for the Northern Territory has pointed out that the residents will be given no advisory functions if the Senate&#39;s amendments are accepted. I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the bill, and to continue tlie present commission with wider powers. </para>

I pointed out that he had intervened, and had quashed convictions in the Darwin court, with the result that fines were reduced, and men were released from prison - or I used words to that effect. The Minister said: &#34;Tell the truth; don&#39;t spread lies.&#34; Had I heard that remark, I would have insisted upon its withdrawal. </para>

            <para>- Then I shall say no more about that. I did not make the statement without knowledge of the facts. I had asked questions previously on the subject of the franchise at Darwin. I had requested the Minister to place the telegrams on the table of the House concerning the whole case. The Minister refused to do so, but prepared a memorandum. There was obviously a liaison between the gentleman who caused the trouble and the Minister. I refer to that only in passing, because I feel that the interests of the Northern Territory should be the concern of all members, and should transcend party politics. </para>

        <para>A great deal of money has been wasted on the territory simply because that country has not been given the attention that it warrants. The provision of roads, for instance, is of paramount importance, and, since Darwin has now become a regular port on the air route to Europe, it will become one of the stopping places for the Dutch mail or for the Imperial Airways mail, thus bringing it closer to us than ever before. For that reason, I feel that control of the Northern Territory by one person from so distant a place as Canberra is wrong. The Minister, in seeking to give the adult population of the territory a vote of the nature intended by him, is taking an unwise course. On the 6th August last year I asked in the House - </para>

            <para>- It would be inadvisable to give the ratepayers and the men who have no stake in the territory the same voting power. The residents are agreed that the choice of the present mayor of Darwin, although his political views may be different from my own, is a wise one. . I say nothing against his politics; he seems to have the approbation of the local residents. It is wrong to have a council elected on an adult franchise, and for that reason I support the action taken in another place. </para>

These rates have also been made the same as those operating on non-spirituous amyl acetate and ethyl acetate under item 11 a. The action of the Government in increasing the duty under this item had the immediate effect of influencing a manufacturer in New South Wales to undertake the production of ethyl acetate. This firm acquired certain patent rights, installed the necessary plant for the most up-to-date and economical process of manufacture, and is now able to supply more than the whole of Australia&#39;s annual requirements. The local acetate, which is 100 per cent. Australian production, is giving complete satisfaction to users throughout the Commonwealth. Employment has been found for additional workers, and the price of the product has been reduced. The ethyl acetate manufactured by this firm is produced from ethyl alcohol, which is a bi-product in the manufacture of sugar from sugar-cane. Indirectly, the increased duty assists one of our important primary industries. </para>

I am bound to say that I did not understand the explanation which the Minister gave. It consisted of a mingling of technical terms, which really conveyed nothing to the lay mind. If the Minister is unable to give a general explanation, understandable by laymen, it is surely reasonable for honorable members to ask for a report from the Tariff .Board. It is not our duty to come here and register a vote on a subject with which we are not conversant simply at the request of the Minister. I ask any honorable member frankly does he understand anything about amyl acetate and ethyl acetate? One does not know whether the Minister is talking in Sanskrit, Egyptian, or even in abusive language. It is time that this committee got down to realities, and was told exactly what is meant by these tariff changes. With the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker),</inline> I am not prepared to register a vote on a matter which has been so indifferently explained by the Minister. </para>

When I register a vote, I desire to be able to give a reason for my action. I have felt with regard to this and other items of the tariff that insufficient information  ha3  been given to honorable members concerning the imposition of these duties. Frequently it is difficult to determine whether they are the result of political pressure or economic necessity. Regarding this particular item I, like other honorable members who have preceded me, do not understand why the duty is necessary. A tariff board exists for the purpose of enlightening honorable members on these matters, and I submit that we should have been supplied with the reasons that induced that board to make any recommendation in the matter if, indeed, a recommendation has been made. I do not known on what principle the rate of duty has been fixed, therefore I do not propose to vote for i&#39;t. </para>

              <para>- I refer the honorable member to the memorandum,  which  sets out the alterations in detail, and which has been circulated among honorable members in order to inform their minds  and  save the Minister a great deal of explanation. Item 11 a provides for certain non-spirituous ethers, which were permitted to contain only up to 2 per cent. of spirit. By making the ether content 3 per cent., traders were able to bring the item in at the lower nonspirituous rate. As a matter of fact, ether containing 3 per cent. spirit is practically non-spirituous. Item 10 b corrects the anomaly by providing for a spirit content of from 15 to 25 per cent. I  might explain  that amyl acetate is used  for flavouring,  and also for duco paints  and  a medium for gold paints. Ethyl acetate is used principally for flavouring purposes. This item does not cover chloroform. The item 10 a, which the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> desired me to read, is not in the new schedule. As I am anxious to provide honorable members with all the information at my disposal, I have obtained a copy of the 1921-28 tariff, at page 7 of which item 10 a may be found. It reads - </para>

            <para>.- I should not have spoken upon this item were it not for the fact that the change that has been made discloses a very extraordinary sacrifice of revenue. The Minister spent a good deal of time yesterday pleading for the retention of high duties on whisky on the ground that the country was in urgent need of money, and whisky was fair game for the imposition of high duties. I submit that that argument is equally applicable to tobacco. Yet the Minister is making a great sacrifice of revenue by this change. The duty on unstemmed tobacco has been reduced from 3s. 2d. to 2s. 6d., or a difference of 8d. per lb. On stemmed tobacco the reduction is also 8d. per lb., from 3s. 8d. to 3s. A startling increase is disclosed in the rate of excise on cigars manufactured in Australia. The old excise on hand-made cigars was 2s. 8d. per lb., and it has been reduced to 3d. per lb. In other words, the excise on Australianmade cigars has been entirely removed, so that cigars made in this country are no longer subject to taxation. That is a scandalous state of affairs. Later  I  shall have something to say as to the reasons for this remarkable change. The excise on machine-made cigars has been reduced from 3s. 8d. to1s. 3d. per lb. In each case the reduction amounts to 2s. 5d. per lb. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Two years ago, when I was in charge of the Customs Department, the representatives of the Cigar Makers Union, and the big tobacco company interviewed me. The Australian cigar had been forced to a price so high that it was not saleable, and in relatively good times extreme depression existed in the industry. Investigating the matter further, I discovered that the Cigar Makers Union had approached the Victorian Wages Board for a steep increase in the piece-work rates. The company pointed out to the board that if the rates asked for were granted, partial destruction of the industry would be inevitable, because the price would have  to  rise to a level which would make cigars unpopular, and people would change to other forms of tobacco. The board granted the request of the union, and immediately a slump in the industry occurred. Under the new rates, men working full time could earn between &#163;10 and &#163;11 a week, but they were then working half time only. Employers and employees asked for various alterations of the customs and excise duties, but I was not prepared to bolster up such extravagant earnings. I opened up negotiations with the parties, and I believe they would have been successful had I remained in office to carry them to completion. I asked the representatives of the union whether, if the company were content with smaller profits, and I gave certain assistance through the customs and excise duties, they would agree to lower rates for piece-work; they said they would. That is the proper way to approach a. tariff problem, but the Minister has not adopted that course in connexion with the items in this schedule. The reduction of the excise duty is extraordinary. Every consumer of alcohol is heavily taxed, and so is every user of tobacco, except the cigar-smoker. The Minister&#39;s concern, however, is not for him, but for the unionists, in whose interests he has made an improper sacrifice of revenue at a time of national necessity. I do not propose to move an amendment to this item, but at a later stage I shall invite the committee to express its opinion as to whether the excise on Australian-made cigars should have been almost entirely abolished. </para>

            <para>.- I. was sorry to hear the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> urge this afternoon greater expedition in dealing with the tariff. Because of its bearing on the economic position of Australia, a full consideration of the tariff is of the first importance, and I believe that the honorable gentleman will find that he has lent himself to a policy, the full significance of which he does not realize. The Government urgently needs more revenue, and I have no objection to the heavy taxation of luxuries, but the Government has been guilty of a despicable act in sacrificing about &#163;40,000 worth of revenue in connexion with the customs and excise duties on cigar-leaf and cigars. I move - </para>

          <para class="block">I desire to overcome the provisions of the Customs Act 1925 requiring that an article shall have 75 per cent, of British material or workmanship to qualify for the preferential duty. Everything possible should be done to encourage trade with the United Kingdom, which is our best customer. The records of the Customs Department show that the importations of cigarettes and cigars from the United Kingdom have always been fairly large. We should encourage that trade with Great Britain, and utilize the intermediate tariff to reciprocate any concessions given by France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, and other countries that are prepared to make trade agreements with Australia. That principle should be followed throughout the tariff. </para>

              <para>- The Government wants revenue, and has increased the duties on biscuits to 3d. and 4d. a lb., and has made more expensive every requirement of the worker and the producer. But on this item it is prepared to sacrifice over &#163;40,000 for the benefit of men who, according to the honorable member for Plenty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> can earn &#163;10 or &#163;11 a week; and the combine controlling the industry. Is there any need to help these people to such an extent? When dealing with the 1920 tariff schedule, I quoted statistics- showing thatif we imported all our cigars, and the Australian people continued to smoke the same quantity, we could afford to pay a pension of &#163;200 a year to every man and woman employed in the cigar-making industry, and still be &#163;86,000 to the good. If the Whole of the 338,000 lb. of cigars manufactured in Australia were imported, the duty, at 20s. per lb., would benefit the revenue to the amount of &#163;338;000. The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fenton)</inline> has interjected that the industryis no longer prospering; and I propose to show what has been the result of government interference. As invariably happens when external competition is eliminated by excessive tariff protection, the cigar industry has retrogressed. In 1911 we manufactured 3.81,000 lb. of cigars; in 1912, 374,000 lb.; in 1913, 397,000 lb.; in 1915, 364,000 lb.; in 1916, 374,000 lb. ; 1917, 429,000 lb. At that time a considerable fillip was given to the Australian manufacturer. </para>

              <para>- The prosperous times came later. In 1918 we manufactured 491,000lb. of cigars; 1919, 448,000 lb.; in 1920; 567,000 lb.; in 1921, 516,000 lb. High duties on cigars were then imposed, and since then the manufacture of cigars in Australia has gradually decreased. In 1922 we manufactured. 525,000 lb. of cigars ; in 1923, 487,000 lb.; in 1924, 448,000 lb.; in 1925, 474,000 lb.; in 1926, 439,000 lb.; in 1927, 431,000 lb.; in 1928 384,000 lb.;. and in 1929 338;000 lb. In that year we produced 230,000 lb. of cigars less than we did in 1920. That was because of government interference with trade and industry. All sorts of concessions were given to the manufacturers. The decline of the local manufacture of cigars cannot be said to be due to the desire on the part of the smoking public for better cigars, but the fact remains that although there has been a gradual reduction in the weight of imported cigars - we still import over 100,000 lb. of cigars - the production in Australia has decreased in weight by some 230,000 lb. To give the Australian industry another fillip, we are now sacrificing &#163;40,000 in revenue. The Government&#39;s action should be exposed. It has told the people that it cannot find money for the relief of unemployment or for the assistance of the primary producers, yet. it is able to make a considerable concession in respect of the duty on tobacco to the extent of over &#163;40,000. </para>

          <para class="block">Australian market. Since 1920 continual assistancehas been given to this industry and the result, even to the industry itself, has been disastrous. The trade must endeavour to win favour by supplying a good article at a reasonable price and not by an almost prohibitive duty. When we come to the excise duties, I hope the committee will restore the old condition. The country cannot afford to sacrifice &#163;40,000. At a time of depression we are not justified in making special concessions to Australian tobacco manufacturers. The purpose of my amendment is to give some concession to those countries which arc prepared to enter into reciprocal treaties with us. </para>

            <para>.- I support the amendment of the honorable member for Swan. At a time when we are badly in need of revenue it is absurd to impose a duty of 20s. a lb. on cigars. The leaf tobacco out of which our cigars are made bears a duty of 3s. a lb., and the additional duty of 17s. a lb. is being imposed to assist the Australian cigar manufacturer. That concession will deprive us of considerable revenue. It will practically prohibit the importation of cigars, and at the same time decrease the consumption of cigars in Australia. I am anxious to add to the Commonwealth revenue. I am a believer in a revenue tariff particularly in respect of tobacco, spirits and other such luxuries, which can be taxed without injury to the community.

              <para>- We want revenue from the tobacco grown in Australia. Yet the excise has been reduced considerably. At the same time the import duty has been increased enormously. As the import duty has been increased, the Minister should allow the excise to remain as it was previously. The only objection that I have to the amendment is that it does not provide a big enough reduction of the duty. To prevent the Commonwealth revenue from being further depleted, I trust that the Minister will consent to this amendment, and if not, that the committee will insist upon it. </para>

When the present Government took office it withdrew the British preferential tariff on tobacco. At that time the duty was11s. British preferential; 12s. Intermediate; and 13s. General. It has now been increased to a flat rate of 20s. We must encourage our tradewith countries which are willing to trade with us. We do a huge trade with the United States of America, but unfortunately for us, that country refuses to buy our products. During a period of ten years we have had to find gold with which to balance our trade with that country to the extent of &#163;210,000,000. Had we secured trade with the United States of America to that extent, we should not now be in our present financial difficulty. </para>

              <para>- It lies unfortunately in the tariff of this country. The United States of America had adopted a selfish policy. It has huge deposits of gold, and it is demanding every cent of the money that it lent to the allies during the war. It has no moral right to that money. The world to-day has been crushed by the power and influence of the United States. It is therefore only right that we should do everything within our power to counteract the influence and trade of that country where it is crushing Australia. I should be willing to include in the schedule a fourth and prohibitive tariff to apply solely to the United States of America. I support the amendment because, if carried, it will favour Britain which is willing to buy our products. </para>

            <para>. - I support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Swan, although I regret that the proposed reduction is not more drastic than it is. The amendment provides for a duty of 18s. British Preferential; 19s. Intermediate; and 20s. General. I suggest that the duty should be 15s.; 17s. and 20s. When the British preferential tariff on cigars was11s., the cigar manufacturing industry in Australia was in a more flourishing condition  than it is to-day. The reason is obvious. It is the old story that is told of all the Australian industries. High duties amounting almost to prohibition have been imposed, and as a result the people refuse or cannot afford to buy the protected articles. The high tariff has been a deterrent to the cigar manufacturing industry. The smoking of cigars has gradually declined in Australia and the Government has, in consequence, lost considerable revenue. The intention of the Minister, when he imposed the higher tariff, was to assist the industry, but unfortunately, his action has had the reverse effect. Not only has the local industry suffered, but the consumption of cigars has decreased. </para>

            <para>.- I regret that I am unable to support the attitude of my Western Australian colleagues on this item, because I feel that we should give special consideration, and even some preferential treatment, to the excellent cigar-making establishment now operating in Perth. In the last fiscal year cigars aggregating 18,000 lb. weight were manufactured there, the value of the output being about &#163;15,000. This secondary industry is established in a State in which fewer such industries are operating than in the other States of Australia. For this reason, and also because the presence of the factory there is stimulating the production of tobacco leaf in Western Australia, I support the item. It seems to me that before we grant a special preference to overseas interests we should consider bow such an action would affect employment in Australia. It is highly desirable that we should not restrict employment in secondary industries in States like Western Australia. To do so would not be a service^ to States which are dependent chiefly upon agricultural pursuits. We should not intensify the competition between secondary industries in such States, and similar secondary industries conducted overseas. For these reasons I cannot support the amendment. </para>

Surely the presence or otherwise of a particular industry in an electorate is not sufficient to determine the attitude of honorable members on these tariff questions. It cannot be said that decisions formed in that way are governed by principles.

          <para>I shall support this item, because I believe that the duties provided will lead to the provision of additional employment in Australia. Five years ago 1,400 persons were engaged in cigar-making in Australia ; to-day the number so employed is only between 500 and 600. I hope that the progressive policy of the Government will soon increase the number considerably above 1,400. </para>
          <para>I have in my hand a cigar made in the Perth factory. It is composed partly of Australian-grown leaf and partly of Havana leaf. Similar cigars may be procured in Canberra at a cost of 6d. It is an excellent smoke, and equal to the 6d. cigars obtainable in any of the capital cities of Australia. My smoking is confined to cigars, and although I do not claim to be a connoisseur, I regard this cigar as a good one. </para>
          <para>Some complaint has been made because the Government will not give a special preference to British cigar manufacturers. The policy of the Government has been adopted because of the endeavours of British cigar manufacturers and importers to claim a preference on cigars made with foreign leaf by foreign labour. It is not fair that such cigars should be granted a preference on the ground that they are British products.  3&#39;ust  as I intend to do everything possible to stimulate the production of tobacco in Australia, so I intend to do my utmost to encourage the manufacture of cigars here. I hope that the time is not far distant when cigars will be manufactured in every capital city of the Commonwealth, and that we shall produce all the cigars that are smoked in Australia. </para>

The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> remembers that the cigar-making industry was then in a serious condition. The number of men employed in it had been reduced from about 1,400 to about 600, and the cost of the Australian-made cigars having risen to 7d. and 4d., the demand for them had decreased. The manufacturers and the employees asked that effect be given to the recommendation made by the Tariff Board in 1925, and the Government adopted that course for the purpose of assisting in the rehabilitation of the industry. We reduced the excise duty by 2s. 5d., and reduced the duty on cigar-leaf by-Sd. a lb. </para>

          <para>Reference has been made to the preference given to the United Kingdom. Certain manufacturers there claimed that their cigars had qualified for this preference, when, as a matter of fact, they had not, and the cost of checking their claim was entirely disproportionate to the trifling amount which the preference was worth. In 1928-29, it represented only &#163;1,600, and it is doubtful whether the quantity of cigars entered at the preferential rate would have qualified the manufacturers for the preference. In 1929-30, the value of the preference was only &#163;1,000, and all the material used ,in the manufacture of the cigars was imported from other countries. Another factor which influenced the Government in abolishing the preference on cigars was that no preference had ever been granted on manufactured tobacco, and it was illogical to grant it on cigars. Certain honorable members have criticized the Government&#39;s action. My reply is that, under the tariff resolutions introduced by this Government, in only 32 items or subitems has the preference been reduced or abolished, while the margin of preference has been increased on 140 items and sub-items. This gives a favorable balance of 108 items and sub-items, and furnishes an adequate reply to those members who have stated that the Government is imbued with the desire to abolish British preference. Honorable members opposite say nothing about the British preference on Argentine meat, and the preference given to wheat from Russia, to the detriment of the sale of Australian wheat. When inspecting the Melbourne factory of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company some time ago, I was surprised to find that hundreds of men were engaged there in making cigars. </para>

            <para>.- The Minister promised to give an explanation of this item, but he has entirely ignored a phrase in the amendment of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> which entirely overcomes the difficulty of the present requirement of 75 per cent, of British material or labour before the preference applies. That requirement may be very desirable in most cases, but I think that, in the present instance, we might well waive it. This could be done by accepting the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Swan. The Minister ha3 said that, while preference to Great Britain has been abolished under certain items, increased preference has been granted under many other items, yet I do not know that that should be regarded as very satisfactory. If the preference is given by adding, perhaps, 50 per cent. to a British:duty and100 per cent. to a foreign duty, itwill be practically impossi ble for Great Britain to trade with Australia under such conditions. </para>

He appeared to think that the honorable member for Swan, and other members who ordinarily support low duties, were doing something diametrically opposed to their usual practice on the present occasion; but I point out that the amendment proposes a reduction of the duty, not for the specific purpose of reducing the revenue, but with the object of maintaining the principle of British preference. </para>

              <para>- Yes, but I join issue with the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. C. Riley),</inline> and the Minister, who seemed to think that the amendment would endanger the local cigar-making industry. The local, industry now pays a total duty of 2s. 9d. per lb. - 2s. 6d. per lb. on leaf imported for the purpose of cigar-making, and 3d. per lb. excise on the manufactured article, if entirely hand-made. That amounts to 2s. 9d. The margin between that and the slightly reduced duty which would be imposed on British cigars if the Minister accepted the amendment, would be so tremendous - not less than 15s. 3d. - that the interests of local manufacturers could not be in any way threatened. If the amendment is accepted; it will mean that 18s. per lb. will be paid on imports from Britain, while the Australian-made cigars will pay a total of only 2s. 9d. If Australia cannot stand up to competition on that basis if is about time we gave up asserting that we are equal, if not superior to, the people of other parts of the world. I am certain that, no matter what the Tariff Board recommended in 1925, it would not, if asked- for a. recommendation now. propose anything on the lines which the Minister has advanced. The Minister seemed to think that he scored a point when he said that the Tariff Board&#39;s recommendation was made in 1925 during the regime of the Bruce-Page Government. As a matter of fact, that was the weakest link in his argument. The board might have been justified in recommending reduced duties when the revenue was buoyant, but it is out of the question that it should now propose a course of action by which the revenue would lose to the extent of &#163;40,000 a year: This industry is, to my mind, a fair field for taxation, especially at this time when we are desperately in need of revenue. </para>

            <para>.- I support the amendment. Before touching upon the matter of preference I should like to point out that the amount of protection afforded to the Australian cigar, manufacturers under the various amendments which have been so lightheartedly introduced by the Minister, amounts to no less than 700 per cent. Evidently, that is what the Minister regards as a. fair measure of protection for Australian capital and Australian workmen. </para>

              <para>- The Minister is constantly shifting his ground. One moment he says that, thesehigh duties Have been imposed toyield more revenue, and the next moment he says that they will foster Australian industry. He was in the same state of mental confusion during the discussion on the whisky duties. We have to ask ourselves whether the cigar-making industry is worth what we are paying for it in loss of revenue. We are giving up some &#163;40,000 in revenue in order to foster an industry which provides employment for 600 persons. Therefore, each employee receives a subsidy from the Treasury of &#163;66 a year. I admit that that is a relatively moderate sum as compared with what we pay to those who work in the galvanized iron industry, but where, I ask, is this sort of thing going to end? Are we to go on building up industry by means of subsidies drawn from the general public, and more especially from the rural population? I differ fundamentally from the Government ou this point: the Government says I .U... we should make in Australia everything that it is possible to make here. </para>

              <para>- Yes, at any price. That is an insane policy. Not only does it impose an excessive penalty on the primary producers, our dependence upon whom we have recently come to recognize more clearly, but every new industry we start under extreme protection tends to penalize the industries already in existence. Surely the proper course is to make a judicious selection of (he industries which are worth while, and have a fair prospect of success, and to concentrate on them. It should be made possible for those selected industries to obtain their raw materials and other necessary articles at the cheapest possible price in the world&#39;s markets. That is the only intelligent form of protection, and the only one which will succeed. It is not in the multiplicity of secondary industries that our salvation will lie, but in the proper encouragement of selected industries. If we follow the policy I have suggested, we shall soon find that costs of production haT,e been brought down to export level, and then there is no end to the possible expansion of industry, and the number of persons for whom it can provide employment. The Minister&#39;s idea, however, is to set up in Australia thousands of little, tin-pot industries, each adversely affecting the rest, and adding to the general cost of industry, including that of those industries which are really worth while&#62; </para>

          <para>I confess that I became lost when I endeavoured to follow the Minister&#39;s reasons for the abolition of preference to British goods in connexion with this item. One moment he threw out a suggestion of fraud against the British manufacturers; he suggested that they had been defrauding the Customs Department. When routed out of that position, he said that there were great administrative difficulties in the way of giving preferences. As a matter of fact, no frauds have been perpetrated for over twenty years, and the Customs Department has been administering the preference provision in a quite satisfactory manner. The Minister went on to say that, in any case, the amount of preference was only nominal, and was really worth nothing to the British exporters. According to his own figures, the preference provision applies to 200,000 lb. of cigarette tobacco out of 800,000 lb. imported. </para>

              <para>- I propose to take the Minister&#39;s statement that 200,000 lb. of cigarette tobacco qualified for the preference of 6d. per lb. That was worth &#163;5,000 to the British manufacturers, and amounts to 1 per cent, on &#163;500,000. That is a big contribution to the returns of any British company, and is certainly worth while. Then, in regard to cigars, the Minister said that the preference was worth about &#163;1,600 a year to the British manufacturers. </para>

              <para>- It is the difference between the import duties imposed on goods coming into the country, and the excise duty imposed upon the same class of goods manufactured in Australia. I deplore this wilful destruction of British preference. There seems no doubt that in the present case the action is wilful. In many other instances this destruction has come about automatically by the simple process of raising the tariff wall to a prohibitive level. When that happens in regard to British goods it does not benefit the British manufactures that foreigners are placed outside an even higher wall. The Minister has given no satisfactory reason for the withdrawal of British preference. I am not satisfied with the statement that his action is due to the difficulty of administering preferences. That is a matter for the department, and we know that the department has administered the provision successfully for years. </para>

              <para>- These amending schedules the Government has shown itself to be at war with the principle of British preference. It has given evidence of an anti-British spirit. That is especially deplorable at this time, when our dependence on Britain is so great, when her goodwill is so valuable to us, and when we are practically reduced to the position of suppliants, as in the matter of our war indebtedness, the Government must needs seize the opportunity of wantonly destroying the small measure of preference that Britain has up to now enjoyed. There is no justification for such action. The loss of pro tection to the Australian cigar-makers by the restitution of this preference would be merely nominal. I can ascribe this action only to the opposition of the Minister and the Government to the principle of British preference; it cannot be justified on business grounds. </para>

          <para class="block">About 100 items are before that body for consideration and report. As part of the policy of the Government to rectify Australia&#39;s adverse trade balance, the importation of biscuits into this country is now prohibited. Excellent biscuits are manufactured in Australia, and the latest figures disclose that our annual production is now valued at &#163;2,777,912. Australia&#39;s biscuit exports for 1928-29 amounted to &#163;141,000, and in 1929-30. to &#163;116,532. It will be seen that the bulk of our requirements is produced locally. In addition, we are exporting about four times as much as we import. Our importations for 1929-30 amounted to 527,540 lb., the value being &#163;37,000. That is a good sign, as Australia has very few exporting industries at. the moment&#39;. The increased revenue derived from the manufacture of biscuits here provides an additional market for our flour, sugar, and the other ingredients of biscuits, also for desiccated coco-nut, which is drawn from Papua and the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. The present alteration is the first that has been made in the duty on biscuits since 1914- </para>

              <para>- I do not. Inquiries disclosed that the 1928-29 figures for the. Australian output of biscuits do not include the value of biscuits manufactured in the States of Queensland and, Tasmania, an item included in the total in previous years. That accounts for the decreased total. The duty imposed is only a small one. I do not see any reason, why we should import biscuits, but, it is quite probable that the Government will decide to lift the embargo in the comparatively near future. </para>

            <para>. - The Minister intimated that the existing embargo on the importation of biscuits may be lifted in the near future. Surely that does not justify an increase of 100 per cent, in the duty on biscuits. Of coarse, it is quite possible that this Labour Government considers that a biscuit is a luxury, and should be taxed as such; that it has no right to find a place on the table of the worker. At the present time flour is very cheap, and we have in &#34; Australia biscuit manufacturers who have been operating in Victoria and New South Wales for between 40 and 50 years. I do not believe that either Swallow &#38; Ariell or Arnotts would make a request for an increase in this duty. Tariff-making appears to be merely guess work on the part of the Government. Evidently the Minister says, haphazardly, &#34; I will double this duty and that duty,&#34; irrespective of any economic considerations. Of course, we shall hear the old argument that by having a heavy duty we shall be enabled to produce the commodity on a large scale, I point out that importations have not been very large. The Minister mentioned 527,540 lb. in 1929-30, to the value of &#163;37,375.&#34; We should do nothing that will permit firms to form into a combine and exploit the community. Surely that will be the effect of this extra duty. It merely destroys competition. The manufacturer will fix the price at which the grocer will buy biscui ts, and in turn the secretary of the Retail Traders Association will fix the price which the consumer will pay. </para>

              <para>- It always did so, without the aid of an onerous duty. Only recently manufacturers in New South Wales confided to me that the only result of the imposition of these heavy duties is an inducement to overseas combines to establish factories in Australia and crush our own people out of existence. I contend that there is no justification for the committee to approve of this duty merely on the Minister&#39;s casual assertion that the embargo may be lifted in the near future. </para>

Parliament is asked to consider what is the proper duty to fix on this it-em in conformity with ordinary trade practice. Representations made to me are that the duty which previously obtained was inadequate to protect any but the bloated monopolies of the eastern States. It certainly was insufficient to protect the factories in Western Australia. It should be a source of satisfaction to those who desire to see Australia a well-balanced country to know that Western Australia now produces a much larger proportion of its secondary requirements than was ever the case previously. That is quite a desirable state of affairs. It has been pointed out to me that in the three years, 1927-8-9, the Western Australian importations of overseas biscuits were as follows : - </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="129331193105144_35_4.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para class="block">And that despite the fact that local manufacturers were extending their businesses. There are already two carrying on in a substantial way in Western Australia, and three others on a smaller scale. It was found possible to import overseas biscuits into Western Australia in increasing quantities, because of the general deflation in prices in overseas markets. The representations made to me are to the effect that, owing to the control over flour supplies in Australia, by reason of a millers&#39; agreement, manufacturers who rely upon local flour to produce their biscuits are compelled to pay a much higher price for it than are biscuit manufacturers in England. One well-known biscuit manufacturer in Western Australia authorizes me to say that it is common knowledge that the Australian millers keep their price for locallyconsumed flour much higher than they do the price for exported flour. This, we are given to understand, is to recoup them for the loss on flour consigned overseas. It is a well-known fact that flour has been, and is at present, being shipped overseas at a loss to the millers. Biscuit-makers also have to take into consideration the consequences to their businesses of the policy of this country in respect of sugar,  which is an important constituent of biscuits. So long as this Parliament agrees to the special position which the sugar industry occupies in relation to other industries of the Commonwealth, we must have some regard for those industries which use sugar as a raw material. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member is a high protectionist in respect of sugar, but a free trader in respect of biscuits. On the 14th February, 1930, the price of sugar in England was &#163;22 a ton duty paid, but the Australian manufacturing consumer had to pay &#163;37 a ton. As a matter for fact, the British exporting manufacturer gets his sugar at approximately &#163;18 a ton, because . the duty is refunded in respect of all biscuits exported. Butter is another important ingredient of biscuits, and again the English manufacturer can buy Australian butter cheaper than his competitor in this country can. All these facts tell in favour of an increase of the duty on biscuits rather than a decrease. Mar.gerine is quoted in England at &#163;56 a ton&#39;, or about 6d. per lb., while the price paid by the Australian manufacturer is  7&#190;d.  A substantial duty is imposed on paper for wrapping and labels. Another factor to be taken into account are the relative costs of dried fruits here and abroad. The London price of sultanas is &#163;37 9s. lOd. a ton, or 4.001d. per lb., as against 7-|d. per lb. in Perth. Currants in London are sold at &#163;38 ls. 7d. a ton, or 4.08d. per lb. a.&#171; against 6$d. in Perth, and lexias for &#163;23 in London or 2.46d. as against 6d. in Perth. The Australian manufacturer should use local materials, and should be prepared to pay higher prices for locally-grown currants, lexias, sultanas, and even for butter, flour, and sugar. But while he has to bear those: higher costs, it is the duty of this Parliament, which desires to encourage the local consumption of Australian products, to be logical in its fiscal policy, and protect the manufacturer equally with theprimary producer. </para>

              <para>- That point may beconsidered in conjunction with the inquiry of the honorable member for Swan(Mr. Gregory) - &#34;Are biscuits to be a luxury?&#34; I reply with another question &#34; Is employment to be a luxury?&#34; If we wipe out the whole of the duties that protect Australian biscuit manufacturers, what will  become of the employment which this industry provides, and of the local market for those Australian primary products  which  are the raw material of biscuit production? The whole of Australia&#39;s butter cannot be sold outside the Commonwealth, and to the extent of the unemployment in our midst the local market for butter, as well as for dried fruits, sugar, and flour is thereby reduced. The Government&#39;s policy is the logical corollary to the steps taken by it and previous governments to assist Australian industries generally. This industry in Western Australia employs a large number of young men and women. The problem of unemployment will never be solved by making Australia a sheep walk or a cattle run. These secondary industries are becoming increasingly important in Western Australia, not only providing new avenues of employment, but also protecting that State from the dumping of the surplus manufactures of other countries, and, even, other States. If Australia is to be well balanced industrially and economically, it is of the highest importance that there shall be secondary industries on the western coast of the continent as well as on the eastern and southern coasts. </para>

            <para>. - All champions of protective duties say that it is essential that industries shall in their infancy have the shelter of a high tariff wall, which can be removed when they have become established. But I see no indication in this schedule of any duty being removed or even reduced. On the contrary, the tendency is constantly to ask for increased duties. Apparently, Australian secondary production never grows out of its swaddling clothes. The only classes with whose welfare some honorable members are concerned are the manufacturers and their employees. The third great party, the consuming public, is never considered, and the Labour party is clearly indifferent to the prices charged to the toiling masses in the industrial areas for the necessaries of life. If there is one commodity that does not require high protection it is biscuits. Arnott and Company, with their factory in New South Wales, built up almost a monopoly in Australia under a freetrade policy in pre-federation days. </para>

              <para>- It is  correct.  The honorable member is antediluvian and does not know what has happened in recent years. Under the Reid freetrade administration in New South Wales, Arnott and Company developed a big industry that was able to compete against all coiners in the Australian market, and even sent its products abroad. The honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> claims that heavy duties should be imposed upon biscuits in order to assist some trifling industry in Western Australia, of which I had never previously heard. Later we shall hear the honorable member inveighing against the duties on wire netting and galvanized iron, because they adversely affect the primary producers in his State. I am not in. favour of a policy which penalizes the vast majority of our people for the benefit of a few persons who are baking biscuits in Western Australia. To-day there is no competition amongst biscuit manufacturers. Certain, manufacturers in New South Wales and Victoria have agreed for their mutual benefit that their products shall not be sent over the border between those two States. The duty on biscuits has absolutely destroyed competition, and the manufacturers can charge any prices they choose to fix. Notwithstanding that every ingredient of biscuits is produced in this country, the Government asks for excessive protection. The honorable member for Fremantle referred to the sugar agreement, by which the Government hae committed this Parliament and the next to the most unfair arrangement, having regard to existing economic conditions, that was ever agreed to by any government. The honorable member makes no protest against that agreement, yet has the affrontery  to use it as an argument for increased duties on biscuits. Because a great wrong has been inflicted on our people in respect of sugar, he contends that they should be further penalized in respect of biscuits, of which sugar is a minor ingredient. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ARCHDALE</inline>PARKHILL.That does not justify its continuation. If the Bruce-Page Government made a mistake, there is no occasion for the present Government to perpetuate it. The sugar agreement is an obvious imposition on the people. The same remark applies to the causes responsible of the cost of the butter and other ingredients contained in biscuits. After all, the quantity of biscuits imported into this country is not considerable. Last year we imported some &#163;36,000 worth of biscuits. If a lower rate of duty were imposed, the biscuit manufacturers here could still supply the local market. The imports consist mostly of Peak Freans&#39;  biscuits and fancy biscuits made in France, a friendly nation that buys our wool and other commodities and does not interfere to any substantial extent with Australian production. If the local manufacturer had to compete with overseas manufacturers there would be some incentive for him further to improve the excellent  quality of his biscuits. When we were importing a limited quantity of biscuits, our revenue benefited. The balance of trade has been remedied, a.nd the Government or the Minister may, when they feel inclined, lift the embargoes on various articles without Parliament being consulted. That is one of the methods under which the tariff is controlled, and I strongly protest against it. Even under a reduced tariff the biscuit manufacturers would be able to obtain full control of the Australian market, and at the same time there would be that element of competition that should prevail in respect of all our industries. When we increase duties on an article to such an extent that there is no competition, we are doing harm to the manufacturers and the people of this country, and we are building up a combine or monopoly which later we shall be doing our utmost  to smash. Before many years pass there will be as big a howl from the Labour party against combines and monopolies which, have been built up under this protective tariff as there is to-day from that same party in favour of these proposals. I know of no greater engine for the establishment of monopolies than this unreasonable and inequitable tariff. There &#39; is no justification for an increased duty on biscuits. </para>

Then he said that if the duty were reduced, the manufacturers would still be able to supply local requirements. </para>

            <para>.- The high duty which has been placed upon imported biscuits indicates once again the inconsistency of this Government. It has refused definitely to grant assistance to the wheat-growers, by means of a sales tax on flour. The duty which is imposed on a pound, of biscuits is equal to the value of 8 lb. of wheat, and seven-eighths of the ingredients in that pound of biscuits represents flour. It seems to me that there is a screw loose somewhere in respect of the processing of the food, of the people. Why should there be such a great difference between the price of the raw material and that of the finished article? I agree with, the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> in respect of the efficiency of the biscuit factory in Western Australia. That factory produces one of the finest biscuits made in this country. If we were to examine the tariff in conjunction with the conditions of industry, we should probably solve many of the problems that have placed us in the slough of despond today. Biscuits are a portion of the food of the people, and the duty on them should not be more than the price of the ingredients. If the duties were reduced, the cost of living would fall. No country can be considered to be in a sound position unless it produces plentifully, and its people live cheaply. All the necessaries of life, such as wheat, bread, biscuits, wool, and clothing - the things we wear, the things we use, and the  houses Ave live in - should be available to the community at reasonable prices, otherwise, r,he whole fabric of the nation inevitably will be destroyed; industries will languish and hundreds of thousands of people will be unemployed. This one item relating to. biscuits shows the trend of this country to a ruinous condition. </para>

            <para>. It appears to me that this duty applies only to the more expensive biscuit, which, of course, is- not made locally, and that the intention of the Government is not so much to protect the local industry which, according to honorable members, is able to carry on and to develop under a lower tariff, as to provide Australian requirements. It has been stated that 98.2 per cent, of the biscuits consumed in Australia are manufactured locally, and if that is so, it seems to me that the Government is practically bringing imported biscuits within the category of the tariff prohibition which was introduced by the Government in the early stages of its administration. The honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> has said that the cost of living is involved in these tariff proposals, but I feel certain that the Boards of Trade and other bodies which deal with cost of living figures do not take this class of biscuit into consideration, which, after all, is only purchased by those with large incomes. If consideration is given to any class of biscuit at all, it is given to that made by the local manufacturer, and if he is able to run his business successfully irrespective of the tariff, that is clear evidence that the cost of living has little or no relation to this particular item. </para>

          <para>The competition aspect of this subject is not worth considering, for the commercial interests are now organized to such an extent that they can control prices and regulate supplies in a manner that enables them to over-ride all tariff boundaries. The honorable member for Warringah disproved his own argument when he said that only &#163;36,000 worth of the more expensive biscuits were entering Australia annually and that they never affected the local market at any time. </para>

            <para>. - I am happy, at last, to find myself in agreement with the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> I am also glad to know that the manufacture of biscuits has been undertaken in Western Australia. For a long while the absence of manufacturing industries in Western Australia was somewhat of a menace to the welfare of the secondary industries in other parts of Australia. Even the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> made as usual an eloquent speech on this subject, and I compliment him on having concluded it without giving the sugar industry the customary final kick. After all, this additional duty will affect only a very small quantity of biscuits. All the raw materials required for biscuit-making are produced in Australia, and we should make it possible for the local manufacturers to retain the Australian market. Every other country in the world, with the possible exception of Great Britain, does its best to keep its home market for its own people. Great Britain does not produce all the ingredients required in many of its manufactures. I have pleasure in supporting this item, and I trust that other honorable members who support it will be consistent when the sugar and similar industries are under discussion. </para>

            <para>.- This is one of the most extraordinary &#39;of the new duties, and that is saying a great deal. The Minister is labouring under a complete misapprehension in regard to the biscuit business. In 1928-29 biscuits to the value of &#163;2,777,000 were manufactured in Australia. Our total imports in that year were valued at only &#163;39,000. But let me remind honorable members that, even with a duty of  1&#189;d.  per lb., our manufacturers were able not only to control the local market, but to export biscuits to the value of &#163;141,000. In these circumstances, I contend that this increase in duty is an amazing and an outrageous abuse of the principle of tariff protection. It is an attempt to exploit the consumers, and particularly the workers, who are great biscuit-eaters. Who will be protected by this additional duty? The manufacturer does not need extra protection, nor does- the employee, for under existing conditions a considerable export trade is being done. </para>

              <para>- Of what use will it be to vote against it? This increase of duty is a direct invitation to the Australian manufacturers to advance their prices or reduce the quality of their biscuits. It is an incentive to dishonesty, and an incitement to exploit the public, or else it is a suggestion to the  workers  in the biscuit-manufacturing industry to make an application for higher wages, shorter hours, or some extravagant labour conditions. Surely the ideal of the biscuit manufacturers, as well as of those engaged in other secondary industries, is to build up an export trade; but an increase in this duty must kill the export trade which we already enjoy. If we can extend our export trade we can increase our employment. This is particularly true of this industry for which we have all the raw materials of a quality equal to anything in the world. We are producing some of the best biscuits in the world, and there is no need to increase the duty. I appeal to the Minister to display some common sense and to show a little consideration for the consumers of Australia. If this duty is agreed to it will be possible for the biscuit manufacturers to advance their prices by Id. a lb. </para>

            <para>.- I oppose the imposition of this additional duty. There is no need whatever for it. It has been pointed out that the local manufacturers already control 98 per cent, of the home market. Although &#163;39,000 worth of biscuits entered Australia last year we exported &#163;141,000 worth. At present it is impossible for any biscuits to be imported, for biscuits come under the prohibition ban of the Government. </para>

          <para>As the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. D. Cameron)</inline> has pointed out, certain kinds of biscuits should be allowed to come into Australia. I refer to biscuits manufactured by Callard &#38; Com- ?any, and certain lines manufactured by ,-n 1. Frean and Company in which there is neither starch nor sugar. Such biscuits are frequently prescribed by medical practitioners for persons suffering from diabetes and similar diseases. If this duty is agreed to, a reduction of revenue must follow. It should not be overlooked that a certain amount of competition in business is highly desirable. Competition is the soul of business and of manufacture. It is the only means by which we can keep our manufacturers up to the mark and ensure that they will conduct their operations on up-to-date lines. If the Minister insists on the imposition of this additional duty, competition will be stifled and our biscuit manufacturing industry will be in grave danger of deterioration. The only reason advanced in support of this additional duty was that given by the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> who said that biscuit manufacturing was a new industry in Western Australia, and that it was desirable to foster it, because it used raw material produced in the State. </para>

              <para>- Well, there is more nutriment in bread than in biscuits. Biscuits are a luxury. I know that large sums of money have been invested in this industry, but that is no reason why we should increase the duty by 100 per cent. If this is done it will react on the cost of living, and so place an extra burden upon the consumers. If we grant additional protection on every line simply to provide employment for a comparatively few more people, we shall seriously increase the cost of living. We should judge each case on its merits. As I have pointed out, 98 per cent, of the biscuits consumed here are of Australian manufacture, and I see no reason why the duty should be increased. </para>

            <para>.- The biscuit industry absorbs large quantities of our primary products, and, if well conducted, it can give employment to large numbers. For these reasons it is an industry entitled to adequate protection, but I must confess that I am surprised at the proposal to double the protection which, as the Minister has pointed out, has not been increased since 1914. What is the attitude of the department towards the importation of the biscuits to which the honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bayley)</inline> has referred? Certain biscuits cannot be made in Australia, and I hope that there will never be a sufficient demand for them in Australia to justify their manufacture here, because they are ordered by medical men for persons suffering from certain disabilities. I have in mind Callard&#39;s Kallari biscuits, which are entirely devoid of sugar or starch. I understand that at present they cannot be imported under any circumstances. There are other biscuits of a similar nature, the use of which is prescribed by doctors for persons suffering from diabetes and other complaints. I think that such biscuits should be admitted free of duty. The Minister has not shown that a request has been made for the great increase in the import duty. I gather, from what he has said, that the Tariff Board has not been asked to report on the matter, and has made no recommendations regarding it. The Minister has pointed out that biscuits are included among the items that are prohibited. How long that prohibition will continue, none ofus can say. We were definitely assured that the prohibition was a temporary measure, for the purpose of assisting in correcting the adverse trade balance. No matter what government is in power, if it allows a prohibition to continue for a considerable period, it will have great difficulty in removing it. In view of the figures quoted by the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> and others, the local biscuit industry can carry on under the old rate of protection. It is certainly entitled to protection, but, since it has not asked that the old rate be doubled, we should not be called upon to grant the increase in the duty without an assurance that the Tariff Board has recommended it. I have always maintained that the only fair and scientific way of dealing with applications for protection, or for increases in duties, is first to submit the requests to an independent body of experts, such as the Tariff Board. </para>

            <para>. -  This item should not be passed until the Minister has replied to the criticism levelled against it. The committee is entitled to know why this duty has been imposed in the absence of a recommendation by the Tariff Board. The duty has been shown to be entirely unnecessary, and no reputable firm has asked for it. The Minister should also answer the criticism of the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. D. Cameron),</inline> and say why, under the system of protection, medicinal biscuits are entirely prohibited. It is a gross reflection on the department and on the Minister if there is not some provision for the admittance of such biscuits. What justification is there for doubling the duty, in view of the figures submitted by the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> who has shown that the local manufacturers have full control of the Australian market ? </para>

            <para>.- This impost represents an ad valorem duty of only 16&#189; per cent., butone might imagine that it was 500 per cent., judging by the remarks of honorable members opposite. The honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bayley)</inline> spoke of Callard&#39;s biscuits. As a matter of fact, these are included in a list of invalid and infant foods&#34; which may be admitted free under item 55. Included among the articles mentioned are - Bemax, Benger&#39;s food, Bovo-Lactin, Callard&#39;s casoid biscuits, Callard&#39;s vitmar, Carnrick&#39;s soluble food, Fairchild&#39;s and Foster&#39;s panopepton, Herogen, Hewlett&#39;s malted food, Kellogg&#39;s malted nuts, Robeleine, Virol and Neave&#39;s food. Diabetes biscuits are now made in Melbourne, while a suitable substitute for Peak Frean&#39;s biscuits is also obtainable in Australia. There is no justification for the importation of any biscuits from overseas. The local manufacturers can supply the whole of our requirements, and, in doing so, they use Australian flour, and provide a local market for our primary producers. </para>

              <para>- The Minister will say anything. The local manufacturers already have a complete monopoly of the market. No inquiry into the matter has been madeby the Tariff Board, and the Minister has not mentioned a single firm of importancethat has asked for the increase. The circumstances under which the tariffgenerally has been framed become more mysterious as this debate proceeds. The Minister made a remarkable calculation. He said that the duty of 3d. per lb. was equivalent to an advalorem duty of only 16&#189; per cent. But that would make the retail price of biscuits1s.9d.per lb. The Minister should not treat us as though we were illiterate children. </para>

          <para>Mr.MAXWELL.-That has been my experience up to date. The Minister tables a duty, and gives no reason why it should he passed. The speeches of the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> and the honorable member for Fremantle (Mr.Curtin) are rather illuminating. It seems to me that the honorable member for Wide Bay justifies his support of this increase by saying, practically, &#34; You put an embargo on my sugar and I will vote for the dutyon your biscuits&#34;. Themanufacturers in Victoria, and in the other States, have been perfectly satisfied with the duty that has obtained in the past. They have built  up a  splendidindustry  under the  old rate, butan effortis being made to establish the industry in Western Australia, and, because it is claimed that  an  increase  in  the duty is required to establish oneor two factories in that State, the honorable member for Fremantle claims that allthe people of Australia must submit to an increase in the duty. What is required is a general relaxation of duties. </para>
          <para>No recommendation on this matter has come from the Tariff Board. The Minister said that certain tariff experts believe that the dutyought to be doubled, and that is the only reason advanced by him in favour of the increase. I, for one, am not satisfied with that argument. </para>

We should then be able to arrive at the truth&#34;. But these vague general statements go for what they are worth, and that is very little. I content myself with entering an emphatic protest against this increase of duty. No reason has been given for it, but presumably it will be agreed to by the House, because the Government has its majority and is determined that its proposals shall stand. </para>

It is evident that the Minister knows very little about his job. He has been badly duped on more than one occasion. In the  past  he has made himself a laughing stock by speaking in this House of the thousands, and even hundreds of thousands, of persons who would be employed as a result of increased tariff protection. As a matter of fact, the tariff has failed in every respect to do what was claimed for it. This afternoon the Prime Minister assured me that the tariff was not tobe made a party matter. I shall test the accuracy of that statement by moving - </para>

            <para>. - I do not know why the Minister has chosen to adopt a disingenuous attitude towards this subject. It seems to me that much time might have been saved if he had refused to fence with the whimsicalities of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> ; if he had turned a deaf earto the bolshevistic brigandage of the group below the corner, and had declined to be intrigued by the legalisms of the honorable member forFawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell).</inline> This increase will not benefit the primary producers nor the manufacturers to any appreciable extent. I do not think that it will confer any great benefit even upon Western Australia. If the increase can be justified at all it is on the ground that it is a tax on a luxury. If the Minister had adopted that argument, he could have made out a very good case; but he was at fault when he contended that the duty would help the sugar-growers, the primary producers and the biscuit manufacturers. </para>

            <para>.- I desire to draw attention to the inconsistency of the Minister in imposing this anomalous duty. Imposed purely for revenue purposes, it means an increase of 1d. per lb. on roasted or ground coffee, and substitutes. This article is a household requisite. While I agree that it is reasonable in times like the present to impose a small revenue duty upon coffee, I protest against this excessive increase. In passing I wish to contrast the position in this case with that in regard to cigars. If any luxury comes into a country surely cigars con-  stitute one. Yet from that item the excise duty has been removed. </para>

            <para>It was strongly opposed to any increase in the tariff on the manufactured article, because it contended that the tariff on raw materials used in the industry should be reduced. With the exception of cocoa beans, all the raw materials used were dutiable.  . . Obviously, then, no request was made by the confectionery manufacturers prior to the tabling of the November, 1929, schedule for an increased duty of confectionery, and the manufacturers should be the best judges of whether the former duties were adequate. The natural protection afforded by freight, insurance, and landing charges, excluding exchange, amounts to about 15 per cent. of the value of the goods. The primage duty gives a further 4 per cent. The former duty of 35 per cent. was equivalent to38&#189; per cent., as 10 per cent. is added to the price before duty is computed. Thus the total protection enjoyed by the industry, without adding exchange, and including duty at the old rate, would amount to 57&#189; per cent. The value of the output of Australian confectionery manufacturers in 1928-29 was over &#163;7,000,000, and in the same period the total imports amounted to only &#163;137,524. Thus the local manufacturers had 98.2 per cent. of the business. Surely, in face of these figures, it is obvious that the proposed additional 10 per cent. is entirely unnecessary. </para>

          <para>The following extract from a statement presented by a deputation of Australian confectionery manufacturers to the Minister for Trade and Customs in April, 1930, indicates the real view of the manufacturers on the subject of a duty. It is quoted from the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Confectioners&#39; Journal</inline> of May, 1930, and reads - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Of the comparatively small proportion of confectionery imported, a great deal consists of specialties, hand-made lines, &#38;c., for which there is obviously a very limited demand, but such would probably still exist even if the duty were raised to 100 per cent. on such lines. It should be perfectly clear, in view of the facts set out, that with the imposition of a duty high enough to actually prevent the importation of an amount of confectionery well under 1 per cent. of the total requirements of Australia, cannot have any appreciable good effect, either in relieving unemployment in a confectionery industry, or in bringing into operation and useful productivity, confectionery plant which is now lying idle, or, at any rate, not fully occupied in many of our factories. </para>

This subject was submitted to that body for inquiry and report. Evidence was taken, and, in all probability, the report, if not actually completed, is in course of preparation. The Minister cannot expect honorable members to discuss intelligently this item in the absence of the Tariff Board&#39;s report dealing with it. I therefore appeal to him to agree to its postponement. The Government has no right to expect the committee to pass it without the information which must be contained in the Tariff Board&#39;s report. </para>

            <para>.- This is even a worse case than the item dealing with biscuits. I invited the Minister to name one biscuit manufacturer who had asked for the increases in duty, and I now challenge him to name one manufacturer of confectionery who is not opposed to the increases in this item. If the duties were not imposed in the interest of the manufacturers, they must have been imposed in the interests of the employees. Some time ago the Minister addressed a number of circular letters to the manufacturers concerned, asking for particulars of their output and the number of employees engaged prior to the imposition of the duties and subsequently. I know that replies have been received from one or two big confectionery manufacturers, and I now challenge the Minister to place them on the table. </para>

              <para>- Apparently the Minister is also too busy even to read the Tariff Board&#39;s reports. The honorable member for Moreton (Mr.Francis) has pointed out that the value of the output in confectionery in Australia is approximately &#163;7,000,000 per annum, and that our total imports for 1928-29 amounted to &#163;137,000. In that year, however, our exports totalled &#163;.90,000. Here then we have an. industry which is being progressively successful, is noted for the quality of its products, and has established an export trade. This increase of 10 per cent. in the duties is a direct invitation to the employees in the industry to demand better working conditions, higher wages and shorter hours. If wages are increased we shall have to say goodbye to our export trade in confectionery. The Minister stated also that it is a revenue duty. The honorable member for Warringah answered that contention by stating that there is an embargo on the importations, and the Australian manufacturers had 98 per cent. of the trade, so the duties cannot be revenueproducing.We understand that they have been imposed to offset other duties upon certain raw materials. The effect of those duties was to increase the cost of production, resulting in an increase in selling prices, and a reduction of turnover, and the laying off of hands. There is the clearest evidence that these duties are ill-considered, and will cause one of our most promising industries to contribute heavily to increased unemployment. </para>

            <para>. - The arguments adduced against the increased duties on biscuits can be advanced with even greater force against this item. We have just been told that no manufacturers of confectionery asked for these increased duties, but that, on the contrary, they have urged that they should be taken off. In the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 23rd November, 1929, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> Dutton, a director of MacRobertsons and.  president  of the Victorian Manufacturing Confectioners, was reported as saying &#34; the association would use its influence to obtain the rejection of the increased duties when the schedule. was being discussed in Parliament.&#34; The Minister has addressed letters to manufacturers and others, asking what amount of additional trade they had done since the increased duties had been imposed, and how many additional employees had been engaged. He did this to justify the statement which he had been making from time to time that increased duties fixed by this Government had resulted in the. employment of approximately 50,000 additional men. At a later stage he said that if 50,000 new jobs had not been provided they should have been; still later he further modified his original claim by saying that the new duties had at least prevented the dismissal  of  a  large  number  of men. He might as  well have said that the manufacture of pins had saved the lives of many people because they had not swallowed them. I challenge the Minister to produce the replies of the confectionery manufacturers to his inquiries. If he does, those replies will show that the manufacturers declared that their output has been less, and they have employed fewer hands since the new duties were imposed. </para>

              <para>- The Minister has it, and I ask him to do so. In 1928-1929 the Australian output of confectionery was valued at &#163;7,000,000, and the imports at only &#163;137,000. Thus under the old duties Australian manufacturers supplied 98.2 per cent. of the market. In view of that fact, if honorable members were able to consider this item on its merits, and free from party prejudice, they would&#39; not find the slightest justification for voting for the proposed duty. The 1.8 per cent. of the business whichwas being clone by the importers the manufacturer does not want, and makes no effort to get. It is fair to say, therefore, that under the old duty the Australian manufacturer had an absolute monopoly of the market. I am willing to assist any Australian industry, but not to vote for additional protection for an industry which already controls the market, especially when the local manufacturers are doing their utmost to have the lower duties restored. We can, by means of the tariff, build up for the employees high wages and extravagant conditions, but by so doing we kill the export trade. The manufacturers with a monopoly of the Australian market can charge what prices they choose, and pay almost any wages. I have no objection to a man earning as much as he can, but the workers who are not engaged in the sheltered and pampered industries have to pay for the extravagant conditions enjoyed by their more favored fellows. That reacts detrimentally on the employment market, and compels thepoor and needy to pay excessive prices for the necessaries of life. There is not the slightest justification for the increased duty on confectionery. </para>

            <para>.- This item covers a number of primary products. I do not intend to oppose it.  I  regret, however, that in the interests of the primary producer tariff-making has become such a general practice as a form of compensation to offset the results of tariff-making in favour of secondary industries. I should infinitely prefer that the primary producers should take a more determined stand against the excessive duties that are designed to assist secondary industries. The most unfortunate aspect of tariff-making within recent years has been this diminution of opposition on the part of the primary producers to excessive duties, and their acceptance of compensation in the form of excessive duties for their own products if such can be obtained. If the circle could he completed, and if Australia were entirely selfcontained, it might be possible for an allround benefit to be conferred. I doubt whether it would ; but certainly some sections would not then be heavily penalized and others substantially benefited. Try as we may to compensate primary producers, our efforts must prove fruitless. The experience of the last season or two of the two big industries upon which we absolutely depend has clearly shown that this system of compensation is a complete failure; because there is not sufficient money in the country to load up the price of wool and to increase artificially the price of wheat. It is not my intention to vote against any of the proposed increases that will benefit the primary producers.I believe that the tariff as a whole favours enormously the secondary industries in comparison with the benefits derived from it by the men on the land. It pampers the wage-earners and the people generally in the cities, at the expense of those who live in the country. But so long as the compensation system is continued, I shall see that it is exploited, -wherever that can be done, in favour of the man on the land. I believe, however, that the practice is an absolutely false one, that it is economically rotten, and that it will get us nowhere. I regard the present tariff purely as a temporary measure that is being forced through by sheer weight of numbers. I say quite definitely that if, at any time, it is within my power substantially to revise it from end to end, I shall take great pleasure in doing so. </para>

I ask honorable members to realize that their approval is sought of an increase in duty of 300 per cent., on an item that has twice been referred to the Tariff Board. Reporting in 1926, the Tariff Board definitely opposed any increase in this duty. The matter was again referred to the board, and in a report dated the 27th September, 1929, it re-stated its opposition to any increase in the duty. Yet the Minister has seen fit to increase it by 300 per cent. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The sole ground upon which the application for increased duty was based was that the dried fruits associations of Australia were of the opinion that imported dates competed with the sale of sultanas and lexias. The Tariff Board, reporting in March, 1926, expressed the view that dates did not compete detrimentally with raisins, and recommended that no alteration be made in the duty. In 1927 the board reported that the imposition of an additional duty on dates would restrict the choice of users, by making it more difficult to obtain an article of diet which it believed was purchased for the most part because of the nature and flavour peculiar to it. </para>
          <para>As the bulk of the sales of dates apparently are made in localities in which those with smaller incomes dwell, any additional duty falls most heavily on those who are least able to bear it. The increased duty will not assist the Australian dried fruits industry to any appreciable extent. Other avenues through which that industry can be assisted have apparently been unexplored. The Tariff Board in its report went on to say that no dates are produced in Australia, practically the whole of our requirements being imported from the Levant. When the duty was Id. per lb., a special ship was chartered each year to bring dates from Mesopotamia in one shipment, thus reducing to the minimum the cost of transport. As this duty has increased the cost of date&#167; to the Australian consumer, the demand for them has fallen off. It is nol. now possible to charter ships; accordingly the cost of this fruit to the Australian consumer has been substantially increased. The report of the Tariff Board indicates that as the sale of sultanas and raisins has increased, the sales of imported dates also have risen. The figures are as follow - </para>

          <para class="block">Therefore, the increased imports from Mesopotamia did not prejudicially affect the sales of the dried fruits associations. </para>

            <para>.- The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> does not know much about the dried fruits industry or he would not have spoken as he did. It is true that dates are not grown in Australia, hut those interested in the dried fruits industry maintain that dates, to a large extent, replace raisins, particularly in cakes and puddings. That industry has considerable difficulty iti finding a market for currants and raisins. The 1928-29 season&#39;s production of these goods was over 72,000 tons, the Australian consumption being only about 13,500 tons. The dried fruits industry is in a serious position, and hundreds of growers are being driven off their blocks because they cannot find a market for their products. There is a huge surplus production. The duty is being increased to protect the industry by calling upon the Australian people to buy raisins, currants and other dried fruits in preference to dates, and it is hoped by this means to assist au important  industry that is providing considerable employment to-day: </para>

            <para>.-^1 am not too enthusiastic about an increased duty on dates. There is some justification for increased duties on currants, raisins and other dried fruits, but dates arc not grown in Australia. The duty on dates has been increased from Id. to 3d. per lb. The Minister pointed out that the dried fruits industry is in a serious position, and that this increased duty will be helpful to the growers. If that is the case it is just as well for honorable members to know that the Government is doing something to assist that industry. At the same time it seems to me that the housewives of Australia are being penalized by being forced to buy currants or raisins, although they may particularly wish to make a date pudding. My experience&#39; of the worker&#39;s family is that it consumes from 3 to 4 lb. of dates every month, and I ask the Minister to reconsider this item with a view to reducing the duty. Dates are a food, and popular with children. They are more easily digested than are raisins, currants and other dried fruits. I agree that the duty on raisins, currants and sultanas should be &#39;increased to prevent imported dried fruits from coming into this country. I suggest to the Minister that the duty on dates be reduced by Id. per lb. </para>

            <para>.- I hope that the Minister will not weaken on this item. It is an important item, although not so important as machinery and many other utilities that we import or manufacture in Australia. But it certainly has a direct and powerful influence upon a great industry in this country - the dried fruits industry. There is in the Darling electorate a number of irrigation settlements, such as Curlwaa and Wentworth... The men in those centres are having a bad time. They produce, probably, the best lexias, currants and raisins in the world. They also produce figs, which are onn of the most popular substitutes for dates. In other parts of Australia large quantities of figs are being grown, and gradually we &#39; are supplying our own requirements. The dried fruits industry is properly controlled, particularly in respect, of packing and grading. It is a white man&#39;s industry, and is worked under Australian conditions. Several members in this chamber have had an opportunity of witnessing the harvesting, packing and marketing of dates and other dried fruits in the Levant, Mesopotamia and other places overseas, and, as a result, they refuse to buy imported dried fruits, particularly from Asia. Dates have an excellent food value and, personally, I am fond of them, although I take care to wash them before eating them. Those who are fond of dates and purchase them, despite the risk of infection,&#39; should be prepared to pay dearly for them. Others who cannot afford them may purchase several excellent substitutes for both cook:ing and table consumption, such as lexias, currants, table raisins, seeded raisins and figs. We are well catered for in respect of those goods. If there is anything that the Minister should remain solid on, it is the imposition of a duty on black-grown foodstuffs which are imported to- take the place of white-grown foodstuffs. </para>

              <para>- If that is the object of the honorable member, it would be interesting to know why he supports the continuance of an embargo upon the importation of foreign sugar, as by so doing he is assisting to increase the cost of living. While I know that there is some difference of opinion as to whether dates effectively compete with currants, raisins, and other dried fruits produced in Australia, the general opinion held among fruit-growers is that they do enter into competition, with their products. From my experience in the grocery trade many years ago, when dates were obtainable at from 2-Jd. to 3&#163;d. a lb., I know that they did effectively compete with Australian dried fruits. I agree with the views expressed by the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> that those engaged in primary . production are seriously affected by the duties imposed upon the products of secondary industries, and that is is only &#39;right that consideration should be given- to them wherever possible. Dates are obtainable in a very, handy form, and are used- not only in cakes and puddings, but in other ways in competition with sultanas and lexias. I remind the advocates of a reduction in the existing duties on Turkish-grown dates that 87 per cent, of the sultanas grown in Australia have now to be exported. When the Federal Parliament met in Melbourne, I frequently enjoyed a luncheon consisting solely of lexias when &#62;walking around the beautiful gardens adjoining Parliament House. I advise honor-&#39; able members who have not used sultanas as a food to do so, as they will find them as palatable, and in every sense, equal to dates, which are very often grown and packed under conditions which would not be tolerated in Australia. In the handling and packing of dried fruits, cleanliness is the first essential; but if all that we hear concerning the handling and packing of dates -in the Levant&#39; and Mesopotamia is correct, cleanliness is the last consideration. In spite of the request, by a representative of a city constituency foi; a decrease in the existing rates, I trust that the Minister will adhere to his decision to assist the primary producers. </para>

            <para>.- Apparently there is no length to which the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> will not go in increasing duties. That is made evident when we are asked to ratify an increase of 3d. a lb. on dates. It has been argued that dates enter into competition with dried fruits grown in Australia. That may bc true to a certain extent, but the trouble which those engaged in the dried fruits industry in Australia have to meet is not from overseas, but is due to the additional cost they have to incur in consequence of the protection given, to secondary industries, and other factors, such as the high price paid for the land upon which fruit is grown. Our irrigation projects have been too expensive, and although practically all the products from such areas cannot be sold in the markets of the world at a reasonable profit, -the Government is not doing anything to improve the existing &#39;state of affairs.  The committee has already disposed of a number of items, on every one of- which the Minister has asked the committee to sanction increased duties, and the- natural result of such action is to add further to the cost of production in this country. The only effective way by which the primary producers can be assisted is by lowering the rates imposed on the products of secondary industries. In the past, high wages have been paid to those engaged in secondary industries, and low rate of wages to the men on the land. Honorable members who are supposed to represent the primary producers - the members of the Country party - have complained bitterly concerning the high prices which primary producers are compelled to pay in order to conduct their activities. In order to meet such objections,  the  Minister is advocating this method of assistance. These increased duties are submitted in order to placate those who sit on the corner benches, and the people whom they represent.. I agree with the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. C. Riley)</inline> that, although our dried fruits are of excellent quality, they cannot be used as a substitute for dates, which are highly nutritious. If the only way in which the Government can assist those engaged in the dried fruits industry is by placing an increased duty on dates, I suggest, that it is bereft of ideas. I appeal to the .committee to oppose this duty, and to compel the Government to submit some other method by which the man on the land can be assisted. </para>

            <para>. - I entirely disapprove of this duty on dates. I am sympathetic with the primary producers, because I  realize  that they have to sell their products in open competition in the world&#39;s markets; but I do not believe in the adoption of fictitious methods of helping them. Wc  have  started at the wrong end,  and  sooner  or later Ave  shall  have  to  retrace  our  steps.  Our costs of production  are&#39;  continually mounting, and this  is  obliging the masses of the people to pay  excessive  prices  for  the necessaries of life. The system is unsound. I disapprove of the sugar agreement, and I also consider that the Paterson scheme is faulty. It is also wrong to impose  this  duty on dates, which are a highly nutritious  food.  I do  not  think that  the  saleof currants, lexias  and  raisins is seriously interfered with by the sale of dates. If  dates  are admitted under reasonable con- ditions, the revenue will benefit. I do not join in the wholesale condemnation of the importation of goods from foreign countries. I was interested in the speech of the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. C. Riley).</inline> I know that he is an ardent protectionist, and I was surprised to hear him say that dates should be admitted into this country under reasonable conditions. I rather thought that he would insist on the moiling and toiling . masses in his electorate spending their money on currants and raisins in preference to dates. It has been said that, dates imported from Smyrna, Lebanon, and some other eastern countries are not so clean as they might be. But &#34;what the eye does not see the heart does not grieve over &#34; is a good motto. This is probably just as true in regard to dates as to any other things that we eat without inquiring closely into their preparation. Although there may be special virtues in such locally-&#39;grown foodstuffs as currants and raisins, dates also have strengthreviving qualities. . </para>

          <para>Seeing that I have opposed most of the items under consideration to-day, it is only right that I should speak favorably of such as are acceptable to me. I, therefore, wish to commend the Government for the action it has taken in regard to prunes. . In the past we have imported large quantities of prunes from the United States of America, and this has seriously interfered with the marketing of the prunes grown on our irrigation areas, and in other parts of Australia. Nevertheless,, we are building up a substantial local market for prunes, principally on account of the activities of exsoldiers in our irrigation and other areas. In  1926-27  our production of prunes totalled  112,000  lb. It is estimated that in  1930-31  the production will total  2,464,000  lb,, and that in  1932-33  the yield will be  4,480,000  lb. It will thus be seen that we may be approaching a period of over-production. In  these circumstances  I  appreciate the action of the </para>

            <para>. -  In my opinion, the excessive duty that is being imposed on asparagus tips is unwarranted. Our local producers are unable to supply all our requirements, and in these circumstances, the duty should &#39;be reduced, at least to some extent. If a reduction were agreed to, the revenue would be increased and no injury would be done to anybody. Some of the asparagus grown in the Macquarie electorate is probably equal to the best Californian asparagus. On the other hand, some very poor asparagus is grown in other parts of Australia. If these excessive duties are retained, people will be forced to eat the inferior product. If the Minister has any regard for an. evenlybalanced, scientific tariff, he will see that the duty on asparagus is reduced, </para>

            <para>. -  The Government claims to have the interests of the primary producers at heart, and therefore I urge it to re-consider the claim of the ginger industry for some of the protection which is so freely given to secondary industries, many of which have- received more protection than those controlling them ever expected. There is room for a considerable development&#39; of the ginger industry in Australia, thus providing employment for our own people, but, unfortunately, lack of adequate protection has prevented development. At my request, the question of increasing the duty on imported ginger was submitted to the Tariff Board, which reported&#39; unfavorably after manufacturers had presented their evidence against the claims of the growers. Some of the board&#39;s recommendations as well as some of the evidence given before it will not bear examination. Australia&#39;s consumption of ginger amounts to  2,266,975  lb. per annum, of which practically  2,000,000  lb. comes from China. The argument that it would cost Australian consumers&#39; more if the duties on ginger were increased, applies  in  the  case of almost, every duty that isimposed against imports from Asia. If duties are not to be increased merely because their imposition would increase the cost of commodities above that of Chinese-grown articles, then the outlook for Australian industries, both primary and secondary, is not encouraging. Yet that is the argument put forward by Australian manufacturers in the case of ginger. The Tariff Board&#39;s report shows that the request of the Australian growers of ginger was opposed by Australian manufacturers - persons whose industries enjoy a generous protection. The growers of ginger in Australia are to be prevented from expanding their industry because of the opposition . of Sydney and Melbourne manufacturers, whose attitude, to say the least, is inconsistent. </para>

              <para>- Its report states that ginger is not grown to any great extent in Australia, although 100 registered growers claim to be able to produce it. As growers cannot sell their present production without protection, what is the use of increasing production? It would take perhaps two years after the growers were assured of protection for Australia to provide its own ginger requirements, but unless adequate protection is provided against the Chinese article, the position will never improve, because, under the present tariff, ginger can be imported from China and sold in Australia at a price with which the Australian growers cannot compete. Surely no honorable member would go so far as to say that Australian-grown ginger must compete with that grown in China ? That is what the Government decision means. </para>

              <para>- I thank the Minister for that. We have not had much sympathy so far. If he will refer the matter back to the Tariff Board, I shall, at least, have gained something. Last year the local growers produced only 60 tons of ginger, of which 20 tons were sold. It is grown at Buderim Mountain, about 60 miles north of Brisbane. The climatic conditions there are ideal. No plant disease affects the plant and no damage is done by frost. The industry is capable of givingemployment to a large number of persons, and it could be extended to enable Australia&#39;s total requirements of 2,250,000 lb. to be met. It is estimated that the next crop will amount to 130 tons, and in the following year, if the Government grants the duty asked for, and the 130tons are used for planting, a production of 400 tons could follow. After that, all the requirements of this country could be supplied by the Australian industry, but protection is essential. </para>

          <para>From my remarks concerning the attitude of Australian manufacturers to this industry, I exclude MacRobertson &#38; Company, who, alone, have shown the greatest sympathy with the Ginger Association at Buderim. This company has purchased the association&#39;s product, processed it and marketed it, and it has given the industry every encouragement by its favorable reports as to quality. MacRobertson&#39;s action stands out in striking contrast to that of other manufacturers, whohave done everything to discourage the industry. </para>

              <para>- Yes; it has given practical assistance by buying Australian ginger, and proving it to be of excellent quality. It has offered to take a large quantity of this article, if it can be sold at a price equivalent to that of imported ginger. This company thus contradicts the statement of those who went before the Tariff Board and said that it was impossible to secure ginger grown in Australia, and of others who stated it was not suitable.Some mem- bers have had an opportunity of testing the quality of Buderim ginger, which I made available from the association. I shall be quite satisfied with the prospects of the industry if the Minister will again bring the case under the notice of the Tariff Board. </para>

            <para>.- I support the request of the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser),</inline> and, as the hour is late, I shall make my remarks as brief as possible. The cultivation of ginger is one of tho few industries in Australia which offers great scope for expansion. There are opportunities in Australia to-day for the marketing of over 1,000 tons of ginger in various forms, and, in a brief period, the whole of the requirements of this country could be met by the local growers. In most industries, the stage at which overproduction occurs is easily reached ; but there is no danger of that in connexion, with the growing of ginger. The high quality of the local article is shown by the fact that MacRobertson&#39;s, of Melbourne, have purchased large quantities of it, and have declared it- to bc equal to any ginger that can be imported. That is excellent testimony from a firm that uses this commodity extensively. At the present time there are only about 100 growers in Australia. The ginger is produced solely on the Buderim Mountain, in the Blackall Range district, about 60 miles north of Brisbane. I knew this district well in my childhood, and it is, undoubtedly, one of the most ideally situated and fertile localities in Queensland, if not in the world. It has passed through many stages of development, from sugargrowing to banana culture and dairying, and now it promises to rival other districts in the production of ginger. It has a splendid rainfall, very fertile soil, is accessible  to markets by fast tramway service, joining the main Brisbane line at Palmwoods. There is a considerable area of land awaiting closer settlement development, and the expansion of this industry should quickly bring this about. I hope that the Minister will give it the encouragement that it deserves, particularly since its chief competition is from China. Assistance could be given by means of a deferred duty, a bounty, or direct tariff protection. I trust that this question will again be referred to the Tariff Board and that it will make recommendations that will give the industry the encouragement and opportunity to develop to which it is entitled. </para>

            <para>. - No increase in the duty on ginger is proposed in the schedule under consideration. I have received a number of deputations concerning this industry, for which I have every sympathy. I believe that, in a few years, Queensland will be producing the whole of Australia&#39;s requirements of ginger. I referred the matter to the Tariff Board, which carried out an investigation, and submitted a report, in the face of which I found it impossible to grant the duties asked for. The board pointed out that about 1,000 tons of ginger was required in Australia annually, and the Queensland growers supplied only about 60 tons. </para>

            <para>. - I cannot understand why the Minister has failed to make some provision for canary seed in connexion with this item. He has imposed so many super duties and embargoes that it seems strange that canary seed should on this occasion have been overlooked. </para>

          <para>.- This morning I asked the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> what expense had been incurred by the Defence Department in staging a military display at the Royal Agricultural Show, Sydney. The Minister&#39;s reply was - </para>

          <para>I understand that  little or no expense to the department was involved. </para>

        <para class="block">I do not know who is responsible for supplying that information to the Minister, or whether, indeed, it was supplied to him, or he made the discovery for himself. In any case, the answer docs not satisfy roe. Expenditure incurred by the military authorities has to be watched very carefully. They are lavish spenders of public money, as has been proved in the past. I am anxious to know just what expense was incurred on this occasion, and I am not prepared to accept a vague statement prefaced by &#34; I understand&#34;. The departmental officers concerned should have this information, and it should be available to the Minister. I ask him to be good enough to obtain the information for which I asked. </para>

          <para>.- It is very difficult to determine exactly the amount of a small expenditure such as that incurred in connexion with the display at the Royal Agricultural Show in Sydney; but I assure the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> that he will never have any difficulty in obtaining from me a courteous reply to his questions. Had he told me during the day that he was not satisfied with the answer I had given Mm, I would have taken steps to obtain the fullest data, so as to be able to inform him of the exact cost, if it were only 2s. I have no desire to burke questions, and I regret that the honorable member has seen fit to manifest some heat over the matter. </para>
