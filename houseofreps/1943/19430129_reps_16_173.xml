              <para>- I have not seen the news item to which the honorable member has referred, but I shall thoroughly investigate the claims contained therein. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> J. Smith was associated with the Department of Munitions as the Director of Gun Ammunition, he advised the introduction of certain labour-saving methods and I believe that he contributed many helpful suggestions for improving factory operations.  His  recommendations were extended to other plants, which were doing the same class of work. For his advice and assistance in that regard I give him full credit; but I am not in a position to say whether as many of those ideas as the report mentioned emanated from him while he was Director of Gun Ammunition. </para>

I should not like to make a hurried decision. I had a discussion concerning the matter only this morning, and it is now in hand.

            <para>- Will the Treasurer institute an inquiry into the principles of pay-as-you-go taxation in order to estimate its probable effect on Commonwealth income tax revenue for the year 3943-44? Will he then consider the application of the pay-as-you-go method from the 1st July next, and its effect upon the rates of income tax as fixed in the legislation which is shortly to be introduced? Will he at the same time give consideration to the changes that have been recently adopted in the United States of America in order to relieve taxpayers of the arrears of tax for one year ? </para>

            <para>- The point raised by the honorable member has received consideration. Most of the advocates of the pay-as-you-go system hold that they should not pay the tax which they already owe; in order words, that they should miss the payment of a year&#39;s taxation. All proposals for the payment of tax on current income have been investigated. </para>

            <para>- It is true that the department which I control is making a complete survey of all bus services throughout Australia. The survey is being conducted by a committee of practical men who understand the industry thoroughly, and one member of the committee is a representative of the Omnibus Proprietors Association. This work, which has been going on for the last six months, is being done in close liaison with the Liquid Fuel Control Board and the Department of Supply and Shipping. The report of the committee has now been presented, and has been considered very carefully by the officers of my department, who are convinced that the curtailments recommended by the committee are necessary in the interests of petrol and tyre economy. </para>

            <para>- The Liquid Fuel Control Board has compelled many owners of motor vehicles to fit producergas units, and their petrol ration has been reduced in consequence. Now, in many country districts of New South Wales and Queensland, and particularly on the north coast of New South Wales, practically no charcoal whatever is available, so that the owners of the converted vehicles can now obtain neither charcoal nor petrol. I ask the Minister for Supply and Shipping whether his department accepts any responsibility for ensuring that adequate supplies of charcoal shall be available, or whether it takes the attitude that this is the responsibility of private enterprise? </para>

            <para>- I should say that the Department of Supply and Shipping must accept some responsibility for maintaining essential services. The supply of charcoal in New South Wales is largely in the hands of a State government department, only small quantities being provided by private enterprise. As a matter of fact, the charcoal supply is much better in New South Wales generally than it is in any of the other States. </para>

            <para>- The proposal has been approved by Cabinet. So far, the allocations of the money are approximate only, and I cannot give the figures offhand, but I shall supply them to the honorable member later. The decision to establish country appraisement centres is in keeping with the Government&#39;s policy of decentralization, and is in conformity with the desire of all genuine wool producers throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. I have received numerous requests for the establishment of country appraisement centres, and the Government&#39;s decision is taken on the direct advice of the Director-General of Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Harold Clapp),</inline> who stated that the establishment of country appraisement centres was essential in order to relieve the strain on transport. In addition, there is at present tremendous congestion in the wool stores in the metropolitan areas. Only recently, I conferred with the  chairman  of the Central Wool Committee, and with the Director of the Allied Works Council in an endeavour to have buildings erected for the purpose of relieving the congestion in the metropolitan areas where no fewer than 57 storage units have been taken over for defence purposes. This congestion, which has been a matter of great concern to the Central Wool Committee, will be relieved by the establishment of appraisement centres in country areas. </para>

            <para>- Some time ago, a complaint was received from officials of the Australian Workers Union regarding the alleged waste of petrol at a northern station, and the complaint was immediately investigated. A reply was sent to those who had made the complaint, and  a  general order was issued that care should be exercised in the use of petrol. Later, another complaint was received, and after  an  investigation was made a reply was sent that no cause for complaint existed. </para>

I  am  referring now to what is alleged to have occurred to-day when a map was published in the newspaper. I cannot say whether any m,a: published, particularly when I have not seen it, is  a  breach of the censorship instructions. I do not know whether n censorship order was issued in respect of this matter, but, if the censor has given a direction which has not been observed, obviously  ia  breach of the law has been committed. I shall &#39;have the facts examined, and if the law has been broken steps should be taken to vindicate it. </para>

            <para>- There has been no direct request to me by the representatives of the wool manufacturers. Wool was sold to them previously at a rate determined by the * &#39;Central Wool Committee. The rate was kept as close as possible to the British purchase contract price. It was found that wool had been allotted to the manufacturers at too low a price, representing a deficit last year of about &#163;26,000. The Central Wool Committee imposed a surcharge of 25 per cent, to cover that deficit, and increased the price to local manufacturers. Cabinet considered the matter and decided that the local manufacturers should get wool at the British purchase price and the Prices Commissioner was instructed to fix the price at that level. </para>

            <para>- The price of pig meats was fixed by the Prices Commissioner as the only authority vested with powers to fix prices. He was actuated in fixing the price by a definite request from the Pig Council, on which pigraisers in every State of the Commonwealth are represented, that the price of pig meats be fixed and that, for a period of upwards of two years, the pig-raisers be guaranteed a return of 8&#163;d. per lb. for first-grade pig meats. The price was fixed at S&#163;d. per lb., with contingencies bringing it up to more than 9d. In view of the repeated requests which, no doubt, have been organized by vested interests, I am seriously considering whether the Government should wipe its hands of the pig industry and allow it to revert to the law of the jungle under which it operated previously. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> leave- Prices fixed by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner for tomatoes delivered to canneries in Victoria were 5s. a case of 48 lb. for canning varieties, and 3s. a case for standard grade. These prices are at least double the prices paid before the war, and the growers have received the protection of Government inspectors as regards the rejections of tomatoes unfit for processing. They are, moreover, guaranteed these prices for the whole of their crop during the period in which in certain areas deliveries of the whole crop are required for the canning programme. The prices, moreover, are prices at growers&#39; gate and should not be compared with the wholesale prices ruling in the metropolitan area. These wholesale prices include agent&#39;s commission, transport and cases. In the fixing of the prices the growers were conferred with and every aspect was thoroughly examined to ensure as far as was humanly possible that no injustice should be done. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>For a short period after the canneries took the whole of the supply from certain areas, prices in the open market reached a high level. This position has now been corrected by the determination of a maximum price for tomatoes in the wholesale market in Melbourne at 10s. a case of 24 lb. The maximum retail price in the metropolitan area is 8d. per lb., and for places in Victoria outside the metropolitan area the maximum retail price is the wholesale price plus the cost of transport, plus the maximum retailers&#39; margin of  2&#190;d.  per lb. This is a maximum price and not a guaranteed price as is the case with prices fixed for canning varieties. In New South Wales where the supplies required for canning are not so great as in Victoria, the open market price has been falling, and this week it is at a level of from 2s. to 5s. a case, with a few cases at 7s. It is essential that the canning programme shall be fulfilled. The crop in Victoria this year is very large, and, if the canning programme were of normal proportions, prices of tomatoes in the open market might well be below the levels now fixed for canning. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for Indi asked me for an absolute guarantee that similar circumstances shall not be permitted to recur in future, burt the House will realize that it is most difficult for the Government to give such an undertaking in wartime. Another consideration is that climatic conditions affect the ripening and marketing of tomatoes. The Government must obtain large supplies of tomatoes because they contain valuable vitamins that are essential to the health of our fighting forces. Naturally, the growers wish to secure the highest prices that they can for their  product.  If the price offering on the metropolitan market is higher than the price fixed for canning purposes, growers will tend to by-pass the canneries and dispose of their product on the metropolitan markets. In making that statement, I do not speak disparagingly of the growers. It is only human nature that they should desire to obtain the best possible returns. However, the Department of Supply and Shipping cannot permit the canneries to he bypassed in this manner when tomatoes are so urgently required for the troops. Compelled by this necessity to obtain supplies, the department took steps in Victoria to prohibit the transport by rail of tomatoes from certain centres in the metropolitan area. Tomatoes from those districts will bc consigned to the canneries. </para>

            <para>- I frankly admit one weakness that arose in connexion with this scheme, and I have no desire to &#34; pass the buck &#34;. When the Department of Supply and Shipping took steps to prevent the despatch of tomatoes by rail from certain districts in Victoria, I specifically requested that a maximum price should be fixed immediately for tomatoes sold on the metropolitan market. I considered that such action was absolutely necessary, because the imposition of the prohibition on the part of my department to restrict the flow of tomatoes to the metropolitan area would naturally increase the prices for the remaining tomatoes that reached the market. In fact,, I foresaw that, without a general fixation, the prices on the metropolitan market would become exorbitant. When I was compelled to take positive action in the first instance, I requested the Prices Commissioner to prevent a skyrocketing of prices, so that, growers who were permitted to market their tomatoes in the metropolitan area would not receive an undue advantage compared with growers who were compelled to send their tomatoes to the canneries. Honorable members will appreciate the necessity for the Prices Commissioner to act simultaneously with the Department of Supply and Shipping in the matter. </para>

In somewhat similar circumstances, I discussed with the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spooner)</inline> problems relating to the market.ing of citrus fruits and I thank him for the practical aid that he extended to me.

            <para>- I ask the Minister for the Army whether it is a fact that a large body of soldiers in varying states of health is attached to the Sydney showgrounds awaiting the decision of medical boards? Is it also a fact that no facilities have been provided for feeding and accommodating these men at the showgrounds, with the result that after assembling each day at 9 a.m., they are dismissed and granted leave for the following 24 hours? Is the purpose of this almost immediate dismissal each day to relieve the Army of the obligation of feeding and sheltering the men? Is it a fact that these men are without homes in the city and are forced to sleep whenever they can at night? If so, will the Minister ensure that in future soldiers are provided with food and shelter while awaiting the decisions of medical boards? </para>

They cannot possibly be construed to mean generating plants attached to motor vehicles or farm lighting systems. The purpose of issuing the regulations was to obtain an estimate of electrical plant that may be held by local governing bodies generally throughout Australia, so that in an emergency involving a breakdown of electrical services the Government would know where reserve plants could he obtained for the generation of power. My department made it clear to the Press that the regulations did not include electrical equipment on motor vehicles. </para>

            <para>- I am quite willing to do so, but our main problems arise from the lack of supplies of what the Americans call critical materials for the development of shale deposits. These are in short supply in the United States of America as they are in Australia. I refer to cracking plant, refining machinery, and retorts. Man-power also is a difficulty. We have been endeavouring to concentrate upon deposits which we think can be developed in the shortest possible space of time. </para>

A coal commission is engaged at present in making a survey of the best way to reach the objective we have in mind, which, I am sure, the honorable member desires to be reached. Whatever may be said in criticism of a certain section of the coal-miners, the fact is that never in the history of Australia has so much coal been produced in twelve months in New South Wales as was produced there last year. That is the first and most important point to keep in mind. </para>

            <para>.- I shall be brief in my contribution to this debate for I realize that it is only preliminary to other business which will come before us shortly. I regret exceedingly that the Government was not ready, when the Parliament met on Wednesday, to introduce the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Bill of which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> has just given notice. Because of that fact we have wasted a week during which we and also the members of the staffs of the Parliament could have been spending their time to better advantage in connexion with the war effort. I know that by the resolution carried during the last sessional period the Government was bound to call the Parliament together not later than the 27th January. This suggests to me that, in future, it would be desirable to allow the Government some latitude in arranging the meetings of the House. As things have turned out, we are wasting our time discussing what, after all, is a futile motion. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I trust that during this sitting period honorable members will be given the opportunity to consider the decisions of the Constitution Convention that was held in Canberra at the end of November. During our last sittings the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> moved the second reading of a bill which provided for certain Constitution alterations, and the debate on the motion was adjourned. I understand that in consequence of the decisions of the convention that bill will be withdrawn. Apparently legislative action by this Parliament will not be necessary to give effect to the decisions of the convention. I trust that that does not mean that we shall not have an. opportunity to debate the subject. If necessary the Prime Minister or the Attorney-General should make a report to this Parliament on the decisions of the convention. That would open the way for a debate on the subject. This Parliament is, of course, deeply concerned in the issues that have been raised, and honorable members should be given a full opportunity to debate them. </para>
          <para>I deplore the unseemly wrangling and continual argument that has occurred in this chamber since the beginning of our sittings this week about whether this Government, or some other government, has done the most effective work in connexion with the war effort. Such controversies cannot help, hut must hinder, the war effort. It is the duty of this Parliament to set an example of unity to the people and to inspire them to exert their utmost powerto strengthen every national endeavour in order to bring the war to a successful conclusion. Unfortunately, during parliamentary recesses, some honorable members take the opportunity to travel throughout the country criticizing the members of other political parties and stressing the achievements of this or that government. That sort of thing can get us nowhere and must lead to division among the people at a time when we need unity. What we should bear in mind is that the Government has a job to do in the interests of the country. I agree with the sentiment expressed by the Prime Minister on Wednesday that we all should go down on our knees and thank God that Australia has been saved from invasion. We should thank our fighting services for all they have done to resist the enemy. Members of this Parliament and civilians generally should feel humble when they compare what they have done with what the members of the fighting services have done to save Australia . from invasion. We should cease bickering in this Parliament and bend all our energies to the worthwhile duty of inspiring the people. </para>
          <para>Whilst a good deal has been done to organize our man-power and resources for the war effort, I consider that additional action is desirable along certain lines. I do not intend to criticize the Minister for War Organization of Industry or his colleagues. I appreciate the difficulties which have confronted them. Yet I believe that our man-power could be organized to better advantage. The Government could set an example by overhauling the Public Service. Many men and women engaged in the Public Service could be released for more definite war work. I do not suggest that public servants have nothing to do; but many activities which may be desirable in peace-time are not necessary in wartime. From time to time numerous reports are called for which involve a great deal of work, and this is work of a kind which could well be held over for the time being. If the Commonwealth Government were to take a lead in this direction, its example would probably be followed by the State Governments. I am not satisfied that the large number of persons in the public services in Australia are being used in the best interests of the country at this critical period. </para>
          <para>I am also concerned at the ever increasing number of boards and commissions, all of which require staff. In fairness to the present Government I admit that many of these boards were appointed by the previous Government,, but circumstances have changed since then, and it is time the matter was reviewed. Some time ago, I called for a report on the number of boards and commissions and committees in existence in Australia, and whilst I knew that there were many such bodies, I was staggered when I saw the complete list. Since then, the number has probably been increased. From my experience as a business man, I have reason to fear that there is a good deal of duplication of effort and overlapping associated with the activities of these bodies. I am not suggesting that the staffs attached to them are not working, but we have to ask ourselves whether they are working to the best advantage. I arn convinced that, with a little planning, it would be possible to employ many of them on work more directly associated with the war effort. Indeed, one is sometimes tempted to wonder whether we are not, trying to win the war with pens instead of guns. </para>
          <para>There is a strong feeling throughout the community that the funds available to the Government are not always put to the best use. There is more than a suggestion that there have been waste and extravagance in many directions. I am a member of the War Expenditure Committee, and we have examined a great many items of war expenditure. .1. frankly admit that it, would be impossible for the Government to have speeded up the war effort in the way it has done, when hasty decisions had frequently to be taken, and still avoided waste in every instance, but I still believe that the exercise of a little care and thought could have saved large sums of money. I have in mind particularly the resumption of valuable properties in various parts of Australia. These resumptions appear to have been made without giving proper consideration to whether or not the property would be suitable for the purpose in mind. It often happens that properties are hastily resumed, the occupiers turned out, and then the property left unused  for months. Sometimes existing buildings are pulled down and others erected, or extensive alterations are made, and (hen the buildings are not used at all. I recognize, of course, that in time of war the needs of the fighting services must come first, and the interests of private citizens must take second place, but I a.l so believe that, by the exercise of a little thought and courtesy, much inconvenience could be saved to private citizens, and, in the end, much money saved to the Government, </para>
          <para>Honorable members are continually hearing stories of fabulous wages paid to men connected with the Allied &#34;Works Council. I would not believe these stories at first, but I have since investigated some of them for myself, and find that there is some truth in them. One case I have in mind is that of a cook&#39;s  off-sider,  who receives &#163;25 a week. </para>

              <para>- I know that, under the award, he is entitled to what he receives. He is brought on early in the morning to prepare breakfast, then he has to stand by for some time between breakfast and lunch time, and probably again in the afternoon before the preparation of the evening meal. For all this waiting time he must be paid, and this makes up his wages to &#163;25 a week. I mention the matter in order to make a plea on behalf of the men who are fighting for the protection of this country, the men who have fought a determined enemy in the swamps and -jungles of New Guinea. 1 have heard complaints that while conditions are being improved for those who stay behind little is being done for those upon whom we depend for our freedom and safety. This is a point on which I feel strongly. If the country can afford to pay such high wages to those who stay in Australia, it should be able to do more for those who are offering their lives for the safety of the country. I. trust that, the Minister for the Army will take steps to ensure that men fighting in New Guinea are given adequate relief. They are fighting, not only against a determined enemy, but also against vile climatic conditions. Many of them have been stricken down with malaria, and arrangements should be made for their relief. </para>

              <para>- I recognize that the financial conduct of the war is a matter of secondary consideration. &#34;Whatever the cost we must foot the bill, and I believe that the people of Australia are prepared to do so. I suggest, however, that in view of the magnitude of our financial commitments, the Treasurer should endeavour to provide Parliament with a half-yearly statement of the financial position. I also draw attention to the fact that, although this is now the end of January, Parliament has not yet seen the Auditor-General&#39;s report on the accounts for the year ended the 30th June, 1942. I appreciate the difficulties of the Auditor-General in compiling his report, seeing that he must obtain information from all over Australia, but I suggest that he should submit half-yearly reports to the House on those matters which he thinks should be brought to the attention of the Parliament. </para>

          <para>The Treasurer delivered a temperate and able speech yesterday on the financial activities of the Government. I assure him that I for one never believed that we could pay for the war out of taxation and loans as we went along. I realized all the time that it would be necessary to draw on the national credit to a certain extent, but I am afraid that we are not mobilizing the financial resources of the nation to the best advantage. I understand that legislation is to be introduced shortly to provide .that more of the surplus funds in circulation shall be taken by the Government for the war effort, </para>
          <para>Some of the regulations that have been issued from time to time should be reviewed by this Parliament. I wish to refer briefly to the Landlord and Tenant Regulation that was introduced for th, purpose of protecting the tenant. Unfortunately, many landlords need protection. I have been interviewed by persons who have wished to regain possession of their homes; they include widows, and persons possessing one or two properties, on the rents of which they are dependent. Certain parties having taken advantage of the regulation, it is impossible for the landlords to obtain possession of the properties. </para>

          <para>I am concerned about the effect on the taxation revenue of the Prices Commis- sioner&#39;s order for refunds to the public of what he deems to he excess profits, I put this matter to the Treasurer in a letter in the following terms :  - </para>

            <para>Takethe case of a company which is deemed to have made excess profits of &#163;20,000 for the year ended 30th June, 1942, and is ordered to make a refund of this amount to the public. The company will be liable for tax on the excess profits, but in the following year, as its profits will be affected by the amount of the refund, the liability for taxation will be reduced accordingly. </para>
            <para>I would suggest that a more equitable method would be to allow the taxation payable on the excess profits as a set-off against the amount to be refunded. This would not disturb the taxation revenues which, under the present system, must represent a considerable loss. </para>

In the case of a private company where the shareholders concerned arc on the maximum rate, the taxation on &#163;20,000 will be over &#163;18,000. </para>
            <para>I would further point out that these refunds do not carry a relative liability for income tax on those who receive the benefits, as for the most part it represents transactions which do not attract taxation. </para>

I mention the matter because I regard it as very serious. The practice has been for the Prices Commissioner to order the retailer or trader concerned to make these refunds to the public, but, as I have pointed out, it will he the Treasury which, in the final analysis, will often be the loser, because it will have to pay the major portion of these returns of excess profits. </para>

          <para class="block">I have read that advisedly. I deplore the discreditable attempt that was made on Wednesday to prevent the right honorable gentleman from making those declarations. This Parliament is the symbol ofour democracy; the place in which, through their duly accredited representatives, the people of this nation may express themselves freely, without let or hindrance; the place where &#34; freedom slowly broadens down from precedent to precedent &#34;. Yet there is a disposition in this House to check freedom of discussion. We either retain a free parliament or get a dictatorship; there is no other choice. One realizes with a feeling of thankfulness that we still retain this symbol of our free democracy. In few countries of the world does that state obtain to-day. If some members of the Opposition do not wish to hear about the state of the war, and the imminent danger in which this country is placed at the present time, surely the people of the Commonwealth do. The news published in the press this morning is very disquieting. A ruthless and relentless enemy has concentrated considerable forces at a comparatively short distance from this continent. In my opinion, there is only one great thing that matters to-day; that is, the preservation of this Commonwealth inviolate. With that object, we have only one industry; that is, the industry of war, with all its ramifications, producing food and other necessaries for the fighting men and civilians, as well as arms with which our fighting men may defend their country. In addition, there is the training of our fighting forces. Therefore, the attitude adopted by a small number of members of the Opposition is inexplicable. They appeared to object to the Prime Minister making his statement. I believe that all recognize the intense sincerity, loyalty and patriotism of the right honorable gentleman. Whether or not there is agreement with his politics, the people of Australia as a whole consider that he is doing a good job. He was magnanimous in the overflowingmeasure of credit that he gave to previous administrations for the work that they had done. The Opposisition cannot object to that. When the history has to be written of this period during which Labour has occupied the treasury bench, the people of Australia will be thankful that at the wheel of the ship of State there was a leader of the calibre of the Right Honorable John Curtin. </para>
          <para>In the debate there has been much discussion of methods that should be employed in orderto finance the war. We have been told that there are only two ways in which a government may obtain money with which to finance a war or any other undertaking, namely, taxation and loans. It has been disclosed that neither taxation nor loans, nor the two combined, can provide the abnormal amount that is needed in order to co-ordinate, correlate, and move into effective activity the different factors connected with this war. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> has sounded what he has called a note of warning against inflation. He has spoken of the material lessening of the value of money. I admit the existence of such a clanger. When our products and the necessaries of life are becoming scarcer, and when wages are high, the tendency is for prices to rise. But I hold, and have long held, that there is no human problem which cannot be solved by the human mind. With careful control of the issue of currency, careful fixation of prices, and the pegging of rents, profits, interest and wages, we can secure ourselves against unhealthy inflation. The Leader of the Opposition has advanced his remedy, which is the taxation of the workers. He did not say, but I may infer from his remarks, that in his opinion the workers are receiving too much. I disagree with him. It is about time the workers came into a little of their own. For too long have they been satisfied to take the crumbs that have fallen from the table. The obsession of the Leader of the Opposition is that the workers should not only fight, but also pay for the war. Every nation to-day is financing its part of the war from what we call bank credit. Now, the creation of bank credit has passed the academic stage. We have the highest. authorities - Soddy, Haw-try, Keynes, McLeod, Hartley Withers, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Vincent</inline> Vickers, McKenna, McMillan and the <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</inline> - to name but a few - to prove that when a bank makes a loan it creates credit, The vitally important question is who is to have the power to control the issue of bank credit. In the past that power has been in the hands of irresponsible private individuals, the governors or directors of the private banks. Australia was fortunate in having <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> national bank in the Commonwealth Bank, before&#39; its functions became perverted and before it became a bankers&#39; bank instead of the people&#39;s bank. Speaking on this subject yesterday, the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spooner)</inline> said - I took down his words verbatim - that the credit issued to the Commonwealth Bank was ^proximately &#163;250,000,000. Why &#34;issued to &#39; the bank&#34;? Why not &#34; issued by the bank &#34;? Why should the Commonwealth Bank have credit issued to it when it has the power to issue its own credit? Why create a debt when the Commonwealth Bank has the power instead to create a credit? I call the attention of honorable members to the difference between those two words &#34; to &#34; and &#34;by&#34;. </para>

              <para>- I have repeated what the honorable member for Robertson said. We do not need treasury-bills, either. I repeat that the Commonwealth Bank has the power to issue credits, but it is not allowed to do so. Most of the members of the Commonwealth Bank Board were appointed to safeguard the interests of the private banks and other financial institutions. That is why the Commonwealth Bank has credit issued to it instead of issuing credit itself. I shall read four important resolutions of the conference of the Australian Labour party held in Melbourne in November, 1942, and January, 1943- </para>

Could not afford it! What rot! I further suggest equally strongly that discharged and demobilized soldiers be kept on the pay-roll of the Army until such time as they can be absorbed in industry, and that, if they are not fit to take up industry, they be nursed and trained until such time as they are able to go out into the world again. Who will say that this country, the richest in the world, cannot afford it? </para>

          <para>I welcome the announcement that the Government will introduce a national welfare scheme embracing unemployment insurance, health insurance and nationalization of the medical, hospital and dental services. We must do that if we are to make this country a land worth living in and fighting for, and a land to which our defenders will gladly return. We do not want our soldiers to come hack to the same conditions as welcomed those who returned from the war of 1914-18, for we all know what happened to them. They came back to the most tragic conditions - a man-made depression, a depression brought about by the private .banks. We shall have the same thing again if the &#34; old gang &#34; remains in charge of the affairs of this nation. If those people remain in charge, the depression which will follow this war will be worse even than that which in the ten years of its course after the last war deprived our manhood of the opportunity to earn enough to live on and forbade our youths to learn a trade, owing to there being no trade open to them. One of the measures needed to guard against a repetition on a worse scale of the last depression is a national welfare scheme. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> hope that the scheme which is projected will be introduced before the present sessional period comes to an end. </para>
          <para>I was sorry to hear the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> and the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McDonald)</inline> object to the establishment of wool appraisement and. storage centres in districts far removed from the coast. Theirs is the voice of vested interests. All our wool has been purchased by the British Government, and we are merely its custodians. Yet it is stored in the coastal cities, and we all know that the coast would be the first section of our country to fall to the enemy. To prevent the enemy from obtaining that wool we should have to destroy it. This Government, therefore, has taken steps to establish wool appraisement and storage centres in districts back from the coast. In my electorate two such centres have been established at Dalby and Soma, in the face of a barrage of opposition. Why take everything to the coast? Therein lies one of our greatest, dangers. Russia, very wisely, placed  its factories far from, its western boundaries. Many of its factories are past of the Ural Mountains. Had the factories been placed within a short distance of its western boundary, where would Russia have been to-day? Surely there is a lesson which we must heed. Why gather 40 or 50 per cent, of our population in coastal capital cities? </para>

Their answer, &#34; All right, we will go came very quickly. They were in no hurry to join the Army.

              <para>- That is so. We must have irrigation and water conservation. There is a project in Queensland for the building of the Mingoola Dam. If that dam were built, tens of thousands of acres of country suitable for tobacco-growing could be brought into cultivation. At present Australia grows only one-sixth of its tobacco requirements. Surely, therefore, the building of the Mingoola Dam is a war measure. Our soldiers and our civilians all need tobacco, and we can supply their needs only by growing it ourselves. To do so we must irrigate. Irrigation has caused the desert to blossom like the rose in such places as Mildura, Renmark, Yanco, Griffith and Leeton; places which were once sheep runs are now thriving towns. The cost of the construction of the Mingoola dam will be &#163;1,000,000, which is less than our war expenditure for one day. If the money can be found for weapons of destruction, it must be provided for this important national work. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. J.</inline> J. G. Bradfield has a project for diverting westwards some of the streams which now flow from northern Queensland into the Pacific Ocean. Although the cost of the scheme is estimated at &#163;30,000,000, the figure does not appear to be nearly so colossal when we realize that it represents less than one month&#39;s expenditure on the war effort. If the project were proceeded with, vast areas in the Northwest, Central West and South-west of Queensland would be converted into a garden. I hope that in the post-war years the money will be provided for this important project. </para>

          <para>Tobacco-culture is an important Australian industry which will provide employment for many persons after the war. Even though we are fighting a powerful enemy, .this industry should not be allowed to languish or stagnate. I bring to the notice of honorable members a suggestion that the Government should establish tobacco nurseries. Young plants, raised under ideal conditions, would be made available cheaply to tobacco-growers. The suggestion impressed me, and I submitted it to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully),</inline> who appeared to be interested in it. </para>
          <para>We are apt to speak vaguely of the &#34; new order &#34; that will be introduced after the Allies have defeated the Axis, but in my opinion the &#34;new order&#34; can be achieved only through the education system. Education will be one of the most potent factors in bringing about the &#34; new order &#34;. I should like to commend the action of the Government in granting financial assistance to the sons and daughters of parents in comparatively needy circumstances to enable them to gain a university education. At present, the universities require highly trained personnel. On the outbreak of war, large numbers of lecturers and students volunteered for service, with the result that the universities, instead of being a national asset, have become in some measure a national liability. Financial assistance will enable many boys and girls to attend the university, but I hope that the assistance will not cease on -the termination of war. In my opinion, the scheme should be enlarged. The &#34; means test &#34; should be abolished, and boys and girls should be given an intensive course of instruction. We urgently require engineers, scientists, doctors and dentists. </para>

              <para>- In the post-war era, the Commonwealth will desire to send its diplomatic representatives to the courts of the nations of the world. We shall have to &#34; deliver the goods &#34;, as our American friends so effectively express it, in order to sell the things that we produce so prolifically. We cannot have too many highly trained young men for the work. </para>

          <para>I regret that the proposals for constitutional reform do not include the transference to the Commonwealth of education. The reason for this omission is obscure. The States experience increasing difficulty in financing education, which is undoubtedly a national matter. The Commonwealth Government should accept responsibility for the education of the people, because education, like war, is one of the greatest fusing and unifying forces in the world. Over 40 years ago, Australians considered that it would be in their interests to federate. The motive that actuated them was the desire for unity. We come from British stock: we speak the same great language. From the English we have inherited all our great literature, with Shakespeare at the head. We have the same standards of civilization. In the circumstances, why should Australia have six different standards of education? Seven years ago I attended a conference on education in Adelaide, and I was astounded when I saw this evidence of six different standards and curricula, which result in overlapping and duplication. We federated for the purpose of achieving unity. Education is the greatest fusing and unifying force. In my opinion, the standardization of education must be regarded as the consummation of federation. </para>

            <para>.- Last year, shortage of man-power and the excessive demands of the Army indicated the likelihood of a potato famine in this country. Warned of the danger, the Government persuaded growers to produce potatoes, assuring them of a minimum price at sidings, and appointed a control board which, up to a point, had considerable powers. For example, it could prevent a grower from sending a  potato even to his grandmother. All transactions involving potatoes had to be done with the knowledge of the board. There are two periods of the year when the potato market is glutted. If the board had been empowered to regulate the distribution of potatoes to consumers, the story would have been different. The Government perceived the possibility of a grave shortage, and our worst fears were realized. Prices soared, and civilians were unable to buy potatoes. A famine prevailed. Then the new crop was dug, and a few days ago the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> announced a glut of potatoes and urged restaurants to serve large helpings of them. If the Government had agreed to purchase the potato crop and the board had been given power to form a pool, supplies to the public could have been regulated and the market would have revealed neither a scarcity nor a glut. During the famine, the price of potatoes was a little over &#163;20 a ton but in Sydney recently the price had fallen to about &#163;2 10s. a ton. A board with adequate powers would have prevented such absurd fluctuation. The supply of potatoes was adequate to meet all demands for a long period, if only the distribution had been properly spread. As the result of this unfortunate experience, growers are now asking the Government to establish a pool. Control could be vested in the board, which should have the advice of the growers. </para>

              <para>- With the assistance of the State Governments, the Commonwealth Government was able to induce the potato-growers of Australia to increase their area under crop, so that service and civilian requirements could be met. But when the first glut occurred the authorities were unable to cope with the position. The board, not having power to order pooling, asked the growers to name their own agents. That was done and immediately the agents engaged in a competition which caused complete disorganization of the market. The glut was such that prices varied from day to day and eventually dropped to a figures which involved the Commonwealth Government in con siderable loss in order to meet promises that had been made to the growers. I desire to see the right thing done for the potato-growers. We should learn from our experiences of last year. If necessary, the Government should make arrangements now for a compulsory potato pool. One strong organization of potato-growers has already carried a resolution in support of such a move. Pooled potatoes could be placed in storage or dehydrated and released from time to time as they were required. This procedure would obviate gluts on the market. I have received the following telegram from the secretary of the potato growers of Donnybrook, Western Australia: - </para>

At that time the ruling price was &#163;13 a ton and the growers who supplied the potatoes naturally expected to receive that price, but I have been informed that, because the price subsequently fell, the Government proposes to pay them only &#163;8 10s. a ton. I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to investigate the position. If the position is as stated to me, there is a strong case for the payment of the price offering at the time of shipment. </para>
          <para>I wish now to refer to the rabbit menace in Australia. In 1941 sales of rabbit-skins in this country yielded &#163;600,000. In the following year sales increased to about &#163;4,000,000. Complaints made by the hat manufacturers caused the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> to introduce a measure which provided for the imposition of an export duty of 2s. 6d. per lb. on rabbit-skins. American purchases ceased at once and trappers lost interest in the industry. To-day rabbit-skins fetch only 7d. per lb. and nobody will trap rabbits when skins are , at that price. Honorable members who live in rural areas know what a menace rabbits are. Even good stock country soon loses its value if rabbits are allowed to run unchecked on it. The Vermin Board ofWestern Australia has power to enforce the destruction of rabbits on private property. Recognizing the seriousness of the present position, and also that there was no Pharaoh available to order bricks to he made without straw, the board issued the following circular to property-owners: - </para>

          <para class="block">It is unfortunate that the Government&#39;s action in the interests of the hat manufacturers has had the effect of discouraging all trapping operations and of stopping purchases by American interests. I therefore ask, in the interests of rural production, that the Government should now do something to encourage rabbit destruction. If the price of rabbit-skins can be stabilized, it will help to control the menace. If action to that end be not taken, rabbits will soon overrun and ruin a large area of valuable pastoral and agricultural country. </para>

            <para>.- 1 support the motion submitted by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> In common with many other honorable members,. I was nonplussed at the attitude with which it was received by the Opposition. It contains matter which could be submitted daily without warranting the reception which Opposition members gave to it. Possibly they realize the value that this Labour Government has been to Australia in its hour of very great need. I congratulate the Government upon its achievements after a brief term of office during a period when this country, to use the words of the Prime Minister, &#34; had its back against the wall, from which there could be mo retreat &#34;. It is undeniable, and is recognized by the great majority of the Australian people, that the Government has proved its capacity to organize and to galvanize war production into activity. It has strengthened the defence line of this country. It has had to submit much unpopular legislation, make inroads on various industries, and touch the pockets of many business concerns. All these were necessary in order that this country might be organized on a thorough war basis. I am not actuated by parochial instincts when I assert that Western Australia was hit harder than any other State; because, when the call for man-power was made, it was without defence and did not have any war factories. That statement is unchallengeable. The result was that many of its valued artisans, having failed to obtain employment in war industries in their own State, came over to Victoria and New South Wales. The position has been accepted by our people. In respect of enlistments in the Australian Imperial Force and service in the Militia, their record on a population basis compares more than favorably with that of any other State. </para>

              <para>- My remarks apply also to man-power withdrawals and subscriptions to war loans. It was left to this Government to strengthen the defence line, and establish war industries in Western Australia. I have come into this House with the object of endeavouring to do the right thing f ot this country. I am definitely a Labour supporter. I make no apology to any Parliament or section of the people on that account. The press and public men who criticize this Government do not always adopt a fair basis for their criticism. Throughout Australia to-day there are what are known as &#34; Wardism &#34; and &#34; Dedmanism &#34;. The honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> took over an organization in which the Government of which the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> was a Minister had failed to leave even a scrap of paper. It was an organization in name only, and was not functioning. The Minister for War Organization of Industry had to administer what no man or woman will say is not a necessary control if the whole of our war effort is to be organized on a correct basis. The constant attack upon him for these necessary activities is the sort of criticism to which I object. When I see newspapers blazoning forth &#34;Dedman has killed Father Christmas&#34;, my retort is that the Japanese would have killed Mother Christmas had the proper organization not been given effect. That sort of criticism tends to arouse a complacent attitude in the minds of the majority of the people, who even yet do not realize the dire peril with which we are faced. Such cheap gibes go far towards creating the complacent attitude that is to be found in our towns and cities. But that is not the position farther out. I have just returned from a visit to the far north of Western Australia. I witnessed the devastating results of enemy action at Wyndham and Broome. I met men and women who are rationed in regard to not only tobacco and beer, but also essential foodstuffs, because there is no transport by means of which they are able to secure supplies. The people of Derby, Wyndham, Fitzroy, Hall&#39;s Creek and other outlandish centres are compelled to travel hundreds of miles to Broome in order to obtain supplies of foodstuffs. That only bare necessities can be carted long distances will be readily recognized. Men are employed on Allied works under wretched conditions which it is impossible to avoid because of lack of transport and other facilities. The Commonwealth should commence without delay negotiations with the Government of Western Australia, which is doing all in its power, with the resources at its hand, to bring some relief to the people who are suffering in the north-west. Not one complaint did I hear from those people. They realized that it is their responsibility to stand up to the position, and they are doing so uncomplainingly. They say that they will carry on to the bitter end. They are not going to be driven out of their country; all they ask is that help be sent to them as quickly as possible so that some protection will be afforded them should the enemy make another visit of the kind he made to Broome. </para>

          <para>There seems to be different conception of hardship as between metropolitan and country districts. There is no real beer or tobacco rationing in the cities. A man may go from one shop to another in the city and buy a packet of cigarettes in each, but in remote country areas and in the settlements along the east-west railway, tobacco rationing is rigidly enforced. The Government should make another aeroplane available in order to assist the State in carrying supplies to people living in such isolated places, so that they may enjoy some of the amenities available to people in city areas. </para>
          <para>Yesterday, I listened to the Treasurer pointing out that when the present Opposition constituted the government of this country, hundreds of thousands of people were out of work, and some of them were starving. I can endorse what the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> said because, at that time I was the secretary of a trade union. Every day when I went to my office I was met by a batch of men pleading for work or food. Today, those men are in the front line fighting for the security of Australia. Perhaps in the near future the fight will be brought much closer to our shores than it is to-day. I liken the enemy to a dingo pack prowling on our boundary fence and waiting to force an entry. At the present time, the Japanese are only 500 miles from Broome. I hope that when the war is brought to a successful conclusion the working people of Australia will not he treated as they were by the last government. It has been necessary for the present Government to impose heavy taxation, and the exemption figure has been placed very low. I admit that it seems unfair that the same men should be asked both to fight and pay, butI am convinced that the people of Australia are prepared to pay taxation, however heavy, rather than see the Japanese place foot on Australian soil. The Government has imposed these financial burdens because of the imperative need to establish an adequate defence organization and to equip our forces. We do not hoar to-day the cry that our troops are without equipment. Thank God the people of Australia have produced the necessary equipment ! I remind those who criticize the working class, and point to a few stop-work meetings and a few hold-ups by the miners, that the workers of Australia generally have made a greater war effort than those of any other country. I ask those critics not to gibe and sneer at the workers, because their sneering hurts honest men. </para>

            <para>. - The honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Johnson)</inline> said that he was nonplussed by the attitude of the Opposition to the motion of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> Members of the Opposition are certainly nonplussed by the action of the Prime Minister in introducing the motion. I have studied it, and can see in it nothing but what we on this side of the House have subscribed to ever since the war began. There is no need for us to re-affirm our loyalty. Of course, it may be desirable that Government supporters should reaffirm their loyalty and their determination to support a maximum war effort. The old tippler, the life-long addict to strong drink, endeavours from time to time to fortify his resolution of abstinence by signing the pledge. In the same way, honorable members opposite, who have all their political lives flirted with certain dangerous political doctrines, find it necessary from time to time to make resolutions of good behaviour, to reaffirm their loyalty, and to assert their intention to devote themselves to a maximum war effort. Surely every body in Australia can subscribe to the sentiments expressed in the Prime Minister&#39;s motion, and it should not be necessary to take up the time of Parliament with debate. It should not be necessary for Government supporters to sign the pledge again. We can only conclude that the Government was not ready to go on with the legislative programme for which honorable members were called together from all parts of Australia ; either that, or Government supporters are indulging in a little pre-election window-dressing so that they may point out to the electorate what a wonderful war effort the Government has made. </para>

          <para>The Government is now proclaiming its loyalty, but its supporters have taken a long time to realize their responsibilities. The record of the Labour party, and of individual members, requires close investigation. Ever since 1921, the attitude of the party towards the Empire and what it stands for has been questionable. In support of the statement, I quote the following resolution which was carried at the Australian Trade Unions Conference in 1921, and appears on page 32 of the official report of the conference: - </para>

            <para>This conference, believing that the operation of the Defence Act <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> 70 days&#39; training of compulsory trainees is unduly harsh and morally degrading, enters its emphatic protest and calls upon the administration to immediately cancel same. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">A few days ago, the Prime Minister had to attend a special federal conference of the Australian Labour party to ask permission to introduce legislation enabling members of the Militia to be sent overseas. Time after time, the Labour party has been forced by the pressure of public opinion to espouse proposals which it had formerly condemned with great vigour. For instance, the Labour party condemned the Empire Air Training Scheme when it was first proposed,  but now ministerial supporters apeak glibly of the wonderful work which is being achieved under that scheme. &#34;When it was proposed to send Australian troops overseas the Labour party condemned the proposal; yet now it is seeking an amendment of the Defence Act to permit it to send overseas, not only volunteers, but compulsory .trainees also. The Labour party also opposed the restoration of compulsory military training. It is no wonder that such a party has been in power for only two years out of 24 up to the time of its present accidental occupation of the treasury bench. The utterances of some members of the Labour party, as recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> reek with disloyalty to the British Empire. I hope that 1 shall not be challenged to quote those utterances; they have already been quoted <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam.</inline> That the Labour party is rotten with subversive elements is proved by the fact that on the 24th March, 1940, while Australia was fighting for its very existence and when Japan was already a member of &#34; the Axis, and when we knew that we were &#34; for it the New South Wales branch of the party by 195 votes to SS passed an  anti-war  and an anti-British resolution in the following terms : - </para>

We declare that the -Australian people have nothing to gain from the continuance of the war. The management of this war in the hands of the anti-Labour Menzies Government, in association with the anti-Labour Chamberlain Government, means that the war is being pursued in the interests of big finance and monopolists. Conference is opposed to Australian participation in oversea conflicts. The Labour party unhesitatingly demands that no Austraiian troops be permitted to leave Australia. </para>

The published report of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions Conference in Sydney on the 18th April, 1940, reeks with disloyal, subversive and anti-war propaganda by union officials and delegates. The motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crofts</inline> on behalf of the executive, &#34; supporting the war against Hitler and Fascism &#34;, was carried by only two votes. Sixty-eight delegates voted for the motion and 66 delegates voted against it.

          <para class="block">We all know how they can .obstruct military operations by direct action, but what did they mean by &#34;other methods&#34;? There is something significant, something really subversive, in &#34;other methods&#34; - something which they were not game to bring to the light of day. With a background like that, is it any wonder that the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> are filled with disloyal and subversive statements made by Labour members? These subversive tactics were effective in nullifying the efforts of the Government of which I was a member. It was not until, first, Russia and then Japan entered the war on opposing sides that a change came. When Russia entered the war on our side as the result of the breaking by Hitler of the pact between Germany and Russia, the subversive elements changed their tune a little. Then, when Japan ranged itself alongside Germany, they changed their tune a little more for the sake of their miserable hides. Where is the devotion to the British Commonwealth of Nations referred to in this motion? I give the Government all credit for theefforts it has made to regain the ground that was lost as the result of the tactics employed by the subversive elements within the Labour party, but, foul seed having been sown, the .Government must await the plant before it will be able to eradicate it. It cannot, therefore recoverthe position immediately. That is whystrikes and absenteeism and job control arestill rife in industry. I impress upon thaGovernment that it must weed the subversive elements out of the organization. It will not do so by such methods aslifting the ban on the Communist party. </para>
          <para>I direct the attention- of honorablemembers to some of the extraordinarymanpower muddles into which we have- fallen, not as the result of attempts to intensify the war effort,but because, as the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> has frequently said, of the need to implement Labour&#39;s peacetime policy. I know that in any wartime Ministry, only certain Ministers carry the heavy burdens of war-time administration. Other Ministers have plenty of time on. their hands. We all know the old adage that Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do. Satan certainly found some mischief for the Minister for Labour and National Service, who is taking advantage of the war situation to try to enforce compulsory unionism. I quote from circular No. 167, issued from the office of the  Deputy  Director-General of Man Power, New South Wales, which was distributed amongst the employees of the Department of Labour and National Service - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I am informed by the Director-General of Man Power that the Minister for Labour and National Service has asked that immediate inquiries be made to ascertain whether there are non-unionists employed in any national service office and should such be the case, he desires that a direction be issued that all employees of the Department of Labour and National Service must be financial members of a bona fide trade union organization covering their employment. </para>

              <para>- I am happy to have the assurance of honorable gentlemen opposite that compulsory unionism is the war-time objective of the Labour Government. Does the Ministry think that compulsory unionism will contribute to our achieving the maximum war effort? That is the argument employed by honorable gentlemen opposite, but how false it is will be readily appreciated by honorable members who analyse the facts as T. now propose to do. Rather than intensify the war effort, compulsory unionism will intensify discontent and trouble with greater loss of production than ever. In saying that without compulsory unionism there will be discontent in all union workshops Labour members deny the loyalty of those whom they represent. The Commonwealth Statistician has had something to say about this matter. I shall take three of the most highly unionized industries in Australia, the coal-miners, the engineering and metal trades, and shipping and wharf labourers. In NewSouth Wales in 1939 there were 386 disputes, in which 148,531 men were involved, causing the loss of 410,183 days. Men engaged in the coal-mining, engineering and metal trades, shipping and wharf industries were involved in 94.99 per cent. of those disputes, and 82.49 per cent. of the total days lost were lost by them. That happened when Australia was in the throes of war, and the Menzies Government was endeavouring to harness our industrial resources for war purposes. That was about the time when the resolutions towhich I have referred were carried. In 1940, about 174,000 men, of whom 91.47 per cent. were coal-miners, struck work, and 93 per cent. of the 1,238,161 days lost were lost by coal-miners. Engineering and metal trades workers lost 53,102 days through disputes - 3.52 per cent. of the total. In the first half of 1941 there were 218 disputes, of which 167 occurred in the coal-mining industry, and 68,419 men were involved, of whom 76.5 were coal-miners. There was a loss of 190,905 days, of which 49.10 per cent. were lost by coal-miners. Engineering and metal trades workers were involved in 32 disputes, in which 10,700 men were involved and 41.516 days were lost. That is the record of the highly-unionized industries in the days before Labour took office. It is quite plain that if compulsory unionism is introduced there will be an intensification of these destructive tactics in industry. I listened with interest to the Prime Minister&#39;s tribute to the coalminers. That is one side of the picture. In order to give the other side I shall quote a statement published this morning in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times -</inline></para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>The loss of coal production in New South Wales during last year, due to stoppages, absenteeism and other causes, totalled 2,169,000 tons, said the  Chairman  of the Wallsend Coal Company <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scroggie)</inline> at the annual meeting to-day. </para>
            <para>He said the handing over of control of strikes to employees&#39; organizations was nothing less than class legislation, and an offence against the principles of democracy. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This does not square in any way with the statement made by the Prime Minister, and, if true, is a serious indictment of the unions concerned. I listened with some amazement to the vehement complaints of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie regarding the lack of transport for employees of the Allied Works Council in the north-west of Australia. I know that those men are experiencing great hardships, but I am not blind to the fact that our soldiers in New Guinea also lack adequate transport. They go into battle after forced marches of many miles and often on an empty stomach, and they do not complain. I direct attention to the following extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times -</inline></para>
          <quote>
            <para>The threat by 250 miners employed at Wallarah colliery to hold a stop-work meeting within 48 hours unless transport is provided for the men to and from the mines was referred to to-day by the general secretary of the Miners Federation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Grant).</inline></para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The greatest distance that those miners would have to travel would be a mile. While they were threatening to stop work unless they were provided with buses, our soldiers in New Guinea were laboriously making their way through the most difficult country in the world, so that the miners may retain the privileges of compulsory unionism. The whole thing is a tragedy ! The Government contends that if the principle of compulsory unionism be not accepted, discontent will be rife in industry and our war effort will suffer. Honorable members may be surprised to learn that of 1,955,000 workers in industry only 48.9 per cent, are unionists. That figure excludes the thousands of volunteers who are fighting for the preservation of Australia. I have no doubt that when they return they will be compelled to join a union. Though they were permitted to volunteer to fight for their country, they will be compelled to belong to a union before they will be able to get a job. Non-unionists do not hold stop-work meetings, or go on strike, and they are not affected by job-control. But they are working loyally and efficiently for their country, while the highly organized unionists go on strike. </para>
          <para>I come now to what I describe as the &#34; great and glorious man-power muddle &#34;. The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> has enunciated his views so often and so distinctly in this chamber that no one can doubt where his sympathies lie. We know his background, and the high esteem in which he holds the Communists. Consequently, </para>
          <para class="block">I am not surprised that the man-power regulations should be so designed as to enable unionists successfully to exploit their power. They use the name of the Minister indirectly to force recognition from their employers. Under the regulations, the employers are helpless. A worker may be dismissed for serious misconduct, but before he may be discharged, the case must be referred to the appeals board, which regularly and faithfully amends all charges of serious misconduct to charges of misconduct, and orders the employee to return to his job. The fact that he may have been discharged for subversive activity or inefficiency does not appear to matter. This policy is jeopardizing production in the factory. If the worker is fortunate enough to know a Cabinet Minister, he can secure a transfer from one factory to another without difficulty. Later, I shall cite examples to prove my statement. The Government has used a first-class party bias in drawing up these regulations. The basis of discipline in any factory is the right to take disciplinary action against an employee for serious misconduct or for other good reasons. The transfer of workers from one industry to another should be on the approved basis of a greater need for skilled tradesmen in another factory or a greater concentration of men in order to stimulate production of a certain kind. Unfortunately, at the present time transfers are effected to allow employees to get higher wages. Indeed, some workers have acknowledged that their only reason for transferring was to obtain increased emoluments. One lady who performed highly skilled work essential to war production was granted a transfer from a munitions factory to a silknit factory, where she would be paid a higher rate. By shearing the employers of their authority to dismiss an employee, the Government has created the very thing that it should avoid, namely, a lack of discipline in the factories, with a resultant loss of production. The employer has the right to appeal to a board but that body invariably amends a case of serious misconduct to one of misconduct and instructs the employee to return to his job. </para>

              <para>- I shall prove it. Every one knows that the foreman in a factory has a most difficult job. He must learn how to handle men, and he is re-, sponsible for production and efficiency. If the authority of the foreman be undermined, the output of the factory will be reduced. From time to time, I have read in the press of cases where foremen have threatened to resign if an employee who had been dismissed were reinstated. One firm,  Stromberg  Carlson (Australasia) Proprietary Limited, lodged 97 appeals with the man-power authorities; the employees won 92 of the cases. In my opinion, the unions are concerned, not about achieving maximum production in the factories, but only with the abolition of the employer&#39;s right of dismissal. This is a fundamental principle of unionism and appears in the regulations drafted by the Minister for Labour and National Service. Before an employer may terminate the services of an employee he must refer the case to an appeals board. More often than not the board opposes the wishes of the employer. Stromberg Carlson (Australasia) Proprietary Limited cited the following experiences of their dealings with the man-power authorities : - </para>

          <para>I have numerous other cases to which I could refer, but my time is too short. I shall, however, mention the case of a girl who was employed by the S&#39;trombergCarlson organization in making signalling apparatus. She was given permission to change her place of work and she went to a silk knitting company at higher wages. In that instance, the war was made subordinate to the desire of the girl to earn higher wages. Apparently, it was only for that reason a man-power officer granted her permission to change her place of employment. Perhaps I have said enough to lead honorable members to realize that there is need for more attention to the activities of the Department of Labour. </para>

      <para>A toolmaker employed by the above company applied to the National Service officer for permission to leave  Airzone  (1931) Limited and go to E.T.C. Industries. The National Service officer gave the necessary permission. </para>
      <para>As  Airzone  (.1931) Limited urgently required the services of a toolmaker, the company appealed against the National Service officer&#39;s decision to the Local Appeals Board and the board upheld the employer, i.e., the board ordered that the toolmaker should not leave  Airzone  (1931) Limited. </para>
      <para>However, the toolmaker had left  Airzone  (1931) Limited immediately he had received the National Service officer&#39;s permission, and, despite directions, he refused to stay on at  Airzone  (1931) Limited pending the hearing of the appeal. </para>
      <para>On the day that the appeal was heard, the toolmaker called at  Airzone  (1931) Limited and became very abusive to the works manager, so much so that the works manager had to threaten to call the police to remove him. </para>
      <para>Although the Local Appeals Board directed that he should return to  Airzone  (1931) Limited immediately, he did not do so until four days later, i.e., on a Monday. He refused to do any work that day, but just remained on the premises and loafed. He became offensive to the managing director, production supervisor and the works foreman. </para>
      <para>On the next day. about midday, this employee walked into the works manager&#39;s office and threw a -handful of orange-peel into  the  works manager&#39;s fane. For this act he was immediately suspended. </para>
      <para>The .matter was referred back to the manpower authorities, who advised that, in circumstances such as this, they were  helpless  to do  anything </para>
      <para>This case illustrates clearly that a section of employees cannot be controlled by the regulations and there is a number of other cases such as this wherein the employee has provoked the management to dismiss him. </para>

      <para>I see the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> sitting opposite, so I shall refer to an incident in Newcastle. A man-power officer in that city sent certain men from a number of engineering establishments to a shipbuilding yard. They were skilled men whose time was fully occupied,. The firms affected were not approached by the man-power officer, who apparently had no knowledge of the kind of work that they were doing. When die firms appealed, the man-power authorities realized that another muddle had occurred and it revoked the order that had been issued, with the result that the men were sent back to the engineering shops. It is not difficult to imagine the hubbub, the talking, the vexatious delay, and dislocation of operations that must occur in such cases. This kind of. thing is undermining discipline and destroying authority, yet it is characteristic of the activities of our man-power administration. In my opinion, the talk that we hear about the co-operation of the manpower authorities with industrial executives is seriously inaccurate. Apparently, any person who can get the ear of the Minister and can say, &#34; If you do not let me go where I want to go, I shall see Ned Ward about it &#34; gets what he wants. That kind of thing is being said time after time in workshops throughout Australia, and people are able to get away with it. Notwithstanding the brilliant persiflage that we hear from time to time, 1. am of the opinion that our industrial activities are being undermined and that a. definitely subversive undercurrent exists which is most undesirable. It appears to me that an organized endeavour is being made by means of Labour&#39;s supposed war-time policy to introduce a form of socialization, which, it is hoped, will be continued after the war. I do not like it, and I think that something should be done about it. It should not bc necessary for us to re-affirm our unity with the United Nations and our loyalty to those with whom we are associated. An honest man&#39;s loyalty does not need to be proclaimed from the house-tops. If it is necessary to bolster up enthusiasm and morale by means of a re-affirmation of loyalty and unity, then there is something seriously wrong with our war effort. I am firmly of the opinion that there are undercurrents in1 our industrial and economic life of which the general public should be made aware. </para>

          <para>. - If the speech to which we have just listened had been made by a responsible member of this Parliament it would have had to be considered seriously. An accusation that a Minister of the Crown was engaged in subversive activities would warrant the close attention of the Government if it came from a really responsible quarter. I have been wondering what purpose the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> desired to serve by indulging in a tirade against the Government. No doubt he was partly actuated by his well-known desire to see in office a national government in which he was a member; but the making of such speeches will have the effect of leaving the present Labour Government in control of the affairs of this country for a considerable time to come. The people generally must be considerably disturbed in their minds on account of the scenes that have occurred in this House in the last few days. Several honorable gentlemen opposite, including the honorable member for Wentworth, have dealt in everything except facts. I hope next week to be able to make a detailed statement on the specific cases to which he has referred this afternoon, but I am able to say now that there is not an atom of truth in any of his statements concerning man-power activities. </para>

            <para>- As the honorable member was not able to give the name of the Minister he should not have referred to the matter in this chamber. Such an attack was most unfair. The honorable gentleman has been a fake ever since he entered this Parliament. He has accused me of having communistic tendencies and a communistic background. I have never been a member of any political organization other than the Australian </para>

            <para>- I believe that the Government will need to give consideration, very shortly, to one aspect of the manpower problem to which no reference has yet been made. The honorable member for Wentworth made certain statements against the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Johnson)</inline> in relation to the transport services for workers in northwestern Western Australia, and then began to talk about communications in New Guinea. He knows as much about communications in New Guinea as I do. He gets his information, no doubt, from the columns of the newspapers. In the light of recent happenings, I consider that the Government should take prompt action to call upon certain persons who are strutting about this country in military uniforms to decide whether they are, or are not, prepared to go to the localities in which active war operations are occurring. Certain persons also should decide whether they wish to be members of Parliament or soldiers, and the honorable member for Wentworth is one of them. The individuals to whom I am referring wish to strut about the country in military uniforms, but they are not prepared to take the risks involved in active service. </para>

            <para>- Apparently the honorable member for Wentworth thinks that he can impute improper motives to Ministers of the Crown and charge them with subversive activities, and yet come unscathed from the conflict. The motion submitted by the Prime Minister ought to have been accepted after a discussion lasting only a few minutes. Every honorable member who has spoken has said that he favours the declarations that it makes. All that the honorable member for Wentworth had to say in criticism of the activities of the Government was that the man-power position had been muddled. Let us examine one or two aspects of it. For security reasons, we are not permitted to give the exact figures; but we can state the percentage increases that have occurred in certain directions. The Labour Government took office in October, 1941. This country had then been bled white of its defence equipment, which had been shipped abroad. Honorable members opposite seem to pride themselves on the fact that they were responsible for sending many thousands of Australian troops for service overseas. When we took over, a plan was in existence for the abandonment of large portions of North Australia without firing a shot, because the service advisers had stated that there were insufficient troops and equipment in this country properly to defend that portion of Australia in the event of invasion. That state of affairs was due to the fact that the war equipment that this country had been producing had been shipped abroad. I am informed that the position in regard to tanks is now approximately 2,000 per cent, better than it was in October, 1941. I understand that when Labour assumed office, of the very few tanks we possessed only one was in working condition, and it was regularly paraded, in Martin Place when war loan appeals were made. That constituted the effectiveness of our tank forces. To-day, those forces are considerable. What was the position in regard to aircraft? Beaufort bombers were practically non-existent. Although we had a few, I am informed that none was fit to take the air. All that the preceding Government left to the incoming Government were intermediate training planes, which were being used as fighters and. bombers. The Government pays tribute to the valor of the men in the Navy, the Army, and the Air Force. We have a good deal to be thankful for in that respect. But valor cannot win victories unless the men who display it are properly equipped. What happened to our Air Force in Rabaul? There, we had about a dozen Wirraway aircraft. </para>

            <para>- I am prepared to concede that there were a dozen. They were manned by heroic Australian airmen, but they were shot down almost before they were able to get into the air. They did not have a chance. It was absolute suicide of some of the best men that Australia has produced. Have honorable members opposite anything of which they may feel proud in the fact that they sent men into battle areas under such conditions, without proper air defence ? Did not the same set of circumstances apply in connexion with the Malayan campaign? The right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> on his way to Great Britain, stopped at Singapore, whence he issued to the Australian public, the statement that it was impregnable. We had Australian airmen in antiquated Wirraway aircraft. We were told that the Japanese did not have an up-to-date air force, that their airmen and their aircraft were no good, and that the Wirraways were quite capable of handling them. &#39; As a result, we grieve to-day over the loss of many gallant Australian airmen. Our position in regard to aircraft for the defence of this country has been immeasurably improved. We now have up-to-date fighters and bombers, and our production has risen by many hundred per cent. Honorable members opposite assert that the present Government is now reaping the benefit of what they did. Therefore, they say, they should share in the government of the country. Their complaint is that they are not permitted to do so. What sort of a race would we be able to run with a thoroughbred Government harnessed to an Opposition mule? Such a scheme would not work. If we - are to come through this conflict successfully, the Government must be left in the hands of those who have proved their capacity to get the best results on behalf of this country. &#34;We have heard a good deal about complacency. It is said that we ought to make the Australian public understand the seriousness of the position. The Government has endeavoured to do that. Large sections of the workers are realizing it, and are co-operating with the Government. I agree with the statement of the Prime Minister, although it has been challenged by the Employers&#39; Federation - as we expected - that if the same measure of co-operation had been forthcoming from the employers&#39; organizations as we have received from the employees, we would have had an -entirely different war effort. What has happened? Members of the Opposition, backed up by the Employers&#39; Federation, keep saying. &#34; Give us an all-in war effort &#34;. Why do we not have an all-in war. effort? Honorable members opposite have gained their point. There is now conscription of life. When are they :going to propose that we have conscription of wealth? All that- they say is, &#34; Let us have another loan. Let us have more taxes on the lower paid workers, because it is unfair that they should have too much to spend in these days, for the reason that, by competing for the limited quantity of goods available, prices may be forced up and we shall have the terrors of inflation&#34;. I wonder whether any of them has studied the contribution that has been made by those who have been able to lend money to the Government! Despite the endeavour to heap ridicule upon the idea, I have always been of the opinion that this and other wars are fought out of past and current production, not on something that may beproduced 10 or 20 years hence. The workers in the factories are labouring for long hours, impairing their health, in order to .make possible the defence of this country. They are making the real sacrifices in this conflict. I believe that the Minister for War Organization of Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> mentioned in this House on a previous occasion, and I agree, that whatever money can be secured by way of loans can be raised also by way of taxation; that is, if people are able to lend money to a Government, and we are supposed to be making an all-in war effort, why can they not give it by way of taxation? Yet the interest-free loans are actually falling, and our interest-bearing national debt has been mounting. Figures that I have received from the Statistician&#39;s department disclose that the national income increased by &#163;290,000,000 between the years 1938-39 and 1942-43, the national income in the latter year being an estimate. In the same period, the amount of interest-free loans to .the Government, to enable it to continue this war, fell from &#163;3,865,000 in 1940 to &#163;539,000 in 1942. This shows conclusively that those who control the wealth of Australia are not making a proper contribution. Remember how readily they accepted the economic regulations. There was then no protest from the Opposition. It did not say, &#34;That is destroying freedom &#34;, when jobs and wages were pegged and food was rationed ; but when the question was one of pegging or limiting profits, there was a squeal. It was argued that incentive would be destroyed, that the manufacturer would not want to produce, that his workshops would .be inefficient. What an indictment of those who control our industries, that they must have some greater incentive than the national need before they will do their best! I wonder why honorable gentlemen opposite  put that forward as an argument in favour of discarding the proposal for the limitation of profits. </para>

        <para>Let us study some of the figures that were cited by the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> concerning the loss of -&#39;time due to industrial stoppages. Most of his figures relate to the period during which anti-Labour  governments had control in this Parliament; therefore, the deplorable state of affairs he depicted merely proved conclusively that the great benefits of industrial peace which are now bestowed upon this country have been gained only as the result of the sympathetic handling of the problems of the workers by a Labour government. I, too, have some figures in regard to industrial upheavals, and the honorable gentleman might well study them. During the regime of the Menzies Government, 2,178,702 man-days were lost, an average of 21,152 a week. Under the Fadden Government, .which fortunately lasted for only five and a half weeks, the number of man-days lost was 284,155, an average of 51,664 a week. Under the Curtin Government, the figure is 8,477 a week, showing conclusively that that Government has reduced substantially the loss occasioned by industrial stoppages. Honorable members would attempt to make it appear that whenever there has been an industrial stoppage the workers have been to blame. Why did not the honorable member cite the innumerable instances in which not the man-power department, but industrial tribunals, conciliation commissioners, and other independent authorities had decided that the workers were justified in their complaints and had rectified- them ? </para>
        <para>Let us now consider absenteeism of workers from industry. There has been too much exaggeration of certain features of this matter. The Government regrets that there is too much absenteeism in industry and is always striving to reduce it. The problem is being dealt with scientifically. Officers are making examinations, and interviewing workers in order to ascertain why they absent themselves from their employment. It has been found to be not due to their wanting to be perverse and to embarrass the Government ot- the war effort. Most of them have a legitimate reason for staying away. We are endeavouring to remove the causes of absenteeism. &#39; We believe that the position may be helped by an improvement of industrial welfare. When the honorable member for Wentworth referred to the Department of Labour and National Service, he said: &#34;This is the peace-time policy of the Labour Government.&#34; It is not our peace-time policy, but om- policy for any time, in peace or war. We believe that the best, results in regard to production by the workers can be achieved by having them happy and contented at their work. We discovered that 50 per cent, of the absenteeism was due to ill health. In the majority of instances; the loss was confined to one or two days, due to colds during the winter months. Honorable members opposite argue that improvement of welfare conditions should not be undertaken in war-time. We discovered that in Victoria two factories were working under one management. One was an old factory with very poor facilities for the. workers, the other a modern factory iti which several amenities had been provided. The absenteeism in the older factory was just double what it was in the modern factory. Wo are establishing canteen services, and improving lighting conditions in order to safeguard the health and eyesight of the workers. Honorable members opposite believe that we should leave these matters until after the war. A women&#39;s industrial code is now being considered. Wc are working out a Commonwealth industrial code. The workers are striving to produce the best of which they are capable, in order to assist the war effort. Why should they be denied some consideration? It has already been stated that, although the number of men employed in coal pits has not been increased, the production of coal last year was a record, having been 500,000 tons more than had been produced in any previous year. In regard to steel production, although Australia is relatively only a young country, it produced as much steel per head of  population  this year as was produced in England. Is not that something of which we ought to be proud? Should not this Government be thanked because, in the few months during which it has had control, it has transferred 500,000 people from non-war to what is described, as essential war employment ? Because the pool of available labour has been almost exhausted, the Government is seeking to eke out our labour resources in various ways. To this end, the production executive, consisting of nine members of the Government, framed regulations to control the employment of domestic servants, and what a howl followed ! It was said that the regulations constituted interference with the liberty of the people. As soon as it appeared that certain sections of the community might have to do something for themselves to meet their every-day requirements, that some personal sacrifice would be involved, a campaign was begun in an attempt to jeopardize the existence of the Government. We are now dealing with applications for the right to continue employing domestic servants. 1 shall not give names at this stage, but 1 shall cite a few examples. Let it be remembered that these applications do not come from munitions workers, who, in many instances, must leave their homes early in the morning with a bit of lunch under their arms, and remain away all day. The applications come from people who live in the more &#34;  toney  &#34; parts of our cities. Here is one from Elsternwick for permission to employ twelve servants to look after six inmates. Another from Brighton asks for permission to employ six servants to attend to one inmate. One from Toorak wants six servants for one inmate, and another from Toorak asks for eight servants to attend to two persons. Applications of the same sort have been received from other States besides Victoria. The first one that I pick up from New South Wales seeks permission to employ ten servants to attend to two persons. Some of the reasons given in support of the applications to retain servants would not satisfy even the most hardened tory. We received one application to retain twelve servants to look after six inmates. The applicant said that he had 23 glass houses and conservatories, containing rare orchids, &#38;c, besides extensive lawns. He formerly employed a staff of 23 men and six females, but since the war his staff had been reduced from seventeen to twelve. What a sacrifice ! Those people, and their representatives in Parliament, constantly belittle the efforts of the workers, although the &#39; fact is that we could not fight this war for five minutes if it were not for the workers. Those who try to cause division between the workers in war industries and the workers in uniform are doing the country a grave disservice. So long as the workers know that their sacrifices are helping the men in the fighting services they do not care how much they are asked to do; but they are distrustful of being asked to make sacrifices when they see that all the time the reserves of the big companies are being built up, and monopolies are reaching out for greater power and spheres of influence in all directions. Some of them, with the help of government money, are setting up plant which they hope to secure &#34;for a song &#34; when the war ends. Those big companies look forward to a happy time after the war when all competition will have been crushed. That is the new order which they visualize. I trust that this Government will remain in office, not only for the duration of the war, but also for a long time afterwards, so as to organize the country during the postwar reconstruction period. The honorable member for Wentworth made various charges against the Government regarding its control of man-power. I have been watching the position very closely, and next week I shall be in a position to state the facts regarding the cases he has quoted. I hope that then the honorable member will have the decency to withdraw his charges. As a matter of fact, we have on our files sheafs of applications from members of this Parliament asking for exemption from military service for all classes of men, including accountants, clerks in offices, and dentists. Applications have been received from practically every member of this Parliament. The man-power authorities have been dealing fairly and effectively with all applications received. If a man has a case he is granted exemption. </para>
        <para>The Government has now decided upon a policy of labour direction. The Labour party does not welcome this decision, but it is necessary, having regard to our limited man-power resources. The scheme, when it comes into operation, will apply, not only to the lower ranks of the workers, but also to the executives of big concerns. Although we are so short of man-power, reports have been received that city clubs are still well patronized, even during working hours. The worker cannot leave his job when he likes, but the boss can take time off for his morning cup of tea. He can, when he likes, pick up his golf clubs and go out for a round of golf. The Government proposes to see that there is no waste of labour at the top any more than there is at the bottom. Everything is being done to marshal our man-power resources, but there is always strong opposition whenever a reference is made in Parliament to the need for conscripting wealth. I. can see no reason why we should not conscript wealth. If we will not concede to a man the right to withhold his life from the service of his country, why should we allow any member of the community the right to withhold his wealth from the service of the country? The honorable member for Wentworth said that there should be no interference with management. Here is. an example of how seriously management sometimes takes its responsibilities: just after I became Minister, there was a partial stoppage of work in an important aircraft factory outside Sydney, and I decided that prompt action was necessary. The matter was reported to me on a Saturday morning, and I immediately telephoned to the works and asked for the manager. I was told by the girl on the switch that he was absent, that he did not usually come to the works on Saturday morning. I rang his home, but no one there knew where he was. I rang another private firm in which I knew he was interested, hut was told that he did not go there either on Saturday morning. I then rang the works again, and asked the girl with whom she would get in touch if anything went wrong at the works. She said .that she would ring the gatekeeper ! That is how some of the representatives of .private enterprise have organized themselves for the war effort. We want something better than that. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Johnson)</inline> made a valuable contribution to the debate, and offered some constructive suggestions to the Government. I can assure him that his suggestions for overcoming the difficulties which confront residents of the north-western parts of Australia will be given immediate attention. If any other honorable member has a submission of a helpful character to make to the Government for the better organization of the war effort, it also will be considered. However, I have been waiting patiently to hear honorable members opposite ask for the conscription of wealth, but I have waited in vain. The honorable member for Wentworth said that the Government wanted to force compulsory unionism on the country. I remind the honorable member that the great majority of the soldiers who are defending Australia to-day are unionists without any compulsion having been employed. It seems to be rather peculiar that although honorable members opposite want compulsory membership and compulsory service in certain directions, compulsory unionism is abhorrent to them. They say that compulsory unionism is not desirable in this country, but I contend that unless we have a strong trade union movement when this war ends, the people will be in a&#39; very sorry plight. Our national debt is mounting enormously as successive loans are raised. There is a call for greater services for returned men, and I agree with that. We should give to&#39; the returned men and to their dependants every possible comfort and benefit, but surely honorable members opposite do not think that when the war finishes we can do these things whilst we continue piling up our national debt at the same rate as we are doing while the war is on. It is claimed that a mounting national debt is unavoidable at present, but when Ave  return to peace, there will be a clamour for the restoration of normal conditions, and &#34;normal conditions&#34; will mean the cessation of huge loans. The result will be that the government of the day will be faced  with  increasing claims for the improvement of various services for returned soldiers and other members of the community, and the Government  W111  have to decide whether, in order to meet the annual interest payments upon the national debt, social services will have to be reduced. The granting of increased benefits under those circumstances would be ruled out as being impracticable. When the war of 1914-18 ended did we not have a depression for that very same reason? It is well known that certain members of this Parliament were saying at that time, &#34; We must meet our obligations in regard to our national debt&#34;. The result  Wai  the introduction of the Premiers plan and a consequent slashing of out social services. When this war ends, we must have a strong trade union movement in order to preserve democracy, to preserve the rights of the people, and to see that they are assured of getting some of the benefits of the many sacrifices they are making to bring this war to a successful conclusion. Anything that I can do to assist the building up of a strong trade union movement and the co-operation of that movement with (he Government, I shall do gladly. I am pleased to have had this opportunity to pay a tribute to the trade unionists for their co-operation. I know it will continue, and when I next address this House I hope to be able to announce a further great reduction of absenteeism and stoppages, because if these people are approached in a proper and sympathetic manner, they will co-operate with the Government and with the nation to sec that the best possible war effort is made.. </para>

            <para>- I rise to make a personal explanation. I claim that I have been misrepresented by the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> in regard to my war service. In order to place the matter beyond doubt, I should like to point out, very feelingly, that during the last war the only two members of my family who could, offer their services did so. My brother took part in&#60; the landing at Gallipoli and was subsequently killed while I was on my way overseas. I never served in any unit but a fighting unit. I know nothing of service in a clothing store. I served in the artillery as a sergeant and was constantly with the guns in the firing line. I refused to attend an officers&#39; training school in July, 1918, so that I could remain with the guns and go forward. My body shows the marks of minor wounds. For a while I was blind through gas. That is the service that I have rendered to this country, and I am proud of it. My record may be found in the official handbook in the Parliamentary Library. My family could not have given greater service to the country than it has done, and I challenge the honorable member to stand up to that record. When this war broke out I enlisted again, not in an administrative capacity, but in one of the fighting services, the Second Division Artillery. Subsequently, I was taken into Cabinet and was placed on the regimental reserve, which is an active service reserve the members of which may be called up at any moment. I was informed -that I would not be called for active service as, holding the rank of lieutenant. 1 was too old for service. I joined issue with the authorities on that matter. That fact can be substantiated by the Adjutant-General. I then took up duty in a purely honorary capacity, as liaison officer with the American forces. The fact that that service is purely honorary is shown in my paybook. </para>

          <para>. - I wish to refer to a matter which I raised in the House yesterday, namely, the action taken by a police officer, presumably on the instruction of the Taxation Department, in going to a private home in the absence of the husband taxpayer, and putting a series of questions to the wife relating to the financial circumstances of her husband. I was not able to convey to the Minister in my question all the details that were in my possession,, and I  consider that the matter is of such importance that I take this opportunity to refer to it again. I have no reason to believe that the taxpayer in question has had any difficulties at all with the Taxation Department. It may be that his return has been queried in some respects, hut I have no information on that point at all. So far as I know there is no suggestion of any offence having been committed by him. The incident as it was related to me was as follows: In the course of the morning - obviously at a time when an office executive would be expected to be away from his home - a call was made upon the lady by a police officer in uniform. He presented himself at the door and asked the lady if she was the wife of this man. &#34;When she said that she was, he proceeded to put a number of questions to her regarding her financial circumstances. He asked if she would describe herself as being comfortably off or well-off. Other similar questions were asked. The lady expressed very natural surprise at the interrogation and inquired what it was all about. The police officer said: &#34; I have dozens of these things to do In his hand he had a bundle of pink slips upon which apparently the information that he secured was to be placed. The lady got the impression from him that he was merely doing something in the ordinary course of his activities, at the request of the Taxation Department. Apparently he was interviewing, people and in due course conveying the information that he obtained to the Taxation Department. I do not know who was responsible for this action. It is possible that inquiries of this kind are conducted by officers of the Taxation Department in normal times, but that, in order to save man-power, some arrangements have been made with the police to conduct them. That is the only assumption which I can make from the facts. I shall certainly attack that as a policy if my assumption is correct. It is most reprehensible that &#60;a private home should be visited and that the wife of &#38; taxpayer should be put through this sort of an examination in the absence of &#34;her husband when no offence has been alleged or charge laid in respect of any breach of the taxation laws. I invite the Treasurer to make an examination of this matter. There is a growing fear among members of the public generally - I am sure that the Ministry is aware of it - of the encroachment of bureaucracy into their private lives. I am sure that the Treasurer will agree that even in these days that encroachment should be kept at the absolute minimum. I bring this development to the notice of the Treasurer in the hope that he will be able to obtain a satisfactory explanation. If he finds, however, that the Taxation Department has adopted this method he should take immediate steps to bring the practice to an end. </para>

          <para>. - Yesterday I made a statement regarding the case of Sergeant Pilot Gregor - and part of that statement I feel it my duty to correct. I stated that no appeal had been lodged, and this was based upon information supplied to me yesterday by Air Force Head-quarters. I was informed to-day that a notice- of appeal, dated the 11th January, 1943, was forwarded by Sergeant Gregor&#39;s solicitors to the accused&#39;s former officer commanding at. Narrandera, and subsequently to the training group headquarters concerned. The submission by Sergeant Gregor&#39;s solicitors was not an appeal in the correct sense of the word, as the grounds upon which it was based were not specific enough to enable the matter to be properly examined and considered. As a result of a telephone communication with Sergeant Gregor&#39;s solicitors, they advised that they desired the notice of appeal to be regarded as the actual appeal, and promised to amplify the grounds of appeal to facilitate full consideration by the Air Board. I regret that the information supplied to me earlier was not in accordance with the facts, and have taken steps to ascertain who is responsible for that incorrect advice. The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> and the House may rest assured that steps will be taken to avoid a similar occurrence in the future, and  that, as soon as the additional information required is received from the solicitors, the appeal will be dealt with by the Air Board and a decision expedited. </para>

          <para>. - Work has been commenced on the south-west portion of this building for the purpose of providing additional accommodation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> was good enough to let me see the plans in the presence of the architect this morning. So far as my memory serves me, the present intention is identical with the proposal that was put before me when </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I was  Speaker  in the previous parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby</inline> was the Minister appointed by the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> to investigate this matter of providing additional accommodation. Although I did not agree with everything that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby</inline> suggested, his proposal to build the necessary extra accommodation where the building operations are now proceeding was tentatively agreed to. Members of the then Opposition, who occupied the party room now occupied by the United Australia party, objected to the proposal and asked me to hear their view, which I did. I considered that their objections were justified. I said that, of course, there was a shortage of accommodation, and that additional buildings would have to be provided. The right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> took a leading part in the negotiations. He suggested that I should allow a committee of the Labour party to go into the matter in order that it might make alternative proposals that would provide for the necessary additional accommodation and be more satisfactory generally. That was done, and the result was the erection of an additional wing - that portion now occupied by the library staff. The rooms previously occupied by the library staff were then made available for use by Ministers. My complaint is that a plan identical with the proposal to which objection was taken by the then Opposition is now being carried out. I do not know who is responsible, but I assume that it would be the Minister for the Interior. This plan has . been put into effect without the knowledge of honorable members on this side. The objections raised when the present Government supporters were in opposition were valid then and they are equally valid to-day. The buildings in the course of erection will interfere with the ventilation and lighting of the Opposition party room. Moreover, a new passageway 8 feet wide will reduce the area of the party room. I know as well as every one else that there are difficulties of accommodation. When the Labour party was in opposition and this plan was formerly under consideration the question of privacy also was raised. That applies equally to-day. On the  plan, provision is made for a Ministers&#39; room only 7 feet from the party room. I suggest that a room occupied by a Minister and his staff 7 feet away from where party meetings are held does not provide the necessary privacy. I cannot see how it can be contended, as it has been, that lighting will not be interfered with. I realize that as further additions are made to this building, there will be fewer opportunities to have alternative proposals accepted, but had members of the Opposition known about the present alterations some weeks ago, alternative plans much less objectionable than those now adopted could have been made. It is unfair to the Opposition and to the occupants of the room in question that this work should have been commenced without their knowledge, when it must have been realized that the alterations would be objectionable to them. </para>

          <para>. - I bring to the notice of the Government, and particularly the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> a matter relating to subscriptions to the war loans by groups of employees formed in various factories and on other works. We cannot expect a maximum contribution from employees without adequate co-operation on the part of their employers. I have received a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> Scoble, Dubbo district secretary of the Building Workers Industrial Union of New South Wales who states that he has been directed by the members of the Dubbo branch of the union to bring to my notice the failure of the staff in John Grant and Sons&#39; Dubbo office to co-operate with a committee appointed by the union and other interested local bodies for the purpose of obtaining investors in the &#163;100,000,000 Austerity Loan among the workmen employed on certain government projects in the district, John Grant and Sons being the employing authority of those works. About 360 workers are concerned in the matter. They undertook to make contributions to the loan and to pay deposits at various times according to their capacity to pay. At the meeting of employees held on the 7th December last, &#163;250 was raised, and on the 9th December the committee had in sight &#163;1,100. John Grant and Sons refused to undertake to make the necessary deductions from the pay of the employees on the works, thus reducing to some degree the number of contributions to the loan, because it was anticipated that from &#163;3,000 to &#163;4,000 would have been obtained if the firm had agreed to make the deductions. In my opinion the firm has not acted patriotically. I understand that this is one of many instances in which employers have not been prepared to co-operate with employees in making deductions from wages for the purpose of war loan investments. Possibly many hundreds of thousands of pounds have been lost by way of contributions on that account. I draw the attention of the Government to the lack of co-operation on the part of many large employers, including even those who are engaged in essential war work from which they are making substantial profit. Some action should be taken by the Treasurer to see that, when future war loans are raised, employers are compelled to make deductions from the salaries of their employees in order to comply with the wishes of the committees set up among the various staffs who desire to contribute to the loans. </para>

        <para>Mr.RANKIN (Bendigo) &#91;4.36&#93;.- In view of certain remarks made by the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> on the adjournment of the House on Wednesday, concerning the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> A. Mendes, then of the Mayfair Hotel, Darlinghurst, I feel compelled this afternoon to bring to the notice of the House what appears to be a case of party political favouritism. In support of my statement I propose to relate in chronological order the various incidents con nected with the case. On the 11th September last, I asked the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> whether he would call for the production of the file relating to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mendes,</inline> and table it in Parliament, so that honorable members might investigate the suggestion that a racket was being worked in connexion with exemption from military duty. I asked the Minister whether it had been brought to his notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mendes</inline> had boasted that it had cost him more than &#163;100 to keep out of the Army, and that he had experienced no difficulty in keeping the male staff of the hotel out of the Army. </para>
        <para>Stating that he had no knowledge of the case mentioned, the Minister undertook to call for a report regarding the matter and to advise me of the result. On the 16th September I again asked for the file, and was informed by the Minister that the case in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mendes</inline> applied for exemption from military service on the grounds of great hardship had been before the Central Police Court, Sydney, on the previous day, and it was necessary for the file to be there. He promised to ascertain whether the file could be made available in Canberra on the following day. Thirteen days later, the application by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mendes</inline> for exemption from military service having been dealt with by the court, I again asked the Minister for the complete file. The Minister replied that he would call for the file and that he understood that the Magistrate who considered the case had given <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mendes</inline> six weeks in which to put his affairs in order before entering the Army. Not having heard anything further concerning this matter, I again referred to it in this House on the 3rd October. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> then stated that the Minister for the Army had said that he would send for the file, have a look at it, and decide whether he would lay it on the table. When I put it to the Prime Minister that the Minister for the Army had said that he would lay it on the table, the Prime Minister replied that the file would be laid on the table after the Minister had had a chance to have a look at it. Again, on the 7th October, I put a specific question to the Minister seeking an assurance that before Parliament went into recess he  would table the complete file. The Minister replied in the affirmative. However, up to the time Parliament adjourned on the 9th October, the file had not been made available to me. When the House met for the two-day war session, I raised the question on the 11th December, and asked the Minister to honour his promise to table the file. He replied that lie would make it available. Not having received the file after waiting for a month, it was with some surprise that I heard the honorable member for Reid state in the House on Wednesday last that he had searched the file. Why was access to this file denied to rae, yet allowed to a member of the same party as that of the Minister for the Army? In fact, the honorable member for Reid told the House that in response to a request by him the Minister had made the file available to, him. The honorable member for Reid dealt at some length with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mendes&#39;</inline> application to the magistrate for exemption from military service. He said that my remarks - which after all were not in the nature of a statement, but a request for information - would be likely to have some effect on the magistrate. I cannot do better than quote extracts from the report in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 26th September of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mendes&#39;</inline> application to the Chief Industrial Magistrate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prior.</inline> According to that report, Captain H. A. Henry, for the military authorities, said - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Here is a single man aged 34, Class 1, Fit 1. There is also the fact that he has already had exemption since July, 1941. He has not been singled out. He is only one of many young men caught in the comb-out. If Mendes succeeds in his application, every one will be entitled to an exemption. This application is impudent. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>I draw the attention of the House to Captain Henry&#39;s concluding comment on Mendes&#39; application. Obviously, Captain Henry, who appeared for the military authorities, and who, incidentally, urged a temporary exemption for one week only, must have had good grounds for that statement. A further extract from the report in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> reads - </para>

        </quote>
        <para>The honorable member for Reid asked the Minister to make a statement substantiating what the honorable member had said. I suggest that the Minister should explain to the House why he made available to a member of his own party a file which, up to the present, he has not made available to me, although I have made repeated requests for its production. Actions such as these make me suspicious, and are calculated to leave a bad impression on the public mind. A reasonable inference is that, in this particular case, the Minister for the Army has something to hide. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for Reid said that I should state the name of my informant. I assure the House that, before I made the statement, I satisfied myself that the information was correct, and I have no intention of disclosing my source of information so as to allow Mendes or anybody else to persecute him. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CALWELL</inline>(Melbourne) <inline font-style="italic">\4:A2&#93;.I</inline> direct the attention of the Minister foi1 Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> to the fact that a circular has been issued by the  Deputy  Director of Man Power in Victoria calling upon youths of fifteen years of age to serve in the Shepparton fruit area under conditions laid down in accordance with the National .Security (Man Power) Regulations. Things have come to a sorry pass when a youth of fifteen years of age, on registering for work for the first time, is given no choice by the man-power authorities as to the nature of his employment, but is instructed to proceed to Shepparton, which is more than 100 miles from Melbourne, and remain there under certain prescribed conditions. A boy aged fifteen years should not be taken from his home under such conditions, and discretionary power should be given to the man-power officials, even though the shortage of fruit-pickers be acute. It is doubtful whether even boys of seventeen years of age should be compelled to take the employment which man-power authorities order. Honorable members will agree with me that a boy of fifteen still needs parental control and supervision. He should not be thrown into some encampment or hostel and made to work, even for a fair wage, and then left to his own devices when the job is completed. The man-power authorities in Victoria have been exceeding their authority, and have certainly demonstrated too much zeal in taking these boys into the service of those engaged in the canning of fruit. I make this protest here because this is not a matter which should be reported to the Minister privately. Such practices are likely to increase, unless honorable members protest in Parliament when the subject is brought to their notice. In my view, the question is sufficiently important to warrant ventilation in this chamber, and I hope that publicity will deter Deputy Directors-General of Man Power from taking similar action in future in the course of their duties. </para>

          <para>. -in <inline font-style="italic">reply</inline> - The honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir George Bell)</inline> referred to extensions which the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has directed shall be made to this building. It is perfectly true, as the honorable member said, that the previous Government approved of extensions to the east wing, but that the work was not proceeded with because certain objections were raised. It was believed that an alternative plan could be devised which would completely meet all requirements. The second plan was then proceded with, but with the increasing demand for offices resulting from the war, the existing accommodation is totally inadequate to meet present requirements. This afternoon I inspected the accommodation provided for members of the Opposition parties. I was previously well aware of the nature of that accommodation, and I now say that it is totally inadequate. Particularly is that so with respect to the accommodation provided for the Leader of the Opposition, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, and their staffs. Indeed, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has to direct  his staff to leave his room when he is engaged in an interview. This building was- not designed to meet the present pressure upon it. The advisers of the present Government say to it, as they said to previous governments, that it is not possible to erect an additional storey on the present Parliament House foundations, and therefore it is imperative, if additional accommodation is to be provided, that the plan which was approved by a previous government should be proceeded with. There is now no scope for any alternative plan, as was the case then. </para>

            <para>- I have not previously expressed this view to any one, but my hope is that when the proposed additions on the east side of the building have been completed a similar structure will be proceeded with on the western side, thereby adding another 23 rooms, and making altogether 46 more rooms. It is not practicable to start the two buildings at once. </para>

            <para>- The alternative plan has not provided as much accommodation as will be provided by the plan which is now being proceeded with. The alternative plan which was put forward at that time would not have provided 23 additional rooms. There was a certain re-arrangement of rooms in another part of the building which enabled the alternative plan to suffice for a time. As things now stand, the accommodation in this building is not equal to requirements. The officers in attendance are engaged for long hours under conditions which are not those that we like to impose upon them if any other course be open to us. I need not draw the attention of honorable members to the congestion of the staff in several rooms, as that is already known to them. My belief is that the 23 additional rooms to be provided under this plan, if supplemented by a similar construction on the west side of the building, will meet much more readily than in any other way the present pressure upon the accommodation in this building. It may be said - and I myself have expressed this view - that Parliament House should not be an administrative building at all. If that view were accepted, alternative accommodation would have to be provided away from this building. Previous governments, as well as the present Government, have looked at that matter, and all have been forced to the conviction that the general convenience of members of this Parliament is best served if they are given access to Ministers as rapidly as possible. As Canberra is a place in which honorable members do not reside - the greater proportion of members arrive in &#39;Canberra on the morning of the first sitting day of the week and leave at the finish of the week&#39;s sittings - they impose on Ministers the obligation of dealing with parliamentary business and also a great many administrative matters while the Parliament is  sitting. Therefore, for the mutual convenience of Ministers and members, the additional room can best be provided by increasing the accommodation in this building rather than in some other part of Canberra. </para>

          <para>- The plan which has been accepted was obtained by me on my return to Canberra, by which time a contract for the work had already been let. . From my study of the plan, it appears to me that the proposal does interfere very seriously with the amenities of the Opposition room. A passage will cut off about 8 feet along one end of that room, although I think that an additional room can be made without interfering with the basic plan. Another serious objection is that the room proposed to be provided for Ministers will be altogether too close to the Opposition room, and may interfere with the privacy of that room. I am glad that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> has looked into this matter. During this week-end I hope to have an opportunity to confer with the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> and also with the Prime Minister with a view to seeing whether some more convenient arrangement can be made. </para>

          <para>-  The question of the appointment of press attaches is always kept carefully in mind in the consideration of appropriate staff for all Australian missions abroad. In the case of the United States of America,to which the honorable member&#39;s question is particularly directed, the Commonwealth Government has established in New York City a special news and information bureau. This bureau carries out functions which have, up to the present, made it unnecessary to appoint a special press attache to the Washington Legation, but as a result of the honorable member&#39;s suggestion, the matter will be reconsidered. </para>
