      <para>THE HEAVY TARIFF. </para>
      <para>Birmingham much concerned. </para>
      <para>London, Aug. 22. </para>
      <para>Birmingham commercial men are much concerned at the heavy increases of duty provided for in the Australian Tariff. The Chamber of Commerce has already presented a memorial to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, pointing out the &#34; injustice, hardship, and enormous losses &#34; which exporters would suffer by the Tariff coming into operation without notice, and urging Lord Elgin to ask the Commonwealth Government to postpone its operation for three months. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline>announced in the House of Commons last evening that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, the Commonwealth Treasurer, had stated that he was unable to defer the collection of the new duties. When he heard this statement, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harold</inline> Cox (who for many years acted as secretary to the Cobden Club), shouted excitedly, &#34;Will the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce take this lying down?&#34; </para>
      <para>The  chairman  of the Birmingham chamber declares that in some cases the new duties are prohibitive, and he intends to confer with other chambers throughout Great. Britain as to what action should be taken. </para>
      <para class="block">Has the honorable gentleman read that cablegram, and, if so, does he still hope to deceive British manufacturers as to the sincerity of his expressions of a desire to give them substantial trade preferences? </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir WILLIAM</inline>LYNE. - I have read the cablegram, but I do not know why the members of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce should be disturbed about the new Tariff, seeing that, according to the honorable member, Customs duties must be paid by the people of the country in which they are levied, not by those who export goods to that country. Amongst many statements, true and untrue, regarding the Tariff, I have read that manufacturers in other parts of the world say that if the rates of duty remain unchanged they will have to come here to manufacture. They have, therefore, not much to complain of, seeing that they can get here the raw material to manufacture what they require. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HEDGES.</inline>- I have received a telegram from the Minister of Mines and Railways in Western Australia to the effect that, under the new Tariff, duty amounting to &#163;1,09318s.  9d.  has been charged upon wheels andaxles landed at Fremantle by his Department, whereas the duty under the old Tariff would have been only  &#163;109 14s.  Will the Minister of Trade and Customs inquire into the matter? </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. AUSTIN</inline>CHAPMAN. - Certainly, and I shall inform the honorable member of the result of my inquiry. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. GLYNN.</inline>- In view of the consensus of opinion that the tax upon magazines is a well-meant but mistaken emotional inspiration of the Minister, that the advertisements contained in them are not local and cannot come into competition with local advertising, and that there is no tax on the raw material of genius and talent, even if imported, will the Minister of Trade and Customs, without delay, remove this tax, and allow the public free enjoyment of imported literature? </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. AUSTIN</inline>CHAPMAN.- I would not put my legal knowledge against that of the honorable gentleman, but hemust know that it is not within my power to remove this duty ; that it can be removed only by Parliament. I shall not do anything in the matter until Parliament hasdealt with it. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn.</inline>-  None of the duties which are now being collected has yet the force oflaw. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDONALD</inline>- Will the honorable gentleman make the duty on magazines one of the first items to be dealt with when the Tariff is considered in detail? </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr- AUSTIN</inline>CHAPMAN. - I am afraid that if I proposed to. do so the Committee would say that it should be taken in its proper order. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. LIDDELL.-</inline>Is it a fact that the honorable gentleman has permitted importers to remove advertising matter from magazines with scissors before passing entries for them? </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. AUSTIN</inline>CHAPMAN. - As I explained the other day, the importers of magazines have been allowed to remove certain advertisements in bond, but whether scissors or knives were used, I do not know. </para>

            <para>- With a view to making a personal explanation, I wish to read the following article which appears in this morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> headed, &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Sir W.</inline> Lyne&#39;s Analysis &#34; : - </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Lyne)</inline> has prepared an analysis, showing the variations made in the reports of the Tariff Commission by the Government. This shows that in 542 cases the recommendations of the Tariff Commission have been followed. In these cases, in which the Commission&#39;s recommendations were departed from, the rates have been raised in ninety-three cases, reduced in eight cases, and in six cases varied to fresh bases. These figures represent different rates - not items. Items frequently consist of two or more different rates, and in some instances some of the rates recommended by the Commission under an item have been varied and in others followed. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think it necessary to explain that the reports referred to above are not the reports of the Tariff Commission, but those of the protectionist section of that Commission. Similar paragraphs have appeared in the press from time to time, and to show that the public is misled by them, I wish to read an extract from a letter m regard to the kerosene duty appearing in this morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> in which the writer says - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In the first place, you state that the Tariff Commission recommended that kerosene should be admitted free, but this is not so, as the Royal Commission progress report No. 30, item 84 (see special report No. 28), clearly states: - &#34;We recommend that- kerosene in bulk be admitted free, but that packages containing less than 10 gallons shall be dutiable at 3d. per gallon.&#34; </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Two reports were issued on the subject of kerosene duty, the free-trade section of the Commission recommending that kerosene should be admitted free, as the light of the poor, and the protectionist section recommending a duty under certain conditions. I hope that when future references are made to these reports a distinction will be drawn between the reports of the Commission as a whole, and the reports of its two sections. There seems to be a tendency to ignore the reports of the free-trade section, although the members of that section numbered as many as the members of the protectionist section. </para>

            <para>- I wish to make a personal explanation. When speaking on a motion submitted by the honorable member for Barrier, in reference to patent and proprietary medicines, I stated that a preparation known as &#34; California Syrup of Figs &#34; contained podophyllin. I spoke on the authority of an expert in chemistry. I find he cannot give me the details of the analysis upon which he relied, and I am assured by the representatives of the proprietors that it does not, and never did, contain the drug mentioned. They have also submitted certain analyses of the pre.paration to me. I desire to say that I accept their assurance, and express publicly my regret for a statement which may have done them harm. Had the proposal to have placed upon the bottles the contents of such preparations been- in force, the mistake could never have occurred. </para>

            <para>.- The Acting Prime Minister, in submitting the Tariff proposals of the Government, did not put much information before the Committee, and even when he replied to the criticism of the leader of the Opposition on Wednesday last, he made a statement that was altogether inadequate. When the first Tariff was submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, many honorable members felt that it was not what the people of Australia were entitled to expect, having regard to the promises and statements made by Ministers at the first general election. The Tariff Commission found that it was full of anomalies, and after a careful scrutiny of it, and the taking of much evidence, it made recommendations as to the steps to be taken for their removal. After a close examination of the Tariff now before us, I have come to the conclusion that many anomalies are also to be found in it. Those responsible for its introduction appear to have given very little care and attention to its preparation, and it will be the duty of the Committee to see that the anomalies with which it bristles - and many of which are similar to those which existed under the old Tariff - are removed. I am not in accord with the view expressed by the leader of the Opposition that he recognised that the last general election resulted in a victory for protection so far as the representation of the people in this House was concerned. </para>

              <para>- Victoria is not yet Australia. I am ready to admit that the majority of honorable members returned to this House at the last general election are protectionists, but the issue at that election did not relate to the question of free-trade or protection. The leader of the Opposition himself travelled from one end of Australia to the other and invited free-traders and protectionists to join forces in a fight against Socialism. Many protectionists and free-traders responded to that call, and, therefore, whilst I admit that there is a majority in favour of protection in this House, I do not agree with the leader of the Opposition that the last general election was a victory for protection. . In many of the States the fiscal issue was not raised. </para>

              <para>- Nor was it raised in New South Wales. I hope to prove before I resume my seat, that there is not the slightest justification for such a Tariff as that now before us. Many of those who appeared before the Tariff Commission were absolutely unable to sustain their plea for higher duties. I think that I shall be able to satisfy many honorable members that, on the evidence put before the Commission, as well as on the statement of the Treasurer himself, there is no justification for the adoption of the higher rates of duties affecting some of the most important industries in Australia. I fail to understand why those engaged in our great primary industries, and consumers generally, should be subjected to heavy taxation merely to benefit a few manufacturers in and around Melbourne, Sydney. Adelaide, and other large centres of population in Australia. The evidence submitted to the Commission clearly proved that, in most cases, manufacturers were doing well. Many industries to which these high rates of duty relate are in a flourishing condition, and that being so, there can be no justification for passing a Tariff that will impose&#39; very serious burdens on the primary industries of Australia and the great mass of the community. It will be for those  - who favour this Tariff to prove that under the old rates production has diminished, trade has decreased, employment has fallen off, and wages have been reduced, and that, therefore, the higher duties are necessary. Although the Free-trade Party in this House is in a minority, I trust that they will be able to secure the co-operation of many protectionists in an effort to materially reduce a number of the proposed duties. A perusal of the reports of both sections of the Tariff Commission will, I trust, lead to such a combination. </para>

              <para>- I do not. &#39; I hope that honorable members of the Labour Party who claim that they are more closely identified with the people than are the Opposition, will fight with us in an effort to reduce the duties on food, clothing, and many other commodities used by the masses of the people, and that in this effort we. shall be assisted by honorable members- belonging to other parties in the House.  To those responsible for this Tariff, I. would say that the latest Commonwealth, statistics do not bear out the contentions that under the old Tariff production has diminished, trade has decreased, employment has fallen off, and wages have been reduced. On the contrary, they clearly show that, in connexion with production, trade, employment, and wages, there has been a very material improvement.  Trade is&#39; flourishing, the &#34;number of persons employed is greater now than it was when the first Commonwealth Tariff was introduced, and wages, instead of falling off, show an increase. I heartily agree with the view expressed on Wednesday by the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission, that frequent alterations of the Tariff dislocate trade and disorganize the whole business community, and that we should endeavour, therefore, to so frame the schedule of duties&#39; before u&#187;  as to render it  unnecessary,  for many years, to make further alteration. It is absolutely essential, in the interest of the development of our industries, and the  well-being  of the people, that we should pass a Tariff that will be fair in its incidence to all industries and of an enduring character. </para>

              <para>- We all show an aptitude for giving expression to noble sentiments, and I hope that in this case a majority of honorable members will be prepared to carry into effect the sentiment &#91; have just voiced. It seems to me that the Tariff has been framed for the especial benefit of the manufacturers who failed when before the Tariff Commission to justify their demand for. higher duties. Some time ago. we heard frequently of the strangled industries in and around Melbourne. Meetings of workers at various factories were addressed during the luncheon hour by honorable members of this House, who assured us that various industries were in a very serious condition. Representatives of those industries, when before the Commission, however, absolutely failed to prove that any one of them was being strangled. </para>

              <para>- What they said apparently tickled the ear of the Minister and his colleagues, because in hundreds of instances they have followed the recommendations made by that section of the Commission. The Acting Prime Minister, when speaking in this House on Wednesday, dismissed the reports of the free-trade wing of the Commission with the statement that he &#34; recognised that such reports were in existence.&#34; Before we have dealt finally with the Tariff, he will regret that he has not read them. They are based, not on mere statements contained in circulars issued by manufacturers, but on sworn facts. When the proposed Tariff is fairly and honestly considered in detail, I believe the Acting Prime Minister will find great difficulty in combating the conclusions arrived at by the free-trade members of the Commission. The Tariff fence which the Acting Prime Minister is endeavouring to erect is so high that many honorable members will &#34; jib &#34; at it. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member may apply whatever term he chooses to the proposed Tariff ; but I am satisfied that several rails will have to be taken out of the fence before even the protectionist members of the House are able to surmount it. In the course of our investigations, we found that a large number of the complaints as to the operation of the old Tariff came from one State. It strikes me as rather remarkable that the applicants for higher duties were mostly from Victoria, where a protective policy had been in operation for very many years. It might be thought that, if the&#39; effect Of protection is to establish manufactures, and, as has often been said, to so encourage infant&#39; industries as to, in time, enable them to rely on their own strength, there would not be complaints from a State where high protection had been enjoyed for so long. But we are presented with only another example of what the history of the world has proved time after time, namely, that, once protective duties are imposed, they seldom, if ever, can be removed. When manufacturers are shielded against the competition of the world, they are content to  carry  on with obsolete machinery, and they do not display that energy and push which characterizes those who are exposed to ordinary, industrial competition. When under the Commonwealth there arose Inter-State competition, the Victorian industries, instead of being in that strong stable position which we have been led to believe would be the result of protection, were the subject of the largest number of complaints. Another fact is that very few consumers gave evidence before the Tariff Commission. That was rather unfortunate, considering that the consumers are much the larger body - are, in fact, the bulk of the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- Only one or two; and it is to be regretted that the other side of die picture was not presented more strongly. Since the introduction of the new Tariff, however, a feeling of indignation has been created from one end of Australia to the other against the consequent heavy taxation, more particularly on the necessaries of life. In the evidence given, especially in what used to be the freetrade State of New South Wales, it was clearly pointed out that food, clothing, and other necessaries had, in consequence of the Tariff, been considerably raised in price. As &#34;one result of the Inter-State freetrade established under the Commonwealth Constitution, the output of manufacturers lias enormously increased ; and we found that in the wider area of competition, it was the men with up-to-date equipment, sufficiency of capital, and energy who were taking the lead,- while those to whom I have already referred were falling behind. The evidence of the manufacturers themselves shows that it is not competition from the outside world from which some of them are suffering, but the competition of their fellow citizens within the Commonwealth. This is a point which I trust honorable members will carefully consider when dealing with the Tariff in detail. I hope that honorable members will look closely at the imports and Inter-State transfers ; when I am sure that they will find that those who complain most loudly about the Tariff are not prejudicially affected by increased imports from the outside world, so much as by the competition to which they have to submit in the course of Inter-State trade. At any rate, that is the position which many manufacturers have represented themselves to be in ; although in numerous instances they failed to show any just ground for their complaints. I have already referred to the fact that employment and production increased largely under the old Tariff. There came under our notice, however, one feature which is characteristic of all protective Tariffs, namely, that in some of the manufacturing industries, combinations were being entered into. That was the case particularly in connexion with the candle industry, which is one of the largest in Victoria. We found that a combination had been organized with the view to meeting the demand and regulating prices throughout the Commonwealth. That, as I say, is characteristic of the protective theory ; and we know that in the United States one of the greatest curses has its origin in the trusts that have been formed under the high Tariff. But the American people are now rebelling  and are at this moment fighting against the power of the trusts as strongly as they possibly can. </para>

              <para>- Exactly similar results are following the adoption of protection in. Australia. Then, consumers are called upon to pay very much more for goods manufactured here, in consequence of the heavy cost of distribution. It is not a deal between manufacturers and consumers; but. the middle man comes in, and, in very many instances, practically controls the trade. We found that, in many instances, manufacturers were not receiving the return to which they are entitled, while the consumer was called upon to pay three or four times more than was just for his goods. </para>

              <para>- We found another drawback which is common to every protective Tariff, namely, that, when there; is an attempt to give protection to one  industry, another industry may be very seriously hit. When we protect one industry, we find, it may be, that we have taxed the raw material of five or six other industries; and this is a matter which has to be very seriously considered when we are dealing with the&#39; Tariff in detail. We must take care that what may be the raw materials of several industries are not taxed for the benefit of one industry, but. that they are admitted freely in order that as many people as possible may be employed in production. Some time ago there was a great agitation in regard to what is described as &#34; dumping &#34; ; and it was contended that the practice is very disadvantageous to Australian manufacturers. But, although many manufacturers were examined before the Commission, not one was able to cite a single case in which dumping had occurred in any part of &#39;Australia. It would be thought that after the clamour the representatives of the very men who gave evidence, there would have been proof of at least one instance. </para>

              <para>- The Commission sat for a couple of years, and notices were inserted in the press of the various capitals inviting people to give evidence. The manufacturers all presented themselves with their cut-and-dried cases - they were the interested people, who had something to gain from higher duties - but the great consuming public of Australia, to which we all belong, were not represented. As the honorable member for Perth has said, what is everybody&#39;s business is nobody&#39;s business; and the result was that little or no evidence was given on behalf of the. public. As I said before the honorable&#39; member for Grey entered the Chamber, I felt that omission very keenly. But, of course, the Commission could not summon people to give evidence ; and if they did not present themselves, we could not help it, though in common with, I am sure, all honorable members, we regret the fact. Astc the allegation of dumping, the Commission found that there had been followed in Australia a well-known rule of trade. Australian manufacturers admitted that,  in  the course of trade. large shipments aresent to other countries at a cheaper ratethan that at which they would be sold inthe country of origin, or at a cheaper ratethan would be charged for small parcels. That has been the practice to a considerable extent in the Commonwealth, as shown by the admissions of the manufacturersthemselves; but there was not a tittle of evidence to show that dumping had occurred in connexion with importations intoAustralia. Much has been heard about prejudice against Australian goods, and there is no doubt that in years gone by such prejudice existed. In many instances, however, the Commission found that the prejudice was well founded, owing to the quality and character of the goods manufactured in Australia. We also found that when Australian goodswere up to standard, from the point of. view of quality and price, they were in many instances preferred to imported goods. For example, we were assured by tailors that the produce of Australian woollen mills - when it was up to standard - -was preferred by them to the imported article. In other words, no real prejudiceexists against Australian manufactures so-&#39; long as they conform to the standard of imported manufactures in respect of quality and price. It was -asserted again and again by witnesses who appeared before theCommission that, owing to the rate of wages paid to employes in Australia, and to-, the hours worked by them, local manufacturers were under a great disability ascompared with their oversea competitors. </para>

              <para>- The statement was repeatedly made that owing to the rate of wages paid and the hours of labour worked in Australia, our manufacturers were placed at a distinct disadvantage as compared with their competitors abroad. But it is very significant that the authors of these complaints were extremely unwilling to give definite information to the Commission -in support of their statements. They repeatedly declared that if, by means of the equalization of the rate of wages paid and the hours of labour worked, they were placed upon a level with their competitors abroad, they would be able to successfully compete against the world. In this connexion they made statements of a most reckless character,  but in every instance, when they were subjected to cross-examination by the free-trade section of  the  Commission, it was found that their statements had been grossly exaggerated. They had attempted to bolster up their case by assertions which would npt bear examination. In the whole of the evidence tendered to the Commission, scarcely any proof can be found that the difference alleged to exist between the -wages paid by Australian manufacturers and their oversea competitors does actually exist. Doubtless, some little difference exists, but in every case the statements made in this connexion were proved to have been grossly exaggerated. </para>

              <para>- It is rather singular that manufacturers should have been so un willing to give convincing evidence in support of their contention that their inability to compete with the outside world was due to the higher rate of wages paid to their employes, and to the shorter hours worked by them. By adopting that attitude they robbed themselves of the strongest argument which could have been advanced in &#34; support of their cause. I repeat that their statements could not endure analysis, and that whilst they were under crossexamination we found that the operation of the old Tariff had not prejudicially affected employment. On the contrary, it was patent to all that the duties imposed under that Tariff were sufficiently high to compensate them for any disability under which they laboured in connexion with the rate of wages paid or the hours of labour worked by their employes. Indeed, in very many instances it was found that those duties represented more than the total cost of production. </para>

              <para>- I will refer to that matter presently. I have taken the trouble to select a few items in order to direct pointed attention to the fact that, in many  instances,  the duties imposed under the old Tariff represented more than the total cost of production. The whole basis of the agitation in favour of increased duties was the equalization of .the conditions surrounding the Australia manufacturers and their competitors abroad. Strange to say,  the  countries which were chiefly referred to as cheap-labour countries were those in which protective duties of an extremely high character are operative. Is it not a remarkable circumstance that the countries against which Australian manufacturers desire to be protected are Germany, Belgium, and others, which to-day have in operation some of the highest protective Tariffs in the world? The Government, however, by means of the present Tariff, have not only sought to protect the people of Australia against the low wage countries of Europe, but they have gone out of their way to increase the old duties, in order to exclude the manufactures of England. I ask honorable members whether  protectionists  ought not to be satisfied if the duties levied under the Tariff are of such a character as to equalize the  labour  conditions as between Australia and other countries ? </para>

              <para>- It was the whole basis of the claim of the Melbourne manufacturers for increased duties. Let me take the case of bolts, nuts, and rivets, the manufacture of which is an important industry in Australia. The old duty upon these articles - as will be seen by reference to page  10  of the ninth report of the freetrade section of the Tariff Commission - was  12&#189;  per cent. In connexion with this industry, I should like honorable members to recollect that the chief trouble experienced is not on account of the duty which has been operative, but on account of the limited demand for these goods which exists in Australia. Labour-saving machinery has been introduced in their manufacture, with the result that in a very short time a supply of bolts, nuts, and rivetsmore than sufficient to satisfy the demands of the Commonwealth - can be turned out. Consequently, the machinery has for a certain period to lie idle. The old rate of duty, I repeat, was  12&#189;  per cent. The total wages cost involved in the manufacture of bolts, nuts, and rivets is  20  per cent., and the proposal of the Government is that a  30  per cent, duty shall be imposed upon them, with a  25  per cent, duty uponthose imported from the United Kingdom. I appeal to honorable members to say whether it is fair to levy a duty of  30  per cent, upon bolts, nuts, and rivets, seeing that the wages cost involved in their manufacture is only  20  per cent. ? </para>

            <para>- My next example has reference to the manufacture of nails, which represents another industry of a very extensive character. Official statistics show that under the old Tariff, when the duty on nails was  3s.  per cwt., the local production largely increased, and importation declined, while new factories were opened within the Commonwealth. It was conclusively shown by the evidence given before the Tariff Commission that there is no unfair competition in the nail industry from outside manufacturers. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member does that, we shall be able to deal with his statement. I am speaking from what I know as a member of the Tariff Commission. Despite the fact that the local nail industry has increased and flourished under a duty of  3s.  a cwt., the Government has raised the rates to  5s.  6d. and  5s.  a cwt., which is equivalent to a protection of about  40  per cent, on the price of nails, without taking into account the additional protection afforded by the freight, wharfage, landing and other charges on imported! nails. Furthermore, the cost of the labour employed in the industry is insignificant. Ministers cannot have considered thequestion of cost of labour andnatural protection. Had the Acting Prime Minister, strong protectionist as he is, done so in connexion with any one item, he would have hesitated to propose the increases which have been made. With regard to the duty on ironpipes, cast and wrought, n.e.i. , the Commission found that in Queensland the wages cost of producing such pipes is  10  percent., and in Melbourne, for reasons set out in its reports, about  20  per cent. The old rate of duty was  25  per cent, on wrought iron pipes, but under the present Tariff the rates are  30  and  25  per cent, on both wrought iron and cast iron pipes, there being a preference of  5  per cent, in favour of the British manufacturer. There has been a falling off in the local production of iron pipes, but this has been due to the cessation of Government works.. These pipes are used chiefly in Government undertakings, and the Governments of the States having ceased for a time to carry out works largely requiring the use of iron pipes, the demand for them fell off. It was clearly proved, however, that, notwithstanding this falling off in demand, the local industry has been, and is being, carried on at a profit. That is another instance in which wages cost and natural protection were not considered. With regard to the duty of  50s.  a ton on sheet lead and piping, which, was admitted free under the old Tariff, I would point out that the three witnesses who appeared before the Commission to ask for protection for this industry asked for a duty of from 25s. to 30s. a ton. </para>

              <para>- About 10 per cent. What importations there were came chiefly from Great Britain, and when a free-trade member of the Commission asked one of these three witnesses why he wished for so high a rate as 30s. a ton, he was told that it was merely a sort of &#34;ornamental demonstration of the Empire&#39;s unanimity.&#34; The speeches which have been delivered in support of the Tariff proposals of the Government are a fair sample of what may be regarded as an ornamental demonstration in favour of preference. I was astounded, to hear the honorable &#39; member for Bendigo, after his statements in favour of preferential trade, conclude, his speech the other evening by saying that in no instance . would he vote for a reduction of duty on British goods if their importation would prejudicially affect an Australian manufacture. That was tantamount to a declaration that he is in favour of absolutely excluding British goods from this market, because any importation must prejudicially affect local manufactures. A duty of 30s. a ton being the highest rate asked for the protection of the sheet lead and piping industry, I cannot understand why the  Chairman  and the other three protectionist members of the Commission recommended a duty of 50s., or why the Government has adopted that rate. That will be a matter for both parties to explain and justify. As a matter of fact, the local industry is in a most flourishing condition. .Manufacturers in New South Wales told us that they had flourished under free-trade there, while under the first Commonwealth Tariff they exported to Japan, New Zealand, and other parts of the world. Australia&#39;s exportation of sheet lead increased from 22,611 cwts. in 1901, and 17,429 cwts. in 1902, to 34,629 cwts. in 1905, the importation in 1905 being 5,071 cwts., or, as was. stated by two witnesses, a mere fleabite in comparison with the exportation. Wire netting is an article of which we have heard a good deal lately, particularly in connexion with the recent action of the Premier of New South Wales. The labour employed in the manufacture of wire netting is little and insignificant in comparison! with that employed by the pastoralists and farmers, who have to erect wire netting fences to pre vent their land from being overrun by rabbits. There are hundreds and thousands of men in Australia who have to protect their&#39; holdings from the rabbit pest by means of wire netting fences. Under the old Tariff wire netting was admitted free, but now a duty of 35 and 30 per cent, is being charged on it. The object of this duty is to give an altogether inconsiderable amount of employment. If it is really desired to assist the development of industry, and to benefit the community generally, the Committee will remove this impost, which presses so heavily upon those engaged in our rural industries, whose efforts are the basis of the country&#39;s welfare. Even in the Illawarra district, within the last two or three years, the rabbits have made their presence felt. This week I have received from constituents letters in which it is pointed out that the proposed duties will seriously affect their interests. In three instances have dairy farms in my constituency been abandoned because of the rabbits. I trust that the Committee will not impose a heavy tax upon the primary producers of Australia for the encouragement of an industry which employs little labour. </para>

              <para>- It is in a very flourishing condition. The Acting Prime Minister said on Wednesday that Lysaght Bros., who until recently had been turning out 200 miles of wire netting every week, had increased their output to 400 miles a week, and before long would have a- weekly output of 600 miles. The industry is flourishing, and there is no necessity for a duty. </para>

              <para>- I am not at liberty to mention the names of the merchants to whom I refer, but I do not think they are in the habit of giving orders of the kind suggested by the Postmaster-General. They do not favoursweating such as that which has been so prevalent in Melbourne, or that which I hope the honorable gentleman will endeavour to eradicate from. that great institution - the Postal Department - over which he presides. Having regard to the position which the industry at present occupies, the honorable member for Bendigo&#39;s appeal for the higher duties recommended by the Government was a pitiable one. Those duties are slightly higher than those recommended by the protectionist section of the Commonwealth. I am sure we shall all agree with the honorable member for Bendigo that it is highly desirable that our woollen manufactories should be in a flourishing condition. The evidence put before the Commission shows that they are, and it remains for those who dispute it to submit rebutting evidence. The honorable member for Bendigo said that a high duty was necessary to prevent the Australian market being floodedby the sweepings of the world. As a matter of fact this higher duty is desired simply to prevent the product of British manufacturers - the result of the labour of British workmen - from having a fair opportunity to compete in the. Australian market. Recognising what the mother country has done, and is doing, for us - recognising that she is protecting this Continent, and preserving it to us in order that we may develop our industriesin peace - I am sure that the majority of the people, if appealed to, would declare that, despite the opinions of a few manufacturers to the contrary, the time had not yet come when British manufactures should not be allowed to compete in the Australian market. The  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission said that the Parliament should make a; strong and resoluteendeavour to support this great industry, asserting that &#34; there must be strong protection, with an assurance of its continuance.&#34; Let us see whether this is really necessary. The honorable member based his demand for increased duties upon a summary of the evidence compiled from his own point of view. It is rather remarkable that he should have&#39; omitted from that summary anything approaching a complete statement of the objections that were raised before the Commission to any increase of duty. The free-trade section of the Commission, recognising how imperfectly the facts were stated in the Chairman&#39;s summary, felt it their duty to prepare a separate report on the subject. In passing, I should like to refer briefly to the complaints made from time to time in the press - and more particularly in the Melbourne newspapers - that the reports of the free-trade section of the Commission were belated. We were blamed for failing to submit our reports simultaneously with the presentation of those from the protectionist wing. It should be borne in mind, however, that we had first of all to ascertain the nature of the reports of the protectionist section. Our object was, if possible, to agreewith those reports. We held ourselves perfectly free in every case to consider and to accept anything like a fair summary, or statement of the evidence, prepared by the protectionist wing for submission to the Parliament. We should have been prepared to sign such a report or summary, and to submit our own recommendations . But when we found, as we did in the case of the Chairman&#39;s summary of the. evidence relating to this item that the, objections to increased duties were only briefly and imperfectly stated, we were compelled to draw up separate reports. The unanimity with which a demand for an increased duty in respect of this item was made in the various States was due to action on the part of Victorian manufacturers, who had brought together those interested in the industry in Australia with the object of arranging for a general demand for higher rates of duty. The Victorian and other witnesses asserted that in the absence of higher duties they would not be able to carry on. Let us see how far the actual facts justify such an assertion. In Victoria the industry enjoyed a high rate of duty for many years prior to Federation, and I have here official figures showing the number of hands employed, and the rates of duties prevailing, during a given number of years. In 1878, with a duty of11 per cent., there were 736 hands employed in the industry in this State. In 1881, with a duty of 16&#189; per cent., there were 776 hands employed; in 1886, with a duty of 22 per cent., 780 hands ; in 1887, with a 22 per cent, duty, 704 hands; in 1888, with a 22 per cent, duty, 784 hands; in 1889, with a 33 per cent. duty, 841 hands; in 1890, with a 33 percent, duty, 810 hands; in 1891, with a 33 per cent, duty, 791 hands; and in 1892, with a 44 per cent, duty - the highest that had prevailed - the number of hands fell to 552. </para>

              <para>- Notwithstanding the smiles of the Postmaster-General, we know . that high protective duties do give manufacturers the opportunity to dip into the pockets of the people. If that be not so, why is there a cry of indignation throughout Australia in connexion with the duties which have just been imposed? Is it not because prices have gone up? And intowhose pocket does the money go if not intothat of the manufacturers? Had I been, in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vicars&#39;</inline> place, I should probably have done exactly as he did. </para>

We found that in this industry the Tasmanian manufacturers had suffered much less than those in Victoria. The representatives of the Tasmanian manufacturers declined to join with those who preferred requests for higher duties, and suggested a duty of 20 per cent., as against the higher proposed duty of 25 per cent. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hogarth,</inline> a Tasmanian witness, clearly admitted that prior to Federation he had sent his goods into Victoria and paid a duty of 25 per cent. </para>

              <para>- I do not know howmuch, because the Commission did not inquire into the man&#39;s business, merely- a general question being asked. In any case, can the Postmaster-General inform me how I could possibly find out how much this witness sent in the shape of goods to Victoria ? I have shown what was the position before Federation, and now I desire to give some indication of the state of affairs since Federation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grainger,</inline> the well-known representative of the Ballarat Woollen Mills, admitted to the Commission that, since the inauguration of Inter-State freetrade, his firm had been benefited, and one of the reasons he gave for the improved state of affairs under the lower duty was that they had put more dash .into their business, as the result of a. little competition. Under the old Victorian Tariff there was not the competition which has to be met now, and which compels manufacturers to adopt improved methods. Honorable members will agree that since Inter-State freetrade has roused these manufacturers to  a  sense of their position, that result is, at any rate, a good one. The balance-sheets of the Ballarat Woollen Mills showed a very satisfactory state of affairs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grainger</inline> was confronted by one of the Commission with one of his own balance-sheets ; and it was shown that, with a capital of &#163;30,000, a dividend of 15 per cent, had been paid for several years. An industry which can pay such a dividend cannot be described as struggling or in a strangled condition. In New South Wales the Commonwealth Tariff gave the manufacturers a duty of 15 per cent., but we were informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vicars</inline> that the impost had effected scarcely any change - that under the old system of free-trade he was doing just .as well. A South Australian manufacturer said that he did not regard the progress made in South Australia as due to the Commonwealth duty, but to better methods of business, which they had been compelled to adopt, with satisfactory results. In Tasmania the reduction of duty under the Commonwealth Tariff was from 20 per &#60;:ent. to 15 per cent., and it was admitted that the industry had profited under the lower duty. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hogarth</inline> himself said, using similar expressions to those used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grainger,</inline> the lower Tariff had given the manufacturers a shake-up, and. on- the whole had done them good. That was the result of. the competition which they had to face, causing them, as it did, to adopt better methods of business. According to the honorable member for Bendigo, and the manufacturers who gave evidence, the disabilities under which the latter were alleged to be suffering were unfavorable conditions regarding the buying of raw material, the great initial outlay of capital on buildings and plant, higher wages and shorter hours, local prejudice, and excessive and unfair oversea competition. These were the grounds on which higher duties were claimed, and now let us see how the manufacturers succeeded in substantiating them. In regard to the alleged unfavorable conditions regarding the buying of raw material, it was conclusively proved that the Australian manufacturer is in a better position than his competitor in England. </para>

              <para>- I am glad that the Postmaster-General agrees with me as to that, because it is so seldom that we do agree. The manufacturer here can practically buy wool all the year round ; sales are always going on, so that he need not lay out his money, but may obtain stock as he requires it. In addition he has the advantage of saving freight, insurance, and all those other charges which English purchasers of wool have to pay. There was no direct evidence as to the relative cost of land and buildings in Australia and in England ; but it is more than probable that the cost here is not higher than at Home. In fact, the site for a .factory in England would, in all probability, cost very much more than in Australia. </para>

              <para>- That is a matter on which the honorable member and I must agree to differ. I contend that, in all probability, the&#34; cost of a site in England is greater than it would be in Australia. I come now to the question of the wages paid in the industry. If honorable members will refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Statistical Register of New South&#39; Wales</inline> they will see that it contains a table showing the rate of wages paid in the industry in that State as compared with the rate of wages paid in Victoria. From that table it will be gathered that in New South Wales the average wage is 20s. <inline font-style="italic">56.</inline> as against 20s. 9d. in Victoria. Again, it has been said that in England the wages paid in the  woollen industry are very much less than theyare in New South Wales and Victoria. </para>

That evidence showed that the average wage paid by those mills was respectively 23s. 4d., 24s.1d., and 25s. 8d. per week. </para>

              <para>- The amounts represent the average wage paid in the mills in question. It is, however, only fair to add that the same witness declared that other mills which were engaged upon a lower grade of work paid lower wages. It was a very difficult matter for the Commission to arrive at a proper estimate of the cost of labour in this industry. The conclusion at which we did arrive was that 30 per cent, of the cost of the goods produced was absorbed in labour. I wish to draw special attention to the report of the free-trade section of the Commission upon the alleged disability under which Australian woollen manufacturers labour. After stating that the cost of labour absorbed in the production of woollen goods is approximately 30 per cent., the report states - </para>

            <para>So that for every&#163;100 worth of goods produced in Australia the value of the labour is &#163;30, as against &#163;20 paid by the British manufacturer. &#39;Therefore, on an extreme estimate, the total Australian labour disability is not more than 10 per cent, of the value of the goods produced. Putting it in another way from a protectionist stand-point, and ignoring the natural protection of freights, a duty of 10 per cent, on the goods in question would equalize all the alleged disadvantages of the Australian manufacturer in respect of higher wages and shorter hours. </para>

He did not say that the Australian market was inundated, or had been inundated, with the sweepings of outside markets, but merely that &#34;it was liable to be inundated. Seeing that it had not been inundated under the operation of the old duty, what reason was there for him to suspect - especially in view of the increased employment which had taken place in the industry - that there would be a dumping of goods from abroad.

          <para class="block">I now wish to deal with the important question of adulteration. That aspect of the matter was brought prominently before the Commission, with the result that two investigations were made into the quality of woollen goods locally manufactured, and into the quality of the same class of goods from oversea. The members of the Commission were not satisfied with the result of the first analysis, and consequently a second was made under conditions to which no exception could be taken. It is remarkable - and I do not say it in any spirit of hostility - that it was conclusively proved that the greatest adulteration of woollen goods takes place in Victoria. </para>

            <para>While the evidence on this subject was proceeding, the Customs authorities, at the instance of the Commission, obtained samples of Victorian and of imported flannels in order to institute a comparison between them in the matter of adulteration. The analyses showed that out of thirty-six samples of imported flannels five contained cotton in proportions varying from 28 to 40.4 per cent., while in the case of twentyVictorian samples fifteen contained from 26 to 58 per cent, of cotton. The Commission, on the casting vote of the  Chairman,  decided that the method of obtaining these samples &#34; had failed,&#34; and the Customs Department was requested to secure a second set. Accordingly, the ComptrollerGeneral instructed Detective-Inspector Christie, of the Customs Department, to take steps to obtain these. In his report this officer explained that the mills and others were &#34; on the <inline font-style="italic">qui vive re</inline> samples required,&#34; and as an instance of the difficulties encountered in this connexion wrote :  - &#34; A retail firm doing an extensive business in the city endeavoured, at my request, to get samples of the goods required from each of the mills, but the latter being aware that the firm only dealt in imported woollens, informed them that it would be of no use sending samples, as they were so full up of orders that they could riot supply any fresh orders for some considerable time to come.&#34; However, with the assistance of a lady expert, the samples were eventually obtained. The only difficulty about procuring the samples of imported flannels was that the season for importation was practically over when the order was circulated for the officers to take samples at the various shipping sheds. For over a month the collection went on, and then when the question of ceasing was dealt with in the Department, the following instruction was issued :  - &#34; If the officers notice any importation of very inferior flannel, a sample might be retained, but otherwise no further samples are required.&#34; </para>

              <para>- He supported so few of the recommendations of the free-trade section that I am doubtful on the point. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Victorian Year-Book</inline> of  1903,  the Victorian woollen mills used -  154,388 lbs. cotton in 1899,1 78,332 lbs. cotton in 1900, 250,184 lbs. cotton in 1901, 273,335 lbs. cotton in 1902, 368,749 lbs. cotton in 1903. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Those figures are an evidence that adulteration has been largely practised in Victoria, by the use of cotton in the manufacture of so-called woollen goods. I trust, therefore, that the Government will endeavour to procure the adoption of the recommendation which I have just read, and honorable members seem to indorse, and that all three of our recommendations  in  regard to woollen manufactures will be adopted. A very important part of the woollen industry is the blanket trade. We have been told by writers in the press and by public speakers that the blanket-making industry is being ruined because of the immense importation of blankets, but that statement is not borne out by the following statistics, showing the importations of blankets and blanketing into Australia. These importations, in  1899,  were valued at  , &#163;111,624;  in  1900,  at  &#163;134,233;  in  1901,  at &#163;122,399 ; in  1902,  at  &#163;114,503 ; in 1903, &#163;70,946;  in  1904,  at  &#163;57,720; in 1905,  at  &#163;57,899;  and  in 1906,  at &#163;53,506.As a matter of fact, there has been a great decrease in importations. When I stated some time ago that the woollen mills were not able to fulfil their orders, that statement was received with incredulity ; but this is what the free-trade members of the Tariff Commission have to say on the subject - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The difference between the imports of woollens in 1899 and 1905 - two fairly typical years - is equal to an increase of 34 per cent., and this, in view of the increased prosperity of recent years, cannot be regarded as in any way abnormal. That the Australian woollen manufacturer has enjoyed a large share of this prosperity is notorious. In addition to the evidence of witnesses, we learn, from official and other reliable sources, that for some time back the majority of the woollen mills has been fully employed, many of them running overtime, while their customers are unable to obtain delivery of their orders. </para>

          <para>The free-trade members of the Commission are satisfied, after the fullest investigation of the subject, that what is required to make the woollen industry prosperous and progressive is not higher duties. Unfortunately, it is only too common a thing in Australia, when an industry is not making headway, to immediately appeal to the Government to assist it by means of a bounty or a protective duty, the hundredandone reasons for which the industry is at a standstill being lost sight of, or put on one side. I trust that when the Tariff comes to be dealt with in detail, honorable members will bear in mind that it is not duties that make for the success of industries, but attention to points such as those which we have endeavoured to set out in our reports. </para>

              <para>- I am afraid that the Postmaster-General will find himself in difficulties if he does not refrain from making these statements. The statement that the Denton Hat Mills Company is unable to fulfil orders has been directly challenged by him, and I hope that the honorable member for Brisbane will prove his assertion. I propose now to refer to the item of varnishes. The wages cost in the manufacture of varnishes - and we have to remember that nine-tenths of our imports of varnish come from Great Britain - is less than 20 per cent., while the proposed duty is 2s. per gallon, or 30 per cent., whichever will return the higher duty. It is well known that not much labour is employed in this industry. The degree of labour involved is, probably, smaller than is that associated with any industry of corresponding dimensions. Employment in the trade increased under the old Tariff, so that there is no necessity for raising the duty. Protectionists may well fall into line with free-traders who declare that a duty so far in excess of the actual wages cost might well be lowered. I think it ought to be reduced at least to the wages cost. Then we find that an increased duty has been imposed on candles. A very full report upon the candle-making industry has been submitted by the Tariff Commission. The total labour cost in the finishing; moulding, and packing of candles for mar-. ket, exclusive of making stearine, amounts; to not more than 8 per cent, of the value of the finished product. </para>

              <para>- The industry enjoys a high direct protection in the shape of freights and landing charges. The Government propose that a duty of1&#189;d. per lb. shall be imposed on candles coming from foreign countries, and of1d. per lb. on candles from the United Kingdom. Taking the value of stearine candles at 4d. per lb. - and that is a fair average factory value - the proposed duty in the case of foreign imports is equal to 37&#189; per cent.,. or, in the case of imports from Great Britain, to 25 per cent. This industry is con-, trolled by a combination, which regulates prices in all the States, and it is in a flourishng condition. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Upton,</inline> a wellknown manufacturer in Sydney, told the Commission that he did not want a duty.

              <para>- I have quoted these figures in order to emphasize the point that this item as well as many other items of a similar character, require the closest scrutiny. The honorable member for Bendigo  drew a beautiful picture of the timber industry in Australia, and spoke of his experience in Western Australia, where he saw forests of jarrah and other timbers. I think, however, that he should not have lost sight of the fact that various industries are prejudicially affected by the new duties. I am sure we all hope that our great timber forests will be developed, but we have to remember that the timber in many of the forests of New South Wales and Queensland is almost inaccessible, while in some cases our forests do not comprise the timber that is necessary for certain industries. </para>

              <para>-  That is an excellent timber. It has been said that Queensland pine is unsuitable for butter-boxes. It is perfectly true that its appearance is not so pleasing as is that of the New Zealand pine, and that it is somewhat heavier; but I do not think it is unsuitable. I was present when, before a number of experts - and I claim to know something about butter myself - a Queensland pine butterbox was opened, and it was found that butter which had been packed in it for six months was in a condition equal to that of butter packed in New Zealand pine boxes. </para>

              <para>-  I was about to refer to that point. The dairying industry today is exporting millions of pounds weight of butter, and its success depends upon its export trade. The result of the new Tariff on New Zealand pine has been to increase by 2&#189;d. the cost of every butter- box made of that timber. A butter-box will hold 56&#189; lbs. of butter, and, since tens of thousands of boxes are annually used, the additional cost to the dairy farmer must be a very bigitem. </para>

              <para>- I do not think so. From inquiries which I made when in Queensland, I am satisfied that some time must elapse before that State will becapable of supplying the demand for pine for butter-box making. We have to remember that the dairying industry is by no means stagnant. No industry in Australia has gone ahead so rapidly as has the dairying industry in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland. It is the most progressive in the Commonwealth, and we should be careful not to handicap it. Australia&#39;s remoteness from the markets of the old world, as compared with the position of other countries now sending butter to England, places our dairy farmers at a serious disadvantage. But instead of facilitating them in every way, we are imposing increased duties on the timber required for their butter-boxes, on the wire-netting necessary to protect their holdings, on the salt used in the manufacture of their butter, on the timber and iron with which they build their homes, and on most of the necessaries of life. Whilst the Government are subjecting our dairy farmers to all these disadvantages, . they are absolutely unable by means of a duty to increase by the smallest fraction the price which they obtain for their produce. </para>

              <para>- I now desire to refer to the subject of mining machinery, and to show how absolutely unwarrantable is. the proposal to increase the duty from 12&#189;. per cent, to 35 per cent., in the general. Tariff, and to 25 per cent, as against Great Britain. If these duties are imposed, they will have a very serious and disastrous effect on the mining industry throughout Australia. What is the more important industry at the present time - thegreat mining industry or the mining machinery, industry ? </para>

              <para>- The honorable member is quite right, as I shall shortly show from the figures I shall quote. When the Prime Minister and the Acting Prime Minister were attending the Colonial Conference in England - at which their primary object was to promote preferential tradethe Prime Minister made a statement to the effect that this country is very largely dependent on the export of our raw material, of which mining productions form a part. It is the mining industry, at any rate, which has made Western Australia the country it is at the present time. In the whole of Australia there are 111,714 hands employed in the mining industry, while the value of the plant and machinery is &#163;12,476,177. In the engineering industry, on the other hand, there are only 15,022 hands employed, while the value of the plant and machinery is &#163;1,195,637. There is no question, from a national point of view, which is the more important industry, and the more deserving of support. </para>

              <para>- The mining industry can receive no assistance from a Tariff, and those engaged in it are severely handicapped by the increased price of all the necessaries of life. That applies not only to gold and silver mining, but to the great coal-mining industry of Newcastle, Illawarra, and elsewhere. In ray own constituency there is one of the largest coalmining centres in Australia, and the men are formed into an industrial union consisting of over 2,000 members. The Newcastle and Hunter River district is the great centre of coal mining; and all the thousands of men employed, with their wives and families, so far from being assisted in any way by the Tariff, are, as I have already said, greatly handicapped by the consequent enhanced prices. All their food and clothing, together with the timber and iron of which they build their little homes, are taxed up to the hilt. </para>

It was freely alleged by many witnesses who came before the Tariff Commission that the Tariff was responsible for the falling off in the Australian manufacture of mining machinery ; but the great majority, at any rate, of those witnesses absolutely failed, on cross-examination, to substantiate their position. It was made clear in the evidence that the falling off in this industry was not due to the Tariff but to the following causes, which will be found set out in Progress Report No. 7 of the Commission :  - </para>

          <para>The unsettled condition of the sugar industry had a very damaging effect on the large foundries in Queensland ; and, in consequence of several mines being closed, machinery was transferred to other mines. As to the first cause of the alleged decline in trade, it may be remembered that in Victoria, under the old State Tariff, there was large Government expenditure, and several companies were established, which subsequently went into liquidation, or were absorbed by other firms. It is proved by the evidence of Victorian witnesses that those works were established prior to Federation in order to meet special demands, and were in excess of normal requirements. Large Government locomotive workshops, were also established at Ispwich, Queensland, and on this point we had evidence from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrington,</inline> the manager of the Walker Proprietary Limited, Maryborough. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrington</inline> stated that the opening of the Government workshops had more than anything else a damaging effect on the foundry with which he was connected.

In the Report of the Chief Inspector of Factories for Victoria, 1904, page 27, relating to the iron-moulding trade, it is stated - &#34; Unfortunately, however, owing to the mining industry being for some time at a very low ebb, trade has been very slack, and I found that a large number of men were unemployed.&#39;&#39; </para>

The iron and engineering trade has been very brisk, so much so that some of the shops have been working two shifts to keep up with their orders. Bendigo has to depend on the mining industry for its support. The reason for trade being so good this year is not far to seek, as the mines throughout this district have been very successful during 1905, thereby being able to give a lot of labour to various trades.&#34; </para>

              <para>- I think that is so. The next cause assigned for the depression is the drought and general depression in particular States. Itis common knowledge that there was depression in some of the States in the early period of the first Commonwealth Tariff. The position stood out in bold contrast to the prosperous years experienced immediately prior to Federation, when there was a succession of good seasons. Immediately after the Commonwealth was instituted, however, there was one of the most disastrous droughts which ever overtook Australia, and that was one of the causes for the great falling off in the demand for mining machinery. Another cause,the effects of which were felt most keenly, particularly in Victoria, was InterState trade, which is specially referred to in another report, so that I need not deal with it at the present stage. As to the use of second-hand machinery, I am sure all honorable members connected with mining will bear out the finding of the Commission as follows - </para>

            <para>In the development of mining properties dur ing some five or ten years prior to Federation, a very large quantity of machinery was procured, mainly in the Commonwealth, which, while suitable for surface propositions and the treatment of free milling ore, was discarded when other methods had to be employed, or the mines reached greater depths. In addition, there was a good deal of imported machinery purchased for working severalWestern Australian properties which was&#39; never used. In this way, a large quantity of good machinery was either &#34; scrapped &#34; or sold and removed for working other claims for which it was suited, and, consequently, met the demand which otherwise would have been supplied by new machinery from Australian makers. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>There are, therefore, a variety of factors which account for the depres sion which exists in the mining machinery industry. I venture to think that when honorable members carefully consider the position, they will agree with the free-trade section of the Commission that the depression in the industry is due, not to the operation of the old Tariff, but to the nine different causes enumerated in our report. There is no comparison between the mining and engineering industries, from the stand-point of their value to Australia. In the case of mining machinery, the duty levied under the old Tariff was higher than the average of the State Tariffs in operation prior to Federation. That there is a big future before the mining industryof Western Australia is conceded by every one. </para>

              <para>- Yes. But I wish to make special reference in this connexion to Western Australia. We know that to profitably develop the mines of those States it is essential that up-to-date machineryshall be employed. A large quantity of this machinery cannot be made in Australia. It is subject to patent rights which render that impossible. If opportunities are to be afforded the mining companies to develop their properties at considerable depths, and with low-grade ore, we must permit them to obtain, as freely as possible, the most uptodate machinery available. Many of them have almost reached the stage when it is difficult to carry on operations at a profit, and unless we* allow them to obtain their machinery at the lowest possible price there is no doubt that many of their workmen will be thrown out of employment. </para>

              <para>- It has been clearly provedthat the old Tariff did not operate to the injury of the mining machinery trade. As a matter of fact, several Australian engineering works have been fully employed. It has also been demonstrated that since the first Commonwealth Tariff became law, there has been a great reduction in the imports of mining machinery. Reference to official statistics clearly establishes this fact. </para>

            <para>That, owing to the limited, irregular, and special demands of the mining industry,no plants in Australia are capable of producing all of the machinery required for present-day mining. </para>

          <para class="block">The demand in Australia for certain classes of mining machinery is so limited that it would not pay any company to lay down a plant for its manufacture. I submit that as between these two industries the one which  ought to be supported, if regard be had for our national development, is the great mining industry, in which over &#163;12,000,000 is invested to-day, and in which over 111,000 men are employed, in preference to the mining engineering industry, in which only one-seventh of that amount of capital has been invested, and in which only 15,000 men are employed. I trust that when the item is under consideration, honorable members will realize the position, and see that the mining industry of Australia is given fair play. In the course of the investigations of the Tariff Commission its members discovered many anomalies which both sections desired to get rid of. In this connexion a very extensive report has been compiled, and I feel that the members of the Commission are under a deep obligation to that excellent officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smart,</inline> for the assistance which he and his subordinates rendered us. I venture to say that a number of anomalies will be discovered in connexion with the present Tariff. Already one has been brought to light in the newspapers. It has reference to the cap industry.

            <para>A brief examination of the new Tariff will convince you of this. Under the old scale woollen piece goods, which comprise ourraw material, were dutiable at 15 per cent., while the rate charged on the manufactured article, caps, was 30 per cent. The effect of the new Tariff has been to raise the duty on our raw material, woollen piece goods, to 30 per cent, on the British and 35 per cent, on the foreign article. As against this, the duty on the manufactured article is unchanged, and still remains at 30 per cent, on British goods, with an extra 5 per cent, on those of foreign manufacture Now, manufactured caps are almost exclusively imported from Great Britain, but, on the other hand, we are compelled to go to Germany, Belgium, or France for our raw material, which, in consequence, bears the higher rate of 35 per cent. This means, in a nutshell, that while we have to pay 35 per cent, on the raw material, the manufactured article can be imported  by  paying 30 per cent. </para>

After a careful investigation of all the representations made to us, we found that, as a rule, 12 per cent, would cover the alleged disadvantages of the Australian manufacturer. </para>

              <para>- The duties on British manufactures are so high as to practically prevent their importation into Australia, and the extra 5 per cent, against the foreigner is merely ornamental, and, furthermore, is imposed on many items in regard to which there is no foreign importation. The, duties on mining machinery, textiles, and woollens are so high as to practically prohibit British importations, and it is from Great Britain that in the past such goods have chiefly come. The additional rate of 5 per cent, against the foreigner is a mere make-believe preference to the British manufacturer. I have already pointed out that the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission has announced his intention not to vote for any reduction of duty, even on British goods, whose importation is prejudicial to Australian manufacture, and, as I have said, any importation must be prejudicial to some extent to the local manufacturers of goods of the kinds imported. The duties on British goods are such as will prevent them from competing against local manufacturers in this market. But I shall show the position which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer put before the British people when in England in connexion with the Imperial Conference. It will be found, by referring to page 249 of the Report of the Proceedings of that Conference, that the Prime Minister made use of these words- </para>

              <para>- That arrangement was in existence when the Prime Minister- made the remarks which I have quoted. The Treasurer is reported oni page 336 of the document from which I am quoting to have stated that it was ridiculous to suppose that a duty of 2s. a quarter on wheat would, raise the price of bread ; but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, who ought to know something about the position of the people of England, did not agree with him. The English people do not seem to have forgotten the state of affairs which existed when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Peel took action to remedy the - starving condition of the masses of that - country. They did not believe the honorable gentleman. </para>

              <para>- I have endeavoured to let the people of Australia know what the Acting Prime Minister told the Conference he would endeavour to carry out. I hope that British statesmen will note what is occurring at the present time in the Australian Parliament. Those who posed before the people of Great Britain as ardent supporters of preferential trade were prepared to make glib promises in the old land as to the grand markets that would be opened up for (British manufactures in Australia; but as soon as they returned, they changed their tune, and began at once to pander to the desires of Australian manufacturers, and to yield to the dictates of a section of the press. They have shown themselves utterly unable to rise to the true ideals of Imperial unity ; they have really no idea of the meaning of Imperialism in this connexion. In the old land they talked of uniting the Empire by means of preferential Tariffs, but as soon as they returned to Australia they brought down a Tariff calculated to shut out goods not only from foreign countries, but&#39; from Great Britain herself. I have no hesitation in describing the preferential trade proposals of the Government as a sham, a humbug, and a farce. If they were prepared to grant a substantial measure of preference to Great Britain, why did- they not adopt the suggestion of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission, which showed that a preference on a protectionist basis of 12&#189; per cent, could be granted without injuring Australian industries? Why did they not pull down instead of raise the duties against the products of the mother land? I wish now to know whether the Tariff, as introduced, is to be carried in its entirety or whether the Government are prepared to compromise? </para>

              <para>- It is based on the report of the protectionist section of the Commission. The Tariff is high in places; but who could expect a perfect Tariff, when so many items have to be considered? I do not suppose that any representative House would accept absolutely the recommendations of a Commission. The members of the Commission undoubtedly did their best ; but it is unfair to accuse those who drew up the Tariff now before us of having done so without due consideration. I was much struck by the emphasis which the honorable member for Illawarra laid on the importance of the mining industry. Mining, taken as a whole, seems to me practically a gamble. There is more money put into mining, not only in Australia, but in every other part of the world, than into any other form of gambling. </para>

              <para>- I am glad to observe this solicitude for the worker. It is truly astonishing how careful honorable members opposite appear to be on behalf of the worker; but when there arises any test question as between the worker and the man who desires to sweat him. the sympathy for the worker is all on this side. I have had many years&#39; experience of mining; and I should consider any company very weak-kneed that would be afraid to launch out on a speculation because of duties on mining machinery. Furthermore, the mining industry is not confined to gold or precious metals; and the Tariff is an attempt to develop mining generally. Australia can produce almost any mineral, especially iron and tin, and, though the mining companies may feel the effect of the Tariff a little, the duties will assist other branches of mining, by causing the local production of machinery made from raw materials raised in Australia. We have been told that the last general election was not fought on the fiscal question. That, however, could not be said of my own contest, because the gentleman who opposed me went very solidly for free-trade, as he had done as a member of this House. Personally, I stood for protection as well as for labour. </para>

              <para>- I always considered him a straight man, and I am not saying anything against him. During the election I was asked whether I, as a protectionist, imagined for one moment that I would get any large support on the mining fields, seeing that protection must injure the miners. I know a great many mining fields in New South Wales; and the one question facing the fathers of families there, now that the alluvial fields are worked out, is what to do with their large families in the way of employment. </para>

              <para>- I am pleased to hear that from the honorable member for South Sydney, because it shows that miners are improving in their knowledge, and becoming less selfish.. In the early days of mining in Australia, when everybody was rushing pell mell to make his fortune, I can well understand that all were free-traders. The prospect then was that Australia would become a great mining camp, and must import all its requisites from outside; and, therefore, a miner was consistent in being a free-trader. But I know thousands of men to-day who, although ten or twelve years ago they were free-traders, are now voting steadily for protection. </para>

              <para>- I did &#39;not; in my younger and. more callow days I used to vote on theory - I had dreams such as the honorable member seems to have now. Years ?.go, when I was a student of economics in pure theory, I made the discovery that under one condition only could there be free-trade without injury to the people of Australia. That condition was that there  must  be a system of national co-operation, po that the whole people may own, collectively, the machinery for production and conduct not only their own manufacturing, but also their own distribution. If we had a system of national co-operation, we would not import unless we wished to, seeing that there would be only one importer, and that importer the nation. When I hear honorable members opposite advocating free-trade I ask them whether they will go the whole hog, and support national co-operation? </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member had studied economics he would be seated on this side. There is one important point, which I should like to impress on those honorable members who are such staunch free-traders. We have heard a great cry during the last few weeks about the enormous prices which people have been called upon to pay on account of the Tariff, but I have not heard one word from the Opposition benches as to how this can be remedied. Those honorable members have pointed to one class of robber - the Australian manufacturer. But not a word have we heard from them about the middleman, who is raising the prices of commodities on which no duty has been paid. We have not been told that the middleman, or that the foreign manufacturer, who wants to wipe out our little local manufactures, is a robber. No; the Opposition have discovered one robber, but have left the other two robbers untouched. </para>

              <para>- I tell the honorable member what I should do as a protectionist, but I throw the onus of proof in regard to free-trade on his shoulders, and those of his colleagues. I regret the lamentable absence of argument on the part of the Opposition. I must say, however, that I admire the leader of the Opposition in the stand he has taken on the Tariff. He has decided not to obstruct, but to accept the inevitable and expedite the measure. That shows the common sense of the right honorable member; and I am glad that we are to have no obstruction. However, the right honorable member put forward a plea on behalf of the consumer. &#34; He urged that, while much had been said during the last few months about the manufacturers, nothing had been said on behalf of that great body of people who are consumers. The&#39; right honorable gentleman, however, quite omitted to tell us that nearly the whole of the consumers are producers; and in a protective Tariff we seek to assist all producers. The farmers and miners, on behalf of whom the plea of the -right honorable member was made, are only too willing- to vote for protection, even if they have to pay a little more in living expenses. It is not pretended for one moment that they are to have the benefits of protection without paying for it in some way ; but what they desire is diversity of employment for themselves and children. They desire to see Australia absolutely selfsupporting, which is, after all, the first effective blow to be struck in self defence. In my opinion, the establishment of a thoroughly protective system in Australia is the most important step we can take in defence of the country. If we do not make Australia self-supporting, what is the use of worrying about closer settlement, or about putting people on the land, when it is possible that the country may soon pass out of the hands of the British race into the hands of some invading force of, say, Chinese or Japanese? The farmers and miners, and the people generally, are willing to sacrifice a trifle to avoid such a calamity. The man who says &#39;that protection will cost us nothing - that we are to have absolute cheapness straight off - is, in my opinion, not telling the whole truth. I do not look on protection as a final reform, but merely as a means whereby we may make Australia a country worth living in. I have heard a great deal about dumping to-day. Of course everybody is aware that in America there is a monstrous and abnormal growth in the form of trusts and combines. I know that members of the Opposition are always ready to assure us that these trusts are the result of protection. I admit that they have utilized protection to their own advantage just as they have utilized the weakness of the people, the poverty of the workers, and all the methods known to bad finance to their own aggrandizement. Those Who stand up for freetrade to-day seem to be quite willing to place our industries at the mercy of these trusts. Having read up this question some years ago, I recall the fact that in the early days of American history, Lord Brougham advocated the wholesale dumping of goods into America with a view to crushing its infant industries. As honorable members are aware, these enormous trusts would not hesitate to send millions of pounds worth of goods into this country for the purpose of killing our industries if they were satisfied that they could subsequently recoup themselves by making larger profits. We can find plenty of instances of dumping if we care to look for them. No doubt honorable members upon the Opposition side of the House are just as familiar with them as I am. </para>

              <para>- It suits the honorable member&#39;s purpose very much better to interject that protection is the cause of trusts. I wish to say, especially to the honorable member, that I do not desire to see trusts of any kind established in Australia. I do not wish to see the people robbed, even by our local factories. That is why I am an advocate of the &#34; new protection.&#34; That is why I stand for the protection of the employes and of the public from robbery* either by the manufacturer or the middleman. Another objection urged to a protective policy is that if we close our portsto foreign production, no ships will come here to take away our wool and meat. I have not a very exalted opinion of the Australian who has not a greater faith in the possibilities of his country, especially in&#39; view of the wonderful resources which we possess. I do not think much of the knowledge and foresight of the man who does not believe that in the future Australia willbe able to export her products. What is to prevent her doing so if we adopt a reasonable protective Tariff. Its operation will undoubtedly give our manufacturers a larger turn-over, and a better chance to install more efficient machinery. What then is to prevent Australia from becoming an exporting country? It is not my intention to deal at length with any of the details of the Tariff. I do not believe in a revenue Tariff, neither do I believe in tax-, ing such articles as tea and kerosene, which we cannot produce locally. Nor would I impose a heavy tax upon magazines. </para>

              <para>- We may be able to produce kerosene in Australia, but it seems rather hard that we should tax that article straight away. I should prefer to foster the industry by means of a bonus. I. think that we can well afford to forego any special tax upon kerosene. I am credibly informed that there is a firm in our midst which imports kerosene in bulk, and which tins it, and I do not see why the StandardOil Trust should not do the same thing. J hope that members of the Opposition wilt not take my replies too severely to heart,  because  I recognise .that they are just as earnest in their convictions as I am in mine. I have been forced to become a protectionist by considerations of self-defence. It is all very well for us to be importing millions of pounds&#39; worth of goods annually, but when we recollect that at any time there may be an outbreak of war, and that we may be called upon to stand to our defences, I think we must recognise the need which, exists for making some sacrifices with a view to render the country self-supporting. That is the main line of argument upon which I rely in defending a protective policy. I agree with others that before Australia can accomplish very much in the nature of  closer settlement, she must have diversity of industries, and that the men who have taken up small areas of land must be able to grow something more than wool and wheat. Hand in hand with a protective system must go the idea of closer settlement in the building up of a prosperous population. The one great factor which stands to America to-day is the fact that she has, a mighty home market. She has 80, 000, 000 of people to feed. No matter what war may break out, that market will still be available to her. A few weeks ago I was very much amused in reading an article upon the possibility of an outbreak of war between America and Japan. If those two countries were engaged in an armed conflict, what a magnificent selfsupporting position America would occupy. I can quite imagine that, whilst one fleet of vessels was being destroyed, she would be building another fleet. But in what position should we find ourselves in such an emergency ? We are doing next to nothing in the way of providing an effective means of defence. I recognise that if we are to build up a nation, Australia cannot continue to grow only wool and wheat, and to carry on our minor industries. We must go in for manufacturing, and thereby bring about a dense population. In conclusion, I must express my pleasure at the attitude of gentlemen who - although they have spoken adversely of the party of which I am proud to be a member, although they have said that Australia was being ruined by Labour legislation, and although they have roundly abused this country - have now seen fit to withdraw their calumnies. I hope they will join hands with those who believe that Australia is going to be one of the greatest nations of the earth. I see no reason why they should not unite with us - now that they have ceased to traduce. Australia - in advancing her best material interests. They can most effectivelydo that by assisting us to dispose of the Tariff as soon as possible. </para>

          <para>- This morning, I asked the Minister of Defence certain questions, upon notice, regarding an action taken in the case of Bombardier Lang, of the Royal Australian Artillery. It is my duty, as a representative of the people, to bring before this House any case of injustice which it is within the province of this Parliament to remedy, and it is the duty of Ministers and of honorable members to take notice of the cases which I bring before them. In reply to a question asking if Bombardier Lang had made a complaint about the conduct of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hawker</inline> to the non-commissioned officers under his command, I was told that - </para>

Therefore, I asked if Bombardier Lang subsequently complained to General Gordon, and if he had the right, under the regulations, to make such a complaint. The reply I received was that he had the right, and that - </para>

            <para>- He was advised by me to make representations to a New South Wales member, but, for reasons which I shall give to the honorable member privately, he did not care to do so. It appears that, although under the regulations he had a right to complain to General Gordon, he was put under arrest for doing so, and kept under arrest from the 18th to the 24th April last. I asked if General Gordon has been asked to explain the arrest, but I have received no answer to that question. I was informed that the Commanding Officer investigated the case, and informed Bombardier Lang that he had no cause of complaint. I was also told that- </para>

          <para>The statement that I withdrew the complaint is altogether a misapplication of words. When I was before General Gordon, after his return from the Maitland camp, some days after I had been released, he made a long rambling statement, the meaning of which I took to be that if I let the matter drop I could get anything that I chose to go in for, but if I forced the matter I need not expect a bed of roses while I remained in the Artillery. </para>

            <para>- Yes; and I ask the Minister of Defence to thoroughly inquire into it. It is a matter of mere justice. We have heard a great deal lately about proper military control and discipline, and while I agree that discipline is necessary, we should have as much at the top as at the bottom. The Governor-General in Council having issued certain regulations giving the right to the least influential man in the forces to complain to his State Commandant, it was scandalous to keep Bombardier Lang under arrest for seven days for having made such a complaint. </para>

            <para>- I am prepared to make any reparation possible ; but I am sure that honorable members are willing to concede to military officers the consideration which they extend to other officials. Moreover, members of the House are responsible for the upholding of military discipline, but if every grievance is made public, discipline is impossible. If, instead of bringing matters of this kind before the House, the honorable gentleman would make representations to me, I should be prepared to submit my decision to him, and to any other three members whom he might desire to nominate. We do not desire to make the heads of our Military Department the &#34;Aunt Sallys&#34; of Parliament. </para>

            <para>- No member of Parliament should use his position to do anything detrimental to a Department. Therefore, let the honorable member bring his case before me, and if, when I have dealt with it, he thinks that I have unduly favoured any person, he will have a real ground of complaint. He has already discussed the matter in private with me, and knows that no definite decision has yet been arrived at. Instead of exhausting the Minister&#39;s authority, he has brought the matter before the House. Had I refused to do what the honorable member thinks I ought to have done, he would then have been justified in taking that step. </para>

          <para>.- Two or three weeks ago I brought under the notice of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, who was then Postmaster-General, several matters relating to the Launceston Post Office, and to the postal service generally in Tasmania. The honorable gentleman assured me that he was thinking of sending an officer to Tasmania to inquire into the working of the Department there; but I learn to-day that the postal arrangements are still very unsatisfactory. An honorable member who visited Tasmania some time ago had to wait at the Launceston postoffice for twenty minutes before he could purchase a stamp. This state of affairs has been going on for some time, and I should like to know whether the present PostmasterGeneral will see that improvements are effected as speedily as possible in connexion with the Launceston post-office, and indeed in the service generally throughout Tasmania. </para>

          <para>- The Acting Prime Minister yesterday replied to a question that I put to him with regard to the grantof&#163; 1,000 made to the executive of the Exhibition of Women&#39;s Work. He then stated that, so far as he was aware, only&#163;15 had been paid over. In view of the fact that this grant was made by the Ministry without the authority of Parliament, and, so far as the papers disclose,quite spontaneously, I should like to know whether the Acting Prime Minister will be prepared to cancel the unexpended balance and place the item on the Estimates in order that the opinion of the Parliament may be obtained. There has never been any urgency in regard to the matter. On the admission of the Acting Prime Minister himself, it appears that the grant was made, not to encourage any special effort on the part of the women of Australia, but to defray the cost of bringing exhibits from Europe. </para>

I have received this afternoon reports from New South Wales which, but for the fact that the case is now <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> I should lay upon the table. In the circumstances I do not think it would be proper for me to do so.

            <para>- Yes. I shall try to give honorable members generally the necessary notice. Coming to the question put by the honorable member for Coolgardie, I must confess that I think he is taking a very lively interest in a very small matter. Surely Ministers can be trusted to spend judiciously a sum of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,000?</inline></para>

            <para>- That was an entirely different matter. I gave the honorable member for Coolgardie yesterday an answer with which I had been supplied by the Treasury, and explained why .the money had been sent to London. I pointed out that it was to be expended only in defraying expenses in respect of conveying valuable exhibits from the Continent to London, and that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company would  carry  them thence to Australia free of charge. If there is any surplus in connexion with the exhibition, the money so spent will be refunded. I have reason to believe that there will be a surplus ; everything points to that conclusion. The latest advices obtainable are that only .&#163;15 has yet been expended. </para>

            <para>- They simply show that the Prime Minister had apparently made a promise to some one that a grant would be made for this purpose, and that the secretary of the exhibition wrote to him reminding him of that promise. I hope that the honorable member will not press his objection. I believe that the money paid in this connexion will be refunded to us. If the whole&#163;1,000 is not required for the purpose for which it was granted, it will not be expended. The honorable member for Herbert put a question to me in regard to contract immigrants. There was a mistake in the paper which I laid upon the table some time ago. I think I shall be able to present the true agreement on Tuesday. I do not think that there is any objection to doing so; and I will take care this time that the document is so certified that there cannotbe any mistake, as there was on the last occasion. I regret that an error was made. </para>
