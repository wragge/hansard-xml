          <para>. - Before we proceed to deal with this item, I wish to make a short statement in regard to item 252, concerning which I know there is some feeling that the duties proposed are not exactly what is desirable. Very strong representations having been made to me on the subject, I desire to inform honorable members that when the item is reached, I shall propose that it be negatived so that the goods covered by it will fall into item 253, and be subjected to a lower duty. The specific duty was imposed on the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, but I find that, as it stands, it represents a very high percentage. I thought it well to give the Committee notice of what I intend to do.  Item agreed to. </para>

            <para>- Anything can be made in Australia at a figure. So far no one in Australia has entered upon the manufacture of china, although a 20 per cent, duty, with &#39; an importing cost equal to at least another 25 per cent., should J% a fair temptation to begin it. Until some effort is made to manufacture china in Australia we are, by the imposition of these duties, unnecessarily taxing those who wish to buy china. In the circumstances I am prepared to move that the duty should be 20 per cent., as under the old Tariff. </para>

            <para>- In deciding what the duties on these articles should be it should not be forgotten that the cost of freight, including breakages, amounts to anything from 50 to 100 per cent. Another point of importance is that even the experts have great difficulty in discriminating between china and earthenware. Under the old Victorian Tariff they were dutiable at different rates, but that was -found to be unworkable, and they had to be classed together. As honorable members are, no doubt, aware, we can command the earthenware trade with local manufactures. In all the circumstances I think that duties of 25 and 20 per cent, would meet the case. </para>

          <para>. - I admit that the duties proposed on this item seem somewhat high. The one intention, of course, is to encourage the manufacture of china in Australia, and, in my opinion, it is scandalous that it has not yet been made here. The officers of the Department are very anxious that the duties on items 241 and 243 should be the same ; but in. connexion with some of the articles included in item 243 I do not care to reduce the items to as low a rate as the honorable member for Fawkner suggests. </para>

I have before me a circular from a firm dealing in chin-aware, in which the statement is made that not a single piece of chinaware is made in Australia. I claim the vote of the honorable member for South Sydney on this item, because the honorable member has time and again assured the Committee that  he is opposed to revenue duties, and this is neither more nor less than a revenue duty.

          <para>. - I ani inclined to think that it would be well to reduce the duties on this item to 25 per cent, and 20 per cent., but I should not like honorable members to run away with the impression that it is not likely that china will never be produced in Australia. To suggest such a thing would.be to do an injustice to a budding industry in South Australia, which, I hope and believe, has a very good future before it, although its present prospects are not very bright. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Provis, mining engineer and chemist, and general manager of the Kan-garoo Island Chinastone and Clay Company, informed the Tariff Commission that they had discovered vast deposits of china clay, composed of the finest felspar and silica, and offering reasonable conditions of manufacture. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Provis</inline> was asked with reference to this item, &#34;China, parian and porcelain ware, and mosaic flooring, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> 20 per cent. ,&#34; and gave the following evidence -  56299. What have you to say about that? - T would like to see an increased duty of 10 per cent, on that. 56300. Raising it to 30 per cent. ? - Yes, that would make it 30. 56301. What articles would be included in that? - That would include the whole of the porcelain ware, and the whole of the mosaic flooring. A large quantity of that is introduced into this country, and we can manufacture here. Samples which I have seen manufactured in the State are equally as good as the imported article. We have the materials here and the ability for doing it ; and the work, as far as I have seen it, and as far as I am a judge of these things, is equally as good as the best imported article. 56302. What does china include? - That would he china cups and saucers, dinner sets, and tea set ware, and vases, and so on. </para>

        <para class="block">While my colleagues and myself were convinced that these fine deposits existed there, we recognised that they were in a crude state of development, -and that it would take a large amount of capital&#39; and skilled labour to bring them up&#39; to working, pitch. In the meantime we do not feel justifiedin recommending a high duty, which might for years operate as- a revenue duty, but we think that in time those important deposits will come into&#39; prominence. I mention them now to bring them under the atten tion of the House, and of the country, .in the hope that capitalists and others will give a little attention to them. Probably in a few years it will be quite justifiable to impose the duty now proposed by the Minister, but at present I see no reason lor imposing a duty which will operate only as a revenue duty. </para>

          <para>.- The transport expenses are very heavy in the case of these articles, owing to the great bulk of the packages, the care necessary to be taken in the packing, and the breakages that are constantly taking place. All those considerations pile up the cost tremendously, especially of the finer class of china and porcelain. At the very lowest, the freight and breakage expenses must be put at from  33^  to 50 per cent.  33^  per cent, is the allowance made for freight and breakage in the Doulton, warehouse. That is for good quality material, which, of coUrse would be very liable to fracture. The cheaper and heavier stuff is not so liable to be broken. That cost of  33J  per cent is in itself a very heavy protection for the local manufacture, if it can be undertaken, but there is practically nothing being made here at present of the higher class of these articles, although a little of the delf ware is being made. This is, therefore, a purely revenue duty, and. rates of 15 and 20 per cent, are quite sufficient. We do not want to keep the higher class of china and porcelain out of the homes of the poorer people. If the honorable member for Parramatta persists in his amendment, I will support him. </para>

It is an imported cup, but I bought it in Melbourne. They cannot be made here when they are sent out at a wholesale price of is. 4d. per dozen. They could be made in Sydney and at Brunswick, but it is necessary first to impose a protective duty. </para>

          <para>.  - If any business can stand a little taxation, this one might, as it is well known that in Australia we can obtain any kind of clay that is to be found on the face of the earth. It is only a question of getting the experts to deal with it. If we give the industry a little protection, -we shall get the experts. The other day when I went into a shop to buy a small article, I said &#34; This is not up to the proper standard. It is imported.&#34; The mail replied &#34; If you want anything good you have to import it. You have not got in Australia the experts to deal with this class of. -work.&#34; I asked, &#34; Do you mean that we have nothing good in Australia&#34;? And he replied, &#34;You cannot make anything good in Australia except the people, and they are all good.&#34; I urge the Committee to give this little protection, because it -will not hurt the poor people. The duty proposed would not prejudicially affect poor or working people, who use very little china, and, in fact, do not want it. The sample cup produced by the honorable member for Batman is quite good enough for all practical purposes; and I am just reminded by the honorable member for Fremantle that there was a time when most of us were glad to get a pannikin. A duty on china will be borne bv the rich j and I hope that the Minister will not back down, but will afford proper protection. </para>

          <para>.- When speaking in the general discussion on the Tariff, I referred to the difficulty there is in distinguishing between china and earthenware, and the events of this morning have shown that the statements I made on that occasion were perfectly correct. Several honorable members have asserted that the cup produced by the honorable member for Batman is not china, but it has been pronounced by an expert in the House to be china. This only shows how the public may be imposed on, and how extremely difficult it must be for the Customs officers to distinguish. </para>

            <para>- Quite so; I know perfectly well that a china cup, from any part of the world, cannot be bought for 11/2d. I suppose, however, that honorable members opposite will say that this is a case of dumping. I desire to emphasize my determination not to vote for any revenue duty of 25 per cent. Let those who believe they can make china in Australia get to work. Personally I see no reason why china should not be made here, but the fact remains that the industry has never been begun. In the meantime, there is a duty of 20 per cent., plus a natural protection, consisting of the charges of importation, of at least 50 per cent. If 70 per cent. is not sufficient inducement to people to undertake the manufacture, there must be some other reason why the industry has never been started. </para>

          <para>.- I trust that the Treasurer will consent to the insertion after the word &#34;crucibles&#34; of the words &#34; scorifiers and muffles,&#34; with a view to eliminating them from the next item. These articles were previously upon the free list, and the roasting dishes, assay furnaces, and cupels which are used in association with them are at present included in that category under item 248. Those who haveany knowledge of assaying work know that the heat which has to be generated in assaying furnaces, and to which these crucibles are subjected, is terrific. As a matter of fact, the best crucibles cannot be used often, and many of them not more, than once. In laboratory work it is of the highest importance that the assayer shall have absolute confidence in his materials, because, in the event of his crucible giving way in the furnace, the whole of the assay is lost. It has been stated that in South Australia three men are employed in making these crucibles.I gatherfrom the evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission that the industry has not been started in any other State. </para>

          <para>In Adelaide the manager of the local pottery company asked for a duty of 25per cent. on crucibles, muffles, scorifiers, &#38;c, imported from England, and a higher duty when imported from foreign countries, particularly Japan, where labour is so cheap. These articles are at present free of duty. The company has been carrying on business for six years, merely struggling to live. Unless the industry receives some protection, they were much afraid that they would have togive in to the competition of imported goods. His company has been benefiting the mining companies, which were the chief customers, as the prices of imported crucibles would have been higher but for local competition. . . . The company would employ from twelve to fifteen hands if they had the duty asked for, but at present(November, 1905), employed only three. The business had been started prior to Federation without a duty, but had never prospered. Plumbagocrucibles were preferred to those made from fire clay, but they were very much more expensive. </para>

        <para class="block">If the crucible of local production were equally suitable for the purpose for which such articles are used, is it likely that assayers would prefer to use a very much more expensive crucible? In this connexion, I desire to quote the opinion of a mining man who says- </para>
        <quote>
          <para class="block">On account of crucibles being of bulky nature, and freight charged by measurement, they cost from 30 per cent. to 40 per cent. to import, which in itself is a substantial protection. Local crucibles vary in quality on account of the clay being unsuitable, and being unreliable they are little used. Battersea (Morgan&#39;s) crucibles are imported and used almost exclusively by the mines, the Government laboratories, mints, universities, schools of mines, chief mines, and assayers throughout the Commonwealth and New Zealand ; and in Western Australia crucibles of German manufacture are largely used. These crucibles are also in general use throughout India, China, America, Germany, France, &#38;c. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company and other leading mines specify in their tender sheets &#34; Battersea crucibles.&#34; </para>

        <para>As there are only three men engaged in the production of these crucibles, I contend that we are not justified in penalizing scientific research by imposing a duty of 35 per cent. upon them. </para>

          <para>. - I agree with the honorable member for Kalgoorlie that there ought to be a considerable reduction in the duty on articles to which he has referred. According to the information which 1 have obtained their local manufacture gives very little employment. Some clay crucibles have been manufactured in South Australia, but there are, it is said, only a few men employed at the works. It is estimated that the increased employment which the duty would give at the Stafford manufactory - at Alberton, I think - would range from a few hands to about twelve. The quality of the crucibles is a most important matter in mining, because experts state that they must be so made as to withstand extreme changes of temperature. It is most inexpedient, merely with a view to providing a little more employment, to impose a severe tax on one of the scientific necessaries of a mining company. . I have very apt information on. the subject. It is stated that the cost of importing clay crucibles andsoori tiers is 40 per cent. Therefore, there is a natural protection of 40 per cent. for the local product before a single penny of duty is imposed. For thirty or forty years the best classes of English crucibles have been imported, and have been used not only by mining companies, but also by State Governments for their testing work. In the circumstances I hope that the Minister will consent to a substantial reduction in the duty upon them. My idea is that the duty in the general Tariff should be reduced from 35 to 15 per cent., and that British imports should be made free. </para>

          <para>- I do not think that there is any justification, for imposing a severe duty. If a suggestion is made to divide up the articles embraced in the item, with a view to making some of them free and others subject to a duty of 15 per cent., as recommended by the B section of the Tariff Commission, I will support it. . I do not like to attempt to make a classification, but if a proposal of that kind is made by the Minister, or by any honorable member who has looked into the matter more closely than I have done, it will receive my support. </para>

          <para>.- There is no doubt that in Australia a crucible is  made in which probably the honorable member for Batman has smelted gold, but the difficulty arises in connexion with the refractory ores, which require a verygreat amount of heat. There are practically only a few places in theworld that supply the materials necessary to make crucibles which will withstand the intense heat. to which they are subjected under certain processes. The ordinary crucible spoken of by the honorable member for Batman will always find a local market for the simpler and more easily smelted metals. </para>

For highly scientific work it is absolutely necessary to have these particular crucibles, which, so far as I am aware, are not made in Australia. I understand that the item before the Committee is item 242, but the discussion is really on the next item. I suggest to the Minister that crucibles, tubes, pressure filters, and evaporating dishes for laboratory use, should be made free, and that crucibles, scorifiers, and muffles, which are used for a reduction which does not require very great heat, should be dealt with separately in item 242. Certainly they should not be retained in item 243, which includes &#34; earthenware, brownwareand .stoneware, n.e.i-&#34; on which, of course, a high duty will have to be imposed. </para>

            <para>- I want to get these particular, crucibles made free. This manufacturer imported six skittle  pots, measuring 36 inches by 16 inches, and which cost 14s. each, or . in all, four guineas. By the time they had reached Port Adelaide, with the importing charges added, the cost had run up to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;16 7s.</inline> 2d., without the duty qf 30 per cent. This manufacturer, whose word can be relied on absolutely, has stated that he was not likely to pay <inline font-style="italic">&#163;16</inline> 7s. 2d. for six pots, which cost abroad only four guineas, if he could have obtained them in Australia. They are very unwieldy and awkward things to carry, and therefore the freight is very high. Again, he imported four skittle pots, which cost ns. each, or in all 44s. With the importing charges added that cost was brought up to &#163;,$ 10s. rod., without the landing charges, agency, and the duty at 30 per cent. These crucibles are as much tools of trade which cannot be made here as are bottle moulds which can be made in Australia. But, strange to say, bottle moulds are allowed in free as tools of trade, whilst crucibles are taxed. I would rather see a duty placed on bottle moulds than on crucibles. I think it is clear that these goods would be made in Australia if practicable. </para>

If we shut up the local factories the result will simply be that the importers will put up their prices. I ask the Treasurer npt to give way to the supporters of foreign institutions at the expense of the institutions of their own country. It is strange to me how eagerly honorable members opposite will fight for the interests of the big men. They seem to believe in the survival of the fattest, not in the survival of the fittest. Crucibles better than any that can be made elsewhere are made in Australia. </para>

          <para>. - I have no doubt it is true, as the honorable member for Kalgoorlie says, that most mines in Australia require high-class crucibles. But I am informed that they can be made just as well in Australia as elsewhere. That statement has been made by the honorable member for Bendigo. I am also informed that crucibles are being made in Sydney and Melbourne which are better than those imported to Western Australia. </para>

            <para>- Why is there such a desire to have goods that can be made in Australia imported from abroad? There appears to be a wish to deprive Australian manufacturers of the opportunity of competing in these directions. I can quite understand large companies in Western Australia, having business connexions entirely outside Australia - owned largely in Germany and France - fighting to be enabled to import their supplies from abroad. But I cannot understand an Australian assisting them. </para>

            <para>- My desire is to help the industries concerned as much as I can. The goods mentioned by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie have been included in this item for a special purpose. They were formerly included in another item, but representations have been made from very large centres in the eastern parts of Australia that the goods are being made here. Furthermore, the Tariff Commission has recommended a duty as high as 30 per cent. Thatrecommendation was made after evidence had been taken and weighed. I have been guided in most of. these cases largely by the report of the A division of the Tariff Commission. But I am blamed for taking it as a guide. </para>

            <para>- I am not going to accuse them of doing such a thing. I dare say that the free-trade section of the Commission made just as many recommendations in favour of goods being placed on the free list in the absence of evidence to support such a proposal. If one section resorted to such tactics, no doubt the other section did so. Even if honorable members do not agree to the duty proposed; I think that a substantial duty should be carried. Surely we are not to put aside evidence that crucibles can be made in Australia. I have given way on a good many small items, but I hope that in this case honorable members will be prepared to give Australia a show. </para>

            <para>- No, according to a statement I have seen they are employed at the Alberton works. I believe that there is a plant at Kangaroo Island.  Clay  crucibles may be used four or five times, but those made of plumbago can be used from thirty .to fifty, and in some cases a hundred times. The English crucibles that we import are used there in public departments like the Mint, and also in many of the States of Europe. In the circumstances, while wishing the local industry success, I feel that there is ample justification for the request that these articles should be on the free list* </para>

          <para>.- It was not my intention to speak to this question until the Treasurer urged that we ought, in this case, to give Australia a show. If we desire to do so we certainly ought not to include in this item crucibles made of plumbago, or partly of plumbago, and high-grade assay crucibles. If we do, instead of helping Australia, we shall blight it. As to the remarks made by the Treasurer regarding the Golden Horseshoe mine, I point out that he visited Western Australia during certain festivities, and he had to listen to practically everything that was said. </para>

            <para>- No, a quantity is &#39; imported from the Continent, and chiefly from Marseilles.  I  re mind the Committee that in New South Wales the manufacture of tiles was undertaken without the advantage of any duty at all, and the manufacturers were able to compete with the imported article. I understand from makers of tiles in that State that there is no necessity for an increase of duty. The article- is a cheap one, and the importing charges represent a veryhigh percentage of its value. The duties I suggest would really mean an increase of 10 per cent, on the old Tariff, since the bulk of the roofing tiles are imported from Marseilles, and we should not add more than that, to the cost of building. </para>

            <para>- I do not say that a large quantity is not imported from Great Britain, but I do say that some of these tiles are imported from the Continent. There is really no occasion for an increase of this duty, because the local manufacturers have sufficient protection already. The competition exists, and the local manufacture has been undertaken, even,;in New South Wales, where there was no duty at all. I do not think that we ought to increase these building charges more than we have done already. There are comparatively, few makers of tiles in any one State, and it would be easy for them to arrange for their price to come up to the duty. </para>

          <para>.- I hope the Government will not reduce these rates below. 30 per cent, and 25 .per cent. We reduced the rates in the last item by 5 per cent, too much. According to the schedule supplied to honorable members, ;&#163;i 5,000 worth of these tiles were imported last year. <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs</inline> states &#39;that ^27,000 worth of tiles, n.e.i., and tiles for roofing are imported per annum. The whole of those should be manufactured in Australia, especially in view of the clays we have. </para>

            <para>- Most of the roofing tiles come from France, but about ,&#163;15,000 worth of flooring and other tiles were imported, mostly from Great Britain. Therefore, the proposed duties of 25 per cent, and 20 per cent, would give no increased protection. We should especially encourage the primary industries, and this is distinctly a primary industry. There are earthernware and tiling factories scattered throughout the country districts of Australia. We should make the whole of our roofing tiles. I shall be prepared to move for a duty of 25 per cent., as against the United Kingdom, retaining a duty of 30 per cent, in the General Tariff. </para>

          <para>I think that when a product is manufactured in a foreign country where the conditions are much less expensive, then the competition of that country is not an equitable competition. Touching the matter of these Marseilles tiles, we know that they are manufactured in Marseilles, where the wages range from 15 to 25 francs a week. Here &#39;we have to pay double, or a little more than double. </para>

            <para>- An honorable member who wishes to speak about anything which is not Victorian is scarcely allowed to be heard in this Chamber. It would be a good thing if we could move this Parliament somewhere into the bush. I am sure that members from other parts of Australia will never get a fair deal until we get away from Melbourne. The tiles made in Western Australia are of a very good quality, and I see no reason why Victorians should not be able to make a tile of equal quality, if they have the energy and pluck to undertake the industry without the assistance of Western Australia and Queensland. </para>

          <para>. - I draw attention to the fact that objections raised to the withdrawal of calls for divisions are likely to waste a great deal of time. Such objections are not fair to the Committee. Already we have allowed one or two calls for divisions to be withdrawn by the Treasurer, simply because we desired to expedite matters. Are we to be compelled to go to the honorable member for Riverina and ask him whether we may move an amendment? Is he to be an autocrat, and say, &#34; If you move an amendment I shall force the question to a division &#34; ? Surely an honorable member has a right to move an amendment in order to see whether he can get support ; and it is only reasonable on his part, if the support be not forthcoming to ask that&#39; the call for a division be withdrawn. </para>

            <para>- When the sitting was suspended, I was making a personal explanation concerning statements made by the honorable member for North Sydney and the honorable member for Parramatta, who appear to entertain a decided objection to the exercise by me of the privilege of objecting to the withdrawal of the call for a division when once it has been made. It has been said that I desire to prevent honorable members from moving amendments. I have no such desire. Any honorable member is at liberty to submit whatever proposal he may deem fit. I merely object to the action of some honorable members opposite who, after having disputed the. decision of the Chair in regard to the voices, are in the habit of calling for a division, allowing the bells to be rung, practically occupying the whole of the time that would be absorbed in taking a division, and then asking leave to withdraw their call. </para>

He was examined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> as follows -  53266. Have you never had any idea of going in for the manufacture of fire bricks? - We have got the idea at the present time of going in for fire bricks. We feel convinced it can be done. 53267. If you had a larger market for your present wares, would that assist you in going in for the manufacture of fire bricks? - Yes. 53268. Is there anything else besides these crucibles and fire bricks that the clay is suitable for? - Well, there is the manufacture of other common goods. 53269. If you were thoroughly satisfied in the manufacture of these wares you are doing now, and also of fire bricks, would you go in for the manufacture of other ware ? - Probably ; but we would direct our attention to the manufacture of those lines principally. </para>

            <para>- Fire bricks are also manufactured in Victoria and can be made in various parts of Australia. I fail to see why fire bricks for reverberatory furnaces should be admitted free whilst other fire bricks should be dutiable. How is it possible to distinguish between fire bricks which are intended for reverberatory furnaces and fire bricks which are intended to be used for other purposes ? If these bricks for reverberatory furnaces are to be exempted from duty let us make them free all round. At the present time they are being imported under the pretence that they are to be used for high-class purposes when as a matter of fact they are intended tobe used for all sorts of purposes. I think that reason has been shown for extending some slight protection to the industry. Certainly fire bricks ought not to be placed upon the free list. If we can manufacture earthenware for ordinary pottery purposes, surely we ought to be able to manufacture firebricks. I, therefore, ask the Committee not to omit the item, but, if they think fit, to fix a more moderate duty. </para>

          <para>. - Firebricks are not manufactured in my electorate, but are used there more than, I suppose, in any other electorate. I have been assured by users that the Australian firebrick is the best. I venture to say that, after the next few years, there will be no more necessity to have (the firebrickon the Tariff than there is now to have the ordinary brick. At the present time, however, it is essential that the item should be dutiable, so that we may getall the large ironworks to use Australian firebricks. In the Newport workshops only Australian firebricks are used, and they give great satisfaction. Last week I was in a steel crucible factory in South Melbourne, and five or six persons told me that the Australian firebrick was positively the best, having a longer life and being cheaper. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will retain theduty at  15  per cent. on firebricks. I believe that if any honorable member were to inquire outside, he would find that the price of the article has gone down considerably. </para>

It is stated that after the process in which the scorifier is used is finished -  a small button of lead still remains, but much reduced in size, and still containing all the precious metals. This button is then cupelled A cupel is a small dish made of bone ash, magnesia, or other special material. The cupel is placed in a muffle, and the small button obtained by scorification placed in the cupel. The cupel, being absorbent, soon absorbs all the lead, and a button of gold and silver is then obtained without any lead at all. A scorifier and a cupel are used once only. </para>

            <para>- At all events, as classes vary, people want them made duty free. Within the last few months an ornamental church window was imported for the Church of England, in Adelaide, at a cost of&#163;260, and the duty thereon amounted to no less than&#163;90. Surely, in the interests of art, the Minister is not going to impose a tax on an ornamental church window, which really contributes to the beautifying of a city, to the tune of&#163;90 ? That, in my opinion, is merely protection run mad. Anything which improves public edifices, apart from the fact that they are churches, is a matter in which the community is largely interested. We ought to encourage the use of the highest forms of art, and the only way in which to achieve that object is by having a moderate duty, or noduty. I think that if we omit the word &#34; heraldic&#34; it will cover the case of ornamental church windows. It may also be necessary to strike out the words &#34; or engraved,&#34; and to insert the word &#34;plain&#34; before the words &#34;panes, prisms, and all glass framed with metal,&#34; because, otherwise, ornamental church windows might fall under the latter words. I believe it is the custom of the Department, whenever doubtful construction gives them a chance, to put a tax on any article, however beautiful itmay be. </para>

          <para>.- I hope that the amendment will not be carried. Throughout Australia great complaints were made to the Tariff Commission about ornamental church windows being free. Not only workers, but also manufacturers, asked : Why should ornamental glass for. churches be free any more than glass for mansions? The churches ought tobe able and willing to support Australian manufactures. I see no reason why they, any more than private individuals, should claim exemption from this duty. We all appreciate the beautification of our places of worship, but we need not thereby sacrifice our system of encouraging native industry. I protest against the omission of the word. </para>

            <para>. - I wish to join with the honorable member for Oxley in asking the Treasurer to give special consideration to this item. Items 249 and 250 are really bound up with each other. One is concerned with the raw material of the other. It goes without saying that the bevelled-glass industry is a very large one. Fair wages are paid in some places, and good wages in others. Our desire should be to keep out the cheap stuff made by people working long hours, and for low wages. What I think should be done is to increase the duty under paragraph  a  of the next item, and to make a reduction under paragraphs  c  and  d. </para>

              <para>- Church windows are practically in the same category as statuary and oil paintings. They are a most valuable means of education, especially for those who cannot afford to travel and admire works of art in foreign countries. I understand that the words &#34;panes, prisms, and all glass framed with metal &#34; in this item refer to cellar lights which are used in pavements, and which, I am informed, are not made in Australia. That being so, I think that the duty upon them is excessive. With the exception of those lights the item relates to glass worked up. I admit that such work is carried on in the Commonwealth, but whilst the silverers and bevellers may ask for a high protective duty, those engaged in all branches of the industry do not. To illustrate the fallacy of high protective duties, I would point out that under free-trade in New South Wales, in 1900 no less than 183 hands were employed in this industry, whilst in Victoria, notwithstanding its thirty years of protection, only eighty-seven hands were so engaged. </para>

The next item comprises the raw material of the beveller and the silverer, who are engaged in the manufacture of mirrors for furniture and decorative purposes. I do not ask the Treasurer to postpone this item, but I think that if he would agree to exempt up to certain sizes the glass included in the next item, the Committee would be prepared to vote for a higher duty on glass exceeding in size  25  superficial feet. </para>

If there be anything in the representations constantly made in this Chamber as to what constitutes the raw material of an industry, then unquestionably glass of certain sizes is the raw material of the silverer and the beveller. I would urge the Treasurer to agree to the suggestion that that phase of the question should be reconsidered by him at a later stage. I wish now to refer more particularly to the duty on stained-glass windows. </para>

              <para>-  I am assured by experts that the quality of glass used for these purposes cannot be made here. As for glass painting for. church and domestic purposes I claim that, with the exception of the work of some men of world-wide reputation, our productions cannot be beaten. I recognise, of course, that the highest class of church windows come only from one centre, but artistic work, such as that of the writer who has addressed me on this subject, and who is known in all the States as one of the most artistic stainedglass workers in the Commonwealth, ought to be encouraged. This gentleman complains, with justice, that the departmental arrangement is anomalous. I submit that the matter deserves the attention of the Minister, and whilst I certainly shall not favour the high duty proposed, I do not think we should be justified in allowing this glass to come in free, seeing that we have an opportunity to encourage the artistic work now being carried on inour midst. </para>

              <para>- The matter is one on which the officers of the Department can advise the honorable gentleman ; but I still think that the word &#34;or&#34; is necessary. I rose principally to object to the proposal to put heraldic glass and stained glass for windows on the free list. There are men engaged in the industry in Sydney and Melbourne, and, I think, also in the capitals of the other States, and it would be most unfair to call upon them to pay duty on the paints and pigments and other materials they use without giving them protection to at least the same extent in respect of the finished article. I suppose that we all desire to see our churches beautified,, but a slight increase in the cost of stained-glass windows, due to a duty for the protection of the local industry, would not prevent people interested in church decoration from purchasing beautiful windows. </para>

            <para>. - The matter is one for the Committee to deal with ; but, personally, I may. say at once that I believe that works of art should be admitted free. I do not care for what purpose they are imported, if they are real works of art, and not simply replicas, I do not see why they should not be admitted free, as they have been heretofore. What I told the honorable member for Angas was that I did not think this was the place in which to deal with the question. Previously these articles have been included amongst those exempt under departmental by-laws, and I think that is the proper place for them. I have not said that they will be included amongst those exemptions, but I admit that my feeling is in that direction. </para>

It is quite true, as the honorable member for South Sydney has said, that thereare a number of people engaged in the stained-glass industry in the Commonwealth ; but I never yet heard of any artist in Australia asking for protective duties with the object of keeping out works of art. </para>

          <para>Mr.HUTCHISON.- I challenge the honorable member to point to any stainedglass window in Australia at the present time a replica of which cannot be made in the Commonwealth. It must not be forgotten that in the stained-glass window industry the artists are not the only persons employed. The industry gives a great deal of employment to ordinary workmen. I am astonished at the Treasurer giving in this matter a promise which would have the effect of destroying a flourishing industry giving considerable employment, and which would also prevent the development in the Commonwealth of the higher class of art in this line. </para>

Any one who knowsmuch about the subject will indorse what I say, when I tell the honorable member that he makes a very great mistake if he supposes that we have artists in this country at the present time who can turn out the ecclesiastical or heraldicglass work which is at present being produced in the Old Country. The heraldic glass work might not be so difficult, since it is generally designed from coats-of-arms, and is more in the nature of a copy, but there is no doubt that the highest class of ecclesiastical glass work could not be produced here. </para>

              <para>- Young artists in oil and water-colour painting come here from the Old Country in the same way, but we could not get aLeighton, a Millais, or an Alma Tadema, or men of that rank to come out to Australia, becausethey can secure prices for their work in Great Britain which Australian people would not dream of giving. It is very difficult for an artist in Australia to obtain &#163;50 for a painting. Yet we find that a man like Corot for his &#34;Bent Tree,&#34; of which there is a copy in Europe, gets &#163;5,600. </para>

              <para>- I submit, sir, that there is a very close analogy from the artistic point of view between literature, sculpture, painting, and stained-glass work of the kind with which we are dealing. I invite the honorable member for Hindmarsh to inquire into the matter. He will find literature on the subject in our Library to convince him of the truth of what I have said. Some of the greatest artistsengaged in this work in England obtain hundreds of guineas for a set of glass windows. To say that we could do such work here is to claim that we have a Millais, an Alma Tadema, or a Leighton amongst Australian artists. </para>

            <para>.- I should like to suggest to the Treasurer that if we are to give special consideration to stained glass windows for churches instead of putting them on the free list, it would be better to include them in a special line at a lower rate of duty. What I want to urge is that our local artists who are ambitious to do good work of this kind should at least be given a protection equivalent to the extra price they are called upon to pay on the materials they use as a result of the duties imposed on those materials. The matter should be dealt with in a way which would not prejudice local artists in this line. </para>

            <para>. - I agree in a large measure with the honorable member for South Sydney, that if there is any virtue in a protective policy the artists engaged on this kind of work are entitled to some benefit from it, but I would urge very strongly that as the disadvantages of the protective policy undoubtedly apply to them to a certain degree steps should be taken to insure that they are not penalized. There is no doubt that they have to pay to some extent on their raw material. It maybe a comparatively small amount, but still the fact remains, and I take it that even free-traders would be willing to level up that difference. The object of the freetrade section of the Tariff Commission has always been to level up any disadvantages that may exist in connexion with an industry in this country carried on by importations of materials from abroad. </para>

              <para>- I was going to suggest that 15 per cent, would be a fair thing. The honorable member for Parkes was a little too dogmatic in saying that there were no artists in Australia capable of turning out the high quality of work of this kind that is produced in other parts of the world. I know one artist in stained glass work who had to come to Australia for the benefit of his health. He previously occupied a very high position in a firm that has a world-wide reputation for this work. That is only one instance. I am sure that there are a good many other artists who are  prepared  to turn out good work if they are only given the opportunity. The Minister would be well advised to adopt 15 per cent, as a fair compromise in existing circumstances. </para>

            <para>-34J. - The honorable member for Perth, rather than the honorable member for Parkes, has stretched matters. He cites the case of a sick artist who has come out here and who once was employed in producing these windows at Home. But does the honorable member base any serious argument on an incident of that kind? The fact remains that we have not the same high quality of skill - I am speaking only of the highest and best work - as can be found in the rest of the world.  I do not think that any Australian, unless a very presumptuous one, would claim that we have. We may hope in the course of time to acquire it. </para>

              <para>- Does the honorable member suggest that we should protect our artist because he is paid higher rates for his work than are the pauper artists&#39; of the Old Country? I am afraid the parallel does not apply. The value of these works of art is the value of the skill and ability which the artist puts into them. Therefore the cost of the raw material would not come to even a quarter or a half per cent. The value of works of art of this kind is what &#39;is known economically as the value arising from the cost of production. The duty on the raw material is not worth considering, and it is absurd to urge it as a. reason for imposing a duty of 15 per cent, on works of art of this kind. </para>

            <para>.- I thought that when the honorable member for Angas withdrew his amendment, the discussion on stained glass windows would end, and that we should deal with bevelled glass and other articles included in this item. I hope that the Minister will not reduce any proposed duty with reference&#39; to glass. We want protection for all industries. We hear the argument time after time that certain things are not being produced in Australia^ Anything can be produced in Australia that is produced in any other part of the world if we  only  hold out inducements for those skilled in particular industries to come here arid establish them. That is how America has made herself great in a short time. Surely we in Australia have confidence enough in our country to believe that the same thing can be done here. I hope the Minister will stand firm on this question, and that there will not be this paring &#34;away of proposed duties in order to satisfy a few individuals who badger honorable members about their own particular industries, and do  not  look at the good of the whole country. That is one of the evils in connexion with people coming here, and canvassing for particular industries.&#39; Some people want protection foi cordials, and free-trade in bottles and corks. If we in this Parliament are to do justice to the interests of the Commonwealth, we must, look to the good of the whole of Australia, and not of particular industries only. That is the way in which I regard the question of the duties on glass. As good church&#39; windows can be made in Australia as any that .we have here at present. Of course, there may be better ones in other parts of the world, but I have not been there to see them.  So far as concerns works of art, it might be a good thing  tor Australia if such, productions as &#34; The Bent Tree,&#34; for which over <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5&#62;000 was</inline> paid, were shut out altogether. </para>

              <para>- If they are not works of art they should not be admitted free. I will not support a proposal to admit free anything, but works of art. I shall move nothing in- regard to this particular class of work, but will give the Committee an opportunity to decide regarding it in considering the exemptions. That seems to me to be the best course to take. </para>

            <para>.- The Committee looks for guidance to the Treasurer, but fails to &#34;get it. He does not know whether the duty is to be 15 per cent. , or the 30 per cent, proposed by himself, or whether the article is to be free. My desire is to have a duty of 30 per cent., because I think these ecclesiastical windows can be made in Australia, and made well. At Melton, in Victoria, there is a little church, the erection of which has been largely assisted by the Staughton family, and where only &#39; Australian stained glass is used in the windows. The honorable member for Laanecoorie will bear me out when I say that the windows in that church are really artistic, and a credit to the country. Australian men are being trained in this art, and they make studies of the great paintings of the Old World. Although we may not have an Alma Tadema or a Millais amongst us, we have some very thoughtful and gifted students. The work of such men as Alma Tadema and Millais never reaches Australia; but is devoted to the cathedrals of the Old Country which are supported largely bv a- wealthy leisured class. There is not the slightest doubt, however, that Australian art in ecclesiastical windows can hold its place, and I am pleased to say that the artists are beginning to study Australian floraand fauna as a means of decoration. We have all heard of  Corot&#39;  s &#34; Bent Tree &#34; ; but that is a French tree. What would Corot have done with an Australian gumtree ? The great majority of our people are not so fortunate as the honorable member for North Sydney, who may take a trip to the Old Country occasionally - they have to study their art in the Australian fields and the bush. What is the good of a picture of a bent tree from France? It is our duty to encourage our own artists to paint works from Australian nature, so that people can compare the artist&#39;s genius with their knowledge of the living tree. As to ecclesiastical windows, we are producing no saints in Australia, although I am reminded we have amongst us a &#34;Holy Joe,&#34; and though not our own St. George and the Dragon, we have Johnson and the Alligator. </para>

            <para>- I have already stated my intentions in this connexion. I ask the honorable member for South Sydney to withdraw his amendment, and I will give him an opportunity of testing the feeling of the Committee upon this question at a later stage. Personally, I am in favour of these windows being admitted free, and I feel that I am bound by my promise. I think that it is very unfair for the honorable member to place me in the position which I now occupy. I was asked to move this amendment, and I declined to do so. I do not think that this is the proper place to insert it. If the Committee decide that stained windows shall be free, well and good; but ifthey decide otherwise we ought to retain the duty at 30 per cent. I am quite prepared to do either, but I am not willing to go half-way. </para>

              <para>- I thought that the honorable member was a free-trader. Under the old Tariff, stained glass windows for churches or public institutions were admitted free, under departmental by-law. If the honorable member for South Sydney persisits in his amendment, of course a vote must be taken upon it, but I would regard it as a great favour if he would withdraw his proposal, and allow the matter to remain in abeyance till we come to deal with the question of exemptions. Then, if it is necessary to go back to this item and to take a vote upon the question of the imposition of a lower duty, I will give him the opportunity to do so. </para>

            <para>.- I did intend to object to the withdrawal of the amendment. After the long debate which has taken place, it seems most undesirable to revive the matter when we come to deal with the question of exemptions. The fact that both sections of the Tariff Commission have recommended the removal of stained glass windows from the free list is a strong reason why they should be eliminated from that category. </para>

            <para>.- I do not suggest that there is no foundation for the complaints made by the workers in this trade. I admit that they appear to be unduly penalized in regard to their raw material. We must recollect that they chiefly use the smaller sizes of glass, the freight upon which is as high as if not higher than the freight charged upon the larger sizes. They have also to cut away portions of the glass, and to sell those portions at a ridiculously small price. There is some reason therefore why their raw material should be admitted free. But the proposal of the honorable member for Yarra appears to go beyond what is asked by the Victorian bevellers and glass-workers. They say that they desire polished and patent plate up to 12 superficial feet to be admitted free. They further request that a duty shall be levied upon all glass in furniture. Whilst I am prepared to exempt their raw material from duty up to a reasonable size, I think that their other request is not a desirable one to grant. If the Customs authorities have to open up all furniture imported, and to measure the area of glass which it contains, the task will be a constant source of trouble alike to the officials and importers. Moreover, it will frequently cause injury to the articles imported. </para>

What they spoke of was the omission of the items under 12 superficial feet, and I concluded that it was their raw material up to that measurement which they wanted made free. If the honorable member for Yarra can say that it is up to 25 superficial feet that they want their raw material made free, I shall accept his statement. </para>

Immediately the Minister made that concession, the whole recommendations of the A section of the Commission tumbled down. Now, I am not going to allow these duties to be reduced in this manner without making an effort to assist the industry. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr. R.</inline>J. Connolly, a Sydney manufacturer, made a special appeal for increased duties on flint glassware, such as lamp chimneys, confectioners&#39; show cases, and railway glassware as used in carriage lamps and telegraph glassware as used for electrical cells. He claimed just those concessions which the Minister abandoned under this heading. Now, however, the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty has also been reduced from 35 to 25 per cent. Not content with that, the free-trade party, assisted by a few so-called  protectionists, are endeavouring to reduce the duty to a still lower standard on goods imported from Great Britain. </para>

              <para>- But what is proposed now is a duty of 20 per cent. The whole scheme, in fact, has been smashed up. I strongly object to any further reduction, even in favour of British goods. I should have been prepared to agree to a concession, provided flint glassware had been maintained upon the higher standard, with fixed measurement duties. But as all the duties are absorbed under this heading now, I think it would be a great mistake to make a further reduction. </para>

            <para>.- The honorable member for Bendigo has referred to the elaborate report of the A section of the Tariff Commission on glassware. The B section on account of lack of time did not furnish anything in the nature of a report. Nevertheless, our recommendations are based on a fair analysis of the evidence. I make bold to say that the recommendations of the A section are not based on the evidence as a whole. Emphasis has been laid on a certain portion of it, and other phases of the evidence, equally important in my opinion, have been altogether ignored. There is no doubt about the high duties proposed by the A section in this respect. Added to the high cost of importing these goods into Australia, those duties would, in my opinion, exceed even the necessities of prohibition. I hold in my hand documents which show that in the case of typical instances in glassware the cost of importation is as high as165 per cent. With the duties as proposed the total would be 355 ner cent. Surely that is protection absolutely run mad. If the honorable member for Bendigo is not a prohibitionist, I take it that he must come down very considerably from those high duties in order to reach that level of moderation which he claims he always had before him in framing his recommendations. I have before me the cost book of an importing firm.I have been sufficiently in touch with evidence on fiscal matters to be very incredulous unless I have absolute proof, and when statements with regard to the cost of importing glassware were put before me, I wanted proof. The firm in question has supplied me with its cost book. I have taken the trouble to verify the facts contained in the papers that have been supplied to honorable members by entries in the cost book. I find that the facts are identical in every respect. There can be no question that a gross and unnecessary duty is being added to the high charges of importation, which will make the carrying on of this industry only possible at enormous disadvantage. If there is any vitality in the Australian glassware industry at all, it ought to be able to carry on without any duty, the cost of importation being so high. There is another cost which has not been included in these amounts. I allude to breakages, which, I believe, run up to about 10 per cent. That percentage has to be added on to the 355 per cent. to find the total charges under the existing scheme of the Government. I am satisfied that these duties are so unnecessarily high that reasonable protectionists cannot indorse them. I feel sure that they can be reduced with considerable advantage to the community as a whole, and without any disadvantage to the glassware industry in Australia if it is being conducted on anything like a commercial basis. </para>

Now, he tells us that he himself would have objectedto the transfer except that he thought that the proposed duty of 35 per cent. was going to be carried. The Treasurer&#39;s real reason &#34;for the transfer of the articles from one item to another was that he was absolutely ashamed of the item as it stood. The measurement duty was at an exorbitant rate. Neither the honorable member for Bendigo nor the Treasurer could have defended it. The heaviest impost was placed upon the cheapest class of articles. </para>

              <para>- Assuming the natural protection to be only 80 per cent., or half of what it really is, the additional 25 per cent. which the Committee has allowed gives the local manufacturer a very fair protection. I intend to vote for a duty of 20 per cent. against British importations, because I do not think that the Treasurer should go back on his avowed policy of preference to Great Britain: So far as the honorable member for Bendigo is concerned, as he did not object to the removal of the measurement duties, he has only got himself to blame for the position in which he finds himself. The Committee has voted the 25 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. </para>

            <para>.- I wish to point out to the Committee that, while we have negatived item 252, the glassware  therein specified is now dutiable as &#34; glassware, n.e.i.,&#34; under item 253. The honorable member for Bendigo has spoken about the need for high protection, but, as a matter of fact, the natural protection to the local makers is very heavy. The cost of importing ruby and coloured lamp globes, which are not made here, comes to 107 per. cent. The cost of importing lamp chimneys is 165 per cent. The cost of importing the clear crimped-top lamp chimney is 204 per cent., and the cost of importing frosted crimped-top lamp chimneys 170 per cent. These are the charges in addition to the duty. </para>

              <para>- No. As I pointed out earlier in the debate, it is shown by invoices that the average loss on glassware landed at Port Adelaide is about 10 per cent. In addition to a natural protection, which ranges from 107 per .cent, to 204 per cent., the Committee has imposed a duty of 25 per cent - on foreign importations, and it is now proposed to make the duty on British importations 20 per cent. The honorable member for Bendigo must think that he is talking to children when he says that this protection is not sufficient. How much does he want? The measurement duties which were knocked out were equivalent to over 500 per cent. The local manufacturers of glassware are being treated very liberally. </para>

            <para>.- Honorable members have a lot to say about the natural protection enjoyed by the local manufacturers of glassware, but it does not  prevent imported tumblers from being retailed in Victoria at  1&#189;d.  each, or is. 4d. a dozen. These goods are being dumped here, notwithstanding the supposed protection of 165 per cent. Their original cost cannot be more than 5d. or 6d. a dozen. They are made by work-people who are employed for twelve hours a  day  during all the seven days qf the week. I bought for  1&#189;d.  the tumbler which I hold in mv hand. </para>

How can our work-people, who are employed only eight hours a day, for a week of forty-eight hours, compete with work-people who are employed, for a week of eighty-four hours, and many of whom are women and girls? There are no women or girls employed in the glassmaking industry in Australia, where all the operatives are paid Wages Board rates, and work under proper conditions. </para>

            <para>. - No doubt the Tariff _ Commissioners took into consideration the enormous charges incidental to the importation of glassware, and,  having  done so, one section recommended a duty of 15 percent., and the other duties ranging from 20 per cent, to 300 per cent. The complaint of the honorable member for Bendigo comes rather late, and, as we have dealt with item 252, we might very well agree to the proposed rate of 20 per cent, on British importations, so that we can make progress. </para>

I have certain f acts relating to the scientific glassware industry to put before the Committee, and appeal to the better nature of the Treasurer to do justice to it. How have the Victorian industries been treated? The hat manufacturers of Victoria have been granted the assistance of protective duties amounting to nearly 200 per cent., and the clothing manufacturers have also received substantial protection. Does not the Treasurer think that every industry deserves some encouragement at the hands of the Government? If the news goes forth that because I voted against the Government on two or three items of which I did not approve, an important industry in Queensland is to be penalized, what opinion will the people form of the Treasurer&#39;s attitude? </para>

            <para>Following our letter of 5th inst., <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> scientific glassware, we beg to state that the circular sent you was printed prior to the declaration of the new Tariff. We mentioned incandescent electric lamps as being admitted free, but under the new Tariff they carry 25 per cent. and_ 15 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">(vide</inline> item 144). This is the only article in our line of business that has received any adequate protection. Items 255,. 256, and 442 include most of the articles important to those in our line of business, and are admitted free. On pages 7, 8, and 9 of our illustrated catalogue are some&#39; testimonials which prove our ability to turn out scientific glassware. At present we are manufacturing for the Commonwealth, New Zealand, Singapore, Honolulu, &#38;c. We would draw your attention to what we consider an anomaly in the present Tariff relating to glassware. While fine, expensive, artistic, and ornamental glassware, which is not made in the Commonwealth nor likely to be for many years to come, carries a duty of 35 per cent., scientific glassware, which can be and is being made here, is admitted duty free. </para>

            <para>We know of many glass-workers throughout the States, comprising the Commonwealth and New Zealand, who cannot obtain work at their trade on account of the free importation from the Continent; and who are obliged to be engaged in- such work as railway carriage cleaners, labourers in connexion with the metal trades, tramway employes, storemen, packers, bailiffs, &#38;c, or any employment offering. We would respectfully suggest that the _list_ of articles contained in our circular as scientific glassware be included in the Tariff as glassware, item 253, carrying duty to the extent of 35 per cent, in the general Tariff and 25 per cent, in the preferential Tariff. We trust that when these matters come up for debate, our Queensland representatives will see the necessity for giving our industry protection, and give our views their very earnest support. </para>

              <para>- Had I heard the remark myself I should have asked that the Treasurer be called upon to withdraw it. Anything that he may say, however, will not affect me; we all know how offensive he can be. The letter which I have just read was accompanied by a number of testimonials which, but for the consideration that I have for other honorable members, I might read for the benefit of the Treasurer. I was prepared to show some consideration for the Treasurer until I heard &#39;the contemptible way in which he said that he would not agree to protection for this industry, because I had recorded a certain vote. One of the testimonials to which I refer is from &#34; R.  L. J.  Ellery, F.R.S., Government Astronomer, Melbourne,&#34; and is as follows - </para>

              <para>- I am not reflecting upon the honorable member, who, of course, is at liberty to do as he likes. But when the honorable member for Oxley has voted, as he has done in almost every instance, to reduce the duty proposed in connexion with the very industry to which he is now referring to- rates which would render it impossible to carry on the industry, of what use is it for him to ask me to put certain manufacturers in Brisbane in a position which I say is not a good position for them or for any one else - and solely because of the way in which the honorable member has voted. I am not going to do it. </para>

            <para>. - The attitude assumed by the honorable member for Oxley in making this request borders on the humourous. For weeks past the honorable member has consistently voted for the lowest possible duty, except where the interests of a Queensland industry have been at stake. He now asks, again in respect of a Queensland industry, that it should be given every consideration in this Tariff. Whenever a Queensland industry is in question, the honorable member desires that something should be done for it, and every other part of Australia, so far as he is concerned, can go hang. I say that, so far as my knowledge of the people of Queensland goes, they do not desire any such discrimination in their favour. They are content that duties should be so imposed as to benefit industries in all the States alike. </para>

              <para>- I would not think of reflecting upon the honorable member for Oxley. I merely direct attention to some little inconsistencies on the part of the honorable member, which are probably quite accidental. There is, however, a peculiarity about them, as they always seem to be in the one direction. Where a Queensland industry is involved, the honorable member suddenly becomes a protectionist, and on everything else he- is a free-trader. </para>

              <para>- Despite the attitude adopted by the honorable member for Oxley, I do not think that we should ignore a Queensland industry. I am quite prepared to . give every consideration to industries established in Queensland, even -though representatives of that State should be so selfish as to refuse to give consideration to industries .established in the other States. I trust that the Treasurer will look into the matter referred to, and see whether anything has been overlooked. I am glad to be able to say that at the Women&#39;s Work Exhibition recently held here I saw some Queensland glass products from Rockhampton that were equal to anything I have seen imported from the Old Country, or anything of the kind that has ever been placed on the market in Australia. I regret that owing to the last vote, carried with the assistance of the honorable member for Oxley and other honorable members opposite, such productions are likely to receive so small a measure of protection in the future that it is doubtful whether the industry for their manufacture can continue to be carried on. </para>

            <para>.- From the debate which has taken place since the honorable member for Oxley brought this matter before the Committee, and from general remarks on the Tariff to which I have listened, I am disposed to think that the honorable member made the greatest possible mistake in not. first consulting the Treasurer&#39;s understudy, the honorable member for Batman. If he had only told that honorable member that he wanted a duty for the benefit of this Brisbane industry, I am satisfied that the Treasurer would have acceded at once to his request. This is the Lyne-Coon Tariff. There is no doubt at all about that. As soon as any article is mentioned, the honorable member for Batman gets up, and says, &#34; The thing can be made in Australia. I have it here in my pocket.&#34; The honorable member went so far the other night as to say that he had a sheep-  shearing machine and a wool-scouring machine in his pocket. He may know something about a good many things, but the honorable member does not know much about wool, or he would not have brought forward the sample he exhibited in- this Chamber. The trouble is that this is a Queensland industry, and so did not happen to have the ear of the Treasurer, the Minister of Trade and Customs, or the honorable member for Batman. The honorable member for Oxley was returned as an independent member of this Parliament, and is free to vote as he likes. We all claim to do that. If one or two, or the whole of the representatives of Queensland, happen to be opposed to the policy of the Government, that is no reason why the industries of that State should not be given a square deal. </para>

              <para>- A number of scientific appliances which are manufactured here have already been placed on the free list by the Committee. The Government have studiously avoided the imposition of duties upon material used for scientific purposes. The honorable member must be aware that gas analysis apparatus is not very largely used, and I feel sure that he would not desire that an impost should be placed upon instruments used to prevent disaster to the community. Arsenic testing apparatus and tubes should be treated in the same way. </para>

              <para>- Does the honorable member accuse me of unfairness for saving a word for the freedom of scientific apparatus which we have already admitted free of duty under different parts of the Tariff ? Ifthe honorable member for Oxley desires a duty, I hope that the Treasurer will give his request the consideration it deserves. But I feel that the Treasurer will be consistent. He has been consistent throughout the consideration of the Tariff. We should not place an impost upon articles required for scientific work. Even if a duty were placed upon evaporating basins, I do not think that it would make any difference in the number manufactured here. The honorable member for Oxley has gone out of his&#39; way to ask the Committee to do something which they have never done before, in placing aduty upon apparatus used solely for scientific work, and for making scientific observations. </para>

              <para>- I spoke this morning in admiration of the way in which the Minister has controlled himself during the whole Tariff discussion. I was honest and sincere in what I said then; but I am afraid that it had a bad effect upon him. Apparently he likes to be scolded better than to be praised. I ask him to take this matter into consideration with the view of giving some measure of protection to the industry which I have mentioned. I &#39; do not care whether it is established in brisbane or in any other part of the Commonwealth. I take it that the industry is established to some extent in other parts of the Commonwealth. I know -that I cannot move for an increase of duty, but the particular articles which Messrs. J. and W. Wilson manufacture are to be found in items  255, 256,  and  442. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member is very troublesome. He takes up a good deal of time himself. He should know that we want to get the Tariff through before Christmas. I ask the Minister to take the matter into his serious consideration, with a view to giving protection not only to this firm, but to others throughout the Commonwealth. The honorable member for Laanecoorie knows that I am not speaking only on behalf of the people of my own State. It has &#39;been alleged that I vote only for those things which will benefit Queensland, but I can say .that Queensland has nothing to thank the Federal Parliament for. It is always thrown in our faces that we do nothing except for the benefit of Queensland. I deny and resent the imputation. I hope the Treasurer will see his way clear to impose a duty of  15&#39;  or  20  per cent. I think I am moderate in my request. I term myself a moderate protectionist. I am not an extremist. I regard high duties as being just as bad as are top low duties. The self-reliance of men and masters is weakened when they have to depend on duties, and on such assistance as they may be able to get from a Government.&#39; </para>

              <para>- The Minister sits in his chair like a Sphinx, and will not say what he will do or not do. Instead of the honorable member for Laanecoorie helping the honorable member for Oxley, knowing full well, as a professional man, the names of these scientific instruments, he tried to cloud the issue by saying that they are not included in this item. If the honorable member for Laanecoorie were fair to the honorable member for Oxley, to the Committee, and to Queensland, he would say whether these articles can be made in Australia or not. Will he say, as a professional man, whether this is a fair industry to be protected? If it were carried on in Victoria, I am satisfied that every Victorian in the House, including the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, would be barracking hard for it. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports interjected something about free-traders being strong on protection. I may tell the honorable member that I was not returned at the last election as a free-trader. I announced on the platform what I intended to do with regard to protection. I said that if the Government introduced scientific protection, and would protect the workers, I would give them the help that they needed. I hope the honorable member for Melbourne Ports will not throw that taunt at me again. I am as good a man as he is, in any way he likes to take me. No good end is served by saying that honorable members are agents for this or that man. Each of us has a constituency to represent, and is amenable to his electors. Let them deal with us, instead of our attempting tojudge one another on the floor of this chamber. The honorable member for Oxley has only asked for a fair thing for our State. He wants the same fair and square treatment for Queensland as I and other Queensland members have given to the other States in regard to their manufacturing industries. I ask the Treasurer, in all seriousness, to see if something cannot be done to protect this industry. Messrs. J. and W. Wilson claim to be the sole Australian manufacturers of accurate scientific glassware. Their factory and warehouse is situated in Wharf-street, Brisbane. I do not know them, but as the instruments which they advertise are made in Brisbane,, which after all is in the Commonwealth, those honorable members who are so strong on protection for industries in other States which have more numerous representation than Queensland has should accord this industry the same fair, square treatment as other States are getting. I ask the Treasurer to give this matter consideration, not on account of the honorable member for Oxley, who does not care a snap of the lingers personally, but in the interests of Queensland and of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>. - The honorable member for Oxley has been good enough to suggest that I have chattered a good deal on this Tariff. I have spoken very little upon it. My constituency is vitally interested in it in many ways, but in the interests of the despatch of business I have kept silent on many occasions in the face of great provocation. When I asked the honorable member for Oxley a civil question as to what articles included in item 255 were made by the Brisbane firm mentioned, he replied in a fashion which I am sorry to say he has apparently acquired from those with whom he is sitting. </para>

              <para>- I cannot find in the catalogue any article that is includedin item 255. There are only three articles included in that item, one of which I know from personal knowledge is not manufactured in the Commonwealth. When the honorable member asserted that all the articles in item 255 were manufactured in the Commonwealth, he made an assertion that is not borne out by the catalogue itself. I hope the Treasurer will decide not to place a duty on apparatus used purely for scientific purposes. If the Minister refuses to impose a duty he will be doing only what has been the consistent policy of the protectionist party for many years past. Of course, we desire to see these articles manufactured here, if possuble; but if they are not manufactured here - and even if they are - we decline to make them subject to taxation. </para>

We have agreed that glassware under item 253 shall be admitted on duties of 25 per cent. and 20 per cent. ; and now it is proposed that, instead of admitting free glassware which we cannot make in this country successfully, a duty should be imposed because there is a factory or factories, in Queensland. I do not believe that there is a glass factory in my electorate, but I feel sure, seeing that the electorate is within a stone&#39;s throw of some of the largest factories in Australia, that some of those engaged in the industry are amongst my constituents. I was perfectly content with a duty of 25 per cent., which the honorable member for Parramatta has informed us really means protection up to 130 per cent. That duty, however, is for the <inline font-style="italic">bond fide-</inline> protection of an industry already in existence, employing a considerable number of people, whereas the proposal now is- to impose a duty to protect an industry in which only one or two persons are employed in some factory in Queensland. The proposal exhibits a provincial and narrow view ; and I hope that, in the interests of scientific research and knowledge, the honorable member for Oxley will not persist in his amendment. I am sure that the honorable member&#39;s contention will not be corroborated, namely, that glassware for scientific instruments can be produced in Australia to compete with European instruments. </para>

            <para>.- It is generally known that I was returned to this Parliament pledged not to interfere with the old Tariff. At the same time, I cannot help feeling thai attention may very well be drawn to the attitude of protectionists like the honorable member for Laanecoorie and others. All through the  Tariff discussion we have seen high duties imposed in order to protect industries, some of which are only one-man industries, or employing very few people. </para>

              <para>- The fact that these people in Queensland manufacture scientific instruments has very little to do with the matter from a Tariff point of view. We must not forget the taxation, equal to 15 per cent, or 20 per cent., which has been imposed on the farmer. What difference would it make to scientific research if particular instruments cost 2&#39;d. or 3d. more by reason of the proposed duty? It is ridiculous to say that scientific research will be stopped at once if a duty of 1.5 per cent, be placed on this glassware. </para>

            <para>.- Before this item is passed, I appeal to the Prime Minister, who is now in the chamber, to see that justice is done to the people of Queensland. I am satisfied that there is some justification for the articles which have appeared in the public press of that State, and which declare that its wants are ignored by this Parliament. The Government is supposed to be a protectionist Government, and I ask the Prime Minister to see that the same modicum of protection is extended to Queensland industries that has been extended to the industries of other States. </para>

            <para>. - In respect of this item we have one of the most severe increases of duty that has been levied under this Tariff. The impost upon bottles of more than10 ozs. of fluid capacity, has been raised from20 per cent. under the old Tariff, and from 10 per cent. in the case of wine and beer bottles, to at least 100 and 150 per cent. in certain instances. These are most extraordinary increases. Yet we know that under the operation of the old Tariff the bottle-making industry was flourishing and expanding. The rate which formerly obtained, added to freight and other charges, represented a natural protection to the industry of from 60 to 80 per cent. Let me point out to the Committee the effect of freight and charges. The New South Wales Wine and Spirit Association has furnished some figures showing that the Home cost of black wine bottles is10s. per gross, and that, under the present duty, the landedcost with all charges in Sydney is 35s. per gross, being an increase of 250 per cent. on the Home cost. The landed cost of the same description of bottles at Fremantle is 38s. per gross, being an increase of 280 per cent. on the Home cost; while at Hobart it is 40s. per gross, being an increase of 300 per cent. on the Home cost. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Grampians has interjected that no per cent. is the cost of bringing out the bottles, and if we take the Home cost at10s. per gross, the landed cost will be about 21s. Under the old Tariff, including all charges, a. protection including charges of from 60 to 100 per cent., according to the class of the bottle, was given to the bottlemakers But under the new Tariff the protection is increased by three times on some items, and by more than three times on some items. Surely that is not a reasonable duty ! No one else has ever claimed such gigantic protection. No one has ever claimed a duty of 100 per cent, on the Home cost, when the article was a small one which would not occupy much space. In the case of bulky goods like bottles it costs an enormous amount in proportion to cost to protect them from breakage and to import them. Is it right to levy an enormous tax on an article of that sort ? </para>

              <para>- Yes,  and in every other industry, but surely it is not proposed to levy enormous duties merely to prevent some persons from being unsuccessful in a calling in which others are successful. What we have to consider is not so much the firms who are engaged in the trade as whether the proposed duty is reasonable and for the good of the people. I cannot see how enormous duties can be for their good.  I also have some figures relating to some shipments of bottles which, under the old Tariff, came in at a total duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;16</inline> 10s., but which, under the new Tariff, would come in at a total duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;165.</inline> Of course, those figures  refer to only special cases. The other figures I quoted related to a large import of the ordinary black wine bottles and bottles of a similar size, such as beer bottles. In addition to that, we have to remember that this item covers not only bottles, but also flasks and ju.-s. On pre- serving jars, which are largely used here, the duty amounts to from 60 to 80 per cent. </para>

              <para>- If preserving jars were made largely under .the old Tariff, as I believe they were, there seems to be no occasion for the enormous increase of duty which is proposed. Then let us take small jars, such as meat extract jars. On an invoice value of &#163;103 8s. 3d., the old duty of 20 per cent, amounted to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20</inline> 16&#39;s. id., and on an invoice value of &#163;.115 4s. 4d., the new&#34; duty has amounted to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;56</inline> 10s. 4d., showing an increase of over 200. per cent. . Again, take an invoice of ginger-beer bottles. Under the old Tariff the duty was &#163;49 10s., but under the new Tariff it is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;i&#38;o.</inline> What a gigantic increase that is ! I ask the Treasurer if he is wedded to &#39;these enormous duties. Surely such duties, which have not been asked for on any other items, are not . intended to be maintained ? A protection of from 250 to 300 per cent, on bottles - which are subject to a. duty equal to 100 per cent. - is surely too gigantic a tax to levy on articles which are used largely in a great many of our industries. </para>

              <para>- I am not forgetting the bottle-makers. I have pointed out that under the old duty thelarger bottle-works were exceedingly active and increasing their trade. I do not say that every bottle-maker was doing well, but the trade itself was growing, and the annual reduction in the number of imported bottles was affording an opportunity for a considerable increase in local business. I cannot see from that aspect that there was any necessity to increase the old duty. If we retain this enormous duty on jars, it will handicap our meat extract makers in the markets of the world. </para>

I do not know that any one has ever attempted to make meat extract jars here, or that it would pay any one to do so. But the effect of this enormous duty is to handicap the exporter of meat extract in competition with other countries. I hope that the Minister will reconsiderthe duties embraced in this item. At the present moment, I shall not move a reduction in the duty on bottles, but personally I should prefer to retain the old duty of 20 per cent. </para>

              <para>- I do not know that any reason has been given for increasing the old duty. I point out to the honorable gentleman that measurement duties are very objectionable. Under the old Victorian Tariff, they were found objectionable, and I think abandoned. Under this system it is all a question of what space articles can be packed into. In many instances, it compels persons to adopt a certain shape of article, when they would rather use another shape. They have to adopt a shape which will allow the article to be packed closely. Measurement duties are absolutely objectionable, especially on lines like bottles, and&#39; whatever duty we may decide upon I urge the Treasurer to abandon them. </para>

But the honorable member for Grampians knows a. good deal about the subject, and I should like to hear his opinion.

            <para>. - I may be supposed to speak more or less as one who is interested in thismatter, though my interests will not be allowed to influence my vote in this House. I shall deal with the subject on general lines, from the point of view of what I consider to be the interests of Australia and Australian industries. I think that a heavy tax upon bottles is oppressive both to the primary producer and the consumer. The old duties of 10 and 20 per cent., when freight and charges were taken into consideration, amounted to a protection of no per cent. I have documentary evidence in my possession which I am prepared to submit to the Treasurer for his perusal, and which will show that my statement is correct. </para>

              <para>- Yes; I think that those duties should be applied all round. Quantities of goods which are put into small phials are sold at 3d., 4d., and 6d. per bottle retail. Those who use them are largely country people, who ought not to be taxed excessively for the benefit of industries in the large capitals, and to the detriment of the primary producer and consumer all over Australia. </para>

              <para>- A case in point came under my notice within the last two or three weeks. I will quote the figures. Fifteen cases of Burke&#39;s stout, pints, each case containing 8 dozen, were imported. Stout, as honorable members know, is only made in qualities which are in great repute at one place, namely, Dublin. The duty and charges paid under the old Tariff would have been 7s. The extra duty collected under the new Tariff was &#163;4 10s. That is to say, &#163;12 17s. was paid on fifteen cases of pints. The Treasurer knows as well as I do that stout is especially recommended by the medical faculty for the use of sick people, and it is a necessary article of consumption in many such cases. He will surely recognise that an extra charge of &#163;4 10s. on fifteen cases of pints is not fair. </para>

              <para>- And they should be used. I have here an invoice from one of the largest firms in Great Britain, Jorgensen and Jorgensen Limited. It is a Swedish firm, having establishments in several places; its London headquarters are situated in St. Mary&#39;s Axe, London, E.C. I have another statement before me for 578 gross and 3 dozen bottles, including pints and quarts, clarets and black wines. The cost f.o.b. London was &#163;299 19s. 8d. The old duty at 10 per cent. being &#163;40 18s.10d., the freight and other charges would bring the total cost up to &#163;364 9s.1d. Surely to goodness those figures indicate a . sufficiently heavy protection. Under the proposed duty the same shipment, 5,796 cubic feet, at10d. per cubic foot, would cost &#163;24110s. On the top of that have to be added freight and other charges, bringing the total cost up to&#163;5650s. 3d., which is 215 per cent. I do not think that any one wants the people of this country to pay 215 per cent. on bottles. I want as much as any one can do to secure effective protection, because I believe in the establishment of Australian industries throughout the length and breadth of. Australia. But I do not wish to penalize the primary producer or consumer to such an extent as is now proposed. Our policy should be rather to induce people to settle in the country instead of attracting them into the large centres. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member talks without sufficient information. He can get land anywhere if he is prepared to pay for it. I am prepared to indicate where land is to be obtained if people want it. but not if they want it for nothing. Some people want to get land but do not want to work for it. I am quite willing to submit the documents from which I have quoted to the Treasurer, in order that he may see for himself that what I have stated is reasonable. I consider that duties of 30 per cent. and 25 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> all round ought to be quite sufficient. No one can challenge the figures which I have quoted, and which show a protection of 215 per cent. on a shipment of bottles landed here. I believe in the Australians making their own bottles, but a protection of 215 per cent. is altogether too high. If we impose duties of 30 and 25 per cent., giving the British manufacturers a preference of 5 per cent., we shall deal very liberally with the local industry. </para>

              <para>- I think that full bottles should be admitted free, because, although it is said that our manufacturers can make any kind of bottle, it is not so. On the Continent of Europe, and in the United Kingdom, large factories confine themselves to the making of special bottles. One factory will make flagons, another black wine or black beer bottles, another amber glass bottles, another medicine bottles, another patent bottles, and so on. We have a great deal to learn in connexion with bottle making. There are secrets which have been handed down from generation to generation of makers in Germany, France, and England. France is the only country in the world where&#39; they can make a first-class champagne bottle, capable of standing high pressure. They make a good bottle in  Germany,  but the German bottle will not compare with the French bottle. Neither will the English bottle. The French champagne pint bottle will stand a pressure of from 160 to 170 lbs. to the square inch. The art of making such bottles is not to be learned in a year or two. Only years of experimenting will produce bottles like those. The best French champagne quart bottles will stand a pressure of from 120 to <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> 30. lbs. to the square inch, whilst most other bottles will not stand a pressure of more than about 40 lbs. to the square inch. While I would giveencouragement to the local bottle-making industry, I shall not vote for the prohibition of importations, which is practically what the Government proposal means, the duties proposed being in some instances equivalent to <inline font-style="italic">ad valor eu</inline> rates of nearly 400 per cent, on some kinds of bottles. I could deal with this matter at greater length, but I shall not do so, unless I find it to be necessary to make a second speech, because we all want to make progress with the Tariff. </para>

              <para>- He admitted that he is interested in this matter. If both sides were heard, honorable members would take a broader and more sympathetic view of the industry. Probably they have not found time to read the evidence taken by the Commission, because it is very voluminous, and the work of going through it is very tedious. Had they read it, they would not deal with these proposals in a cavalier spirit, and, to save time, agree to wholesale reductions of duties. Something like ,&#163;156,000 is invested in bottle works in Australia, upwards of ,&#163;60,000 being sunk in the Melbourne bottle works, while &#163;25,000 is sunk in bottle works in New South Wales, and there are other bottle works in South Australia. It was from South Australia that the request for a substantial increase of the duty on bottles came. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> the pioneer bottle manufacturer &#39;of that State, pointed out that, under the old Tariff, his output was reduced, and he was not able to keep his hands fully employed, so that some of his men were without work for a considerable part of the year. He and other manufacturers strongly advocated fixed rates ; first, because these had operated very successfully in Victoria, and, secondly, because they make it impossible for importers to deceive the Customs authorities by presenting incorrect invoices. We were informed that the Customs authorities prefer the measurement system to a duty of so much_ for a certain number of bottles. Notwithstanding the up-to-date equipment of the Melbourne Bottle Works, the proprietors cannot, compete against many of the imported bottles. Their present machinery has enabled them to reduce prices ; but now further reductions are impossible, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McNeilage</inline> informed the Tariff. Commission that, even if the higher rates of duty which he suggested were agreed to it would take some years for the company to get back its outlay. In New South  Wales we learned of the market . being swamped by the importation of cheap bottles made in China, Japan, and Germany. I would like honorable members - particularly those belonging to the Labour Party  -  ito listen to this pathetic story of a Sydney glassblower. It is given on page 559 of the reports and recommendations of the protectionist section. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott,</inline> the glassblower in question, told us - </para>

            <para>The reason I have been sent before you is to explain what effect the foreign competition has had upon us. For instance, the factories have had to close down for want of work some two and three and a half months at .a time, and we have had first-class tradesmen nearly starving for the want of employment. They have not been able to get work two months out- of the twelve. In July, 1903, we made au agreement with the manufacturers to have  a certain price for making bottles, and had it filed under the Arbitration Act and made a common rule. It was just on twelve months after that the manufacturers asked us to accept 15 per cent, reduction in wages, or they would have to close their factories down. The reason for asking for this reduction was that they could not compete with the foreign trade. Twelve months after accepting the 15 per cent, reduction, men were out of work from twelve to fourteen weeks. Before the Japanese and Germans interfered with the trade here we could earn between 14s. to 17s. a day. </para>

          <para class="block">That was prior to the reduction of wages. This appeal is indorsed by the manufacturers, who have a large amount of capital invested, and by their employes, who have consented even to the reduction of wages to enable the manufacturers to continue their competition with foreign importations, in the hope that relief would be granted by the amendment of the Commonwealth Tariff. This scheme of fixed duties is based on suggestions made in South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. The rates recommended are lower than were asked for by the men concerned. The Minister suggests that <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates should be substituted for them. </para>

              <para>-- I have nothing to gain by pleading the cause of this industry ; but I desire to put honorable members on the track of information. The fixed duties proposed are equivalent in some cases to an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate of 50 or 60 per cent. ; but the Tariff Commission was told that high rates are absolutely necessary to enable the local bottle manufacturers to compete against foreign importations. If honorable members prefer <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> to fixed rates, by all means let them adopt them; but whatever rates are agreed upon should give effective protection to the local industry. A mere nominal increase of the present duties would be useless. If we are to have <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates, they should not be lower than 40 and 35 per cent. I hope that the Minister will stand by his proposition. </para>

              <para>- A firm like this has interests in all parts of the Commonwealth, and when it enters into a contract we may rest assured that it will carry if out. I do not expect to be able to make any impression upon the honorable member for Lang, who consistently adheres to his election pledges, for I know that if &#34;lie yielded to my appeal he would break faith with his constituents. I am directing my appeal more particularly to those protectionists who may be inclined to think that this industry is not likely to expand, and is so small as to be unworthy of consideration. It may be said that it cannot be compared with any of the great manufacturing industries of Australia; but I think we should all recognise that it is very necessary that we should have bottle works,  and that those engaged in them should receive reasonable remuneration,. Surely when I, as a Labour man, am prepared to concede that every investor has a right to secure a fair return on his capital, the representatives of the wealthier classes will be ready to admit the reasonableness of my claim that we should so protect the industry as to enable fair wages to be paid. I do not ask that the manufacturers should be assisted to amass large fortunes.  I merely say that they should be so protected that they will be able to compete to some extent against foreign bottlemakers. It is true that the manufacture of some classes of bottles is scarcely worth protecting; but we ought to be prepared to assist those engaged in making bottles that are in general use. The honorable member for Grampians, who has dealt with this question from the stand-point of the users of bottles, was quite justified in the position that he took up, and although he is an interested party, I am sure he would honestly state what he believed to be a fair duty. But we have no more right To doubt the evidence of the manufacturer than we have to disbelieve his statements ; and I appeal to the Committee to grant to the industry the fair protection of more than 30 per cent, and 25 ,per cent, duties. </para>

              <para>- We are constantlybeing told of the natural protection which some of our industries enjoy, but investigation shows that it does not count for. much. Unfortunately, many people ir&#187;. Australia are ever ready to belittle ourown productions. I do not believe that: this practice obtains so largely in Victoria&#39; as in some of the other States; but it is a remarkable thing that even the merits of our great artists are not recognised until they leave Australia. And so with many of our manufactures; if the people would give them a fair deal high duties would&#39; not be necessary. It is true, as has been, said, that certain counties in England, as well as some continental countries, confine their attention to the production of a particular class of bottle, and since they thusspecialize they will always be able&#34; lo land their manufactures here at a price considerably below the cost of the labour involved in producing them in Australia. I appeal to protectionists not to be led away by the statements of opponents of this proposal, but to grant substantial protection to this industry. </para>

            <para>.- If this industry needs encouragement, surely amoderate duty ought to be sufficient. Copies of invoices placed in my hands show that it enjoys a natural protection of 123 per cent., which ought to be sufficient to keep employed the 2,500 hands who,, according to the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, are now engaged in it. I think that the duty proposed in the first Federal Tariff was only 20 per cent., and that in anticipation &#39;of its imposition there was a bit of a flush in the bottle-making industry prior to Federation. I was asked at the time, in Adelaide, to become a shareholder in a company which it was said would carry on operations in New South. Wales, and make large profits under a duty of 20 per cent, or 25 per cent; Some capital was invested in the enterprise, and if it is thriving I fail to see why we should increase the duty. On the other hand, if it is not, it is about time - seeing that it has enjoyed the protection of a duty of 20 per cent., in addition to the natural protection of 123 per cent. - that we stopped listening to the appeals of mendicant industries. I merely mention this matter because the honorable member for Bendigo assumed that the Committee knew, absolutely nothing about, this question, and1, that the possibilities of the industry werebeing ignored by those who appealed for&#34;  moderate duties. Various industries will be affected by these duties. The chemists complain of them, and the licensed victuallers have brought forward a joint remonstrance with an elaboration and conclusiveness that is almost exceptional. </para>

              <para>- We are constantly hearing invidious arguments of that description. Even the honorable member, fair as he is, when he rose to deal with this question, could not rid himself of the atmosphere in which he seems to have moved as a member of the Tariff Commission. Although the honorable member for Grampians rose in response to an appeal by the Committee, that as an expert he should offer some explanation of the effect of these duties, the honorable member for Bendigo could not rid himself of the trammels of his associations, and immediately imputed to him a personal motive. I should be very sorry to have these issues decided by appeals to a matter of prejudice, butI wish to place before the Committee an illustration of the operation of this duty which has been brought under my notice. I have here an invoice of 100 gross of bottles valued at &#163;95, on which the old duty would have amounted to &#163;20 1 8s. ; whereas the new duty was &#163;68 10s. Surely we are not going to stimulate an existing industry to that extent at the cost of the aerated water manufacturer who has to import his bottles. I have many other instances of the unequal operation of these duties. It has been pointed out to me that while the duty amounts to 5d. per case in respect of magnums of champagne, it amounts to 3s. 4d. per case of half-pint bottles of champagne used chiefly by invalids. It has also been pointed out to me that it amounts to 5s. per case of imported bottled spirits. I could, if I wished, give other instances from a synopsis of invoices, and I should like to remind the Victorian protectionists to whom the honorable member for Melbourne Ports has appealed, that even the Victorian Commission in1894 condemned a tax upon bottles. </para>

          <para class="block">That ought to be good enough, although it is described as antediluvian by some Victorian extreme protectionists. To show how the present duty operates, I can give instances from specific imports. I have had my attention called to this fact, that while the f.o.b. cost of bottles for wine packed in mats and straw envelopes amounts to 10s., when they are cleared here after payment of the duty and charges, the total has gone up to  &#163;1  5s., a pretty stiff protection, representing from 125 to 130 per cent. Take other instances. Black wines, pints, packed in mats and straw envelopes f.o.b., cost per gross, 8s. 3d.; cost when cleared, 25s. In the case of Apollinaris, half-pints, f.o.b., costs 7s. ; the cost after clearance is 1 8s. 3d. I do not wish to labour this matter; but these are facts which do not require an appeal to prejudice in support of the proposal made for a reduction of the duty. </para>

            <para>.- I notice that honorable members, in trying to induce the Committee to carry a particular duty, make a practice of over-stating their case in regard to importations. The honorable member for Bendigo drew a graphic picture from the evidence submitted to the Tariff Commission of the importation of Japanese bottles, and the ridiculous rates of wages paid to bottle-makers in Japan. The inference sought to be drawn was that, as a result of the importation of these Japanese bottles, the local industry was being ruined. It is just as well to get down to the actual facts, and in the statistics prepared by the Government Statistician,I find that of small bottles of not more than 5 drams capacity the imports from Japan for last year represented the enormous  value of ,&#163;28. The imports of bottles of over 5, and not exceeding 9 drams&#39; capacity, were valued at ,&#163;34. </para>

              <para>- I am &#34;not raising the question of wages, and if that question is raised, surely a duty of from 100 to 120 per cent., which is what my proposal would amount to, should be sufficient for the local industry? Under the old Tariff, bottles up to 5 drams capacity were free. The duty on wine and beer bottles was only 10 per cent., and on all other bottles, 20 per cent. I have proposed duties of 30 and 25 per cent., and when it is remembered that that would mean an increase to the full extent of the duty in the case of bottles up to 5 drams capacity, an increase of 20 and 15 per cent, on wine and beer bottles, and an increase of 10 and 5 per cent, on all other bottles, I feel justified in considering that I am making an extravagantly liberal proposal. But, with a view to avoiding the monstrous proposition of fixed duties on these articles, I am prepared to adhere to it. I understand that the Government have agreed to adopt measurement duties. With the object of moving subsequently that the duty on imports from Great Britain should be 25 per cent., I move - </para>

          <para>I think there is something in the contention that there should be some small duty on bottles imported containing liquids ; but that is a question, which might be dealt with when we are discussing the duty to be imposed on the contents. The total amount paid in duty on bottles last year was &#163;1,086, and the total importations, 329,000 dozen. I trust the Committee will agree to duties of 30 and 25 per cent, on this Une, plus the natural protection of from 80 to 120 per1 cent., which can be proved beyond doubt from actual invoices. </para>

              <para>- That would bring the duty up to 150 per cent, on some of these lines. Honorable members talk of starving this industry with the fact staring them in the face that the protection on some lines amounts to 150 per cent. I shall occupy no more of the time of the Committee in dealing with the matter. I trust&#39; that the common sense of honorable members will prevent them from imposing any higher duties than those I have mentioned. </para>

            <para>.- I notice from the reports of the Tariff Commission that this plea that Japan is a serious competitor in this industry was raised by very many of the witnesses. The figures quoted by the honorable member for Grey are sufficient to show that the plea was not raised <inline font-style="italic">bond fide.</inline> There are one or two columns from which the honorable member did not quote, and in order to put the facts completely before honorable members, I should like to refer to them. The figures will be found in, the Trade and Customs returns for 1906, at pages 54 and 55. These returns show that of wine and beer bottles, out of a total importation amounting in .value to &#163;10,321, all we got from Japan was &#163;14 worth. As the honorable member for Grey has already shown, of small bottles of not more than 5 drams capacity, &#163;3,812 worth were imported altogether, and of that amount only &#163;28 worth came from Japan; whilst of bottles of from 5 to 9 drams capacity, in connexion with which the figures are given in dozens, out of &#39; a total importation of 352,000, only 34 dozen came from Japan. In the circumstances, I say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McNeilage, Mr. Thompson,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bishop,</inline> who gave this evidence about the warehouses being filled with Japanese bottles,, must have been misinformed, or they wilfully misled the Commission. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McNeilage</inline> also gave evidence about the effect of the duty upon the Victorian industry from the time Federation was established up to 1906.  His  evidence on the subject will be found in answer to questions 76998-9. He told the Commission that the Caledonian Bottle Works, and several smaller works in Victoria, had ceased to exist since the Federal Tariff  had been inaugurated. I find, as. a matter of fact from the reports of the Chief Inspector of Factories in Victoria, that in 1900, before Federation, there were 391 males employed in this industry, at an average wage of 27s.10d. per week; whilst in1906, after six years of Federation, there were 533 males employed with an average wage of 30s. 8d. </para>

              <para>- Another noteworthy fact is that the New Zealand Government have, after deliberation, withdrawn the proposed duty upon bottles. The honorable member for Grampians emphasised the fact that the best quality of bottles are not made here. There is only one company, with factories in Sydney and Melbourne, who make the black bottles used for beer, wine, and spirits. Under the proposed duty that company would be so strengthened that it would practically have a monopoly of the trade. They are unable now to fulfil the orders that are placed with them. </para>

            <para>.- We must first consider the conditions under which bottles are made here and in other countries. Witnesses who went before the Tariff Commission appointed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> in Great Britain asked for 25 per cent. protection against the foreigner, particularly the German. If so, what protection do we, with the wages that we have to pay, require here? As for natural protection, a ton of bottles, representing seven gross, can be landed in Victoria to-day for 22s. 6d. ! We shall have bottles from Japan very shortly, and also from Germany. Great Britain is losing her trade with us because, as she says, Germany is dumping her bottles into the Commonwealth. Duties of 30, 40, 50, or even 60 per cent. are not high enough. Japan has a protective Tariff of 60 per cent. The United States of America has a Tariff of 80 per cent. Germany has a Tariff of 45 per cent. We need a Tariff of at least from 40 to 60 per cent. in order to compete with the long hours and sweated labour of other parts of. the world. </para>

According to the figures read by him, the importations for1906 were very small. I have not had the returns for that year brought under my notice, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cornelius</inline> Bishop laid before the Tariff Commission figures showing the importations from Japan in the years1903 and 1904. They are given on page 252 of the <inline font-style="italic">Minutes of Evidence,</inline> vol. 5, question 88279, as follows -  88279.1903,4,568 dozen empty wine and beer bottles were imported from Japan. Does that cover the importation to which you refer? - At page 49 of the records which you have handed to me - <inline font-style="italic">General Imports</inline> -&#163;1,451 is set down as the value of the glassware imported from Japan, and 160,000 dozen as the importation of empty wine and beer bottles. </para>

            <para>. - The suggestion of the honorable member for Balaclava might be adopted. The schedule which he mentioned as having been drawn up by me has reference to the next item. I think the two items are very closely related, because the effectiveness of the duty on empty bottles would depend very largely on what is charged on full bottles. The schedule which I suggest with regard to full bottles is as follows : - Bottles up to  5  drams capacity, whether empty or full, free. </para>

            <para>.- After listening to both sides, and the reports that have been quoted, I have concluded that this industry is like many others  - if  the makers have good management they do not ask for a large increase of duty. When I find an industry, according  to  its own reports, doing well  in  some parts of Australia, and badly  in  others, with the same standard  of duty,  I  am  forced to the  conclusion&#39;  &#39;that the fault lies  in  the latter case in the absence of .good administration. In a large measure the argument urged to-night is an admission that those who have charge of this industry have  in many  cases failed in their administrative power. A sum of  &#163;100,000  is invested in the bottle-making industry of Australia, of which  .&#163;60,000  is invested in Victoria. The Melbourne bottle industry has  a  branch in New South Wales. That shows that they are energetic and look after their business well.  If  we could get behind all the evidence quoted, and .into which the Tariff Commission did npt inquire, it  &#39;Would  be found, not only iri the bottle industry, but in many other industries, that want of. proper business management had caused the failure. We are  asked  to vote duties to make up for mistakes  of  management. I refuse to do so. The reason the industries do wel in the Old Country is that they have thebest business ability at the head of affairs, and run them well. . I really think that the weak spot in many of our industries is that they do not pay enough money, and so do not secure the best ability at the top. I am glad that the specific duty has been knocked on the head. The duty according to measurement was tried in Victoria a few years ago, and proved a failure. The first Barton Administration introduced it and then dropped it. The Treasurer apparently is going to do the same. I am prepared to vote for duties of  30  and  25  per cent., unless the Treasurer can show that  5  per cent, is not enough difference between the German or Japanmade bottles, as against the British article- </para>

            <para>.. - If there is one industry that wants protection it is the bottle industry. Honorable members say that it is established. It is established in different States, but an industry that has to close down a good part of its business for half the year cannot be said to be doing well. We should encourage it so that it may have work enough to keep it going the whole year round. The honorable member for Nepean mentioned the wages that were being paid, but it does not matter what wages are paid if men are only drawingthem for half the year, because they have to keep their wives and families for thewhole year. It has been proved that it was not possible under the old duties for a number of the bottle factories to keep going except for a portion of the year. Only the other day I met a young man who originally came from the Old Country, and who was engaged in the bottle industry.. As soon as the first Tariff was adopted he found himself out of employment, and had to work at a different trade, but since the new duties in this Tariff were imposed he and a good many others have found employment. That shows that these new duties have already been effective. I am going to vote for the highest duty that I can get.  Every bottle manufacturer in Australia tells us that the business has not been a success of late years under the old Tariff&#39; iri competition with Germany and Japan. I do not see why honorable members should be so anxious to encourage the manufacturerof German bottles for use in Australia. One honorable member said that we cannot make -bottles here to bear the pressure. T maintain that there is riot a bottle that may  be required in Australia that cannot be made here, if encouragement is given to make it. </para>

              <para>- I have a good deal of information from those who do understand the business. The honorable member can get his champagne bottles from Japan if he wants to. Comparatively few people can afford to drink champagne, and whatever price they have to pay for the bottles will not interfere with them. The industry has gone back since the uniform Commonwealth Tariff was inaugurated, although it is capable of enormous expansion, and we ought to do all that we can to encourage it. I shall support the Treasurer in imposing the highest duty possible. I am doubtful whether the proposal of the honorable member for South Sydney is high enough ; and in many cases I do not think the duty will amount to 25 per cent. When we contrast the wages paid in Australia with those paid in Germany and Japan, it is only fair to prevent the importation of bottles from the latter countries. I have no objection to a higher preference being given to Great Britain, provided the German and Japanese bottles are shut out. Japan has only lately entered upon the bottle export trade, but we may be sure that if her exports represent &#163;1,000 to-day, it will not be long before they represent&#163;100,000 worth. It has been said that Japan cannot produce a firstclass bottle; but I can say that some time ago I saw some Japanese medical instruments which would compare with instruments made in any part of the world, and they were sold at half the ordinary prices. </para>

              <para>- I am fighting for the whole of Australia. There are firms in Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney who are quite prepared to supply all the bottles of ink required in all the schools of the Commonwealth. There is no reason why these bottles should be admitted free, seeing that the process of manufacture is as simple as could well be imagined. </para>

            <para>.- The reason I favour following the example set in the old Tariff, and making bottles under five drams capacity free, is that if they be made dutiable, and full bottles of similar capacity are exempted, outside manufacturers will have a considerable advantage, in the importation of essences, perfumes and so forth, over local manufacturers. The duty charged on essences and perfumes is on the spirituous contents of the bottles and not <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> and, therefore, Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell, and similar firms, would send in these bottles free, while local manufacturers, whodesiredto fill the bottles here, would have to pay duty on the empty bottles. I do not see that we can do much harm  by  allowing the exemption to continue as proposed by the Treasurer. It is true that some small bottles are made in Australia, but not many classes of them. The trouble is that in flint glass small bottles there is such a variety of patterns required that it does not pay local men to enter upon their manufacture. Local manufacturers can certainly make ink bottles, but it is not worth while their entering upon the manufacture of perfume bottles and so forth, of small capacity. </para>

            <para>. - I would point out that glue is the raw material of cardboard box makers, bookbinders, and furniture manufacturers, and that the heavy increase proposed in the old rate of duty would severely handicap those industries into which the consumption of glue enters so largely. The cost of importation amounts to  20  per cent., which, added to the duty, is equivalent to a total protection of  60  per cent. The inevitable result of an increase in the duty will be an increase in the price of glue. This is abundantly demonstrated by what happened in  1961.  In that year, when a duty of  2d.  per lb. was levied upon this article, its price rose from&#163;32 to  &#163;45  per ton - an increase of &#163;13 per ton. But when ultimately the duty was reduced to  20  per cent., its price fell from&#163;45 to&#163;34 per ton - a decrease of&#163;11 per ton. I would also point out that the manufacture of glue was established, both in New South Wales and South Australia, without any protective duty whatever. Before Federation was accomplished, the price of this article in Victoria ranged from &#163;40 to &#163;50 per ton, whilst its price in New South Wales was only&#163;34 per ton. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Robert Firth, a cardboard box manufacturer of Sydney, in giving evidence before the Tariff Commission, read the following statement - </para>

            <para>Glue is manufactured in South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales, from raw materials obtainable entirely in the Commonwealth. Glue making is generally only adopted in larger works, tanneries, &#38;c., and, although such work employed large numbers of hands, vet in glue making alone there cannot be from more than fifteen to twenty hands employed throughout the Commonwealth. Glue making was firmly established in South Australia and New South Wales before the imposition of any Tariff. Cost of importing is high, owing to bulk, and the &#34;natural protection,&#34; therefore, amounts to about 20 per cent. Duty handicaps the following trades :  - Cardboard box makers, bookbinders, and furniture manufacturers, glue being one of their raw materials. The Barton Government imposed a duty of 2d. per lb., equal to 60 per cent., whereupon prices rose enormously ; but when the House of Representatives reduced the duty to 20 per cent., the price of Colonial glue fell from&#163;45 to &#163;34, and of imported glue to&#163;58 to &#163;38 per ton. When the duty of 2d. per lb. was imposed a combine was formed, and the price fixed at &#163;45, about &#163;13 per ton advance on previous Sydney price. The House of Representatives reduced the duty from the 20th February, 1901. Next day the combine collapsed, and the price fell as above-mentioned. However, the combine might be revived. Glue should, therefore, be placed on the free list. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I should be glad indeed to move that it be placed upon the free list, but I know that in a Committee composed as this is of a strong protectionist majority, I would have no chance of carrying such a proposal. With regard to the Glue Combine, it is only fair to add that another witness, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Markwald,</inline> denied its existence. In crossexamination, however, he admitted that he was not in Australia at the period referred to, and had no personal knowledge of the matter. This will be seen by reference to the answers to questions 95694 and 95697. It was also shown by evidence that there is no particular prejudice against the Australian glue, and that the imported article is of a very much higher quality. A large firm of printers and paper-box makers write - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Glue - Another line now increased from 20 to 40 per cent. We use about half a ton monthly, and have bought it from a Victorian glue maker for many years, and it has been mutually satisfactory, but we have little doubt that if the duty is retained that the price will be raised - though there is no necessity for it, as the raw material is here, no duty to pay, and the price charged well pays the manufacturer. Any increase on the 20 per cent. is not needed. </para>
            <para>Gelatine - Duty formerly 2d. lb., equal to about10 per cent., and now proposed to increase to 40 per cent. Coignet&#39;s Gold Medal quality worked out under the old Tariff at 18s. 8d. cwt. duty, while under the proposed Tariff the duty will be 88s. 8d. cwt. This line is only used for manufacturing purposes, and it should be free. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It will thus be seen that although glue forms but a small portion of the manufactures connected with our tanneries, it is a minor article which is used in very many established industries, and consequently any increase in its price must handicap those industries. I therefore suggest that the duty should be reduced to 25 per cent. under the General Tariff and 20 per cent. under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. </para>

            <para>.- I would point out to the honorable member for Bass that 2d. per lb. was the duty imposed upon gelatine under the old Tariff. The manufacturers of photographic dry plates complain that if gelatine be taxed at 40 per cent, they will have to pay duty upon their raw material, whilst the finished article will be admitted duty free. I need scarcely remind the Committee that the gelatine which is used by them costs up to 3s. 6d. per lb., and that it is not manufactured in the Commonwealth, though I will not say that it could not be manufactured here. I think that in proposing a fixed duty upon this article the Treasurer is acting wisely, and I hope it will be carried. </para>

              <para>- The honorable gentleman is proposing to make the duty on all gelatine 2d. per lb. on the ground that there is some difficulty in distinguishing between the different descriptions of that article. To that proposal I do not object, but I do object to the imposition of a duty of 2d. per lb. on an article like glue, which is used in various industries, and the price of which was raised on one occasion by a combine when they got an opportunity to take that step under the cover of a Customs duty. It is equal to a duty of between 40 and 50 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> What were the imports under the old duty of 20 per cent., which in my opinion was too high ? </para>

              <para>- Those figures represent importations of gelatine principally. I thought that perhaps the honorable gentleman had the figures for glue and gelatine separately. I am prepared to believe that the importation of glue is very small indeed. We can export glue, and a high &#39; duty on an article which is worth only &#163;38 per ton is altogether out of the question. The Minister is seeking to impose the same duty on. an article worth from &#163;112 to &#163;140 a ton. The Minister has got an increased duty on gelatine, and I urge him to impose the old duty on glue, or, if he likes, to fix the rate in the general Tariff at 25 per cent. That will give ample protection, and I am quite sure that there will not be an importation of ordinary glue. </para>

            <para>.- I point out to  the honorable member for North Sydney that the difficulty in dealing with this matter arises from the fact that glue and gelatine, although different products, approach each other so closely that there is a point at which one cannot be distinguished from the other. Large quantities of gelatine are used for making edible jellies, and only the .best class of gelatine ought to be used for that purpose. Large quantities of a highly-refined glue, which costs perhaps &#163;2 a tom more than ordinary glue for industrial purposes, have been imported and used for edible purposes. If the honorable member&#39;s suggestion were adopted that description of glue would be imported, and used as gelatine. </para>

              <para>- No, because it is impossible to tell where glue ends and gelatine begins. If it were possible to separate them there would be great force in what the honorable member has said about the difference in the price of the articles, but, as a matter of fact, low-class gelatine is very little dearer than high-class glue. That is the practical difficulty, and I think that the proposal of the Minister is reasonable, and ought to be accepted. </para>

              <para>- Yes, but the honorable member for Mernda has pointed out that there is a superior kind of glue which in point of quality nearly approaches gelatine. Even if that be so, the Department have the power to fix their own standards, and therefore they could easily .distinguish between the two articles for edible purposes. If it is true that this superior quality of glue is being used for the purpose of making lollies, the sooner that practice is stopped the better&#39;. But we ought not to tax to the extent of 50 per cent, one of the raw materials of our industries. That does not seem to me to be the right alternative. The alternative should be rather more vigorous and vigilent inspection of glue,: and the fixing of a definite standard for gelatine. </para>

            <para>.- The honorable member for Parramatta has used a very good revenue-raising argument, but not a very good protectionist one. It is not a question of taxing an article according to its quality, but a question of imposing a duty on articles which can be made here, and allowing others to come in free, if possible. The highest class of gelatine cannot be made here, and therefore it ought to be free. Glue is made all over Australia, and in such quantities that no duty is likely to affect the price of it.  If it were possible, I should like a duty of 2d. per lb. to be imposed on the cheaper class of glue, and the higher class of glue to be admitted free, but as the honorable member for Parramatta has pointed out, in some cases it is very difficult to distinguish between superior glue and gelatine. In view of that fact, the only logical course for me to pursue is to support a duty of 2d. per lb. all roundAl though it means  a  low rate on the highpriced goods, still it is quite in consonance with my attitude throughout, and that has been to admit free any &#39; goods which cannot be made here. </para>

            <para>.- As the raw material of glue and gelatine exists in Australia, this may be regarded as a true native industry, and ought to have substantial protection. That is why the A section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 20 per cent. We had a considerable amount of difficulty in deciding the question. We were informed by a Sydney manufacturer that glue ranges in price from ^28 to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;60</inline> per ton. We considered that it would be very unfair to impose a fixed duty on an article having such a wide range of values. Accordingly we suggested an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 30 per cent., so that there might be no inequality in the incidence of the duty. We also considered that glue and gelatine should be treated alike, and charged duty at the same rate, because we were informed by another Sydney witness that an analyst could not say at what point glue becomes gelatine, or <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> One witness said that he had sometimes imported gelatine as glue. </para>

            <para>.If the Committee decides upon a duty of 2d. per lb., an alteration should be made in the duty on printers&#39; roller composition, because gelatine is the raw material from which that composition is made. The old duty on printers&#39; roller composition was 20 per cent. Even an expert cannot determine the quality of roller composition without an actual trial. It is impossible to look at that material and say forthwith whether it is of good 01 inferior quality. It has to be used, perhaps, for a period extending over some weeks to test its value. If the Minister agrees to accept a fixed duty at so much per lb., I will ask him to make the duty on roller composition, in accord with it, 4d. per pound. </para>

            <para>- - The honorable member for Bendigo is quite right in the description which he gives of the products under discussion. Glue and gelatine are derived from the same substances, and they represent simply different stages of one manufacture. But I feel in&#39; a difficulty about this matter, because there is one sort of gelatine that is imported and used very largely, and which cannot be made in this country. I have reason to believe that it will be used more largely in the future than it is now. I allude&#34; to that which is imported for photographic purposes, to form the emulsion placed upon photographic plates and films. That material is made by only one manufacturer in Great Britain, and his product is not the best. The best quality is made on the Continent of Europe, and it is only made there in the depth of winter. In fact, the temperature has to be below freezing point before the manufac ture can be carried on. Would the Minister prefer that this gelatine should be placed on the exemption list or be dealt with now? </para>

              <para>- It is possible to differentiate between the higher class of gelatine and medium classes. Indeed, the medium class of gelatine is used for domestic purposes, whilst the higher class is only used in the circumstances which I have described. If the Minister would prefer that the matter should be dealt with when we are considering the exemptions, I will bring it up later on. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JOHNSON</inline>(Lang) &#91;9.50J.- It is  unfortunate that the Minister will not accept a fair and reasonable compromise when it is suggested to him. The proposal of the honorable member, for Bendigo is fanpreferable to that of the Minister, and I should be prepared to support it as against the Treasurer&#39;s proposal. There ought to be a differentiation, because, notwithstanding what has been said to the contrary, glue and gelatine are different compounds altogether, although they are both made  from the same basic materials. The labour cost in a ton of gelatine of &#163;80 value would be from &#163;^15 to &#163;18, according to the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Meister,</inline> question 94592. The gelatine imported in 1903 was of an invoice value of &#163;151 per lon. In 1.904 the value was &#163;108 per ton - see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Meister&#39;s</inline> evidence, question 94610. There is consequently an immense difference between the value of this article and that of common glue. Gelatine can be manufactured locally for from &#163;75 to &#163;90 per ton ; and from &#163;125 to &#163;130 for thick and thin sheets respectively - see question 94613. Taking these values, it appears that the proposed duty of 40 per cent, is equal to from &#163;43 4s. to. &#163;52 per ton, and that no duty is required to enable this article to be manufactured at much lower ra.tes in Australia than in Europe. The former duty of 2d. per lb., or &#163;18 13s. 4d. per ton, was equal to only 14 to 17 per cent. I shall not propose an amendment, but will support the duties suggested by the honorable member for Bendigo, namely, 30 and 25 per cent. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir JOHN</inline>QUICK (Bendigo) &#91;9.55J.-  I will ask the Treasurer to agree to duties of 30 and 25 per cent., which will meet all the requirements. At the same time, I must say that I could not. agree to the SUL- gestion that gelatine should be free. There is a strong request that it should be made dutiable. </para>

              <para>- It was not accepted by the Treasurer until the honorable member for Lang said that he approved if it. Then the Treasurer accepted it. The original purpose in accepting duties of 2d. and  i&#163;d.  per lb. instead of 40 and 30 per cent, was that the Treasurer considered that the former were more advisable duties. Yet after a .long argument he has abandoned the position altogether, and says that he will agree to duties of 30 and 25 per cent, instead of 40 and 30 per cent., as originally proposed. I take it that the Treasurer knows something about his own Tariff. </para>

              <para>- Then I understand that the Treasurer is abandoning the proposed duties of 40 and 30&#39; per cent., because he thinks that he cannot carry them. If we are going to have a Tariff made by leading members of the Opposition, let us understand that. But if we are going to have what is supposed to be a protectionist Tariff, the Treasurer should not so readily abandon his proposals. The honorable member for Mernda said that there was not sufficient distinction between glue and gelatine for the ordinary importer or for the Customs officers to be able to differentiate. Yet now he is urging the Treasurer to allow gelatine to be imported free. Speaking as an expert, he told the Committee that it is almost impossible to distinguish between the better kinds of glue and the inferior kinds of gelatine. </para>

The Minister was prepared to impose an all-round duty of  2d.,  and I was ready to accept that rather than have time occupied unduly. Now, however, the Minister seems desirous of imposing a duty of  30  per cent., which would be equivalent to a duty of  6d.  per lb. I cannot assent to that, and I am surprised that the members of the Opposition urged the imposition of such a duty. </para>

            <para>.- I hope that the honorable member for Macquarie will not insist on his objection. If members generally were to exercise their right to object to the withdrawal of amendments, the first maro who rose to speak would have the Committee at his mercy, because he could move such an amendment as would preclude others from putting propositions before it, and we should cease to be a deliberative assembly. If the objection is persisted in, I shall advise my friends to vote against the amendment. </para>

            <para>. - In my opinion,  2d.  per lb. would be a suitable rate to agree to. Such a rate would prohibit the importation of glue, which can be made here, and would not materially increase the price of gelatine, which cannot. Those interested in the manufacture of roller composition for printers&#39; work have informed me that the proposed duty of  2d.  per lb. - the old rate - will not affect its price. If we allow the Minister&#39;s amendment to be withdrawn, we run the risk of a higher rate being proposed.If I am assured that the duty will not be increased, I shall withdraw my objection. </para>

The honorable member for Macquarie says that he objects to the withdrawal of my amendment because he fears that the duty may be raised.

            <para>With regard to gelatine, it may be stated that at the present time very little is made in the Commonwealth. There is made a small quantity in South Australia, and even that little is hard to sell at a reasonable price, because it is Colonial made, and cannot compete with the imported as long as gelatine can be imported so cheaply. Any quantity of raw material is to be had, but it is exported, because under the present Tariff it would be madness to touch this line of manufacturing, which could give a lasting occupation to a good number of hands ; but no man of business would put in about ?8,000 or ?10,000 when he can foresee that every penny of it must belost. The whole quantity of gelatine consumed in the Commonwealth could easily be manufactured here, but nothing can be done without raising the duty to 4d. per lb. </para>

              <para>- I do not know whether it can or cannot be made in England, but I do know that it can be made in Australia. The proprietors of the Australian Glue and Gelatine Works at Alexandria, in answer to a number of questions which I put to them, stated that they were manufacturing glue and gelatine, and that the imports amounted to  &#163;17,000 per annum. The question of whether we should have a high or a low Tariff is not of vital importance to me as a policy. I have voted a good many times with the Government, when I might have voted just as readily against them; but I absolutely object to the moulding of the Tariff being placed in the hands of the Opposition. Whilst I am prepared to assist in passing it with reasonable despatch, I hold that for the sake of saving a little time we ought not to be deterred from doing the work effectively. </para>

Why should it be neglected, whilst others that chanced to be affected by items appearing earlier in the Tariff have received the fullest consideration? </para>

              <para>- I shall not pursue the matter further than to point out that the honorable member for Lang has already referred at considerable length to the statements made by cardboard bpx manufacturers with respect to the duty on glue. The Government have claimed that the Tariff as submitted is uniform and symmetrical. They should therefore stand by their proposal to give a substantial protection to encourage the manufacture of gelatine and glue. The new protection proposals will conserve the interests of the consumers and the workers in the industry, and on that understanding I am prepared to vote for reasonable duties on gelatine and glue. </para>

Printing roller composition can be and is being made here in any quantity, and of better quality,, than very much of what is imported. I happen to know from experience that locally-made roller composition is equal to and cheaper than the best that is imported, whilst those who are  engaged in the manufacture of the article are quite prepared to adhere to present prices. </para>

            <para>. - The previous item deals with slate slabs, split, with rough edges. That is the raw material. The slate in this item is partially manufactured, and in most cases practically wholly manufactured. When I was Minister of Trade and Customs I had a great deal of trouble over this question, and fought the people interested in this article and in marble. Under the previous classification they practically brought in their mantlepieces and tables with nothing more to be done to them except to smooth the edges and polish them. I must oppose the amendment. This classification has been prepared with a full knowledge of what has previously happened, and of what the effect will be. They are allowed to bring in the split blocks with rough edges, but surely we can do the rest of the work here. </para>

              <para>- Does the PostmasterGeneral not know that there is twenty times the work provided on the marble after it is quarried than is provided in the quarrying of it? In big centres like Melbourne and Sydney it is easy to obtain&#39; marble from the quarries, but in the more distant parts of the Commonwealth the cost of conveyance would be greater than that of the marble itself. No one can say that a duty of  to  per cent, can have any protective incidence, and it should be our desire to afford our sculptors an opportunity to obtain their raw material at as reasonable a rate as possible. </para>

            <para>.- What the honorable member for Wide Bay has said is perfectly true, and this marble ought to be on the free list. There is a local white marble, which is useful for a number of purposes ; but local sculptors of undoubted standing themselves say that it is altogether useless for the finer work of statuary. The local marble is not nearly so white as the imported marble, and, not being of so fine a grain, has a dark, rough appearance when finished. It is, moreover, full of small flint-like particles, which interfere considerably with its working. It is, however, quite possible that at a lower depth a better marble may be found. </para>

            <para>.- If the Treasurer will move in the direction of imposing a duty of 10 per cent, upon colored marble, I shall be prepared to support him. I unhesitatingly say that there is no white marble in the world except that which is found at Carrara. I know that some honorable members declare that white marble can be obtained at a dozen places in the Commonwealth. But in reality it is not a white but a creamy marble. Directly it is manufactured into statuary it&#39; does not retain its colour as does white imported marble. </para>

              <para>- No. The workmen are not satisfied that their raw material shall be taxed whilst the finished article is required to pay only a very small duty. They ask that the duty upon colored marble unwrought shall be 10 per cent., and that stone or white marble unwrought, including rough or scabbled from the pick, shall be admitted free. They want slabs or scantlings sawn on one or two faces te* be admitted free ; slabs or scantlings sawn on one or two faces, and one or more edges, to be made dutiable at 10 per cent., and the finished article at 45 per cent. I realize that there is no chance of carrying such proposals here. I believe that if a prohibitive duty should be imposed on any article it should be imposed on marble, because practically the whole value of the finished article lies in the labour. If we want to employ labour here we should see that a. high duty is put on dressed marble. I do not suppose that any honorable member on . the other side will put in a plea on behalf of the poor farmer that heshould have a monument duty free. </para>

Honorable members must know that they will not import the marble unless it is treated on one or two sides. Under my proposal, if adopted, our quarrymen would be able to get more work. Until it is sawn or dressed it isnot possible to tell whether the granite is good or not. </para>

I feel convinced that it would be in its best interests if the proposals I read were adopted. Apparently honorable members are anxious to put a duty on white marble when they know that there is only one place in the world where it can be obtained. I trust that the Minister, if he carries his proposal to put a duty of 10 per cent. on white marble, will agree to increase the duty on the finished article. Will he promise to do that? </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Will you please, when dealing with the duties on stone, use your influence and cast your vote in the interest of working masons by voting for a low duty on rough slabs and blocks of marble, so as to enable us to compete with the underpaid Italian workmen? Rough blocks of marble we would like to see on the free list, also slabs and scantlings. I may tell you that slabs and scantlings sawn on edges are of no advantage to us, as the sawn edges are liable to get chipped and broken, and we have to work the edges again. So if you would try to get  a, b, c  on the free list you will have the best wishes of every working mason in the Commonwealth. As regards wrought arid wrought ornamental,d ande, the duty of 30 and 35 per cent. does not matter so much. It is the raw material that we want to get in free. The duty on the cases in which marble and granite headstones and monuments are packed is a hard tax, as the cases are of no use to us, and are generally left in the cemetery after the headstone is unpacked. In conclusion, I may state that there is no white marble in the Commonwealth suitable for monumental work, or, at any rate, there is none on the market. There is a dovecoloured marble in New South Wales; but it is the white marble that we want, and until there is a local white marble on the market we would like to get our raw material as cheap as possible, so as to compete with the cheap labour of other countries. </para>

            <para>.- A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of paying a visit to the studio of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Summers.</inline> Until then I had not the remotest idea that such very fine marbles, especially coloured ones, were obtainable in Australia as were displayed in his studio. He, of course, is only interested in our marbles as a sculptor. He is not concerned in any quarries. Any duty which would render it more difficult for him to obtain his raw material would certainly be against his own interests, and therefore I placed great reliance on the statement which he made to myself and others. He declared that some of the white marbles which had been submitted to him, and which he had worked up, were as fine as he had obtained from anywhere else. He added&#34; that almost all marble quarries improved as they went down. </para>

As to the statement that there is no white marble in Australia, I have to say that white marble has been obtained in New South Wales. &#34;The Treasurer has taken an interest in the industry in his own State for many years past, and has arranged for several exhibitions of the marbles obtained there. Oft one occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Macarthy,</inline> of Sydney, fooled the public with what be called a marble man. That was done with marble obtained in the neighbourhood of Orange - at Cow Flat. The block was so white that many people took it to be a petrified man. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Macquarie &#39; must admit that the more marble quarries are worked, the better the quality becomes. So far as concerns the item under consideration, the honorable member for Grampians said that the working masons want articles in paragraphs  a, b  and c to Le free. But there are other artisans employed in the industry besides the masons. There is the marble worker to consider. He wants protection as against the cheap labour of Italy. The marble workers prepare the slabs, finish them and polish them. It is a very important industry, indeed - far more important than that of the working mason or the monumental mason who turns the finished marble into tombstones. As under the old Tariff there was a duty of 10 per cent, on the rough marble, I shall vote for such a duty in this Tariff ; and I shall also vote for duties in connexion with paragraphs  b,  c, and  d,  in order to give assistance to a class of very hard-working men, who have to compete against some of the cheapest labour in the world. </para>

              <para>- There is a great deal of labour in chiselling and polishing. The duty of 10 per cent, on unwrought marble is not in the interest of the marble worker, but of the marble quarries of Australia. There are several quarries in New South Wales. Paragraphs  b,  c, and  d  are in the interests of the marble worker. The only paragraph to which I object is paragraph  e,  wrought ornamental marble, upon which the duty is 35 per cent. I should like to see it reduced to 30 per cent. The difference between the duty in paragraph c, 20 per cent., and that in paragraph  e,  35 per cent., is too great. I shall vote for a duty of 30 per cent, in paragraph  e. </para>

              <para>- There is absolutely no chance of getting that marble down to Melbourne until a railway has been built. That being the case, what the honorable member for Yarra says is quite correct - that a duty of 10 per cent, would simply be a tax on the raw material of men whose business it is to work up marble. I shall therefore vote with the honorable member in this case. I also believe that slabs or scantlings should be free. The marble has to be sawn before it can be used. I am advised by monumental masons that there should be no duty on account of the material covered by paragraph c. The same remark applies to that specified in paragraph  b.  When these men work up the imported marble, they have to take the edges off, because in coming out from Italy it gets chipped. Before &#39;it can be made into tombstones, the edges and faces have to be reworked. I shall therefore support the honorable member for Yarra as to the contents of paragraphs  a, b,  and  c.  As to  paragraph f,  dealing with dust and chips, I shall vote to leave the Tariff as it stands. I have seen the pay-sheets of these men, and can say that they are paid really splendid wages, and &#34;have nothing- to complain about. </para>

            <para>. - I understand that the honorable member for Wide Bay is willing to accept the suggestion of the honorable member for Yarra, and to allow white marble to be imported free. I have given some study to this question, and I should feel very proud as an Australian if a block of Australian white marble could be carved into a statue. I may remark that the statue of Queen Victoria standing in Queen&#39;s Hall is generally supposed to be carved from one piece of marble. But when I was in Europe I was told that the headpiece was simply let in, and that the statue was a fraud to that extent. When it was being shifted from one end of Queen&#39;s Hall to the other, I determined to get up and have a look at it, in order to verify that statement. An attempt was made to prevent me, but I was determined, and I found that the statement was true. With regard to what the honorable member for Laanecoorie has said. I think he is aware that when I was a member of the State Parliament I obtained justice for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Summers,</inline> who had been wronged for fourteen years in consequence of infamous treatment by the State Government. He was robbed for some years of the money which he should have received for the four statues which stand in front of the Exhibition Building, and has not been paid even interest on it. Indeed, he was barely saved from the claw of the great Lansell, of Bendigo. Loving this country as every Australian does, I should be glad to learn of the discovery of a real white marble here. Attempts to find such marble have been made in every country in the world. I have not heard of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Summers</inline> making a statue of Australian marble; at any rate, he has not honoured me with an invitation to see it. A much greater sculptor in our community - the man who for the first time in the history of the English Academy won the prize for both painting and sculpture, and who modelled the monument above the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper - does not use Australian marble. How many statues are made in Australia? God knows that the sculptors have a hard time here. I have stood as a model to sculptors in London who I knew had scarcely bread to eat. Bates, whose head I lent to the National Gallery, and who has left perhaps the greatest name in England of late years, although he died prematurely, is one of. these. Australia, is not kind to its artists. Anvone who knows anything about them knows how hard it is for them to make ends meet. If white marble is wanted for statues, the only place where it can be got is Carrara, in Italy. The nearest approach to such marble that I have seen in Australia has been cream coloured. I ask the Committee to allow real white marble to be imported free of duty. By all means, let us tax other marble. : </para>

            <para>. - The honorable member for Melbourne says that he has stood as a model for the sculptors in the Old Country; but I hope that if ever an appreciative country does me the honour to raise a statue to my memory it will be made of Australian marble. We have in South Australia and in Gippsland white marble which is quite as good as is necessary. In South Australia there is a statue of my national poet, Burns, executed in Australian white marble ; and another of one of the greatest men who ever set foot on this country, John McDouall Stuart, also made of Australian marble. If statues like that can be made of Australian marble, the local stone should be good enough for any one who wishes  10  have a monument erected to his memory. It is white enough for the whitest man who ever lived on Australian soil. </para>

            <para>.- Angaston marble is fit for all the purposes for which marble is required here, and I am very surprised to hear Victorian protectionists advocating the importation of tombstones free.&#39; The Angaston marble is very valuable, and the South Australian Government is proposing to build a railway to the locality where it&#39; is found.  There are some of the .finest marble quarries in the world there. The face is as high as the gallery, and slabs of very fine stone,  18  to  20  feet long, can be cut The deposit of marble starts at Second Valley, runs through Macclesfield and Angaston, and crosses the Broken Hill railway line at Paratoo. That belt is  170  miles long, and has been opened up in only two or three places, so that even better quarries than are now open may yet be discovered. The marble is good enough for all the purposes for which we need such stone. </para>

            <para>.- The Committee seems almost unanimous as to the advisability of admitting duty free unwrought white marble. With the exception of the quarry-owners, most of the witnesses who appeared before the Tariff Commission suggested that this marble should be admitted duty- free. As to coloured marble, the evidence is contradictory. The value of the monuments imported last year was only about &#163;838, and if forty masons had been employed in making them, they would not have earned more than &#163;20 each. The weight and bulk of monuments protect local makers from competition. The best Italian marble costs 10s. or 12s. per cubic foot; that would be free of duty. On the other hand, the Angaston marble can be delivered at Adelaide at a cost of about 4s. 6d. per cubic foot, so that no duty would cause the latter to be substituted for the Italian. The very fact that the price of Australian marble is at the present time so much lower than is that of the imported marble shows that the duty is not likely to affect the choice. The petition circulated amongst honorable members praying that the old duty should not be increased was signed by more than 95 per cent. of the monumental, marble, and granite trade of Australia. </para>

              <para>- We have to consider the petition as sent to us. It sets out that the cost of importing marble and granite averages about 40 per cent. or 50 per cent., and that under the old duty the native marble enjoyed a protection of from 60 per cent . to 70 per cent. In the face of these facts, I fail to see why the duty should be increased. It seems to me that we should be disposed, on the contrary, to place this marble on the freelist. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Barrier suggests that it needs only a duty to turn Australian marble white, and I am beginning to think that there is something in the contention. I have seen a good many marble deposits in Australia, but have never come across a deposit of pure white marble, and am afraid that I cannot hope to see in Australia a deposit equal to those of Carrara. I wish it were otherwise. </para>

          <para class="block">This item covers the raw material which is put into the hands of monumental masons to be worked up. It is the sawn edges of the slabs or scantlings that have to be worked up by the local masons. I can assure honorable members that my proposal is in accordance with the evidence of practical men who are earning their living by the making of tombstones. The matter is of great importance to the men engaged at this work. The industry is not one in which there is any sweating, because the monumental masons, I know, receive excellent wages. </para>

            <para>. - This question stands very much on the same footing as the proposal which the Committee adopted with regard to plate glass, that anything under  25  feet, being the raw material of bevellers and glassworkers, should come in free. In this case, however, it is not asked that the article should be free, as a duty has been put on the crude .material. It is simply requested that the raw material for the workers in this industry should bear the same duty as the previous article. The Committee, having accepted the principle in the case of plate glass, should accept this proposal for the same reason. </para>

Honorable members opposite were anxious for the work to be done here, and the marble to be produced here. Any importers who bring the marble in will have to see that it is good. The duty in paragraph c could be increased, as it will mean that more work will be done here, and as a&#39; duty has been put on the raw material the duty in paragraph  e  could be increased also. </para>

            <para>.- This amendment would do a great injustice to those manufacturers who have gone to the great expense of- laying down sawing machines. It means admitting the sawn scantling at the same rate as the rough blocks. &#39; That means interfering with those who do the sawing here. Very strong evidence was given in every State on this point before the Tariff Commission. I am surprised at the honorable member for Yarra . supporting such a proposal. </para>

            <para>- I point out to the honorable member that the bells were rung, and I put the question. I had appointed the tellers, who had gone so far in their count as to reach the honorable member where he was standing ; so that he could not have moved into his place so soon as he heard my voice. As the honorable member was standing in the gangway - whereas he ought to have been seated on one side or the other - I did not know on which side to count him, and, therefore, I ordered that he. ought not to be counted at all. I further point out that whatever conversations go on under such circumstances are irregular ; and, if such irregularities are allowed, the divisions will become a farce. That is a result which I as the officer responsible for the proper conduct of business cannot allow. </para>

I have no doubt that we shall be told that the scheme of the Tariff is all right, and should be adhered to ; but I think that both the Treasurer and the honorable member for Bendigo will admit that the stone which represents the greater amount of work should not be admitted at the lower rate. </para>

            <para>. - In imposing this dutv the Treasurer is placing a tax on the raw material of another manufacture with which we shall have to deal under another item. It is quite possible to make carbonic acid gas out of chips of marble, and under this Tariff it is proposed to levy a duty of 2d. per lb. on carbonic acid gas. It is absolutely ridiculous that a duty should be proposed on marble dust and chips, which are the raw material for the manufacture of another commodity. Probablv the honorable member for Corangamite can enlighten the Committee about this duty more than either the Treasurer or the honorable member for Bendigo has done. </para>

            <para>. - I think that the Committee will act wisely if thev keep marble dust and chips off the free list. The monumental mason has to import the marble at a high price, and he ought to be given a chance to make all the profit he can out of the chips which he breaks off. There is a considerable use for the chips. For instance, they are used in making pavements, and also in covering graves. In my opinion the Treasurer has done right in imposing a duty, because it will give a chance to the local marble workers to make a little profit. </para>

            <para>. - The extreme levity which has been introduced by certain honorable members is not creditable to them. This is a grave question, and I am surprised that a doctor, who has so much to do with committing persons to their last resting places should find fault with the duty. Had he any sympathy with the relatives of those persons he would not hesitate to protect the material which covers their last home . If the honorable member for Parramatta had any svmpathy with bereaved persons he would not attempt to dispute the item. These chips are practically part and parcel of an article on which a duty has been imposed to-night. The dust is used for the purpose of putting a polish on tombstones. There is a lack of sympathy shown by honorable members on the Opposition side on this very grave question. </para>

          <para>. - What is the use of adjourning until11 o&#39;clock? Why not meet at half-past10 o&#39;clock if we are to meet in the morning at all? The extra half-hour is not worth while bothering about. We have now had two late sittings in succession; and I want to say plainly to the Treasurer that if he does not control the business within more reasonable hours we shall either have to have longer sittings when we are about it, or do more business before11 o&#39;clock at night. This is right down sheer brutality. That is what I call it. </para>

I, for one, shall decline to sit these long hours,&#39; and if he insists upon such sittings, the Minister must take the responsibility of what occurs. That is all that I have to say. I decline to be kept here for fourteen hours at a stretch when we could get through the business in much less time and with great advantage to all concerned. To-day, the Minister kept us for four hours which might have been saved to the conduct of public business. Time and again he has sat in his chair for a couple of hours at a stretch when there has only been a question of ft paltry 5 per cent. dividing honorable members. It is unfair to keep the House sitting for fourteen or fifteen hours at a stretch in this way, and I tell the Treasurer again that I do not intend to put up with it. </para>
