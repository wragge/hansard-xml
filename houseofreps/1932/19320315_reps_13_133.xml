          <para>It was revealed to-day that during the discussion in the Country party, of the campaign against the new tobacco duties, a move was  made  to expel <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gregory</inline> (Western Australia) for his opposition to the leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page ) .</inline></para>
          <para>The trouble arose over <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gregory&#39;s</inline> hostility to the campaign for the old high rates of protection for the tobacco industry. </para>
          <para>After a heated debate, a motion was put forward that the party should unanimously support <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gregory</inline>indignantly opposed this, stating that, in no circumstances, would he accept it. He also complained about the propaganda being put out on behalf of the Country party,  and said that it did not square with the Country party&#39;s platform or pledges. </para>
          <para>The motion for his expulsion was then put forward, and, although this was defeated, by the intervention of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Paterson,</inline> a state of high  tension exists within the Country party ranks. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That statement is an absolute fabrication. The expulsion of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> was not even discussed.

          <para>- I rise to a personal explanation. I desire that my attitude to the tobacco duties shall be clearly understood. A proposal was made at a meeting of the Country party that it should support a certain motion; I declined to be bound by it. There was some objection to my action, but there is no ground for the suggestion that my expulsion from the Country party was moved. Throughout I endorsed the Government&#39;s action regarding the tobacco duties. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>By last&#34; mail was received from the High Commissioner&#39;s Office a statement containing the formulae disclosed by M. Spahlinger of his anti-tuberculosis remedies. The actual text of the disclosure is attached. </para>
            <para>It is to be noted that the formulae relate only to vaccines to be administered to - for the preventive vaccination of the animals or humans, respectively, against tuberculosis. No remedy for the treatment of tuberculosis in a human is included. </para>
            <para>The preventive vaccination of human beings against tuberculosis is a development recently introduced in some European countries, but the department considers that this procedure must be further considered. The directions given in the formula supplied are not complete enough to permit of such deliberation; consequently it is proposed to defer action in this direction until further information has been sought. The vaccination of apparently healthy persons against tuberculosis is not a procedure which can be adopted in this country without very careful consideration. </para>
            <para>Concerning the vaccination of bovine animals against tuberculosis, the formula will be placed before the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and a discussion will take place as to the practicability or advisability of proceeding with the preparation of a vaccine. </para>
            <para>It is, however, necessary to point out that the formulae are expressed only in the most general terms, are incomplete, and that the preparation of these substances requires at least one year; and it is greatly to be regretted that, after all the&#39; discussion which has occurred during the last ten years about the cures which Spahlinger is stated to have effected, the formulae disclosed do not contain any reference to the treatment of persons affected with tuberculosis. </para>

            <para>- It has frequently been stated that, if necessary, the Government will not hesitate to ration the imports of tobacco to an extent sufficient to ensure the consumption of the saleable portion of this year&#39;s Australian tobacco crop. Any action in that direction would be by means of a proclamation. Obviously, there would be some loss of duty, inasmuch as the total impost on imported leaf is less than that on Australian leaf. </para>

            <para>- It would be improper for the Commonwealth Government 1o make representations to the British Government as to the administration of its Pensions Act with regard to ex-soldiers. This Government would certainly resent similar representations being made to it by the Imperial Government. The matter is purely a domestic one, and I cannot give the honorable member the undertaking that he seeks. If imperial exsoldiers admitted to citizenship of the Commonwealth become a burden on this Government, their case must be dealt with under the general rules that govern application for an invalid or other pension. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Is the Treasurer aware that, since the Commonwealth Bank obtained control of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales, many persons who had obtained advances for house-building from the rural credits branch, and had paid their instalments regularly for five years, have been threatened with eviction because, owing to unemployment, they cannot maintain their payments? I have been informed that some of the houses thus compulsorily vacated have fallen into disrepair, and the security of the bank is diminishing considerably. Will the Treasurer inquire whether the purchasers who arc temporarily embarrassed can be allowed to continue in occupation of their homes until their circumstances improve? </para>

In the circumstances, and having regard particularly to the fact that certain negotiations are pending in relation to Newnes, I regret that it is not possible to comply with the request. </para>

The matter is one which comes within the administrative activities of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. The position is that certain additional information regarding the matter is at present being sought by the department through the officer-in-charge, Federal and Naval Coal Stocks, Newcastle. As soon as this information is to hand, further consideration will be given to the representations which have been made, and it is hoped that early action to finalize the matter will be possible. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>My Government has been giving the most earnest consideration to the question of the re-absorption into employment of those who are unemployed in Australia to-day. This question transcends in importance all other matters that occupy the attention of governments at the present time. As a result of its deliberations, my Government is convinced that the problem can be grappled successfully only if it is approached from two distinct angles. The first of these necessitates the adoption of a policy that has as its objective the maintenance and expansion of both our primary and secondary industries, with a consequent increase in the avenues of employment for our people. The rapidity with which results will flow from such a policy depends upon steps being taken upon an international basis to rehabilitate the general financial and economic situation and bring about an advance in world commodity prices. The second concerns the possibility of immediate action to tide over the period which must inevitably elapse before results can be expected from the first line of approach. The slump, particularly in capital construction of all kinds, is so great that only a common effort can give the needed momentum to a recovery. In this effort governments will probably play an important part. Insofar as that part involves expenditure it is conditioned by the amount of money governments can provide for such a purpose. This question is closely bound up with the state of budgets in view of the fact that deficits are being financed by short-dated loans. There are obvious limitations to the short-term finance that can beneficially be provided, and the general financial situation gives little prospect of the  raising  of long-term loans. </para>
            <para>It is recognized that reliable budget forecasts for the financial year 1932-33 cannot be made until June at the earliest. At the same time, m3&#39; Government feels that action towards the alleviation of employment is too urgent for so long a delay. It, therefore, suggests that a conference of Premiers and Treasurers be held in Melbourne on Tuesday, 12th April, to consider steps which may be taken to assist in the solution of the unemployment problem. As it is imperative that some information should be available to such a conference with regard to the budgetary position for 1932-33, my Government further suggests that tentative estimates should be prepared upon the basis of the expenditure for the present year, and the existing sources of revenue and the incidence of taxation. I would point out that such estimates are only for the purpose of obtaining an indication of the trend of public finance and arc not contemplated as a basis for the consideration of the requirements of governments for the year 1932-33. My Government has in contemplation that a further meeting of Premiers should be held at the beginning of June, when in the light of the more authoritative information that will then be available the budget estimates for the year 1932-33 could be considered. In preparing the tentative estimates it is not proposed, owing to the shortness of the time available, and the expense involved, to call a meeting of Under Treasurers. It will, however, of course be imperative that such a .meeting should take place before the holding of the June conference. In order to assist the Premiers Conference in April, my Government suggests that a special committee be appointed immediately to make a preliminary survey of the economic problem as a basis &#34;for discussion at the conference. This committee, in addition to making suggestions and recommendations in relation to the ultimate objective of the complete reabsorption into employment of our people, would also deal with the question of how best governments can assist immediately in alleviating the present situation. With regard to the latter point they should be asked to advise generally whether a useful initial impetus towards a general revival would be given by any form of government action, either directly or in co-operation with private enterprise. In this connection they would consider such questions as what are the latent financial resources, which might be utilized for the immediate provision of avenues of employment; whether it is preferable to use them by the means of short or long term borrowing; in what proportion such borrowing should be allocated to the meeting&#39; of budgetary deficits and to the creation of avenues of employment. </para>
            <para>It is thought that the most effective work would be done by a small committee; that the most suitable personnel would be two business men and the four economists who were signatories to the report which was presented to the Premiers Conference last year. In view of the limited time available, it is not practicable to delay the appointment of the committee pending consultation with all governments as to its personnel. My Government, therefore, proposes that the committee be immediately constituted, and that the personnel be Messrs. C. H. Reading, of Sydney; G. S. Coleman, of Melbourne, and Professors Copland, Giblin, Melville, and Shann. Owing to Professor Copland&#39;s absence from Australia at the moment, he will be unable to act immediately, but it is hoped that his assistance will be available in the later stages of the committee&#39;s deliberations. </para>
            <para>I trust that you will be prepared to concur in these proposals, and I should greatly appreciate a reply by telegram at your earliest convenience. I shall also be glad if you will be good enough to arrange for information to be supplied to the committee relevant to the subjects that are to be considered. The headings under which information is required will be sent immediately and it is hoped that as much of this as is possible will be supplied at the earliest practicable date. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - A few days ago, I received&#39; from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins and the other members of the Central Wool Committee, the final report of that body, and I think it appropriate that I, as Prime Minister, should publicly acknowledge on behalf of the Government and the people of the Commonwealth, the debt of gratitude that we owe to the  chairman  and members of the Central Wool Committee, the  chairman  and members of each of the State Wool Committees, and to all of those technical advisers, honorary insurance advisers, and officials who have contributed, each in his respective sphere, towards the successful completion of what can only be described as a gigantic task. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Commonwealth of Australia Central Wool Committee was appointed in 1916 to control, under the direction of the Prime Minister, the administration of the War Precautions Wool and Sheepskins Regulations. </para>
        <para> It was necessary,, during those dark days of war, that the nation&#39;s principal  source of wealth should be adequately protected, and that the sale of our chief primary product should be effected under the best possible conditions obtainable for Australia. The Central Wool Committee has done both of those things. I think that we must all agree that the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who was the leader of the Government of the Commonwealth during that important period of our history, displayed true wisdom in his choice of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins to guide the destinies of the central wool organization. </para>
        <para>The .outstanding position which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins had won for himself in the commercial life of Australia afforded  every justification for optimism as to the outcome of the committee&#39;s work. I go further, and say that his chairmanship of the committee was from the outset a guarantee that the huge task entrusted to the committee would be discharged with the conspicuous ability that had distinguished <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John&#39;s</inline> previous career. </para>
        <para>It must not be forgotten that the whole of the work of the Central Wool Committee, as well as that of the State Wool Committees, from the time of their initiation in November, 1916, has been performed by the members in an honorary capacity. I feel, therefore, that, while our gratitude to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins is great indeed, we should acknowledge also our obligation to those patriotic Australians who, without financial recompense, devoted so much time and energy to the important work assigned to them. </para>
        <para>From beginning to end the enormous wool and sheepskins transactions of the Central Wool Committee, which amounted to no less a sum than &#163;242,689,899, were conducted without cost to the funds of the Commonwealth, the whole of the expenditure being borne by the interests concerned. </para>
        <para>I do not propose to make any detailed explanation of the scheme under which our wool was sold through the committee, as we are now chiefly concerned with the result of the committee&#39;s work. </para>
        <para>The following epitome of the monetary transactions relating to the acquisition of Australian wool and sheepskins by the British Government through the committee, reveals the magnitude of the operations: - </para>

        <para>The Commonwealth Government  is  glad to know that the services of its officers have merited and received the approbation of the committee. These officers effectively seconded the members of the central committee and the members of the various State committees, and contributed in no small measure to the success of the- committee in carrying out what has been described as the largest wool transaction in the history of the world, as well as the biggest commercial transaction conducted during the war period through the agency of the Commonwealth Government. </para>

          <para>. - I offer no objection to this bill, because I feel that the proposed amendments are desirable and necessary for the proper administration of the act, and to carry out the intentions of Parliament when that legislation was enacted. The act has not been administered detrimentally to purchasers or borrowers under it. The object of the bill is to validate regulation 17, which has been in operation since 1921. That regulation makes provision for the recovery of instalments of purchase money due to the War Service Homes Commissioner where the contract for sale has been cancelled under section 36 of the act. The bill places beyond all doubt the position of the Commissioner regarding the powers which he has exercised since the commencement of the act. A judgment of the Supreme Court of Victoria in December last revealed that certain doubts existed in respect of the power exercised by the Commissioner. The object of this measure is to remove that and other anomalies. The administration of the War Service Homes Act has been most sympathetic, and I take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the sympathetic manner in which all matters brought by me under the notice of the department have been treated by the Commissioner and his officers in New-- </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">South Wales. The purchasers of war service homes have been fortunate in being able, by making a nominal deposit, to purchase homes under the act, and they have no cause for complaint in respect of any matters that they have placed before the Commissioner for his consideration. Recently, however, the financial stringency has forced many occupants to vacate their homes. Others, although endeavouring to meet their obligations, are looking to the Government for some relief. The statement of the Minister last week that a special committee of inquiry is to be appointed, was most timely, and I congratulate the Government on its action. I am confident that the committee, as  a result of its inquiries, will submit a useful and valuable report which, when presented to this House, will give honorable members an opportunity to review all matters affecting the administration of Avar service homes. I am particularly pleased that the Government is not going outside the Commonwealth Public Service in appointing the personnel of this committee. We are extremely fortunate indeed that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Treloar,</inline> who at present is direc-tor  of the Australian War Memorial, has been appointed. He is a young public servant who has had a distinguished career. Knowing his qualifications, I believe that he and those associated with him on the committee - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> C. Thomas, sub-accountant of the Commonwealth Treasury, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> C. Allen, investigating officer of the Taxation Department; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smale,</inline> the secretary of the committee - will submit to the Government -recommendations, which if given effect, will ensure fair and just treatment to the purchasers of war service homes. I welcome this innovation, because the appointment of the committee within the Public Service obviates the necessity for setting up some outside body at unnecessary expense. The purchasers of war service homes are, in respect of falling land values, in a predicament similar to that of purchasers of homes under various State housing schemes, and they are, therefore, looking to the Government for sympathetic treatment when the report of the sub-committee is made available. The existing unfortunate economic conditions have forced many of the occupants of war service homes to vacate them. The Commonwealth has provided out of its funds approximately 37,000 homes. That undoubtedly is a fine achievement. It shows that the Commonwealth has assisted returned soldiers to secure their own homes. Unfortunately, of that 37,000 homes, some 600 have been vacated, and have reverted to the commission. </para>

            <para>- That information is later than that contained in the last report of the commission. It shows the vital necessity for reviewing at the earliest opportunity the administration of war service homes. Of these 600 houses that had reverted to the commission about 300 were occupied by other tenants. That, of course, had minimized to some extent the loss incurred by the vacation of war Service homes. </para>

        <para>The bill contains a number of amendments to the act. One amendment is designed to allow the commissioner to let unoccupied houses. That practice has been carried on in the past although there has been some doubt as to its legality. The measure enables the commissioner to serve notices where the purchaser or borrower is deceased. In addition, it gives definitely to the commissioner certain other powers about which some doubt has previously existed. Since July, 1930, the Commonwealth Government has. not, so far as I can gather, made available any loans under the War Service Homes Act. Although there is justification for that action, it is regrettable that the Commonwealth has seen fit to discontinue such a laudable scheme, and is thus contributing to the depression in the building trade. I understand that the Scullin Government, in coming to its decision, was influenced by the increasing number of vacant homes, but despite that, I submit that for war service homes loans should be available to re-, turned men who are in a position which would justify the commissioner in making an advance. The building operations of the war service homes branch should be resumed at the earliest moment. Generally speaking, the returned men and war widows who have purchased homes under the act have played the game by meeting their obligations, and therefore their claims for relief should be given the fullest consideration by this Government. It is gratifying to note that when conditions in this country were normal only one per cent. of the instalments due were in arrears. To-day three per cent. of the instalments are in arrears. The manner in which the purchasers of war service homes have in the past met their obligations is satisfactory and commendable, and that fact shouldbe an incentive to this House, and to the Government particularly, to give them sympathetic consideration in this time of stress. </para>

        <para>Mr.RILEY. - It is not, but I dare say the percentage will increase. I am anxious that every consideration should be given to the occupants of war service homes, and I am sure that this bill will not operate to make their condition more irksome. While we all desire that sympathetic treatment should be accorded war service homes occupants, it is also necessary that the interests of the Commonwealth should be protected. It is for that purpose that this amending bill has been brought down. I am sure that the committee which has been set up will do what is fair both to the occupants of the homes and to the Commonwealth. </para>
        <para>I suggest that the Government, as a means of relieving unemployment, might consider extending the building operations of the War Service Homes Department. Unemployment is perhaps more serious in the building trade than in any other at the present time, and if the activities of the War Service Homes Department could be renewed, it would provide employment for many bricklayers, carpenters, and other tradesmen. In 1928-29, &#163;1,606,469 was voted for war service homes construction and purchase. In the following year the amount was reduced by nearly &#163;500,000, and stood at &#163;1,154,161, while for the year 1930-31 the sum expended was only &#163;157,613. I know of many ex-service men who wish to acquire homes, but owing to the policy embarked upon eighteen months ago, their claims are not receiving consideration. I hope that the Government, when considering the Estimates for next year, will recommend for war service homes construction an amount at least equal to that expended in 1929-30. I am sure that the independent committee which has been appointed to inquire into war service homes will furnish the Government with a valuable report. This bill is not intended to be comprehensive, and the matter will no doubt be brought before the House again when the committee&#39;s report is presented. </para>

          <para>.- Speaking as a returned soldier, I should like to express my appreciation of the speech of the honorable member who has just resumed his seat. He described the bill as being sympathetic as far as possible to the occupants of war service homes; I hope it will be. The Minister, when introducing the bill, described it as largely a machinery measure. The present is no time to do anything which will bear at all harshly on the occupants of war service homes. This bill deals with, among other matters, the taking possession of homes, and the effecting of repairs. I happen to know something of the construction of many war service homes, and while the commission should be given credit for exercising close supervision, there is no doubt that, during the early stages of war service homes construction, many homes were badly built. One series of homes of which I know were found, a few days after completion, to have been so badly built that it was necessary to ask for an inquiry. </para>

            <para>- Yes. I inspected some of the houses, and found that the bricks were of such poor quality that they could be rubbed away with the finger. I ascertained that for myself. In some cases, the window sashes were as much as 1&#188; inches out of plumb. It must be evident that the cost of maintenance and repairs for houses built in such a fashion must be unreasonably high. In another instance which came under my observation, the verandah was constructed by the contractor in such a way that rain water instead of running off it, ran back towards the door. This piece of work had been visited by the inspector, and had, apparently, been passed by him. </para>

        <para>The honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> said that payments on war service homes were only 3 per cent. in arrears. </para>
        <para class="block">That is a particularly good record. It is possible that the percentage will increase, because returned soldiers, like every one else, are under great disabilities at the present time. Many of these men, when they entered into obligations regarding homes, were earning four or five pounds a week. They are now earning, perhaps, two pounds a week, or are out of employment altogether. Many expected that when their families grew up they would be able to contribute something towards the cost of the home, whereas they now find that the members of their families are unable to get employment, an&#39;d have to be maintained. Clause 36 of the bill gives the commissioner power to take possession of homes, cancel contracts, and sue 1 for money if payments are three months overdue. This is not the time to pass a measure of that kind. </para>
        <para>Last week, I asked a question in the House regarding sewerage for war service homes. If the War Service Homes Commissioner has constructed houses in areas which are sewered, it is not right to leave them -unconnected with the sewerage system. In one instance, the municipal council has agreed to do the work of sewering the houses, and allow the occupants to pay the cost over an extended period. The council merely asks that the War Service Homes Department shall guarantee the cost. The Minister, in reply to my question, said that no money was available to make such a grant. I remind him that no grant is necessary. From its experience, the department need not expect a greater percentage of default than two or three per cent, at the most. Not only would the occupants of war service homes obtain tha benefit of sewerage if this plan were followed, but the work provided would go some way towards relieving unemployment. I also direct the attention of the Assistant Minister to the serious losses which occur when houses which revert to the control of the commission are left untenanted. Unfortunately, a practice has grown up in New South Wales, and, I suppose in the other States, among certain persons, to enter unoccupied houses and remove whatever they can, either .for their own use or for conversion into cash. </para>

            <para>- I did not say that it did. If these homes are to be protected, so that they may, if necessary, be sold at a reasonable price, it is bad policy on the part of the commission to allow them to become untenanted. It would pay to leave a tenant in possession, even if he is temporarily unable to meet his instalments, to keep the property in order, and prevent the wilful destruction which so often happens. </para>

            <para>- I shall do so. I do not suggest that the War Service Homes Commission, the previous Government, or this Government has been unsympathetic towards the occupants of war service homes; I am merely citing instances in which the regulations have operated  harshly towards occupants. Under the present proposals, the conditions are, I submit, likely to be harder than they have been in the past. If this is merely a machinery hill, it would appear that some of its provisions are hardly necessary at the present juncture. We are told that this measure is merely to facilitate the working of the act and the regulations framed under it; but I contend that it will make the conditions of occupants a little more difficult than they have been in the past. What is proposed should, I contend, have been deferred until conditions generally are a little more prosperous. </para>

          <para>.- Without giving the measure very close attention, it would appear that some of its provisions are innocuous. When I first heard that it was the intention of the Government to introduce an amending war service homes bill I assumed, without perhaps any ground for- the assumption, that it would afford relief to those occupying war service homes. An examination of the measure shows that it is a bill framed by a departmental official to validate regulation  17,  which the Full Court of Victoria declared <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> This measure is now submitted to validate that regulation, and to make it retrospective. </para>

            <para>- The fact that it has been in force for that period does not prove its justice or validity. Other departments are administered under regulations. For instance, under one clause in the Navigation Act, pages and pages of regulations have been framed by departmental officers, and concerning them Parliament knows very little. On the first occasion on which the regulation in question was tested it was found to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> and the Government now introduces this bill to close up a loophole in the act. I join with the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McNicoll)</inline> in what he has said in support of those occupying war service homes, and congratulate him upon the fact that his maiden speech in this chamber should have been upon so worthy a subject. I agree with the honorable member  that  this is not the time to make conditions more severe for returned soldiers, who are worthy of any preference that can be given to them. It is unfair and inequitable that an act which has been in operation all these years should be amended when a conference is to be held to inquire into the whole &#39; matter. </para>

            <para>- In 1926, the Commonwealth Government entered into an agreement with the State Savings Bank  of  Victoria under which all the war service homes in that State were placed under the control of that institution. The Commonwealth insisted on the payment of principal and interest whether the bank had,  or  had not, received the money from the  tenants. The State Savings Bank of Victoria has the right under the agreement to evict tenants, and it has evicted them ; but in doing so, its action has been tempered by finding houses for evicted tenants in other districts. We have heard nothing about that from the Assistant Minister. Under the agreement between the Commonwealth and the bank they can be evicted. </para>

            <para>- I am referring now only to Victoria; but I understand that a somewhat similar arrangement has been made in South Australia. A subcommittee of Cabinet was appointed by the Scullin Government to deal with this matter and I congratulate the present Government upon setting up a committee. There should he a greater reduction in the interest payable by the occupants of war service homes. I submit that what is fair for the creditor is also fair for the debtor. The, people of Australia, who were creditors of the Commonwealth and had lent money to the Federal Government - with the exception of 3 per cent. - voluntarily agreed to reduce their interest rates by 22&#163; per cent. The remainder converted under compulsion. The Commonwealth&#39;s debtors, the returned soldiers in this instance, are entitled to a similar reduction instead of the <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> per cent, reduction made by the late Government. Although no reduction has been made by this Government, the conference which is to be held shortly may make a recommendation in that regard. </para>

            <para>- If that is so, the hands of the committee have been tied. I ask the Minister to indicate in his reply the exact terms of reference to this committee. It appears to me that the committee has a string on it, the string being this bill. I was under the impression that the statement made by the Minister recently on the subject of interest di&#39;d not finally determine the matter, but that it would be re-opened when this committee was making its investigation. It has been argued that it is impossible to reduce the interest rate because some of the money loaned to the soldiers to buy war service homes was borrowed overseas, but that is small satisfaction to the man who is in distress. What does he care whether the money was borrowed at home or abroad? </para>

        <para>I cannot understand why the Government should want us to pass this bill with such indecent haste, and before the investigation committee has met. In my opinion, consideration of the measure should be deferred until the report of that committee has been obtained. We are labouring under a grave disability in considering the bill at present, for our information is restricted to that obtainable from the Minister, the department, or our own personal contact with returned soldiers. If we could wait until the report of the committee is available, we should be much better equipped to deal with the bill. </para>

            <para>- I do not know; but I certainly think it should do so. Profiteering was indulged in, and high prices charged to the Government for land for soldier settlement purposes, and because of this many returned men have hardly been able to scratch a living from their holdings. A few have succeeded in doing so, but very many others have failed through no fault of their own. Unduly high prices were also paid for land bought for war service homes purposes. Honorable members should contrast what this Government is proposing to do for the occupants of war service homes with what the Victorian Government has done for soldier settlers. Victoria spent &#163;24,140,000 in placing 11,400 settlers on the land. The concessions granted to these men have amounted to &#163;4,203,000, the land values have been reduced by &#163;250,000, and an amount of &#163;1,370,124 has been written off in respect of excess cost of buildings. But very little has been done to help the occupants of war service homes. There was a slight reduction in charges in 1923. The Auditor-General has pointed out that the spending of money on war service homes by the Commonwealth Government has been an excellent investment. He has shown clearly that the men have acquitted themselves as might be expected of them, yet the Government has brought down a bill designed to make things still harder for them. In his annual report for the year ended the 30th June, 1931, the Auditor-General says, in connexion with war service homes - </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">The greatest increase occurred in New South Wales, where unemployment is most acute. No doubt, the percentage of arrears has increased since that time; but it is quite evident that the men have done their best to meet their obligations in spite of scandals associated with the building of war service homes such as those to which the honorable member foi&#39; Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McNicoll)</inline> referred. Land scandals and timber scandals were occurring about the time some of us returned from active service. Many jerry-built houses came into the hands of the returned men who had been thrifty enough to invest their gratuity and savings in a home of their own. In spite of all this, the occupants of these homes have not unduly protested. It is, therefore, regrettable that a bill of this description should have been introduced before the investigation committee has had an opportunity to present a report to the Government on the subject. </para>
        <para>The most important amendment to the principal Act, the Minister informed us, was designed to validate regulation 17, and so make it legal for the commission to sue for arrears. We were told that about &#163;10,000 had been collected under regulation 17, but that &#163;28,000 was still outstanding, and that the Government was afraid that application might be made for the refund of money already paid. But surely it cannot be argued that there is any urgency in the matter. Only one case has succeeded, and every individual occupant will have to take his case to the court for determination. </para>
        <para>The  next  amendment, in point df importance, has relation to repairs. According to the Minister, the commission should be empowered to maintain houses, and the amendment will give it legal authority to do so. Another amendment is designed to permit the commission to let houses that become empty. At present, if a house becomes empty, it may be sold to anybody, whether he is a returned man or not. </para>

            <para>- I think he may do so with the consent of the commission: Some of the men who put their money into war service homes on their  return  from the war, are in a most unhappy position. A man may have bought a house in 1920 for &#163;800, and its value today may be only &#163;500. Many war service homes are in distant suburbs. I have very few of them in my constituency, but I know that there are many in the division of Henty. The men bought homes in distant suburbs, because of the favorable terms that were available at that time; but to-day they are feeling the detrimental effects of living at a distance  from the city. They have to pay higher rail fares,. and, in other ways, are handicapped. The result has been that many men have abandoned their war service homes, and have rented houses nearer  the  city at a considerably cheaper rate than they were paying previously. </para>

        <para>A perpetuation of the present state of affairs will mean the penalizing  of  our best returned men. The man who  squandered  his substance has now no  binding  property obligations. We know very  well  that many of the men who  bought war  service homes are government employees, who have had their salaries or wages reduced to such a point that they are  now  finding it very difficult to make ends meet. I shall be told that men who are in difficulties are not being forced to pay their rent ; but the amount they are in arrears is being placed to their debit,  and they  will be required to continue  their  payments for a greater number  of years than  was stipulated in their  contract in  order that they may repay their full indebtedness. Of the 2,000 men  who  were retrenched in the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department last year, 1,500 were  returned  soldiers, who have very little  chance of  getting back to their old  standard of  home comfort. In these circumstances, we should not hastily pass this  bill, even  though it would validate something  that  is allegedly wrong. </para>
        <para>If a man is forced to vacate his home, he gets no credit whatever  for the improvements  that he may have  made during  his occupancy. If the original cost  of  a house was &#163;800, and if the amount owing on it was &#163;500, because of the depreciation of values, the occupant would be lucky if he got &#163;400 or &#163;500  for  the property, so that the  whole  of  his  equity in it would be lost.  If through  Unemployment a returned soldier  is forced to  vacate a home, the commission  may  decide that certain repairs are necessary,  and  debit him with the cost.  One could say  a great deal more about  this  subject,  if time  permitted.  I  know  that the Government  is anxious to pass  the bill, but I  urge the Minister to defer  it until after the  forthcoming conference.  If this  course is not adopted I  shall be forced to  conclude that the Government desires  to  pass the bill in order to  tie the hands of  the conference. </para>

        <para class="block">As a layman, that is the only meaning which I can read into the provision. The bill also seeks to repeal section 43 of the principal act, and to insert in its stead provisions authorizing the Commissioner to serve notices upon the estate of the deceased occupant or purchaser for the recovery of any money due. Will the honorable member for Cook say that this provision will benefit the unfortunate dependants of deceased soldiers ? </para>

            <para>- The benefits conferred upon returned soldiers and their dependants for sacrifices made during the war are insignificant compared to those given to another section of the community - not the bondholders alone, but shipping companies which suffered losses through enemy action. In some cases, so if is alleged, ships were deliberately destroyed by their owners in order to obtain compensation from the governments of the various nations engaged in the war. I agree with the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> that the passage of the bill should be deferred until after the approaching conference has been held. I have been instructed by four or five returned soldiers&#39; leagues in my division to oppose it. </para>

          <para>I thank you very much for your courtesy in forwarding a copy of the proposed amendments to the War Service Homes Act. These were placed before my committee at the meeting held on the 7th March, and were severely criticized; and during the discussion that* ensued it was pointed out that several of the amendments proposed were all to the. advantage of the commission, and that no benefit would be derived by the occupiers. </para>

        <para class="block">I have also letters from the Kurri Kurri, Wallsend, Cessnock, Weston and Abermain branches. They are couched in stronger terms, and tell me to fight like hell against the bill. I am sorry to have to correct the Minister, but he is absolutely wrong in saying that the whole of the leagues of Australia are in favour of these amendments. </para>
        <para>Many hardships have been suffered by purchasers of these homes. Many soldiers were ejected from their homes during the regime of the Bruce-Page Government. When the then Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> was administering war service homes, I appealed to him to extend some humane consideration to the occupants of these homes. In Maitland,  a  soldier with three children was evicted. Many evictions have taken place in Kurri Kurri and other places.  I  have the names, and the departmental records can show the letters of protest I forwarded in respect of many who, subjected to harassing tactics and the continual threat of court proceedings, preferred to leave their homes rather than face  a  court with the certainty of being  evicted. It was unemployment which prevented them from meeting their obligations to the department. In this connexion, I pay a tribute to the late Government. It did very little good, but what little it did do I am not anxious to overlook. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline> Moloney was administering war service homes, he extended every sympathy to the occupiers of these homes, and even reinstated many who had been evicted by the Bruce-Page Government. </para>
        <para>This bill is unnecessary. The act under which the homes have been administered for years past is harsh enough. Do not let us make it harsher. Let us even extend to the occupiers the consideration that many owners extend to their tenants. A home in Mayfield was resumed by the commission because the instalments had not been met, and the occupant, who happened to be the tenant of the purchaser, was evicted. The property was first purchased when the employment of the purchaser necessitated his living at Mayfield. He was subsequently transferred to Newcastle, and it was more convenient for him to live at Carrington. He therefore let his home at Mayfield, but the tenant subsequently became unemployed and accumulated arrears of rent. The owner would not evict the tenant. He preferred not to follow the inhuman policy of the commission as applied to occupiers who fail to pay their instalments, and, as a result, lost his house. </para>

Many requests have been made for a reduction in the purchase price of property in accordance with the Premiers plan, but there has not yet been a re-valuation of war service homes. The Valuer-General of New South Wales has reported that the value of property has fallen in New South Wales, and I dare say it has fallen in the other States too, yet there has been no reduction in the price of war service homes, nor is any such reduction proposed by this bill. The Government does not even propose to reduce rents in accordance with the Premiers plan. </para>

            <para>- In New South Wales rents have been reduced by 22&#189; per cent. Some war service homes were built without proper outlets for waste water, and the purchasers are now being compelled by the local governing bodies to effect the necessary connexions with the sewerage system. I submitted to the commissioner one such case from Edward-street, Kurri Kurri; the shire council said that it could not be held responsible for an omission on the part of the commission when the home was built. The Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia has asked that when an occupier, through circumstances over which he has no control, is forced to surrender his property, he shall get the benefit of the full value of it, including the improvements. I had to deal with one case in Abermain where a home was sold at a price higher than the original purchase price, and the evicted occupant was not given the advantage of the added value. </para>

            <para>- I propose to move an amendment to that effect in committee. The bill generally does not commend itself to the occupants of war service homes, particularly that provision which seeks to validate an invalid law and thus deprive the soldiers of their legal rights. Although one successful litigant named Davies successfully appealed to the Full Court in Melbourne, and is not to be robbed of the fruits of his victory, this amendment is being made retrospective in order to prevent other occupants from getting the benefit of the defect in the law. </para>

            <para>- Apart from the point dealt with by that judgment, this bill does propose to&#39; impose on the occupants of war service homes a retrospective liability. These men have made greater sacrifices than any other section of the community, and are entitled to special con sideration; for that reason the interest rate should be further reduced from 4&#163; per cent, to 2&#163; per cent. Owing to the general trade depression which has robbed men of their employment, a house for which the occupant contracted to pay &#163;500 may ultimately cost him &#163;1,100, through the accumulation of interest and penalties. Some of the purchasers are so far in arrears through no fault of their own that they have no prospect of ever becoming the owners of their homes. Another objectionable provision in the bill is that which enables the commission to sue the estate of a deceased soldier for the recovery of arrears. In committee I shall move several amendments, which I trust will be sympathetically considered by the Minister in charge of the bill. </para>

          <para>.- It is futile to talk of the soldiers as having been harassed or being likely to receive anything but considerate treatment. The Scullin Government laid down and honestly administered the principle that where default was due to unemployment or any other cause over which the soldier had no control, the contract of purchase would not be enforced by ejectment or other drastic measures. The present Government is following that policy to the satisfaction of representative soldier organizations. The bill has two main objects. The first is to give to the Commissioner the right to recover amounts in respect of which the soldier purchaser has defaulted. An ordinary contract of sale contains a clause setting out the remedies available to the vendor if the purchaser should default. The War Service Homes Act purported to provide similar remedies, but the enumeration of them was defective. The act provides for the annulment of the contract, and for the commission to repossess itself of the house ; but it fails to provide the ordinary right to recover arrears from the purchaser. If the act had not attempted to enumerate the remedies available to the vendor, the right of&#39; recovery would have existed as a matter of ordinary law. An attempt was made to cure the omission by regulation, and for many years both the commission and the soldier occupants were of opinion that the ordinary conditions of a contract of sale applied to war service homes. Recently, however, one Davies took advantage of the defect in the act, and although there was no merit in his claim, the superior court gave judgment in his favour on a technical flaw. It is not desirable that the department should be required to refund many thousands of pounds that it has collected in accordance with what was believed by both vendor and purchaser to be the law. I doubt whether many soldiers would care to take advantage of the defect on which Davies succeeded; and it is questionable whether the administration of the act strictly in accordance with its language rather than its spirit would be in the interests of the soldiers. The act has been administered in a spirit of sympathy with, and consideration for the soldiers, and if an attempt were made to have their agreements carried out strictly in accordance with the law, it would be much to the disadvantage of the soldiers. Such legislation as this should be administered in a spirit of fairness, equity and good conscience; it is hot desirable to take advantage of technical defects which may have been discovered in the operation of the law. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>A similar comment is applicable to the second defect which the bill seeks to remedy. In nearly all cases, the clause enabling the Commissioner to recover the sum expended on repairs is quite unnecessary. Up to the 30th June last, the occupants paid their contributions regularly, and I do not think that any other section of the community can be said to have done so well in that respect. </para>

            <para>- At least 98 per cent of them did so, and these . are the men to whom the repairs clause has no application. The reputable occupant, who pays his way, will keep his house in order, and repairs will be unnecessary. The unfortunate but respectable soldier who may have to leave his home will not abandon it without giving notice, and before leaving the premises he will see that they are in a fair state of repair. That is all that is required under the conditions of contract. Of course, there are a few exsoldiers who will allow their homes to go to rack and ruin, but such delinquents are to be found among all sections. In those case1, the commission should have the right to effect repairs. If a property is tobe sold, it is necessary, in the interests of the soldiers, that repairs should be made before it is offered at auction. In assessing the sum to be allowed for the equity in a house it is fair to debit the soldier with the amount spent on&#39; repairs. Repairs mean renovations, and can be distinguished from improvements, which involve the addition of something that is new. The only risk is that a departmental officer might think it clever to include in the cost of repairs a work which amounted to an improvement, and that would operate unfairly against the ex-soldier. But the department can be trusted, I think, to act fairly towards the occupants in the future, as it has in the past. The only other complaint made is that this legislation is to be retrospective. Ordinarily that is a sound objection ; but, as I have pointed out, it is not desirable that the department should be obliged to refund moneys which have been paid to it. I do not consider that the retrospective operation of this measure is likely to prove unfair, because for years the department has believed that it had the power now sought, and giving it this power is not likely to make it search for new cases. </para>

        <para>The suggestion has been made that the interest rate should be reduced to 2&#163; per cent., but that is quite impracticable. The money advanced for these homes costs the Government 4-&#163; per cent. Whatever the reduction may be, the loss has to be made up by the general community. Some day it may be desirable to consider the necessity for re-valuing these properties, but this is not a suitable time to raise that question, because values are now abnormally low. If it should prove, after a few years&#39; further experience, that these properties have permanently dropped below the value they had when they were sold, there might then be good reason for assessing the losses of the occupants due to the general depreciation of property through general economic conditions. </para>

            <para>- I am aware of -that; but I can show, I think, that the present and future positions of the occupants should be considered conjointly. I do not suggest that any government has failed to show every possible sympathy for the returned soldiers who are struggling to purchase their homes. I believe that the Minister has in mind a method of preventing the ejection of those who cannot meet their payments; but we should consider this measure in the light of the present circumstances of the purchasers. They bought their homes when values were high. On several occasions I have sat in conference with returned soldiers, and I find that the average purchaser entered into his commitments years ago, when he had every reason to believe that he could keep up his payments. He set out with the ambition to buy his home as quickly as- possible ; but every reasonable person must admit that it is impossible under present conditions for a large percentage of the occupants to carry out their original contracts. This bill strengthens the position of the commission in dealing with homes that have been deserted by the purchasers. </para>

            <para>- All will agree that these homes should be kept in proper repair, and nobody suggests that a returned soldier would desire to live in unhealthy premises.

        <para>A large percentage of the men have been forced to join an organization for the purpose of obtaining redress of their grievances. They do not blame the Go- vernment for the commitments which they have to meet; they are merely endeavouring to show how difficult is their position on account of those commitments. Since they guaranteed to make regular weekly payments by way of interest and principal, in order to pay off the sums owing on their homes, their incomes have been reduced, on the average, by at least one-third. Yet it cannot be suggested that a similar reduction has been made in the amounts due by them. More than 50 per cent, of them are either totally or partially unemployed. The Government is quite justified in expecting these homes to be kept in proper order ; but whenever the department authorizes the renovation of a home, it adds to the already high arrears that are piling up against the occupant. The ex-soldiers are inclined to think that if they lived to the age of a thousand years they could never become the owners of their homes. They have now concluded that it would be better for them to abandon their homes, and take much cheaper houses, than to have the arrears piling up quarter after quarter. They do not take up this position because they are anxious to desert their homes. On the other hand the great majority of them would prefer to discharge their liability; they have, in fact, done much to add to the attractiveness of their dwellings. The War Service Homes Purchasers Association, which represents a large body of these men, is asking the department to consider wiping off a portion of the arrears that have accrued. In doing so they are merely asking to be treated as others are treated. It is not an uncommon thing for a government to declare- a moratorium under which the tenants of houses belonging to private landlords are not required to pay rent, in certain circumstances. They do not, however, always free the tenants of government properties from the necessity of paying their rent. Recently, a number of municipalities agreed not to demand rates and taxes from property owners who had freed their tenants from the necessity of paying rent. This bill does not do anything like that. If the Government would view this matter purely as a business proposition, it would realize that it would obtain more revenue from the purchasers of war service homes by relieving them of some of their arrears than if it insisted on full payment. If the arrears are allowed to accumulate, the purchasers will find their position hopeless, and will relinquish their homes. I agree with the honorable member for Balachava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> that war service homes should, be maintained in good condition. Indeed, it is to the purchaser&#39;s advantage to do so, since, in the event of the house being sold, any balance over and above his liability to the Government would go into his own pocket. However, in view of the depreciated value of house property, that is a remote possibility at this juncture. It is indeed strange, as the honorable member for Balaclava has said, for the Government to be tightening up the regulations against the returned soldiers at the very time that they were looking for relief from some of their obligations. The Minister would do well to hold the bill in abeyance until the report of the committee has been received. I am disappointed that the bill, instead of relieving the purchasers of war service homes, merely provides that they shall pay the last penny that they owe. </para>

Indeed, many of them have had to leave their homes because they could not pay what was owing on them. In doing so, they made a big sacrifice. The bill will make their position even more difficult. I urge the Minister not to proceed with this measure in committee until the report of the committee of inquiry has been received.

          <para>. - I wish to refer to some points mentioned by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> which originated with the United War Service Home Purchasers Association. First, I mention the alleged necessity for an alteration of the bill to overcome the difficulty which has arisen because of the Full Court of Victoria having found a regulation to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> The Minister said that the bill would not in any way affect that decision - that V. S. Davies, who brought the case before the court.  would not be affected by the decision. Apparently, Davies is the only man who will obtain any redress because of the action taken in the court, notwithstanding that behind him stood an organization whose members were as much concerned with the Court&#39;s decision as he was. If each member of the association had approached the court, as Davies did, then I take it that all of them would have received the benefit of the decision secured by Davies. It would appear that the object of the Government is to get behind the decision of the court by making it apply only to Davies, not to those other members of the association who stood behind him. It is a common practice, when a number of men are similarly affected by some action, or decision, for only one case to be cited before the court. For the convenience of the court itself that is often done. But it is expected that any decision arrived at will apply to the whole of the members of the organization concerned. If, for instance, the members of a trade union feel that it is desirable that the court should be approached in relation to their wages, or conditions of employment, they submit a test case for the court&#39;s decision, and they expect that any benefit which results from their action will apply to all the members of the trade union concerned. </para>

It may be that the officers of the association are in a more fortunate position than are many of its members, and that, therefore, they are not best equipped to put the case as affecting war service homes purchasers generally. Were the Government really desirous of helping the unfortunate purchasers of war service homes, it would defer further action until the report of the committee has been received. </para>
        <para>I agree with the honorable member for Melbourne Ports that the purchasers of war service homes should he directly represented on the committee of inquiry.

Honorable members who have been in this chamber lor some years, particularly those who have been Cabinet Ministers, know that it is only now and then that an opportunity presents itself to introduce an amending bill. A government may admit that amendments are necessary to a measure, and promise that they will be introduced at an opportune time, but that is too indefinite and unsatisfactory to those concerned. I, therefore, feel that when an amending bill is before the House, we should consider every aspect of the matter it concerns. The occupants of war service homes are passing through difficult times, particularly in the northern districts of New South Wales which are represented by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James),</inline> who put their case so well.

        <para>There are certain features of the bill to which exception cannot be taken. I recognize that the responsibility of ownership must be acknowledged, also that it would be wrong to allow these homes to fall into serious disrepair through neglect on the part of the occupants. At the same time, we should not allow legislation of this description to be hurried through in  an  ill-digested state, as that could only result in hardship being inflicted on the occupants of war service homes. The </para>
        <para class="block">Government would be well-advised to delay action until it is better informed on the subject. From time to time I have been asked to place before the Government the case of occupants of war service homes in my electorate, and I must admit that on every occasion the most sympathetic consideration and assistance has been extended to me. For that I express my appreciation. I realize that the War Service Homes Department is confronted with one of the most difficult tasks associated with the affairs of returned soldiers. The haste with which the war service homes scheme was originated has resulted in many anomalies, which cause the department much concern. These houses were &#34;constructed at a time when building costs were abnormally high, and land values were excessive, and so it is essential to do something to reduce valuations. The committee should deal specifically with that problem. </para>
        <para>I agree with the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> that every encouragement should be given to the occupants of war service homes to remain in possession of them. Because of unemployment and other adverse circumtances,  these unfortunate people have incurred arrears of rents which amount, in the aggregate, to an alarming figure. The Government would be well-advised to disregard those arrears for the time being, and allow the purchasers of war service homes to deal only with current commitments, leaving the arrears to be dealt with as part of the capital cost and extend the period of repayment. That would be preferable to forcing the tenants out of their houses, which would merely result in additional loss in expenditure to the Government. A similar idea was propounded by the originator of the &#34; thousand homes scheme &#34; in South Australia, but, unfortunately, the Government of that State was unable to appreciate its wisdom. I also think that this Government should reduce interest rates on war service homes by another half per cent., which would be in conformity with the action of the Stare Governments in its treatment of returned men. </para>
        <para>I ask the Minister to recognize the claims of honorable members on this side, as well as those of honorable members opposite, in this matter, and to adjourn the debate. While I certainly cannot oppose the second reading of the measure, I feel that certain amendments should be incorporated in it to make it more comprehensive and sympathetic towards the purchasers of war service homes. At present, the benefits appear to be all on the side of the commission. Homeowners are to guard against disrepair, and make good arrears. Let them be given some <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo.</inline> If that and certain other anomalies were adjusted, the measure would be more to my liking. </para>

          <para>. - I trust that the Minister will not agree to either adjourn the debate or withdraw the bill. This measure does not represent an attempt to deal with any of the wrongs from which the occupants of war service homes are suffering. The present Government has been in office only about ten weeks, and has not had time to investigate the position, which admittedly is serious. To accede to the requests of all honorable members would place a terrific strain on the finances of the Commonwealth. The Minister has done all that is possible in. the circumstances, by introducing a bill that will not cause injury to one occupier of a war service home. </para>

            <para>- It restates the position as it was thought to exist. The undertaking to purchase war service homes has been entered into by returned soldiers on a certain definite understanding, which for years has not been challenged. Recently, however, a returned soldier named Davies tested the matter in the courts, and finally obtained from the Full Bench of the Supreme Court of Victoria the decision that the interpretation of the Commissioner was wrong. With a view to protecting not his own money, but that of the people of this country, the Commissioner placed the matter before the Minister, who now seeks to remedy the position by this short amendment of the act. I understand that the sum of &#163;38,000 is involved. The returned soldiers who entered into agreements to purchase homes believed that the Commissioner was acting rightly; but by juggling with the meaning of words, at which&#39; the legal fraternity are adept, the regulation in question was ruled to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra</inline><inline font-style="italic">vires</inline> of the commission. </para>

        <para>The Minister has already appointed a committee to inquire into the grievances of returned soldiers. Unquestionably, many of them are suffering acutely from the existing depression, and cannot keep up their payments.

The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> and others, during the time that they sat opposite, were insistent in their demand for the appointment of such a committee. Their efforts have produced at least this fruit. The bill is by no means a settlement of the grievances of those returned soldiers who have purchased war service homes.

          <para>.- The figures in connexion with the payments of both interest and principal for war service homes speak for themselves. Until two or three years ago the arrears represented less than 1 per cent.; and, although we are now in the third year of the depression, that figure has not grown to the extent that might have been expected; I believe that it is slightly less than 3 per cent., which is remarkable in the circumstances. </para>

            <para>- Rather, he seeks legislative authority for what apparently has been done on the strength of regulations which a judicial decision lays it down are beyond the authority of the act. A good deal of the opposition to the measure might be overcome if the honorable gentleman would accept an amendment which I understand is to be moved later by the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McNicoll)</inline> to the proposed new sub-section1c, to limit the amount for which the borrower or the purchaser may be liable to the Commissioner with respect to expenditure on repairs or renovations, to an amount not exceeding such equity as the subsequent sale of the home might disclose him to possess. It is arguable that expenditure in that direction might result in a better price being obtained, and in some circumstances be the means of preserving an equity that otherwise might not exist. On the other hand, it might be shown that the expenditure of &#163;30 or &#163;40 on repairs might be the means of saving to the commission perhaps &#163;100. </para>

            <para>- I do not think that anybody doubts that. The procedure followed on the present occasion was identical with that followed by previous governments, including the Scullin Government. The bill is designed to deal only with the urgent question of validating certain powers and actions taken under those powers that were thought to exist from the commencement of the war service homes administration. Since I took charge of this department, all my endeavours have been directed towards ensuring that the purchasers of war service homes remained in their homes. The policy definitely adopted by this Government - the policy that was in operation when this legislation was originally introduced - is that every endeavour is to be made to provide returned men with their own homes. The act was designed for that purpose. We are doing all in our power, taking into consideration the difficult times through which we are passing, to ensure that the returned man shall remain in his home. We are accepting, as instalments, small payments in accordance with the wages, salary, or income of the individual occupant. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> said a moment ago, a portion of that policy was introduced during the regime of the late Government. A man with a wife and three children, on an income of &#163;3 18s. a week, pays only &#163;1 a week. The payment diminishes <inline font-style="italic">pro rata,</inline> until the income reaches &#163;2 3s. a week, in which case the returned soldier pays 2s. a week. On an income of &#163;2 2s. a week and under the payment is only ls. a week. That policy has been adopted by this Government to ensure that, so far as possible, the exsoldier will remain in his home. The bill is designed only to rectify an anomaly under a judgment of the Supreme Court of Victoria, but opportunity has been taken by the Government to deal with one or two minor matters. The allegation of harshness, cruel administration, and lack of consideration has no application to this bill, and no act of administration on the part of this Government since it took office could justify any of those charges. The returned soldier occupant himself has made no complaint about this proposal. </para>

When it became known that it was to be introduced, the  president  of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia asked me to make copies of the bill available to him. That was done on the 26th February, at the time the bill was introduced. Copies have been distributed among the States, and there has been no objection taken to this amending legislation except from Victoria in respect of one matter. The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> quoted one protest against the bill, but he referred to a letter which was written to him two days before E made my second-reading speech in this House. </para>

            <para>- If the honorable member&#39;s interpretation of the bill is similar to the interpretation placed upon it by the writer of that unfortunate letter, I am not surprised that the resolution referred to was carried. The official representative of the Opposition in this House referred sympathetically to the administration of the department, which, he said, had always endeavoured to carry out the intention of the act. I also, from my personal experience of the department prior to and since I have been in charge of it, express my appreciation of the work of the officials. They have endeavoured to carry out the spirit of the act, at the same time dealing as leniently as possible, in the light of the circumstances, with all cases that have come under their notice. They have always had a difficult and delicate task, and have carried out their duties with sympathy and tact. While home purchasers who are unemployed or partially unemployed, or whose work is rationed, have been granted the definite concession of <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> payments, the Government is requiring those who are in regular employment to honour - their obligations. I pay a tribute to the returned soldier occupants for the way in which they  have stood up to their obligations. Since 1918, 37,000 homes have been erected, but only 32 evictions had taken place up to the time of the financial depression; the arrears representing 1 per cent, of the total payments due. That was a splendid record. The Government  13 now  asking honorable members to validate the conditions under which this excellent record was created by the war service homes occupants. </para>

            <para>- I shall obtain that information for the honorable member. The honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McNicoll)</inline> brought under my notice certain conditions in respect of homes in 3*ew South Wales, particularly at Goulburn, and raised several objections to this measure. The group of homes at Goulburn was built in 1919, not by the War Service Homes Commission, but by the Commonwealth Bank on behalf of the COInmission. The architect who supervised ihe building of those homes was sued by the &#34;War Service Homes Commission in respect of faulty construction and the offer of &#163;10,000 to indemnify the commission for damages was accepted. On receipt of that sum the commission offered to build for every soldier who had one of those faulty homes, a new home to his own design. That offer was accepted by all except two returned soldier occupants who desired to remain in their old homes, and in those instances the original price of the house was reduced to &#163;600. The Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia at Goulburn has been unstinted in its appreciation of the action of the commission in this connexion. </para>

        <para class="block">The difficulty in respect to the question of sewerage raised by the honorable member for Werriwa is finance; we cannot afford the expenditure of large sums of money at this time. Since the honorable member brought this matter under my notice, I have been in communication with the Goulburn City Council. I have informed that body that we shall be pleased to do all within our power to assist it. The commission is having considerable trouble, mainly in New South Wales, from vandalism in unoccupied houses. For this additional reason we are anxious to carry out our policy of keeping returned soldiers in their homes. If there is any equity in a property, we hope to preserve it for the returned soldier occupant. </para>

            <para>- The purpose of this bill is to validate the action the Government has been taking since the War Service Homes Act was first put into operation. It is not proposed to increase in any way the obligations of the soldiers, and no additional powers are to be given to the Commissioner. The whole matter arises out of a case heard before the courts dealing with a returned soldier named Davies. He was &#163;38 4s. 5d. in arrears in his payments. He had occupied a house since October, 1923, to the 26th February, 1931. He was in permanent employment as a shunter in the Victorian railways. He resides at Newport, His wage was in excess of the basic wage, and he made arrangements to pay the usual instalments, and a small sum in addition every month to overtake the arrears. That arrangement was not carried out, and the commission instituted proceedings after the issue of a final notice. The contract was cancelled, and the Commissioner took action to recover the amount in arrears, and was successful in the County Court. The matter then went to the Full Court, and, on  a  technical point, the decision went in favour of the occupant. It is in order to put beyond any doubt the legality of the regulation under which action was taken by the Commissioner that this amendment is being brought forward at the present time. The regulation which was declared by the court to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> will, in future, be a part of the act. It will be  a  sub-section in section 36 of  the  present  act. </para>

        <para>When the decision of the Full Court was made known, several applications were received by the Government for refunds of sums of money previously paid by occupants of war service homes under regulation 17. I issued a statement, which was published in all the leading newspapers of Australia, urging returned soldiers not to incur costs in making  application through solicitors for  refunds  of payments they had made. I told them that the Government proposed to amend the act in order to carry out its original intention, so that they would only be wasting their money by taking legal action. This legislation has been brought down as early as possible, so as to protect the soldiers themselves, and to safeguard the revenue. </para>
        <para>To-day several honorable members paid tribute to the occupants of war service homes for the exemplary way in which they had met their obligations under the terms of the contracts into whichthey had entered. I join with them in that tribute, and point out that, prior to the present depression, payments by occupants of war service homes were in arrears only to the extent of 1 per cent. Of the 37,000 occupants of war service homes only 32 had been ejected, and this excellent result had been achieved under the  act  as it stood before the judgment of the court was given. Therefore, I can see no reason why honorable members should raise any objection to the proposed amendment. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for Hunter {Mr. James) referred to the case of a man named Endean. I have been advised by the officers of the department that this man is not a returned soldier. </para>

            <para>- The rate of interest payable by returned soldiers in 1918 was 5 per cent., on money borrowed by the Government at 51/4 per cent. Recently, as the result of the conversion loan, the late Treasurer reduced the rate of interest to returned soldiers from 5 per cent. to per cent. Several organizations have since requested that the rate of interest should be reduced by another1/2 per cent. The request has been carefully examined by the Government, and a statement has been drawn up, copies of which will be sent to the various organizations which have preferred requests. The statement is as follows: - </para>

        <para>Allowing for loan expenses and discounts at the time of flotation of the loans the effective rate of interest the Commonwealth is now paying on such of the money as was raised in Australia for war service homes is approximately41/2 per cent. </para>
        <para>However, about one-third of the loan funds which have been used in the operations of the </para>
        <para>War Service Homes Commission was derived 1 from overseas loans. As you are aware, the diminution of the interest charges now paid by the Commonwealth only applies to moneys raised in Australia, whereas the interest charges on overseas loans have had added to  them  the- present high exchange rates. </para>
        <para>On the third of the money so used and raised overseas the interest rate is &#163;5 4s. per cent., which, together with the exchange rate, means that this money is now costing the Commonwea.lth <inline font-style="italic">Gi</inline> per cent. The average rate of interest on money raised in Australia plus the money raised overseas is 5.2 per cent. </para>
        <para>It will be seen, therefore, that in charging the purchasers of war service homes 4J per cent, interest for money which costs the Commonwealth Government 5.2 per cent., the Government is making a concession in favour of the soldier in interest rates of .7 per cent., amounting in the aggregate to about &#163;125,000, and in addition, the Commonwealth Government is paying the whole cost of administration. This concession in interest rates is still considerably greater than when the war service homes scheme was first launched in 1918. </para>
        <para>The fact is that the occupants of &#34;war service homes are better off to-day than when the scheme was inaugurated in 1918. The honorable member for Balaclava further referred to alleged land and timber scandals, and made various other wild statements. </para>

            <para>- I am glad to withdraw the statement, and I agree with the honorable member that there has been nothing wild in connexion with the administration of the act. It is true that, when group settlements were being carried out under the War Service Homes Act, the administration did get considerably astray. That was recognized by the Bruce-Page Government in 1923, and a policy was framed to rectify the extraordinary and unfortunate position into which the administration of the department had drifted. At that time the department did not know what was the cost of many of the homes erected on the group system. Soldiers were returning in great numbers, and were being placed in homes before the group to which the homes belonged was finished, and before it was possible to ascertain the costThings became so tangled at that time that timber, bricks, and other material were being borrowed from one group for use in another, and no record  wa3  kept of such transactions. Recognizing the manner in which the administration had become confused, the Government of the day decided that it would not charge soldiers a penny more than they had believed they would have to pay. It was arranged that the soldiers should be charged a maximum of &#163;800 for homes, although many of the houses had cost &#163;900, &#163;1,000, and &#163;1,100, and as much as &#163;1,150. <inline font-style="italic">All</inline> of them were written down to &#163;800, at a cost to the Commonwealth of &#163;230,000. These points have, of course, been dealt with before. They are ancient history, as is the matter referred to by the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McNicoll),</inline> who mentioned the unfortunate incident which took place at Goulburn. The homes at Goulburn were built thirteen years ago, not by the War Service Homes Commissioner, but by the Commonwealth Bank for the department. The architect in charge was proceeded against, and agreed to pay &#163;10,000 as damages, which offer was accepted by the Government. Every soldier concerned was given the opportunity of going into a hew home built to his own design. Only two preferred to remain in their original homes, and they had the cost written down to &#163;600 each. </para>

        <para>This bill does not deal with those matters at all. It is a small measure designed to rectify the position created by a recent Full Court judgment. The problem of arrears in payments was mentioned by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> but that matter will be dealt with by the committee of inquiry which has been set up by the Government. The terms of reference to the committee make it clear that all those economic problems which agitate the returned soldiers, the commissioner, and myself, as Minister, will be submitted to the committee for inquiry. When the committee brings down its report, Parliament will be asked to take into consideration its recommendations. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for Hunter objected to the last clause of the bill, which gives the Commissioner  power to serve notice on the executors of deceased soldiers. He suggested that the department was taking power to pursue the soldier, through his dependants, even beyond the grave. That is not the intention of the bill. This clause is designed merely to deal with a technical situation. It is necessary that the department shall serve notice on somebody in order legally to take possession of the house. There is no intention to claim any payment and none has been claimed. Every State housing act contains powers similar to those included in this bill, directly or indirectly bearing on repairs to properties, particulars of which I have before me, but which I do not think it necessary to quote. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> objected to what he termed the retrospective nature of this legislation. There is nothing retrospective in the bill. It provides the commission with those powers which the original act was intended to confer upon it. </para>

            <para>- I have definitely stated that, apart from the right to let a house, and to serve a notice under section 42, for which provision had not previously been made, no additional powers are granted. Under this measure no additional burdens are placed upon returned soldiers; the sole object of the bill is to assist the occupants of war service homes. Provision has been made for effecting repairs in order to ensure a better sale. If, when the property market is glutted, the Commissioner endeavoured to sell a home in a state of disrepear or semi-disrepair, a prospective buyer, who has so many properties from which to make a selection, would probably decline the offer. By placing a cottage in a good tenantable condition, a better price should be obtainable. The better the price obtained, the greater is the probability of the original borrower securing more than his equity in the property. This legislation has been submitted in the interest of returned soldier occupants. It is not the policy of the Government to harass a returned soldier who is in arrears in his payments. </para>

            <para>- In Victoria only. It is impossible for all such organizations to be represented on a committee which is to consist of three members; but I hope that that organization will avail itself of the opportunity to submit points for consideration by the committee, which I feel sure will give them the fullest consideration. The federal secretary of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia has advised me that every State branch of the league was supplied with a copy of the bill shortly after the date upon which the bill was introduced, the 26th February last. The only objection to the bill was that raised by the Victorian branch, which is opposed to one matter. The objections of certain soldiers&#39; organizations raised by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> were contained in a letter dated the 8th of March, but the provisions of the bill were not explained until the 10th of March. The honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> made some suggestion which, generally speaking, dealt with subjects which come within the scope of the inquiry to be conducted by the committee. I shall see that the members of that committee are supplied with a copy of the debate on this measure so that they will have an opportunity to study the points raised. There is, as I have stated, nothing in the bill to extend the powers of the commission beyond that of giving legal power to serve a notice upon the executor of a deceased tenant, the letting of properties by the commissioner, and provision to enable repairs to be undertaken to preserve the equity of the original borrower. The amendment foreshadowed by the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McNicoll)</inline> is at present under consideration and will be dealt with in committee. </para>

          <para>. -  The amendment is not in conformity with the spirit of the act and cannot therefore be accepted. If a property could be vacated only by mutual consent the Commissioner would be placed in an impossible position and there would be no necessity for this provision. This measure has been framed to meet all cases that may arise. When occupants wish to vacate war service homes the commission advises them to endeavour to meet their obligations, and points out the advantages of remaining in occupation. </para>

        <para class="block">If this amendment is made the War Service Homes Commission will not be able to effect costly repairs&#34; to a property at the expense of the person who has vacated it. As I pointed out in my secondreading speech, the value of war service homes has fallen considerably. A house bought for &#163;800 a few years ago is probably worth no more than &#163;500 to-day. In these circumstances it would be unwise to permit any authority to make extensive repairs to a property or to spend a large sum in renovating it in the expectation of receiving a very much higher price at a sale. We do not know what agents the War Service Homes Commission appoints to do its work, but it would be distinctly unfair to a person who has had to vacate a home if he had to pay, or was debited with, a large sum for repairs and renovations. </para>

Consideration has been given to the arguments advanced by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White),</inline> and I wish to assure him and other honorable members that the commission will not incur any expense for repairs and renovations beyond the minimum amount necessary to effect a satisfactory sale of any property. As an evidence of the bona fides of the Government in this connexion, I am willing to stipulate that not more than &#163;40 shall be spent in this way in any one case. I do not desire honorable members to imagine, however, that &#163;40 will be spent in every instance. Only so much money will be spent as will put the property into a saleable condition. Such expenditure will be in the best interests of the soldier who may have an equity in the house, the commission, and the Government. </para>

        <para class="block">It is not fair that the War Service Homes Commission should be the sole judge of the extent of the repairs and renovations necessary to any particular property. Many occupants of war service homes are, to-day, in a desperate plight, and severe hardship would be inflicted upon them if they were obliged to submit to the extensive renovation of their homes. Even if they were not called upon to pay for the work immediately, the liability in respect of it would be added to their total indebtedness and so their accumulated arrears would be increased. The officers of the commission should not be allowed to enter anybody&#39;s home for the purpose of effecting repairs or renovations unless the occupant or the purchaser is willing.

          <para>. -  I point out to the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> that proposed new subsection1c applies only to dwelling houses that the commission has entered and taken possession of, and does not apply to residences which are still occupied by the original owners. The honorable member&#39;s remarks, therefore, have no application to section 36 of the principal act which is now being amended. They would have been appropriate perhaps if applied to section 31, but we have concluded our consideration of the amendments to that section. In any case, the officers of the War Service Homes Commission would not be likely to take action with regard to the renovation of a house which is still in occupation of the original purchaser, unless it was in a state of very serious disrepair. But with houses which have been abandoned the position is different. </para>

          <para>.- I again direct attention to proposed new section 2, which provides that action taken under the proposed new sub-sections Ia to lc will be retrospective to 1918. This means that the commission may recover the cost of repair&#39;s or renovations as far back as that year. I wish to safeguard returned soldiers from further indebtedness which may be due- to circumstances over which they have no control. Owing, to unemployment they may have fallen into arrears with their payments and been forced to vacate their homes. In a later provision, the commission is even given authority to serve notices on executors or administrators of estates of deceased soldiers. </para>

          <para>. - Apparently there is one aspect of the amendment foreshadowed by the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McNicoll)</inline> that is not understood by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James).</inline> As I understand the proposal, it means that while &#163;40 may be the maximum to be expended on repairs by the commissioner, the soldier who has vacated his home may be sued for only the amount of his equity. If he has no equity in a property, the Commissioner will not be able to sue for anything spent on repairs. The returned soldier does not stand to lose anything by the amendment; in certain circumstances, he may gain something. Obviously, if a home were not repaired, it is practically certain that no sale would be effected, consequently there would bc no equity for the soldier. On the other hand, if a certain amount were expended to make a property more saleable, the soldier could not be debited with more than the amount of his equity in it. Actually there there might be a balance over and above the amount owing to the commission, and this would be paid to him. </para>

        <para>James). The object of the latter is to ensure that before any claim can be made on a returned soldier, he must be proved to be in some reasonable employment. I would, however, point out that the amendment should have been moved at an earlier stage. These proposed new subsections deal with the situation that has arisen after the Commissioner has entered upon and taken possession of any land or dwelling house, so no good purpose can be effected by persisting with the amendment. The soldier, having vacated his home, the Commissioner has determined to effect certain repairs with the object of finding a buyer for it. If there is any equity belonging to the soldier after all expenses have been met, he will be entitled to receive it. </para>

          <para>. - I am not satisfied that the soldier, at this stage, is entirely freed of all liability. I incline still to the view that he has not rid himself of obligations which he entered into when he made the contract for the purchase of a home. I gather from the remarks of the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr James)</inline> that even if a returned soldier is forced, through unemployment, to vacate his home, he will still be liable for the cost of repairs carried out by the Commissioner. It is true that such repairs may be necessary to ensure a sale at a better price, but under present conditions, the disposal of a war service home might not be an easy matter. The desire of the honorable member for Hunter is to safeguard the interests of a returned soldier who, after vacating a war service home, is in occupation of another property. The honorable member&#39;s view, I take it, is that if a returned soldier&#39;s income is merely sufficient to pay the rent and provide the bare necessaries of life, it should not be in the power of the Commissioner to harass him. </para>

            <para>- There is now power in the act to sue a returned soldier for the arrears of his instalments. But in this case, so far as I can gather - the Minister, I hope, will either affirm or contradict me - the Government is not seeking power to sue a returned soldier for the cost of any repairs effected to a home unless the soldier has an equity in the property and a sale is effected. Thus, if a property were repaired at the cost of &#163;40, and were sold at such a price as to show a loss, there would be no claim against the returned soldier for the cost of repairs. The Commissioner would be obliged to shoulder the whole of it. I can see no hope of being able to pass a law to define what is meant by &#34;reasonable employment.&#34; A man may have no employment at all, and yet be in enjoyment of a fairly good income. Again, what may be regarded by one person as reasonable employment might not be so regarded by another. We must not forget that this clause relates to repairs made to properties which have reverted to the Commissioner. Any provision to define the term &#34;reasonable employment,&#34; should have been inserted in an earlier section of the act. In any case, I think we must depend upon the administration to do the fair thing by returned soldiers, and in this respect we can only judge by experience, and by the policy of governments. Usually, instructions have been given to the Commissioner to take the lenient view. We must rely upon the administration&#39;s sense of justice, and, I think, all will admit that hitherto every case of hardship has been dealt with sympathetically. If, however, any honorable member can cite cases of hardship due to unemployment of returned soldiers, which have not received sympathetic consideration, either during the administration of my government, or any other administration, we shall fight with him until justice is done, and I feel sure that we shall command the unanimous support of all honorable members. </para>

            <para>- The committee must be satisfied that a returned soldier who has no equity in the place cannot be sued for any expenditure in respect of repairs. Can any honorable member imagine the Commissioner taking action to recover the cost of repairs against a returned soldier who, through unemployment or other circumstances over which he has no control, falls into arrears, is forced to vacate his home, and is without means? Right through this bill there is power given to thu Commissioner to sue for instalments when overdue. This is only right, but we can intimate to the administration that while we should provide that every man shall be held liable for his legitimate obligations, it is not the desire of Parliament to inflict hardship upon any returned soldiers. We cannot enact that the law shall operate in certain circumstances and not in others. We must, in the end, leave these matters to the administration, in the hope that the Commissioner will interpret generously the expressed will of this Parliament towards returned soldiers. </para>

          <para>. - In the main the supporting explanation of the right  honorable  the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> is correct. At no time in the history of the commission has it sued separately for the cost of repairs. Where a mortgage has been executed, and the purchaser is in arrears and leaves his home, either voluntarily or by ejectment, the property is repaired and sold. If it should be sold at a profit the borrower has an equity which goes to him. If, however, a loss is sustained the commission foots the bill. The position is different when there is a contract for sale. The power to call upon the soldier for the cost of the repairs exists, but in no instance will the commission pursue any soldier whose circumstances prevent him from meeting his obligations. In no instance is it done. This provision exists in all the housing legislation of the States. </para>

            <para>- Absolutely, so far as a mortgage is concerned. I appreciate the motive that has actuated the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> in moving his amendment, but it would be impracticable to administer it. The principle upon which the amendment is based is observed by the department wherever practicable; but it is impossible to embody it in any statute. It would be impossible to give a correct interpretation of any provision covering it. This bill has been brought down mainly to overcome legal difficulties caused by the interpretation placed upon our legislation by the Full Court of Victoria. We cannot run the risk of getting out of one difficulty and stepping deeper into another. </para>

          <para>. - I think that the Minister has confused the clause by his explanation. It seems to me that the contract between the War Service Homes Commission and the home  purchaser is harsher than any ordinary contract for the purchase of a home. No person, who is selling a- house on instalments, would expect the purchaser to let him step in and say, &#34; I propose without your permission to spend &#163;100 on this house in repairs, so that I may get a better price on selling it.&#34; If there is no condition in the original act that soldiers&#39; homes are to be kept in reasonable repair while the payments are being made, it is certainly right to expect a home to be painted at least once every five years, and that reasonable repairs should be carried out about once every five years. The assets of the taxpayers of the country should be protected by preventing property in which the country&#39;s money has been invested from getting into a state of disrepair. But if after a man vacates his home, possibly through unemployment, or it may be because circumstances have taken him away from the district in which his home has been erected, he cannot let it to a tenant until he gets permission from the Commissioner. If he is in Queensland he has first to write to Brisbane. Brisbane then gets in touch with Canberra, and Canberra .forwards the application to the Commissioner in Melbourne. I have handled these cases, and have found that it sometimes takes four or five months for a purchaser to secure permission to let his house to a tenant. Many men cannot afford to wait&#39; all that time and they are obliged to vacate the premises. But if this clause is allowed to pass they will still be liable to pay the cost of any subsequent repairs effected by the Commissioner. It is a one-sided arrange- - ment, which would not be countenanced between private parties. </para>

            <para>- If our legislation were on the lines of the Queensland legislation there would be no cause for complaint. In Queensland a purchaser of a worker&#39;s dwelling is obliged to carry out painting and repairs every five years over a period of 20 years. Payments extend over 25 years in the case of workers&#39; homes; but in that case repairs are effected by the Government, and the cost is added to the regular instalments. When the purchaser of a home wishes to vacate it he gives notice to the Government. The department makes efforts to sell the property, or gives him permission to let the house for six months, or, at the most, twelve months. It does not say, &#34; We will not allow you to let it. We shall spend about &#163;40 on it in repairs, and then sell it, but you will be liable for the &#163;40 &#34;. The provision in this bill, which enables the Commissioner to garnishee the purchaser&#39;s salary to pay for repairs to the home he has vacated, is not to be found in any other legislation. </para>

          <para>.- The Minister says that the Government does not propose to take any action against the purchaser of a war service home if he has no equity in the property; yet this amendment provides that if the Commissioner has taken possession of a home he can effect repairs, and their cost is made a charge against the borrower, or the purchaser who has any equity in it. I should not object if the Minister, as he stated in his speech, although he does not give effect to it in the bill, made provision that money spent in repairs after the Commissioner has taken possession of a house shall be made a charge upon the equity of the original purchaser. This clause, however, provides that the Commissioner can effect the repairs and make their cost a continual charge against the original purchaser until the amount is repaid. At any rate the power is there and if the Minister does not want it, why ask for it? </para>

            <para>-Yes, and the Minister is anxious to make it retrospective to 1918. I do not like this provision. The charge should be against the equity only, and not against the person whose property may be resumed in all proper circumstances, but upon which repairs are effected. No garnishee order for the cost of repairs should be possible against a soldier purchaser who has vacated his home. </para>

          <para>.- This clause gives to the Commissioner power to secure from the soldier the cost incurred in effecting repairs, and the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mc Nicoll)</inline> suggests that there should be a limit of &#163;40. The clause provides that the expenses incurred in effecting repairs shall be paid to the Commissioner by the purchaser or borrower on demand, or by such instalments, and at such times as are prescribed, or the Commissioner determines. There is thus a definite responsibility which the soldier has to accept. </para>

Of course, I realize that the Government can get nothing from a man who has vacated his house through lack of means; but there is just a possibility that a man may subsequently secure employment at a wage which will enable him, in the eyes of the Commissioner, to meet the cost of the repairs effected on the home he has vacated. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- His</inline>contract is not cancelled by his vacating the house. The liability still remains upon him. I do not altogether like the words &#34; reasonable wage&#34; in the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James).</inline> I have in mind the case of a man who brought his sister to Australia and guaranteed the repayment of the passage money to the Government. When he made application to the migration authorities he was earning &#163;4 a week. Evil times overtook him, and his average net weekly wage for fourteen weeks has been &#163;1 7s. lOd. On that he has to maintain himself, his wife, and two children. When he applied to the commission for relief he was told that because he was in regular employment he is expected to live up to his obligations as far as he can ; the commission is not prepared to cancel his contract. The dangerous nature of this clause is indicated by the proposal of the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McNicoll)</inline> to limit the expenditure on repairs to &#163;40. The Minister stated that the department will charge repairs only against the soldier&#39;s equity in the house, but the bill does not say that. I want to know definitely what will be the liability of the dispossessed purchaser. </para>

          <para>.- I approve of the clause. The soldier has a liability in respect of his home, and if he were vacating it he would probably prefer to have his equity protected by the expenditure of &#163;40 on repairs rather than risk the sale of the property in a state of disrepair. A mistake will be made if any limit is specified because the department will probably spend up to that amount. I suggest to the committee that the interest of the soldier is protected when his house is put in a state of repair so that it will be more likely to be sold at a price which will enable him to get a return of his equity. </para>

          <para>. - A soldier may have bought a house for &#163;800, and he still owes &#163;350, plus interest. Because he is unable to pay his instalments he surrenders the property. According to the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcnicoll),</inline> the commission may expend up to &#163;40 on repairs, bringing the total capital debt to &#163;840. At auction the property realizes only &#163;600, and the soldier is liable for the balance of &#163;240. As a potential owner of the home he should have the right to say whether the expenditure on repairs proposed by the commission is justified or whether he would prefer to take the risk of selling the house in its existing state, especially as the cost of repairs will be added to his liability. I invite the Minister to make a definite statement as to what will be the position of the soldier in circumstances such as I have outlined. </para>

          <para>. - The earlier speech of the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> was based on the assumption that four months would be occupied by a Queensland purchaser in obtaining through Brisbane, Canberra, and Melbourne permission from the commission to let his house. For some years now permission to let a war service home has not been required. I have already indicated the difficulties that would be experienced in interpreting the words &#34; reasonable employment,&#34; mentioned in the amendment by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James).</inline> But as this clause relates to a home that has been vacated by the purchaser, the fact that he is out of employment will be immaterial. War service homes are obtained either by purchase or borrowing. The borrower pays . a deposit of 10 per cent., and executes a mortgage; if he cannot pay this deposit he is allowed to enter into possession on signing a contract of sale. A borrower who has paid a deposit and signed a mortgage must live up to the conditions of his mortgage. Suppose that the borrower&#39;s equity in a home that has been vacated and is to be sold, is &#163;50, and that the repairs carried out by the commission cost &#163;40 ; if the house realizes &#163;100 above the original price, the soldier will get a return of his equity plus &#163;10. </para>

Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of proposed new sub-section 1c merely provides that if the Commissioner is satisfied that it is not possible to effect an immediate sale of the property at a reasonable price he may let it. The honorable member by his amendment has gone entirely beyond the intentions of the Government. </para>

          <para>.- I hope that the Minister will not dismiss lightly the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> which has much merit in it. Even if he cannot accept the amendment he should endeavour to clarify the position. An ex-soldier after having enlarged his house might lose his employment, get into arrears with his payments, and be forced to vacate the premises. In such a case, why should he not have the benefit of the increased value due to the additions he has effected to his property? </para>

            <para>- This clause empowers the Commissioner to serve notices. It repeals section 43 of the principal act, which provides that any notice required by this act to be given may be served personally or by post- The phraseology of section 43 is incomplete, and consequently, added powers have been sought to enable technical notices to be served in the event of the decease of an occupant of a war service home. Under proposed new sub-section 2 of section 43, power is given for notices to be served by persons other than the commissioner. I confidently ask the committee to accept this clause. </para>

          <para>.- I am pleased that one amendment has been made to this measure. I have opposed the bill chiefly with the object of securing a postponement of its consideration until the report of the committee of inquiry has been received. I cannot see any great urgency for the bill. I hope that the information which has been placed before the committee will be considered carefully by the members of the committee of inquiry. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> asked if there were any instances of men having been evicted from war service homes. I trust that that matter will be included in the terms of reference to the* committee. In Victoria the administration of war service homes is in the hands of the State Savings Bank of Victoria, which body exercises its own discretion in the matter of eviction. A few purchasers of war service homes have been evicted, although I give the authorities credit for having accorded the most lenient terms to the men concerned. This agreement then should be considered by the committee of inquiry. I am pleased that the Government has decided to call a conference, and I hope that the committee to be appointed will go into the several matters which have been mentioned to-day as well as the rate of interest. The Minister said that the interest rate had been definitely fixed because the money had been borrowed abroad. It is little satisfaction to the occupant of a war service home to know that his interest cannot be reduced because the money was borrowed overseas. I do not suppose that one occupant of these homes inquired where the money came from. I hope that all the matters debated will receive careful consideration by the committee, and that it will give us a full report. I trust also that prompt action will be taken to give effect to its recommendations. </para>

          <para>. - I have consistently opposed this measure, although not with any intention of delaying the work of Parliament. I submit that my opposition to the measure has been reasonable, taking into consideration the procedure that was adopted in dealing with it. When a division takes place, it is necessary for honorable members to cross the floor to record their votes. It sometimes happens that, following a division, the  Chairman  of Committees puts certain questions to the committee before honorable members have regained their seats. </para>

            <para>- I was referring to the procedure which has been followed on many occasions, and was pointing out how difficult it sometimes is for an honorable member who has crossed the floor, to get an opportunity to speak before the  chairman  has put the question and the clause is passsed. A few minutes ago I lost an opportunity of moving some important amendments which I had been requested by eleven branches of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia to bring forward. When I attempted to move them I was told I could not do so as the clause had been passed. Provision should be made in the bill that a purchaser of a war service home, -who is out of employment, shall have the period of his unemployment added to the term of his contract. An amendment to that effect could have been accepted by the Minister without any loss of dignity, even though it emanated from this section of the chamber. </para>

            <para>- The purchasers of war service homes are also continually receiving notices from the department threatening prosecution. That harassing method is akin to eviction, because the occupant&#39;s leave their homes rather than face prosecution. Such tactics are wrong, and display no consideration for the returned men, and the widows of returned men who occupy war service homes. I have in mind a specific case of a widow at Bellbird who is continually receiving letters threatening her with eviction. I hope that, in future, honorable members will be given an opportunity to resume their seats after a division before the next clause is proceeded with. </para>

          <para>.- I suggest to the Minister that the principle that was embodied in the last amendment that was submitted by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> is worthy of consideration. .

        <para>A request is being made by those concerned that there should be a general writing down of these properties. 1 said, when Prime Minister, and 1 repeat ii now, that this is not a time for a general re-valuation or writing down of war service homes. We should wait until values regain stability before taking that action, lu the meantime the best that can be done is to administer this department in a humane and lenient way. One particular type of case needs special consideration. Assume that a returned soldier purchases a war service home, say, for &#163;900, and that he improves the property by adding rooms at a cost of &#163;300. He finds later that he cannot continue his payments, and abandons the home. The commission re-possesses itself of the home, and because of a drop in values sells it for &#163;900, that figure being obtained only because of the improvements effected by the late occupant. The commission obtains the amount that it originally put into the property, while the late occupant loses, in addition to other moneys, the &#163;300 expended in improvements. The purpose of the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Hunter was to give such a purchaser at least some return for the improvements effected by him. I suggest that the matter should receive consideration before the hill is submitted to another place. It was in order to focus attention upon the desirability of action along those lines that I and members of my party voted for the amendment. We admit that it needs re-drafting, but we realize that the principle is there. </para>

As a rule, I do not find myself in accord with honorable members who belong, as they themselves assert, to the real Labour party. I stated a case to the committee, which was almost identical with that cited by the Leader of the Opposition, and asked the Minister in charge of the bill to give a ruling about an amendment that I contemplated. My amendment was ruled out of order, but, having spoken in favour of the principle, I voted for the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James),</inline> as I do not believe in walking out of the House to avoid registering my opinion, even when I am cbe only honorable member on this side of the House who holds such a view. </para>

            <para>- I refer to the case that was mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition. If it is impossible to arrive at a determination as to the proper basis on which a re-valuation and writing down shall be made, the Government should take some action to deal leniently with urgent cases, pending the time when the committee submits its report. </para>

          <para>.- I ask the Minister, when considering these matters, to recognize the need for an immediate revision of the interest rate that is paid by purchasers of war service homes, and urge the Government to reduce that rate by a further $ per cent. It should not wait for another five months until the report of the committee is submitted. </para>

        <para>Mr.FRANCIS (Moreton- Assistant Minister) &#91;10.8&#93;. - I agree with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> that the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> could not be embodied in the hill in its present form, as it would be impossible to administer it as it stands. Between now and the time when the bill reaches another place, I will give my attention to the matterand see what can be done about it. I raised the objection that the amendment could not be added to a clause which dealt with granting power to let a. war service home. On that issue I was ruled out of order by the  Chairman.  I also contend that the procedure adopted with regard to the amendment was an unsatisfactory one, as if similar methods were generally adopted, a bill entirely different from that intended by the Government would he evolved in committee. I do not think that any general rule could be adopted to compensate the occupants of war service homes for any improvements that they have effected. In one ease the addition might be of value, in another it might detract from the worth of the home. I am quite certain that if a good case was made out, very favorable consideration would be given to it. </para>
        <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> also suggested that the present was not an opportune time to undertake a general revaluation of war service homes or a writing down of values. The intention of the Government is that the committee of inquiry which has been appointed shall submit recommendations that will enable the Government to formulate a plan covering a period not exceeding five years, so that the opportunity may be afforded to span over the difficult conditions through which we are passing. If the committee can lay down the outline of such a plan, I am confident that many of the anxieties of honorable members will be brushed aside, and that an excellent scheme will be evolved in the interest of the occupants of war service homes. </para>
