            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - The Commonwealth Government is very gratified at the successful conclusion of the lengthy trade negotiations between the United Kingdom and the United States of America. It hopes that the agreement which has just been signed will greatly benefit the trade between those two countries, and that Great Britain and the United States of America may now find it possible to exert joint efforts to establish more liberal conditions of trade throughout the world. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The fact that two such highly industrialized countries have found it possible to conclude a comprehensive agreement demonstrates what can be done when there is on both sides a will to succeed. It is an example, moreover, of the best form of economic collaboration between Empire countries. Australia, Canada, India, Now Zealand, South Africa, and other Empire countries have contributed towards the success of the negotiations, by reconsidering some of the preferences they have enjoyed in the United Kingdom market since the Ottawa Conference was held in 1932. </para>
          <para>The commodities affected by the agreement which are most significant in respect of the Australian export trade are fresh apples and pears, canned pineapples, and wheat. The changes of preferences  agreed to in respect of these items will not adversely affect the industries concerned. </para>
          <para>In regard to apples and pears, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia have all agreed to a modification of the preference provided for in the Ottawa Agreement. Australian apples and pears, in common with those from other southern hemisphere countries, are marketed in the United Kingdom during the period from the 1st April to the 31st July in nach year. The principal northern hemisphere suppliers are Canada and the United States of America. The reduction of the duty on apples between the 18th August and the 15th April, and on pears between the 1st August and the 31st January, from 4s. 6d. per cwt. to 3s. per cwt. will assist the marketing of fruit from the United States of America. The Australian industry still retains adequate protection. Fruit imported into the United Kingdom from the United States of America, or from any other foreign country, between the 16th April and the 15th August, will continue to pay duty at  the  rate of 4s. 6d. per cwt. </para>
          <para>The position of Empire apple producers in the southern hemisphere is, in fact, improved, because the Government of the United States of America will draw the attention of American  apple  exporters to the desirability of cooperation with Empire fruit organizations, with the object of avoiding undue fluctuations of supplies and prices. </para>
          <para>The alteration of the duty on canned pineapples entering the United Kingdom from foreign countries is from 15 per cent, ad valorem to a specific rate of 5s. per cwt. The specific rate is an added deterrent to the importation of cheaper varieties, and is an increased protection against them. It is, therefore, preferable to an ad valorem rate of 15 per cent. Attempts by the Commonwealth Government to secure specific duties on other canned fruit were not successful. Apart from the market in tho United Kingdom, Australia enjoys preferences on canned pineapples in Canada and New Zealand, as follows: Canada, 3 cents per lb.; New Zealand, 25 per cent, ad valorem. </para>
          <para>Since the Ottawa Agreement was concluded, Australia&#39;s production of pineapples did not increase up to 1937, and  the export actually declined from 62,000 cases in 1932 to 37,000 cases in 1937. This year both the production and the export have increased. The export has been to the United Kingdom, Canada, and New Zealand. Australia still supplies less than 1 per cent, of the market in the United Kingdom, and about 2 per cent, of the markets of Canada and New Zealand. There is room in those three markets for the existing volume of Australian export, provided that Australian pineapple producers can compete with the help of the substantial protection they enjoy. </para>
          <para>Wheat is in a different category from the other commodities mentioned. It is a world commodity, and the price received by the seller is determined solely by the relationship that exists between the total export surpluses, and the total import demand of all importing countries. Under the agreements concluded at Ottawa in 1932 between the United Kingdom on the one hand, and Australia, Canada, and India on the other hand, the United Kingdom agreed to admit Empire wheat free of duty, and to impose a duty of 2s. a quarter on wheat imported from foreign countries. This duty is now to be removed. The Ottawa agreements with Canada, India and Australia stipulated that the continuance pf this preference&#39; was conditional on Empire producers continuing to offer wheat on first sale in the United Kingdom at prices not exceeding the world price. Quite apart from this proviso, the force of competition amongst Empire producers would always keep the price in the United Kingdom in conformity with the world price. &#34;Wheat exports from Canada and Australia are, of course, dependent upon the crops harvested. In the last seven years, which have included some years of very low harvest in Canada, the average yearly exports have been over 260,000,000 bushels, whereas the imports - of the United Kingdom have never exceeded 210,000,000 bushels. The excess of Empire supplies over Empire demand must keep United Kingdom wheat prices at world parity. The removal of the duty of 2s. a quarter will, therefore, have no influence whatever on the Australian wheat producer. The problem of the wheat-grower is epitomised in the existing excess of world supplies over the  prospective import demand. Available world export supplies are nearly 950,000,000 bushels, whilst anticipated world import demand for the current cereal year is only 550,000,000 bushels. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> Empire preference can have any remedial effect on that position. </para>
          <para>These changes of the Empire preferences enjoyed by Australia were concurred in by the Commonwealth Government after the fullest consultation with the Governments of the United Kingdom and the other dominions. That consultation was commenced during the Imperial Conference held in London in May, 1937, and has continued without interruption ever since. The Commonwealth Government recognized the great influence which would be exercised on world economic affairs by a comprehensive trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and fully realized its responsibility to assist in the conclusion of such an agreement, provided the vital interests of Australian industries were preserved. This dual objective has been attained. </para>
          <para>The Australian action in this matter is an example of the kind of co-operation visualized by the Governments of the United Kingdom and Australia, as expressed in paragraph 4 of the Memorandum of Conclusions resulting from this year&#39;s discussions in London. The United Kingdom will similarly co-operate with Australia in its future trade negotiations. </para>
          <para>The alterations of formerly existing preferences agreed to by Australia are as&#39; follows :  - </para>

        <para>Fresh Fruits</para>
        <para>Apples. - Reduction from 4s. fid. to 3s. per cwt.. during the period from the 15th August to the I5th April. The full duty of 4s.6d. will still operate during the Australian season, viz., from the 10th April to the 15th August. </para>

        <para>In addition to the above changes of preferences enjoyed by Australia, the agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States of America provides for a reduction of the duty on rice imported into the United Kingdom from foreign countries. The duty provided in the Ottawa Agreement between the United Kingdom and India was1d. per lb. This is now to be reduced to two-thirds of a penny per lb. Although Australia had no treaty rights in respect of rice, the strongest representations were made by the Commonwealth Government to the Government of the United Kingdom to retain the duty of1d. per lb. This action was taken because Australia has developed a substantial trade in rice during the last five years. The small reduction of duty, while regretted, could not be prevented by Australia. However, it will not seriously affect the Austraiian rice industry. </para>
        <para>This morning the Prime Minister received the following cablegram from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. </para>
        <para>On the occasion of to-day&#39;s signature of the United Kingdom - United States Trade Agreement I should like to express again to the Commonwealth Government cordial appreciation of their readiness to facilitate our agreement with the United States by consenting to such modification of their rights under their existing trade agreement with the United Kingdom as were necessary to enable it to be concluded. It is our confident hope that the agreement now signed will assist substantially in reducing the barrier to trade and will thereby prove a real contribution to world appeasement. </para>
        <para>I should add a few words in connexion with the direct trade relations between the United States of America and Australia. As was indicated when Ministers returned from abroad early this year, the possibility of Australia commencing commercial negotiations with the United States of America has been discussed informally. The study by both Governments of the problems involved, initiated some months back, is still proceeding, and will, of course, now be continued in  the light of the contents and the probable effects of the Anglo-American Agreement. It is too early yet to&#34; indicate whether a sound basis for negotiations can be discovered, but we are confident that both countries will desire that this should turn out to be the case. I lay the paper on the table and move - </para>

The Government cannot permit the usurpation of its functions by any section of the community. It has the full responsibility to determine what attitude it shall adopt with regard to the Sino-Japanese dispute, and cannot allow this responsibility to be taken from it. I sincerely trust that the decision of the Government with regard to pig iron will have the effect of bringing clearly to the minds of the waterside workers at Fort Kembla the fact that their action ia in conflict with the recognized principles of orderly government and international trading. I therefore hope they will realize that their position is untenable, and that they will resume at once the loading of pig iron for export. </para>

            <para>- In the report in to-day&#39;s newspapers of the refusal of the waterside workers at Port Kembla to load 8,000 tons of Australian pig iron for shipment to Japan, the Prime Minister is quoted as saying that this is part of a total order for 24,000 tons. Is the Prime Minister in a position to say how much pig iron has been exported since the embargo was placed on the export of iron ore from Western Australia, and how does he reconcile the inconsistency of the Government&#39;s policy - </para>

              <para>- I am not able to state the actual quantities that have been exported, but I shall obtain the figures for the honorable member. I assure him that there has been no inconsistency, because pig iron differs from iron ore in that it has passed through a process of manufacture which has provided employment for Australians. Moreover, the important aspect of the matter is that only a very small quantity is involved, and it is not likely to interfere with the future requirements of Australian industry. I give an assurance that if these exports do tend in that direction consideration will be given to measures for the protection of Australian industry. </para>

            <para>- There has been some delay during recent months, due to several causes. In the first place there was a suggestion by the architects that there should be a modification of the design. A meeting of the War Memorial Committee was held some time ago at which I presided, and it was agreed that certain modifications should be made. The architects subsequently suggested further modifications, but they were not accepted. Delay was also occasioned by the nondelivery, or late delivery, of stone from the quarries for the facing of the building. I understand that these matters have now been cleared up, and we may expect the work to be proceeded with expeditiously. Speaking on the Works Estimates recently, the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> questioned the amount of money on the Estimates for the completion of the War Memorial. In addition to the amount appearing on the Estimates there is a substantial sum held in trust, sufficient to cover the cost of the work for this year. </para>

            <para>- I have not actually seen the telegram referred to, but I assure the honorable member that no representations from the Power Alcohol League were ignored when I was in Northern Queensland. I gave a definite undertaking that the Government would consider its representations, and it is partly as the result of those representations that an inquiry into this matter is now being made. The inquiry will be conducted by an impartial and competent body, and the League will have every opportunity to place its proposals and opinions before that body. </para>

I know that several contracts have been signed recently, for which tenders were called for some time ago,  for the erection of a large number of cottages in Canberra, and they will be expeditiously completed. In addition, I am having made a complete survey of all works, those that have been approved, those thatare in process of construction, and those that are contemplated. When this information is available, I shall place it before the House. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - Following on the agreement reached by the State Premiers . at conferences with representatives of the Commonwealth Government on the 29th August and the 29th September last, the Commonwealth Government undertook to introduce legislation for the purpose of collecting a fund to provide for wheat-growers a homeconsumption price of 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. Williamstown on that portion of the crop sold for human consumption in Australia. The Commonwealth Government undertook to do this on the definite assurance that the State Governments would introduce legislation to fix prices for flour in their respective States. The Commonwealth proceeded to prepare the legislation which it undertook to introduce upon the passing of the necessary legislation by the States. Recently representations were made by the Premiers of Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia seeking by different methods some allocation from the homeconsumption price fund for the purpose of rendering relief to drought-stricken farmers in their States. The suggestions made by those Premiers necessitated a departure from the home-consumption price plan as agreed to unanimously by the Premiers at their previous conferences, and the Commonwealth Government, therefore, deemed it advisable to call a further conference of Premiers or their representatives to discuss the whole question and ascertain what departure, if any, was unanimously desired from the plan which they had previously submitted to the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>A conference was held on Wednesday at Canberra of Ministers representing the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. </para>
          <para class="block">The Premier of Tasmania had indicated his views by telegram. This conference discussed the serious position of wheatgrowers in certain areas and States due to climatic conditions, particularly in Victoria where the incidence of drought will cause a serious decrease of the output of wheat for the 193S-39 season. </para>
          <para>It was realized that the Commonwealth Government, with its huge defence commitments, would not consider the making of an additional grant; so the conference discussed the question of allocation of the funds which will be derived from the sales tax on flour. It was realized that any proposal to allocate some portion of the fund for relief purposes would involve a departure from the plan as originally proposed by the States, but there was unanimity that assistance to distressed wheat-farmers during the current season was imperative. </para>

            <para>- As honorable members are aware a reorganization of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is under the consideration of the Government, but it is doubtful that &#34;legislation could be brought before the House before it adjourns for the Christmas break. If it cannot be introduced before that adjournment legislation will be submitted to Parliament at the earliest possible date. In the meantime it will be necessary to extend the term of the commission. </para>

            <para>- An assurance was given that the Government would take action to prevent any profiteering by those who produce armaments and munitions in cooperation with the Government munitions factories. Occasion to do so has not arisen. Moreover, those who have offered cooperation with the Government to meet its needs for armaments in a time of emergency have also given a guarantee that there will be no profiteering on their part. On our part, I have given an assurance that if there were any attempt at profiteering plans would be evolved to prevent it. 1 gave that assurance to the Australian trades unions through the Australasian Council of Trade Unions when I asked for their co-operation with the Government in the defence of this country, but I have not yet received any intimation that they will co-operate. </para>

In spite of all the assurances from the Minister for Defence that there is proper regulation of conditions in these shops, trades union officials in Melbourne report that when the officers of the department go around these premises they find men employed doing the work of boys. </para>

              <para>-It is incorrect to say that the Defence Department make&#39;s contracts which permit non-union labour to be employed. The particular firm the honorable member has in mind is engaged in the manufacture of military hats. I have discussed this subject with the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> and I am satisfied that a course is open for the union to take if it feels that any injustice is being done. Personally, I do not think any injustice is being done. In any case the union may cite the firm concerned as the respondent in an action, but it seems reluctant to do so. I have been approached by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports on this subject and have arranged to meet the secretary of the union, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Devereaux,</inline> at the earliest possible date to discuss the matter. The general observation that the Defence Department lets contracts without providing that award rates shall be paid is entirely without foundation. </para>

            <para>--I ask the Minister for Works whether it is true that the Works Department is so inadequately staffed as to make it impossible for the officers of the department to prepare plans and specifications expeditiously for certain jobs, and that, therefore, these particular jobs have had to be done by day labour? Will the Minister give me an assurance that the staff of the department will be strengthened so as to make possible the preparation of plans and specifications without undue delay? </para>

        <para>Mi-. FRANCIS  (Moreton) &#91;11.28&#93;.- The number of honorable members who rose, with me, to obtain the call from the Chair to continue this discussion indicates  the degree of enthusiasm to see the budget debate&#39; &#39;proceeded with immediately. I regret that so much delay has occurred in connexion with this matter. The budget was introduced on 9lst September last, but practically two months elapsed before the Government was able to make an opportunity for it to be discussed. In modification of such criticism a? may be offered respecting this delay, and of any observations that I may make on the subject, I confess that the international situation that developed, but which we aU hope has been terminated by the Munich . Pact, and the disorganization that has occurred in consequence of other untoward happenings, have undoubtedly contributed to the delay of which I complain. I hope, howover, that in the future the Government will make it possible for honorable members to proceed with the budget debate as soon as possible after the budget has been introduced, for many matters arise in connexion with every budget which honorable members wish to discuss. Delay in this respect does not permit honorable members to take a really effective part in discussing certain aspects of government policy affected by the budget. </para>
        <para>The outstanding feature of this budget is that this is the first occasion since the Lyons Government has been in office on which it has been found necessary to increase the burden of taxation on the people in this country. I am sure that, in view of the special international conditions existing to-day, all responsible taxpayers of Australia are ready to cooperate with the Government in endeavouring to secure national security and social betterment. Since the Lyons Government came into office it has reduced taxation by many tens of millions of pounds. The total cumulative effect of taxation remissions made by the Lyons Administration to the 30th June, 1938, may be estimated as follows: - </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="158331193811184_11_0.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para>This budget practically subordinates everything to defence. To every reasonable man and woman it must be an uncomfortable thought that, just as Australia is emerging from the depression and seems to be on the way to the enjoyment of a period of prosperity and financial security, we must of necessity submit to fresh taxation imposts which will once again throw us out of our stride. I am afraid we cannot afford to grumble. It is beyond the powers of Parliament to influence the trend of international affairs. The world is definitely heading for an epoch in which armed strength will be the final argument between nations, and we must accordingly arm ourselves to the best of our ability. </para>
        <para>In the current financial year Australia will incur a defence expenditure of nearly &#163;.17,000,000, as against &#163;11,000,000 last year and &#163;3,000,000 in 1931-32. These figures may sound very high, in fact staggering, to a peaceful people unaccustomed to the fear of war. Let us compare our defence expenditure with that of Great Britain. Australia expends 3 per cent, of its national income on defence, less than &#163;2 10s. a head of population, whereas Great Britain expends about S per cent, of its total income, or something like &#163;7 a head of population. But, in comparison with the other dominions, Australia&#39;s defence expenditure is outstanding. A feature of this defence expenditure is that the proportion that comes from loans is to bc considerably reduced. Whereas, during the last financial year, nearly onehalf of the &#163;11,500,000 expended on defence was borrowed money, this year only &#163;4,000,000 is to be provided out ofloan moneys. I congratulate the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> on this sound policy. Australia cannot, at this stage, afford to over-borrow, because of the very large loan conversions about to fall due. </para>
        <para>Of this year&#39;s expenditure nearly &#163;10,000,000 will be utilized in the building of defence works, ships, and aircraft, and in the manufacture or purchase of equipment, arms, ammunition and stores: The remainder is labelled, &#34; Maintenance expenditure &#34;. Very little expenditure is provided for in this budget for the enlargement of the personnel of our defence forces. The strength of our defence forces has been fixed at 35,000. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> has recently announced that an effort is to be made to double that number by raising  a volunteer army of 70,000. With this objective I am in accord. Every effort should be made to raise that number with as little delay as possible, but even a volunteer army of that size would be Of little avail if the troops were not more  efficient than the present 31,000 trainees, who, it is generally accepted, are only half trained. </para>
        <para>How could they be anything but half trained when they have only six days&#39; continuous training in camp, one day of which is taken up in going into camp, the issuing of supplies, stores, &#38;c, and one day in cleaning up camp, returning stores and returning to their homes? Only six other days of training scattered throughout the year are provided to enable them to fit themselves for their job of defending our continent. The volunteers have our wholehearted admiration and regard. We all appreciate the wonderful effort they are making in existing circumstances. I want it to be understood that I criticize not the volunteers but government policy in this respect. With units so highly mechanized as they must be to-day, the period of training to reach efficiency must of necessity take twice as  long  as it did in pre-war days. Therefore, I believe that greater provision should be made for an increase of the time devoted to training, and that a better system of training should be adopted. The problem is an urgent one. The criticism that I direct to this essentially defence budget is that not enough money is provided for the &#34;adequate training of our men who are to use the intricate mechanized arms and equipment now being purchased. Most of the defence expenditure will be incurred in the purchase of materials and equipment, and very little is to be expended on the personnel who are to use this mechanized equipment, or on the training of that personnel. </para>
        <para>The Government should grant increased pay to volunteers and should provide for the payment of efficiency pay which should be granted to trainees each year for three years. Should a trainee be deemed efficient in the discharge of his duties, and have served continuously for three years, he should be granted a further sum by way of deferred pay. To-day, volunteers stay only a short time with their units, with the result that the personnel of our forces is continually changing, making it difficult to advance much beyond recruit training. If voluntary training is to be successful, a special effort must be made to ensure that our trainees have, a right to attend camps of continuous training. It is the best training they get, but, unfortunately, the percentage that is able to attend camp is very low. All trainees want to attend camps, but they are fearful that if they approach their employers for the necessary time off, they will lose their employment. These men should not be exposed to this risk. The Defence Department must tackle this question as one of its most urgent problems concerning man power. If this be not done, and volunteers are not given at least three years&#39; continuous training they cannot be efficient, and the whole expenditure in connexion with the voluntary scheme would be more than futile. </para>
        <para>There is ample evidence of a lack of goodwill at defence head-quarters for the ex-members of the Australian Imperial Force. I have always felt that this is so. Of course, by far the majority of my comrades of the Australian- Imperial Force are either so disabled, or so advanced in years, further increased by the rigours of war service, that they could not be considered as available for our first-line defence in time of national emergency. There are, however, many ways in which the services and  experience  of the ex-members of the Australian Imperial Force could be utilized. Recently, I submitted to the then Minister&#39; for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> a plan for the effective utilization of the personnel of the Australian Imperial Force in the time of war. He undertook to put it into operation, but the recent ministerial change precluded him from doing so. I express the hope that the new Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline> will put the plan into operation at the earliest possible moment. The plan is as follows : - To obtain the fullest co-operation of the returned soldiers, the army, as at present constituted, must have as little to do with the &#34; digger &#34; as possible in his enlistment administration. </para>
        <para>From the day mobilization is ordered, no troops other than our militia are available for guard duties on railway bridges, oil depots, wireless stations, gas, water and electric light supplies protection, and for anti-sabotage. Militia cannot possibly mobilize and train intently with practically their whole present strength scattered everywhere on the. duties I have mentioned. </para>
        <para>Through the Federal President and the executive of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, of Australia, invitations should be extended to exAustralian Imperial Force and British Imperial ex-service men to volunteer for these home duties, the names being listed in their own sub-branch, or the nearest sub-branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, if they are not members of the league. </para>
        <para>Arrangements should be made to allot these ex-service men by platoons to the number required to be enlisted to the nearest militia battalion, keeping exservice men intact. </para>
        <para>Issue the men with complete war equipment at the. sub-branch or the drill hall, as found more convenient, the battalion or sub-branch to be responsible for the necessary accounting for such equipment on details as arranged. </para>
        <para>Allow the men to meet on their own arranged nights at intervals to be determined, whether at the drill hall or at the sub-branch of the league, as the case may be. If arrangements are made for them to meet at the drill hall, officers and noncommissioned officers should be allowed to have their own mess, or to be honorary members of the officers&#39; or sergeants&#39; mess. </para>
        <para>Arrange for payment at militia rates or a lump sum payment for privates, with <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> payments to non-commissioned officers and officers, subject to efficiency. Give them authority to deal with their own absentees, discharges and fresh enlistments. </para>
        <para>At the time of mobilization issue to them from the battalions, with which they are co-operating, full information as to their exact duties. The duties that the militia would normally undertake would be set out in the mobilization orders. ExAustralian Imperial Forde men could then proceed on their duties without further notice immediately mobilization was ordered. </para>
        <para>Ex-service men would normally be required to remain on duty after mobilization for a period of up to six or eight weeks, until the militia organization was&#34; smoothly running. The more elderly members of the ex-service organization could continue to remain on guard duties, while others might prefer to join service, units, or to act as instructors or administrators in training battalions or other base units. An important duty in respect of mobilization would thus be discharged very capably without fuss or loss of efficiency to the militia, who will need &#34; every man and every minute &#34;. </para>
        <para>An alternative proposal, or one that could be adopted in conjunction with that which I have just mentioned, is that ex-members of the Australian Imperial Force, and of the British Imperial Force, be invited to volunteer for refresher courses in the more modern and mechanized methods of warfare, and after competitive examination be granted provisional commissions in the Commonwealth Military Forces, or provisional appointments as non-commissioned officers. Their services could then be available for training with units of the militia forces, to whom they should be attached as reserves. </para>
        <para>As I pointed out earlier, I brought under the notice of the former Minister for Defence the details to which I have just referred, and discussed the matter with him at considerable length. He undertook, wherever possible, to adopt my suggestions. I understand that these proposals meet with the unanimous support of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia. I hope that the present Minister for Defence will approve of the scheme, and put it into operation without delay. </para>
        <para>There is one other point to which <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> should like to refer. A national registration should be made of our total manpower, and of the resources of our secondary and primary industries, so that the fullest use might be made of them. Men should be used where they can pull the greatest weight. Medical men, engineers, and the like, should not be used   in the infantry or light horse as combatant troops if their skill and training could be applied to greater national advantage elsewhere. </para>
        <para>During the last war, an extraordinarily large number of women&#39;s organizations were raised in Australia, Great Britain and other parts of the world. They were enabled to become thoroughly organized by reason of the fact that the war was of such lengthy duration. I see no reason why similar organizations should not now be established, composed of those who have grown to womanhood since the termination of the war, and are anxious to make their services available for the benefit of the nation, in case any emergency should arise. They could be used in many activities associated with preparations for defence, protection from gas attacks in our cities, and in red cross, ambulance and nursing services. </para>

            <para>- There is no &#39;more useful work than that of making certain that Australia is adequately defended. I know that the honorable gentleman does not hold ideas along those lines; he is a pacifist, because he knows that there are plenty of people in Australia who are willing and anxious to defend this country, and that, consequently, there is no need for him to do anything in that respect. I regard all that has been done by the Government as vital for the defence of this country, my only criticism being that it has not gone far enough. A great work lies ahead of the Government if &#34;the nation is to be adequately defended. Surface appearances indicate that sufficient has not so far been undertaken. We seem to be merely manufacturing and securing war materials. Although I admit that this is most urgent, I affirm that the other work is equally urgent. </para>

          <para>Whilst I regret that the shortage in the budget of &#163;3,184,000, owing to the special provision for defence, has to be made up by extra taxation, I congratulate the Government on the method it proposes to adopt to raise the additional amount required. I have yet to learn that any tax is popular; none is. The intention of the Government to meet the shortage is by an additional impost of 15 per cent, on income tax payable by companies and individuals, estimated to raise &#163;1,400,000, and by an increase of the sales tax from 4 per cent, to 5 per cent., estimated to raise &#163;1,300,000. It is an equitable proposal. Already the Government has specially exempted from sales tax all foodstuffs, goods usually required by the basic wage earners, the sick and the destitute, and the primary producer, also fields which offer particular opportunities for the encouragement of employment, and the requirements of educational, scientific and religious institutions, and the like. Accordingly, I think that the tax is placed where it can best be borne. </para>
          <para>I regret the necessity to increase the present rates of land tax by approximately 11.1 per cent.; but when it is recalled that this tax was reduced five years ago by 50 per cent., it will be realized that a very substantial measure of relief is still being given. The tax 13 collected only on land of a value of &#163;5,000 and over, and three-quarters of it is derived from city and town properties, only one-fourth being contributed by country lands. </para>
          <para>The Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> recently made a speech i a which he offered certain criticism of the Government which in my opinion was not based on sound premises. He said that youth employment and other social problems in which the Government professed to take a very deep interest had been omitted from the budget. I contend that the promises made in respect of these matters are being fulfilled. The Government has made available the sum of &#163;400,000, to be expended over a period of two years in connexion with youth em&#34;ployment. The measure of delay which has occurred in giving effect to this proposal is the responsibility of the Governments of the States. One must admit, however, that considerable organization was needed to enable plans to be prepared and details to be worked out for the absorption in industry of youths between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five years who because, of the depression, have never had an opportunity to obtain employment. In some cases, the State governments have tackled the problem with a certain degree of enthusiasm. In his criticism in this respect, the honorable gentleman disclosed the desperate position in which he found himself in attempting to make out a case against the Government. National insurance is the only social problem that he could have had in mind. Any delay that has taken place in the plans to put into operation the scheme which has already been given legislative expression has been caused by the unfortunate disaster to the air-liner <inline font-style="italic">Kyeema</inline> in the Dandenong Ranges, which caused the death of the legal representation of the British Medical Association which had been appearing before the royal commission inquiring into doctors&#39; remuneration. &#34;When that commission has completed its investigation and has submitted its report, there will be no delay in bringing the scheme into operation. </para>
          <para>The honorable gentleman also stated that the national debt had been increased very substantially since the Lyons Administration came into office. Se sought to leave in the minds of honorable members the impression that that increase had been due principally to faulty financial administration by this Government. </para>

              <para>- I shall endeavour to enlighten the honorable member for Batman. When this Government came into office, the national debt of Australia was &#163;1,182,566,000. At the 30th June last, it was &#163;1.275,026,000, an increase of &#163;92,460,000. I point out that in that period, the debts of the States increased by &#163;99,544,000, and there was a reduction of Commonwealth indebtedness by &#163;7,OS4,000. When the Lyons Administration assumed office, the Commonwealth national debt was &#163;397,929,000, and on the 30th June last, it was &#163;390,S45,000. </para>

            <para>.- The budget under review at the present time is certainly not a cheerful one. No one faces increased expenditure or increased taxation cheerfully, but if it causes serious reflection on national affairs, and sober thought on national problems, it will be all to the good. It has been frequently stated that we have passed the peak of prosperity, and are now entering upon a period of regression. Well, I do not agree that we have ever reached the peak of prosperity. Unless prosperity is provided for all, there is no peak of prosperity, and whatever measure of prosperity there exists for even a section of the community cannot be permanent unless it is also general. It is true that seasons and prices vary. Seasons are poor in some places, and prices rise and  fall. These factors affect the general welfare of the country, but if there were wise preparations, and a just distribution when things were plentiful, we could prevent the lean years from becoming tragic years. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We must look ahead in planning for a nation. There are numerous outstanding problems confronting Australia. Among them may be classed as most outstanding the industrial development of the nation, national defence, effective monetary reform, organized marketing, standardized railway gauge, the transfer of the unemployed from sustenance to permanent work, the simplification of methods of arbitration and the regulation of conditions of labour, and the control of combines to prevent profiteering. </para>
          <para>I shall not elaborate these problems, as they have been elaborated very effectively by others on previous occasions. I content myself at this stage with merely stating them, because it is my desire to stress just one aspect of government, that is, the reform of our parliamentary machine, which I regard as imperative. The outstanding problems I have mentioned, and others not specified, call for urgent attention, but many of them cannot be dealt with under our existing constitution. The bulk of them cannot be as effectively handled under the present system as under a unified system of government. </para>
          <para>After 38 years&#39; experience of the federal system, I doubt whether there is one thinking man who is satisfied with the results. The need for change is becoming more urgent day by day. One has only to recall the events of the last twelve months, or even less, to be convinced that we are reaching a stage when that change is imminent, and certainly desirable. There is always a call in war time for unity, and I suggest that we should also have unity in time of peace. The world around us is moving rapidly. Many nations are pursuing dangerous paths. Democracy, as we know it, is being sorely tried. In many countries, and in many places, democratic institutions have been destroyed, and it is idle for us in Australia to boast of our democracy unless we are determined to make it a real, living force. Democracy, as has been tritely observed, means government by the people. The people can govern only through their representatives in parliament, and, in my judgment, they can govern effectively only through a unified parliament. Our Constitution should clothe this Parliament of the nation with full legislative powers, so that it may respond readily to the wishes of the people. Legislation passed by this Parliament has, from time to time, been declared invalid. Parliament has been told that it did not have power to pass the laws, and that they were, therefore, <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> the Constitution. They were declared invalid, not on their merits, but on technical and legal grounds, because they were outside the constitutional powers of the Parliament. These decisions of the High Court, which was set up to interpret the Constitution, have created vexatious delays; they have caused expense in the industrial field of arbitration, and have disgusted the unions. Many of these have left the court ; many threaten to do so. It is a quarter of a&#39; century since that great constitutional authority and justice of the High Court, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, made the remark that the way to the Arbitration Court was through a veritable Serbonian bog of technicalities. That was 25 years ago, and the industrialists of Australia are still struggling in the morass. The first Federal Parliament realized this, though it was constituted largely of men who had drafted the Constitution. 1 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins,</inline> afterwards <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, moved this motion: - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That the Parliament shall have full power to make laws as to wages, hours and conditions of labour. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was carried by the Federal Parliament unanimously. We have not progressed much since then. The Constitution, as honorable members know, gives power to the Commonwealth in connexion with conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. Every word of that provision has been tested in the High Court. </para>
          <para>Passing from the industrial field to the larger field of economics and finance, what has &#39;been our experience? We have been compelled to adopt makeshifts in an attempt to overcome constitutional restraints. We have set up a loan counciL </para>
          <para class="block">We frequently call Premiers conferences, but these have proved merely expedients. Every national emergency has found us with the bands of the nation fastened by constitutional manacles. The result has been inaction and delay. No expedient can be devised, in my judgment, to secure unity of effort in Australia while we have seven sovereign powers, embracing thirteen houses of parliament, with 600 members of parliament, and 70 Ministers of the Crown, each, parliament having, for practical purposes, equal status and authority over many matters. With a population of 7,000,000 people, we have seven sovereign parliaments, seven governors, seven overseas representatives - the High Commissioner and the Agents-General - seven taxing authorities, seven railway departments, seven public works departments, seven police forces, and so on. It is grotesque, and there are many other departments that can be multiplied by seven. As a matter of fact, I regard these as the seven wonders of the world. </para>
          <para>The duplication and over-lapping inherent in this system cause delay and expense, and bring ridicule on the institution of Parliament. That is the most serious aspect of the matter. We are living in an age when democracy is being challenged. and if the parliamentary institution is not capable of responding to the will of the people in peace as well as in war, then the institution will suffer. To have our military and police forces under separate authorities is not only absurd, but also  highly  dangerous. .National security demands co-ordination of transport, yet we have seven railway departments, with three principal&#39; gauges and we have nine Commissioners of Railways. Public works in the various States are under independent authorities, so that works are not planned to meet national needs. They are planned to meet the needs of the areas, circumscribed by artificial geographical boundaries, called States. </para>

          <para class="block">I shall not elaborate that point, because we had an excellent debate on the subject yesterday, capably inaugurated by the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford),</inline> who was followed by other honorable members who also made excellent speeches. It is sufficient to state the position in order to call the attention of the people to these anomalies. Take one small matter which indicates the stupidity of this division of powers. I refer to the simple matter of a joint electoral roll. One would imagine that it would only be necessary to mention the need for a joint roll for it to be agreed to. State and Federal authorities cover the same areas, and represent the same people. As far as the Legislative Assemblies and the Commonwealth Parliament are concerned, we are on the same franchise, and yet we have been trying for 26 years to make arrangements with all the States for a joint roll. The first agreement was made with Tasmania 26 years ago, but. the job is not yet completed. So far, only four States have come into the agreement, and two are still outside. This makes for needless cost. The proposal of the Commonwealth for a joint roll does not even constitute a challenge to the power or authority of the States, yet we cannot induce all of them to agree to this simple measure of co-operation in the interests of efficiency and economy. The present system is misleading, inefficient and costly. </para>
          <para>These thing3 are faults of a federal system, and sooner or later we shall be forced to adopt a unified system, a system similar to that of Great Britain, South Africa and New Zealand. Canada is the only other member of the British Commonwealth of Nation&#39;s that works under a federal system, but even in Canada the central authority has much wider powers than the Commonwealth Parliament possesses. The Canadian Parliament has complete trade and commerce powers and possesses all residual powers that aTe not written into the provincial constitutions. Australia has a written constitution for the Commonwealth and the residual powers are left to the States. </para>
          <para>One of the arguments presented against one sovereign parliament for Australia is the size of Australia, the  broad  expanse of the country; but distance to-day is not the obstacle that it was when federation was accomplished. It has been almost annihilated by modern transport methods. For example when the &#39;first colonial parliament was set up in Sydney it took longer for members of that parliament to reach the seat of government from country constituencies than it now takes to travel to Canberra from the most distant parts of the Commonwealth. We have progressed in transport methods, but distance is still held up as a barrier or objection to sane government of the nation. If, on the score of size, Australia should have seven sovereign parliaments, Russia should have at least 20, but it has not. lt is not suggested by anybody who advocates one sovereign parliament for Australia that every detail should be dealt with by the national parliament. What is suggested is that the local details could be entrusted to small local bodies with powers delegated to them by the national parliament, retaining for the national parliament all national questions. If postal facilities can be provided for by a central authority, why cannot the railways? Is there any special circumstance in the management and control of railways that would make it impossible, impractical or inefficient for them to be controlled by one authority as we control the Postal Department? In our railways which we discussed here yesterday we find many anomalies. The Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> mentioned one of them, namely, the injustice of differential freight charges at the borders. It was said when we federated that by the abolition of border duties we should abolish border barbarism, but it still exists. The Minister mentioned the dragging of produce to the capital cities of States away from the natural ports and outlets for that produce by means of freight concessions. </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> yesterday mentioned decentralization. We shall never have real decentralization in Australia until we have one unified parliament, because the influence of the State capital cities is too great in the State Parliaments. There would not be that influence if we had one national parliament. Under such a system no one could imagine the freight rates of railways being fixed to haul produce to capital cities hundreds of miles further away from the place of production than other cities or ports of outlet. That could not be imagined under a unified system. </para>
          <para>Then we have the question of the public debt. In the final analysis the whole of Australia&#39;s debt, Commonwealth and State, is a Commonwealth liability, and this debt is based upon the nation&#39;s assets. Our land, our railways, and our forests, and other great national assets are under the control of the States, whereas the debts which have been incurred in respect of them are, ultimately, the responsibility of the Commonwealth. Nobody will be pleased with the way in which those assets are being conserved, or, rather, with the lack of conservation of them. I do not propose to go into that aspect, because on former occasions, not only I, but also other honorable gentlemen, have gone deeply into the question of the destruction of timber, soil erosion, and the silting of streams. I am glad to - see that there  has  been a little awakening of interest, but it is still small, and the voices of those who protest against the destruction of our assets still are voices crying in the wilderness. I pay tribute, however, to the federal authority in forestry matters for&#39; what it has done towards the conservation of our forests, but there is still  diversity  of control. The best interests of the nation would he served if forestry matters were dealt with by an authority clothed with power from one Parliament. I am keen on the decentralization of our population and development, but I believe that we shall never achieve it until we have a unified system. I represent a city electorate and I have never wavered in my  detestation  of slums due to the growth of the capital cities at. the expense of the rural population and to the detriment of the nation as a whole. Even if it bc not economically profitable to distribute our industries over the whole of the country, instead of centralizing them in the  capital  cities, it would be nationally sound. </para>
          <para>The main purpose of having a unified  system  would be to end the  legal  arguments as to what are the powers of the Commonwealth and what are the powers of the States, whether this is Eeder.il or :that is State. We have cost, delay, and vexatious litigation, when the people of :this country are  asking  us to get on with the work. These disabilities are inherent to a federal system. &#39; The High Court has been set up to interpret the Constitution. We cannot complain about what justices of the High Court do in carrying out their work, but I do complain about the system. After legislation has been in force for yean, it is challenged in the High Court and often thrown out by a legal decision, irrespective of whether the people want it - we imagine that they must if their representatives pass it ; otherwise we do not understand democracy. Interpretation of the Constitution in the High Court becomes almost a personal thing. With the changes of personnel of the High Court Bench, come changes of interpretation of the Constitution. We are ruled in a large number of cases, not by a majority of the people, but by a majority of the justices of the High Court or members of the Privy Council. </para>
          <para>I am grateful to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> for his having supplied me with a list of the cases in which the High Court has overruled its own decisions. They are not numerous, but are far-reaching in their effect and there must be added to them the many cases in which the decisions have been by majority. In many cases, if one justice had turned one way instead of the other, the High Court would have reached decisions opposite to those which they did reach. An outstanding illustration is the history of the interpretation, of section 92 of the Constitution. Section 51 of the Constitution, which specifies the powers of the Commonwealth, sets out <inline font-style="italic">inter alia</inline> that it shall - have power to make laws for the peace, or, and good Government of the Commonwealth with  respect  to trade and commerce with other countries and among the States - whereas section 92 provides that - trade  commitee  and intercourse among the States shall he absolutely free. </para>
          <para class="block">Those words &#34; absolutely free &#34; have caused  more  argument than any other two simple words in the English language. We are told by th. t eminent constitutional authority, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harrison</inline> # Moore, that the phrase &#34; absolutely free &#34; i3 &#34; vague and question begging/&#39; whereas we always thought it was simple. To illustrate how section 92 of the Constitution operates in respect of the marketing and handling, of goods between State and State, I cite the <inline font-style="italic">Foggitt Jones</inline> case which was heard before the High Court in 1916. Foggitt Jones and Company Limited, a company incorporated in Queensland, instituted an action against the State of New South Wales to prevent it from impeding their right to purchase livestock in New South  Wales  and take them to Queensland. The High Court held by a majority of four to one, the fifth justice being doubtful, that the legislation of New South Wales which sought to prevent the sale of stock in New South Wales to other Stales, was invalid. In (September, 1916, a few months later, in the <inline font-style="italic">Duncan</inline> case, almost exactly the same class of legislation passed by the Parliament of Queensland was tested in the High Court which ruled by a majority of five to two that the legislation was valid. Then in 1920, the High Court in the <inline font-style="italic">Mc Arthur</inline> case &#39;held by a majority of five to two that the decision in the <inline font-style="italic">Duncan</inline> case was wrong and that the decision in the <inline font-style="italic">Foggitt Jones</inline> case was right. Then the Privy Council in 193C put the &#34; kibosh &#34; on the lot. It decided that neither the Commonwealth Government nor a State government had the power to do what either had been doing In 1920 it was held that the Commonwealth could, but that the States could not. make certain legislation, whereas sixteen years afterwards the Privy Council declared that it could not be done either by the Commonwealth or by the States, acting together or apart, and as the result our legislation on marketing to a large degree went by the board. Even when we have the court&#39;s kindly permission to legislate on behalf of the people of this country, we are later overruled in our legislation at times by a decision of a  High  Court of half a dozen justices or by the Privy Council. The last decision of the Privy Council, I understand, leaves a gap in the powers of the Commonwealth Government and of the State governments. Most of us laymen, atanyrate, and. most lawyers, had believed that powers&#39; existed to make the legislation which the Privy Council upset. </para>

          <para>On the industrial side of the question, the p6wer Of conciliation and arbitration, there has been great difficulty. The unions&#39; have expended tens of thousands of pounds in order to have a decision reached as to what is meant by the words in the Constitution. The unions fought for this interpretation because they wanted a common rule. We have step by step come a little closer to its but we havenotgotityet. The case of the railway employee&#39;s is an example and a warning. It was held at first that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court could hot fix labour conditions for railways which were instrumentalities of the States. We went to the country with two referendum proposals asking for that and other industrial powers to be given to the Commonwealth, but the people rejected them. After deliberation in 1915 the States agreed to transfer industrial powers to the Commonwealth, but they broke their word. The High Court, however, came along in 1920, and said that the Commonwealth Court had the power all the time to make awards for railway employees. But there is no guarantee that that decision will stand, because other decisions have been overruled. </para>
          <para>I am indebted tothe Commonwealth Solicitor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knowles,</inline> for hisbook, <inline font-style="italic">The Australian Constitution.I</inline> commend all honorable gentlemen who have not yet read it to do so. It contains all of the constitutionalcases, and the details of the voting at each referendum, as well as much other useful information. He refers to what one of the Arbitration Court judges termed &#34;infamous word splitting &#34;. I am not intending to impose details upon honorable members in the brief space of time that I have at my disposal, but I use them as a background for my thoughts&#39; on the matter. I find <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knowles&#39;s</inline> book most interesting. </para>
          <para>Not only are cases over-ruled by the High Court, but the court even over-rules its own previous decisions. Moreover, many dissenting judgments have been given. In fact, we hardly know where we are, in respect of the court. Here is an example: The court held; in a certain case, that an award was binding on a successor in a business. It might have been imagined that it would not be necessary to go to the court to discover that; yet the decisionwas based on a three-to-two judgment of the court. In some cases&#39;, judges are divided three on each side, and the Chief Justice is required to determine the issue with a casting vote. These numerous majority decisions of the High Court may be over-ruled in the future by merely an alteration of one in the personnel of the High Court bench. Professor Harrison Moore declared that a change in the personnel of the bench &#34; might iead to revolutionary changes in the interpretation of the law.&#34; He also remarked - &#34; The High Court has not declared itself bound by its own decisions.&#34; Although the court is not bound by its own decisions, this Parliament of representatives of the people of the Commonwealth is bound thereby, In effect, the court assumes legislative authority under the Constitution. It has a power of veto in respect of the legislation of this Parliament. That is not democracy. I am not criticizing either the court or its justices. I mention these facts to show a weakness that i3 inescapable from, and inherent in, the federal system. As Professor Dicey said : &#34; Federalism means  excessive legalism.&#34; We should extricate ourselves from this tangled web of legalism. We need a clean-cut method of government, which we would have if an alteration of the Constitution were made and Australia had a one united parliament. I commend the Australian Natives Association for the splendid work it has done in educating the public mind on this subject. It has taken a broad outlook. </para>
          <para>I suggest that this Parliament should meet early next year, dispose of such business as the Government has to submit, and then hold a Constitution session, to formulate proposals for the alteration of the Constitution for submission to the people at the  next  general elections. In my humble opinion it is imperative for us to do something of this kind. It may be said that 1 am looking a long time ahead. I believe that in the past we have never given the people sufficient opportunity to consider Constitutional proposals. Campaigns extending over four or six weeks have been held, and a good deal of misrepresentation has occurred. I do not blame either party for this. In fact  all  sides have been guilty of it to some degree, because the issues involved have nearly always been affected, by the policy of the government in power at the time. We should try to avoid anything of that description. Any proposals formulated for the alteration of the Constitution should be divorced from Government policy, and clear cut issues should be submitted to the people. Surely, after 38 years&#39; experience of the Constitution, we should be able to discuss with an open mind the situation in which we find ourselves. If such a session as I have suggested were held, differences of opinion would probably be revealed. If that should be so, the people should be invited to decide as between the issues involved. At least we should ask the people if they favour one sovereign parliament for Australia. It may be said that  on  other occasions the people have refused to extend the power of this Parliament and that we must accept this situation. I remind honorable members that some of us, I among the number, have stood for election at different times and have been defeated; but we have stood again and have been elected. We do not believe that we should give up the effort because a defeat has met us. Many people whom 1 met during the recent referendum campaign voted in the negative because, they said, &#34;Australia has too many parliaments and therefore the parliaments have too much power.&#34; I wish to give the people an opportunity to elect one parliament for Australia. If they are given that opportunity I believe that they would accept it. </para>
          <para>We should recast our whole Constitution. Some people speak about the Constitution as though it were sacrosant because it was. drafted by great men of the past. For this reason they say that we must not place our unholy hands upon it. But is the dead past forever to rule the living present? I hope not. That was never intended. When the late honorable Alfred Deakin presented the Constitution to the people of Australia he said : &#34; It is the framework and ground plan of the nation.&#34; &#39; It was expected that we would build on this ground plan, and improve the framework. All our industrial machinery has been modernized but our machinery of government is obsolete. Our throbbing, pulsating life and activity is deadened by a musty parchment. If we continue like this we shall be political mummies in a constitutional tomb. </para>
          <para>Our population is homogeneous. Our people have the same habits and the same traditions; they speak the same language, and look to the same ideals. With one parliament we should march forward as one people to greater and higher achievements. </para>

The problems to which he has referred will have to be solved some day by this Parliament in particular, and. the country at large. In these days, the right honorable gentleman seldom takes an active part in the debates in this Parliament, but when he speaks, he invariably gives us food for thought.

The Government did a great deal to help the country out of the depression in which it rested a few years ago. I do not say that it should be given all the credit for the position in which we find ourselves today, but at least it gave the people a lead and much that has been accomplished during the last few years should be placed to its credit. </para>

          <para>I wish to direct attention to certain vital factors in relation to the motor industry of Australia and our supply of petrol and oils. The necessity for improving our position in respect of local supplies of petrol and oil is urgent. In 1937-38, 351,000,000 gallons of petrol were used in Australia. Of this quantity, 332,750,000 gallons, valued at &#163;5,503,085, were imported, and 18,250,000 gallons were produced in Australia. The duty and primage tax, amounting to  7&#188;d.  per gallon, on this petrol yielded &#163;9,761,810 in 1937-38. The urgency of this problem is partly in the fact that scientists and geological experts have declared that the world&#39;s known sources of petrol supply are being rapidly exhausted. It is predicted that they will be utterly depleted within the next twenty years, in these circumstances it is logical to assume that in the  future  the cost of petrol and oil will increase proportionately to the rate of exhaustion, lt is interesting to note that in 1937-38 the motoring community of Australia paid &#163;10,66S,000 in taxes to the Government in one way and another. An important factor that we must not overlook is that a very large amount of the money paid by our people for petrol and oils is taken out of Australia. If such huge sums are permitted to pour continuously out of Australia into foreign countries, a serious situation must arise. It would be interesting to calculate what period would elapse under such a policy of national wastage to reach the zenith of Australian progress or for its 7,000,000 inhabitants to liquidate the national debt of &#163;1,275,026,000. I ask the Treasurer, or some other responsible Minister, to make a specific statement about what the Commonwealth Government and the State governments are doing to find a substitute for petrol ? Has the Defence Department made any experiments in this direction? If not, it should do so, at least for defence purposes. I ask also whether the possibilities of producer gas have been investigated in any real way? An effective substitute for petrol is very greatly needed, for liquid power fuel is, in some respects, the very life-blood of the community. </para>

              <para>- I point out that, unless provision is made for a supply of petrol substitutes, the cutting off of the supply of petrol from overseas during a- time of national emergency would paralyse our industries and render us unable to defend ourselves against an aggressor.&#39; The gravity of the position can be realized when we learn that supplies of petrol on hand at present are sufficient to last only a few days. We have heard quite a lot about oil from shale and coal, but are those two sources sufficient to supply our requirements of oil fuel in the event of emergency? My own opinion is that they are not, and that the yield from those sources is definitely restricted. In a country like Australia, every endeavour should be made to find a substitute  for imported petrol. The only solution of this vexatious problem would seem to lie in the direction of making provision on a large scale for the development of producer gas. I ask the Government to have this important matter fully investigated by competent authorities, and to report to Parliament the full facts disclosed. I understand that at the present time the Defence Department is operating a few large trucks on producer gas. To give some idea of its utility, I may mention that I have been informed that the total cost of running a large lorry from Canberra to Sydney on producer gas is only Ss. This experiment on the part of the Defence Department seems to hold out some promise, and should commend it to the business community as a means of effecting economies in the cost of transportation. </para>

          <para>I am not at all satisfied with the present method adopted by the Government in connexion with the tabling of tariff schedules. A practice has grown up in recent years of tabling tariff schedules and providing no opportunity to honorable members to debate them until months have elapsed. Let us consider what has happened in the past in connexion with the tabling of tariff schedules. The first Australian tariff schedule was passed by the Federal Parliament in 1901. It is claimed that the 1901 schedule was adopted as the basis for subsequent schedules. Later, when an alteration or an amendment of the schedule was tabled, the procedure was adopted that if a schedule contained a reduction of duties the previous duties at the higher rate would continue to be collected until the new schedule was passed. By this means it was sought to safeguard the revenue and to protect industries until Parliament had decided on the rates of duties that should be imposed. This method was consistent with the terms of section 90 of the Constitution, which reads - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>On the imposition of uniform duties of customs the power of the Parliament to impose duties of customs and of excise, and to grant bounties on the production or export of goods, shall become exclusive. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It gave the Federal Parliament full freedom in any action it took in regard to a vote on customs duties to be collected. That procedure held good with all parliaments until the 6th December, 1934, when the then Minister for Trade and Customs, on tabling a tariff schedule, surprised Parliament by announcing that the reduced duties contained in the schedule would become operative on the following morning. During 1935, additional tariff schedules were tabled which also included a large number of reductions of duties, and the same dangerous procedure was followed. It should be noted that no discussion of the new duties was commenced until the 21st March, 1936, when the Minister moved that the schedule to the customs tarilf be amended. Tariff schedules were tabled on the 28th November, 1935, and included a schedule introduced on tbe 6th December, 1934, together with others introducing new items. These schedules, dating back  to  the 6th December, 1934, and extending up to the 31st March, 1936, were not finalized by Parliament until the end  of  May, 1936, about eighteen months after the first schedule was tabled. </para>

              <para>- That is certainly a step in the right direction, but the law is not being adhered to. Let us proceed further: Another schedule was tabled on the Sth December, 1937, which included other schedules tabled previously on the 24th June and the 7th September, 1937. These schedules were not finally disposed of by the Parliament until early in June, 1938. I put it to honorable members that the question may well be asked &#34; How can the electors or the business community keep pace with this practice?&#34; In my opinion the time is ripe for attention  to be called to this practice, which has grown up only during the last three years. Members should not be denied the right to discuss items contained in tariff schedules immediately they are introduced. The procedure at present followed places too much power in the hands of the Minister for Trade and Customs. </para>

          <para>Once again- I refer to the fact that when the State of South Australia entered into an agreement to surrender the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth, an agreement was reached between the two governments for the construction of a railway line from Darwin to the South Australian border. The present position is that the Commonwealth has honoured the agreement only in part by the construction of a line from Pine Creek in the north to Birdum, and in the south from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. The gap between Alice Springs and Birdum, a distance of approximately 647 miles, has still to be bridged. We are informed that there is at present available at Birdum sufficient material to put down an additional 43 miles of railway. I listened with a great deal of interest to the speeches delivered on the motion for the adjournment of the House yesterday to discuss the necessity for the standardization of Australian railway gauges. In my opinion that is a most important matter, but I also feel that from a defence point of view the time has arrived when the gap between Birdum and Alice Springs should be bridged by the railway promised by the Commonwealth when the territory was handed over to it by South Australia. </para>

              <para>- I believe that, like the little drops of water which wear away a stone, constant reiteration of the need for the undertaking of this work might bring results. At present the Government is incurring a large expenditure of money for defence purposes, and it may be difficult to raise money for railway development; but I . should like to hear the views of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline> on the desirability of the construction of this line as a defence measure. If it is not possible to complete the north-south railway the Government would, in my opinion, be justified in expending the money necessary to construct a line from Alice Springs to Tennant Creek. I have visited Tennant Creek on two different occasions, and I am satisfied that there is great mineral wealth there. That wealth can only be tapped successfully by the, construction of such a line. </para>

          <para>I recently had an opportunity to visit Darwin, and wish to make reference to the burning question of the resumption of land and property in that town for naval and military purposes. It is not too much to say that among the citizens of Darwin there is widespread dissatisfaction at the rumoured intention of the Commonwealth to acquire considerable areas of the town for these purposes. The uncertainty as to the land that is actually to be taken, and the prohibition issued against proceeding with certain proposed building projects, are exasperating to both the official and the business population, and are retarding essential development. Inflated prices were recently paid for land in Darwin, and this will lead to a greatly increased cost of acquisition if they are taken as the basis of valuation. The Government should make public its intentions as soon as practicable. Full consideration should be given to all local representations, in order that the townspeople may feel assured that the best interests of both the residents and the town are being safeguarded. I promised a number of persons in Darwin that I would take the first opportunity presented to me to bring this matter before Parliament. It is vital to the town. I am acquainted with the area which the defence authorities say they require, and, in my opinion, it is not necessary that they should acquire property in that location. There is plenty of land in and around Darwin suitable for naval and military purposes, without disorganizing the populated part of the town, including some beautiful sites on the harbour itself. The Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> had an opportunity to investigate the matter during his recent visit to the Northern Territory, and I hope that in collaboration with the Administrator he will find a solution of the problem. </para>

          <para>Reading the report of the board, one is amazed to note the immense amount of time which must have been devoted to the elaboration of material from the offices of large overseas firms whoseinterests lie in the stoppage of any development within our borders of competition which may in any way affect their plans. The board does not show in&#34; its report how many of these overseas organizations are entwined in the meshes of the great American net, with control of factories in England and other parts of the world, including Australia. The one bright spot in the matter is the fact that that great industrial organization at Newcastle - the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited - is able to sell its products at prices below those at which purchases can be made in the United States of America. In my opinion, the board did not investigate the matter as fully as the Parliament and the people had a right to expect. Either personally or by  deputy,  it should </para>
          <para class="block">Lave inspected engines brought under its notice during the course of the inquiry, so that it could either praise or condemn the features which were claimed to be of advantage to Australia. It should be pointed out that no inquiry has been made with a view to endorsement of evidence given to the board to the effect that the engine power can be made wholly from materials produced in Australia, the specifications in respect of ferrous metal being cast iron and one mild steel, those of the non-ferrous metal being aluminium, bronze, and white metal. Surely we should be in a position to say whether or not the materials necessary for the building of a car are obtainable in Australia! The boardwas asked to do a certain thing, but it failed to make a complete investigation. It might have asked to be shown under working conditions an engine made in Adelaide, or it might have discussed the charts showing the output of power, fuel consumption, torque, and other technical details which either were supplied or were available, but it did not do so. Even to-day there is displayed in a showroom in the main street of Adelaide an engine manufactured in that city at a cost of only &#163;35. The Tariff Board has made no mention whatever of it. It is difficult for me to believe that motor car engines cannot be successfully manufactured in Australia. Necessity is a driving force. There is need for a cheaper car, and I believe that such a car could be economically manufactured inthis country. Australian industries have developed in this country, the stripper, the harvester, the stump-jump implement, the string binder, and milking and shearing machines. This development has been of great assistance to our primary industries. Why should Australian citizens be asked to pay such big prices as are demanded for motor vehicles, cars, &#38;c? The purchasing public of Australia are crying out for the production of an Australian vehicle, designed and equipped for the transport of persons of moderate spending capacity. They do not want cars equipped with all the expensive gadgets, upholstery, and fittings, which aim at a false standard and at outside show. What they want is a car that will take a family in reasonable comfort from 30 to 35 miles on a gallon of petrol at a speed of from 45 to 50 miles an hour if necessary. I </para>
          <para class="block">Lope I may live to the day when cars are made in Australia at a price that will enable a working man to purchase one. The Tariff Board has shown in its report that, on the same calculated money basis, cars sold in the United States of America at &#163;19S are sold in Australia at &#163;445, a difference- of &#163;267. The English Ford, which sells at &#163;180 in England, is sold in Australia for &#163;2S5. The Australian worker and producer should be put in the way of making a purchase of a new product, instead of having to take over a discarded c-r of a more expensive type, thus attaching himself, because of the low capital outlay, to a vehicle which must drain his resources by expensive running costs, taxation, &#38;c. I regret that the Tariff Board has not gone more deeply into this matter of motor vehicles. I trust that, in the near future, the problem will be tackled by the Government, and that eventually complete motor cars will be made in Australia. </para>

          <para>I intend this afternoon to make two appeals, one for the children who are too young to go to school, and, therefore, do not share in the distribution of milk to school children, and the other is on behalf of the Jews. </para>
          <para>As for the children, I regret that in some schools one pint of milk is diluted with two pints of water to m.;ke it go further. 1 hope the Commonwealth Government will make enough money available to enable every child in Australia to receive two pints of milk a day, the same as is done in Russia, throughout the whole of its vast domain. In Germany, the children are given more milk than we give, while in England, good luck to them, millions of pounds are devoted to this purpose. Though T know the  wisest  among the Greeks sard in regard to the study of life, &#34; J udge the end &#34;, I say rather &#34; Let us judge the beginning.&#34; There is no one in this House,  whether  he  be  engaged in agricultural pursuits, or in merely looking after a garden, who does not know that plants will not thrive unless they have good food, water and sunlight. So with a little child. Unless he has milk in his first two years, he cannot hope to grow up into a thriving, strong adult. I should like to see the mothers, in the pre-natal stage of the child&#39;s life, also receive a proper allowance of milk. I have some pictures here of .children in a Salvation Army Home in Victoria, to which a cow was recently presented. I am sure that there is not one honorable member in this House whos would not vote te give each of these children two pints of milk a day. Some time ago, I made an appeal throughout the whole of Victoria, for financial assistance in order that milk might be bought for the children. I spoke personally in as many centres as possible, and, in order that the appeal might be made everywhere, I, in my  81st  year, tried to become a movie actor so that a film might be prepared to curry the appeal throughout the country. In the film, I was introduced to the public by my old friend, now dead, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prendergast,</inline> and when I afterwards saw myself wobbling across the lawn, as I was depicted in the picture, I realized what a lame duck I was. .1 never asked for more than a donation of a penny or a half-penny. More, of course, was given, and honorable members will bo interested to know that we raised moTe than &#163;4,000 in order that milk might be supplied to children in creches and kindergartens. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to ensure that every child in Australia shall have a chance. No child asks to come into the world ; no child can come into it except at or by the will of its parents. Every child, once he comes into the world, is a unit of the State, and as such has the right to proper food and clothing, so that he may grow into a healthy adult, and be a credit to the nation. I wish that the example of New Zealand could be followed in respect of this matter and others. Already, in New Zealand, &#34;the old-age pension has been increased to 30s. a week, and the allowance for children to 10s. a week. There is one provision in connexion with the appointment of </para>

I quote from a publication called <inline font-style="italic">History in the Making,</inline> being a summaryof the actions of New Zealand&#39;s first Labour Government, by David Wilson, in which the following occurs - </para>

The only proviso is that all ordinary members who participate must give all their time to the discharge&#39; of their parliamentary duties and be willing at all times to co-operate with Ministers in administrative and research work. The scheme also provides that each Minister shall co-opt a number of members whose duty it will be to assist in drafting new legislation and administering the department concerned.  1 am certain that there is a great deal of merit in that system. If it were in operation here, we Should not hear so&#34; much about rights of precedence in the Cabinet. There would not be the same desire to obtain highly-paid posts in the Government. They would all be paid at theonerate. Of course, all expenses in connexion with the administration of the party would be met, The system would have the great advantage that it would tend to train men in the rules and procedure of Parliament, and in that way a great deal of time would be saved. </para>

          <para>In the north-west portion of our continent there is a great fertile strip which I suggest could under certain conditions be provided by this country as a home for the Jews. That piece of country was surveyed more than 100 years ago by one of the greatest ambassadors that England ever sent from its shores, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Grey.  His  report of his survey contains a reference to the splendid physique&#34; of the natives in the area and to the fertility of the soil. The honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blain)</inline> could verify the fact that the natives in. that district are of splendid physique.- Some of them-, I understand, are 7-ft. tailzie is due to the wonderful nature of the country that they are so splendidly built. The only objection which could be raised by any honorable member against allowing the settlement of Jewish refugees in that portion of Australia would be that there would be a danger of their gravitating to the cities and overcrowding them. That objection has been made in the press, even bv Jews already in Australia. I have a suggestion, however, that could overcome that objection. When the Arabs overran Spain and Portugal, the Jews were held in high esteem, but later were expelled from Spain and fled to Prance and Holland, mainly to Holland. Then, when Cromwell, whom they saw to be, in many ways,  a just man, ruled England, they felt that he would give them a home in England. They approached him and he granted their request for a home in England On a strict agreement, which was signed and honored. The congregations of Jews in Germany and  Poland,  learning how happy die Jews were in England - there were no immigration barriers then - followed them to England. They, however, were not bound by any agreement, and 1 suppose they thought that they could take liberties. To show how faithfully the Portugese and Spanish Jews observed the agreement which was made with Oliver Cromwell5 I cite the fact that, even when I was pursuing my studies in England between 1880 and 18S7, it was considered a mesalliance for a Spanish ov Portugese Jewess to marry a German or Polish JeW. We have brains enough among our lawyers to formulate a contract which Jewish settlers would have to sign  and  abide by. They could be supplied with life cards containing their photographs as a check on their movements, but I know enough about the Jews to know that they would abide by any contract they make. If Australia offered those people a home, it would be the first time in- centuries that they would realize that they were welcome in a country. Every honorable member is a Christian or a professing Christian, and as the Jewish people were good enough from which to take our Messiah it is good enough for us to give the Jews a home. The settlement of the Jewish refugees in the north-west of this continent would bc worth many ironclads in the defence of Australia. How they would fight! Honorable members should know from the good Book how Judas Maccabees rose against the might of Rome, whose power in Europe was greater evan than the power of Germany in Europe to-day. I make this appeal in the hope that the Commonwealth Government will give&#39; a lead to the world.

There was a feeling that the late Signor Marconi, the Italian genius, has invented an appliance to render aeroplanes powerless. I sought information as to whether there was any foundation for that belief, but none was available. It would cost &#163;10,000,000 in Australian currency for Australia to purchase a battleship. On the basis of the figures supplied in answer to my questions, for that expenditure we could buy sixteen of the most expensive types of submarines. Admiral Jackie Fisher, one of the greatest admirals since Nelson, says that submersibles would make Australia impregnable. For. the same outlay of money, 250 of the most expensive bombing aircraft could be obtained and 1,111 of the least expensive. I cannot imagine any battleship of an opposing power wanting to approach our shores if the admiral of the fleet knew that there were more than 1,100 bombing aircraft available to repulse him. Aeroplanes are the most mobile force in the world. It is interesting to note the number of lives risked on battleships, submarines and aeroplanes respectively. A battleship carries 61 officers and 1.304 other ratings, making a total of 1,365 ; a submarine carries five officers and 55 men; and a twin-engined medium bomber carries one officer and three men. Yet the bomber may sink a battleship which </para>

          <quote>
            <para>May I offer you my most sincere congratulations on your advocacy of submarines and aeroplanes in the House yesterday. </para>
            <para>I am a retired captain, Royal Navy, and my wife and I came out here ten years ago for climatic reasons. </para>
            <para>During that time, I have written many letters to the West <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on the subject of Australian defence, especially the naval side of it. </para>
            <para>Recently, I wrote a private letter to the editor of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> urging him to take up the subject. </para>
            <para>Briefly, my convictions are: First, that the original conception of an independent Australian navy was a mistake, but that cannot now be altered; secondly, that the ships now in service in her Navy are oil-burners, which is a vital mistake. And she has just bought two more. They should have been dualburners. A splendid quality of steaming coal is available in New South Wales, whereas, in all probability, oil supply would he the first tiling Japan would try to cut off. </para>
            <para>Then the question of submarines. Australia now has none. They are the ideal defensive weapons nf small poor nations. They are the only type of warship which wou&#39;d deter Japan from sending a battle squadron to bombard coastal ports such as Sydney. </para>
            <para>After settling down here, I was amazed to find the confirmed belief that the Singapore Naval Base would be a tower of strength in the defence of Australia.. I proceeded to show that in the first place a naval base was of no earthly (or should I say &#34;watery&#34;) use to any one unless there was a fleet based on it; and that, in the second place, there was no British fleet in existence to spare for that purpose. </para>
            <para>I found that Australia did not seem to have any definite policy for defence; it was merely a political shuttlecock. 1 am not interested in politics. Early this year, I wrote to and saw <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> on these very points. But since then, we have had a very startling reminder of Australia&#39;s defenceless condition. In my opinion, there should be a permanent council of defence, <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> body of men competent to study the subject from all angles, and to recommend suitable action. Defence is not only a matter of men and guns, it is also the art of cultivating friendly relations with one&#39;s neighbours, and is no less economic than military. Those blundering wool and iron ore embargoes, for instance. Have they had no effect on Japanese feelings towards this country <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>
            <para>There is strong professional opinion in England that the exclusive use of oil fuel in the Navy is a tragic blunder.It renders the fleet dependent on neutral friendliness for its mobility, instead of using the finest steam coal a beneficent nature has provided the country with. And the oil supplies call for a considerable proportion of naval protection. </para>
            <para>I notice that you received the standard reply to your suggestions, &#34; adopted on the advice of the bust naval experts.&#34; That is just where Australia makesher greatest mistake. Who are these &#34;&#39; experts &#34; Are they responsible for the condition of the British Navy to-day? Are they the same type of &#34; experts &#34; who are responsible for the appalling revelations we are now reading of - Great Britain&#39;s unpreparedness, after two or three years &#34; rearming &#34;? </para>
            <para>You have been inflicted with the advice of visiting experts &#34;, the most recent being the advice of Admiral Kelly to exchange two cruisers for a battleship. The one, battleship presumably being to fight the Japanese Navy! Then I believe you had Admiral Jellicoe recommending eight battleships, which automatically entailed sixteen cruisers, thirty-two destroyers, <inline font-style="italic">&#38;c, &#38;c,</inline> with two complete naval liases, docks, workshops, storehouses, &#38;c. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby</inline>quoted the costs of up to date submarines. Australia does not need up todate ones. In any case, she could not at present get them from Great Britain. But she probably could get a flotilla from the United States of America of what are classed as &#34; over-age &#34; vessels, completed after the war. All that Australia requires are small seaworthy vessels; the mere fact of having them in commission would ensure that they would never be required in action. </para>
            <para>As for the nil versus coal question, the present ships could not be converted. Coalburners can be adapted for oil fuel, but not vice versa. But asI see no useful purpose in Australian cruisers, they are of little consequence. </para>
            <para>There is too much of the 1014-18 mentality in service minds. They think in terms of the last war, not the next one. Those who try to think of the future are classed as cranks. The experts &#34; still prattle about protection of trade routes.&#34; Australia will not worry about trade routes when she is fighting to the death on her own soil for her own existence! Like China to-day. </para>
            <para>Australia might with great benefit study the composition of the Netherlands naval forces. She realizes the usefulness of submarines in the defence of her eastern possessions. </para>
            <para>I hope, sir, that you will persevere with your arguments and at least arouse the nation to the danger of the present haphazard methods of providing for its defence. </para>

          <para>A good deal has been said from time to time about the necessity for ships to protect our trade routes; but, so far as I know, no big shipping company that is really Australian in character engages in the overseas trade. For this reason, I contend that those who are really interested in the overseas shipping business should protect the trade routes. I have no doubt that surplus Australian wool, wheat and edible commodities would be of great value to people overseas in the event of war. We may, therefore, leave to those other interests the responsibility to provide for the safe transit of these commodities abroad. Unfortunately, a great deal of foodstuffs is destroyed from time to time for commercial reasons. A year or so ago, when the Government was preparing the questions on the alteration of the Constitution for submission to the people, I asked the Prime Minister to include this question in the list: &#34;Do the people of Australia consider that the man who destroys good food, which is provided by God through nature for the sustenance of human beings, should he regarded as guilty of a crime; if so, what should the punishment for the crime be ? &#34; Unfortunately, the Prime Minister was not willing to include this question in his list. Had he done so, the people would have fixed a very heavy penalty. </para>

Lord Noel Buxton and Lord Polworth sent to the League of Nations after a long journey in Ethiopia on behalf of the Antislavery Society the following report: &#34;Slavery constitutes the basis of the entire economic system of Ethiopia. The rich possess a great number of slaves amounting sometimes to thousands, but slaves are owned by people of inferior social position &#34;. Lady Simon, wife of the British ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs, in a recent book stated, &#34; Slavery is so woven into the pattern of Abyssinian existence that one can only fear that the country will never be able to free itself from the chains of this disgraceful institution without the generous intervention of other nations moved by the intention of establishing a new State in Ethiopia &#34;. </para>

Professor T.O&#39;Conroy. in his book <inline font-style="italic">The Menace of Japan,</inline> wrote, &#34; The history of Manchuria is part of the history of China. Definite mention of this territory can be traced back to &#39;the twelfth century B.C., and its development is one of the most interesting sections in Chinese history . . . Until theend of the nineteenth century Manchuria witnessed peace and prosperity, and the population increased very considerably . . . Manchuria is approximately the size of France and Germany combined. Its area is 360,000 square miles. Its population amounts to a little more than 30,000,000; 29,000,000 out of this figure arc Chinese. Koreans total about 800,000; Japanese 220,000. By 1907 Chinese farmers were to be found almost everywhere in Manchuria. Its natural wealth is immense and is, as yet, hardly exploited. It has vast mineral areas where coal, iron and gold are to be found, and its agricultural possibilities are enormous. There are huge tracts of timber, especially in the northern districts &#34;. Yet with all the conquest, of this area, as large as France and Germany, and with less than onethird of the population, Japan is not satisfied. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ogata</inline> attempts to justify the invasion an attempted conquest of China and its population of 450,000,000.. </para>
          <para>Professor O&#39;Conroy writes of Manchuria: &#34; The greatest field in the matter of production is in agriculture. Arable land in Manchuria is placed at 54,900,000 acres. To-day, out of this total, 32,000,000 acres are undercultivation. The annual production of crops has shown a steady advance for the past twenty years. In 1929 it had reached the peak of 786,799,333 bushels valued at $200,000,000.  . . According to the estimate of experts, the coal deposits for the whole of Manchurian area are approximately 1.556,000,000 tons. In 1930 the output of all active mines was 10,040,652 tons.. The gold deposits in Manchuria are the richest in the whole of China, and their output is estimated at around 430,000 oz. There are 30 places where copper is found, and 58 lead and silver mines &#34;. With all this, Japan&#39;s rulers are not satisfied. Professor O&#39;Conroy further stated: &#34;To-day the military cliques, the modern descendants of the old Samurai, arc in the saddle, and the world must be made to realize the menace that accompanies this &#34;. General Araki, exMinister of War, Stated - the essence of his speech is taken from the Japan <inline font-style="italic">WeeklyChironicle,</inline> 16th March of this year (1933) - &#34;It is a big mistake &#34;, says General Araki, &#34; to consider the Manchurian problem from a merely materialistic point of view, and regard it simply as a question of interests of &#39; life line &#39;. The trouble has arisen from the corrupt materialistic ideas of the Chinese people, imported from the west, have defiled the racial spirit and national morality of the Japanese to the firing point. We Japanese are not afraid of blood . . . What is the present state of the East? India, with its population of 300,000,000, lives in dire misery under Britain&#39;s oppressive rule.  . . The countries of the Far East are the object of pressure on the part of the white races. But awakened Japan can no longer tolerate further tyranny and oppression at their hands ... If anybody impedes the march of this country he should be beaten down ruthlessly, and without giving any quarter, whatever the body may be &#34;. </para>

        <para>The Government is now setting out on the organization of an appeal to the whole of the people of Australia for the raising of the personnel of the militia forces to a strength of 70,000. That number has been decided upon as essential in order to add to the security of this country. I call upon all . honorable members to co-operate with the Government for the success of the campaign, each to do what he can within .his own district, and I also make a similar appeal to all political sections of the community outside because, in this case, there must bc no division of opinion, first as to the necessity for the adequate defence of Aus-tralia and, secondly, as to the method of achieving it. Honorable members of the Opposition and the organizations that support them Aave, from time to time expressed themselves in favour of the voluntary system of enlistment. This appeal is based on that system. It is an appeal to the manhood of Australia to provide the numbers necessary for the defence of this country against an aggressor and not for purpose of aggression. I hope that whatever views may be held by outside organizations as to the merits or otherwise of either the compulsory or the voluntary system for the defence of this country, they will recognize that only one system can be adopted at a time. The voluntary system is being attempted to-day. </para>

          <para>.- Once again 1 feel it encumbent upon me to raise a matter of major importance tq the success of the Government&#39;s hopes for the assistance of the trade union movement in the implementation of its defence policy. I do so to-day more particularly as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> has repeatedly stated that the trade union movement has turned down a proposal that it should have representatives on the Council of Defence. While I was asking a question regarding this matter to-day, the ex-Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> backed up by the present Minister for Defence (Mt. Street), conveyed the impression that the information I was conveying was untrue. For that reason I take this opportunity to place at the disposal of the House information which I have received in regard to military contracts, and I back it up with the assertion: that if the Prime </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Minister or some other responsible Minister of the Government does not see to it that military contracts are carried out under trade union conditions, it is beyond question that the Government cannot hope to secure the co-operation of the trade union movement on the Council of Defence or anything else. My complaint refers to a contract that was to be let for the supply of 13,000 felt hats for the military forces. Before the closing date for the submission of tenders I, and the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Sheehan),</inline> at the request of trade union officials of the hat manufacturing industry, and at the invitation of one of the biggest manufacturers of felt hats in Sydney, visited a factory to view the process of manufacture and to hear both sides of the question relative to the supply of hats under contract to the. Defence Department. We were told definitely by the managing director of the factory that, although he had in his own office the necessary application forms for the contract, it was absolutely useless for his concern or any other factory observing trade union conditions to tender for this work, because the firm which had previous been given the contract, and which would probably be given the new contract, did not observe trade union conditions. When I raised this matter on a previous occasion the Minister for Defence promised to have it investigated and if necessary to prevent the contract from being let until the full facts had been ascertained. No delay, however, occurred in arriving at a decision as to what firm should be given the contract. It was, of course, given to the firm which the union officials state does not observe trade union conditions, and against which employers in New South Wales assert they cannot compete because of that fact. Statements were made by the former Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> that air examination had been made of the premises occupied by this firm, and that he had provided for the policing of the contract. As a matter of fact one of the conditions precedent to the securing of the contract was that the firm in question undertook to observe trade union conditions. Union officials state that not only is this shop a non-union shop, but also it will not tolerate the presence of trade union officials on its premises. I do not think the Minister for Defence will deny the accuracy of that statement. He must be aware that it is impossible for anybody but an expert in hat making to know whether a hat in the process of manufacture is an ordinary civilian hat or a military hat until 60 per cent, of the manufacturing operations have been completed.  The department sent along an officer who knew nothing at all about the manufacture of hats to investigate the matter. It is obvious that he must have been as incompetent as I, or any other honorable member of this House, to determine whether the operations that took place during his visit were concerned with the manufacture of an ordinary civilian hat or a military hat. Yet when he returned to the department and reported that he had made an investigation the department accepted without question the statement &#39;that this particular military contract was being carried out under the conditions which the contractor agreed to observe when the contract was let! </para>

            <para>- I do not blame the present Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street),</inline> whom I regard as a reasonable man. When I approached the previous Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> I had little confidence that he would be concerned about the observance of trade union conditions, or that he would do anything in the matter. I have to-day had an assurance from the present Minister that he will interview the secretary of the union. I think he will find that what I have said in this House, what the union officials in New South Wales have informed us, and what a director of one of the leading manufacturers of hats in Sydney has stated, is true, namely, that the firm which has this contract is not observing trade union conditions, and that it is impossible for any other respectable employer who is doing so to compete with it. All that the department can place against that information is that it sent an inspector to the factory who is not competent to judge as to whether or not our statements are based on fact. The union even went so far as to place at the disposal of the department an expert who could recognize the difference between hats in the process of manufacture, yet all that the department did waa to continue to rely on the inspector. In these circumstances, how does the Government expect any self-respecting trade union to Go-operate  with it? It deliberately places the telescope to the blind eye when asked to investigate the  circumstances  that I have depicted. &#39;Condemnation has been voiced not only by the trade union, but also by the employers. I have received from the Minister a letter dated the 17th November, from which I shall read certain passages. One passage reads - </para>

        <para class="block">Both the Minister and the inspector ought to know that this firm is not observing award conditions. It will not allow on its premises a trade union official who knows something about the manufacture of these hats, as well as the conditions under which the men have to work. With Unscrupulous employers, an inspection of books does not furnish a good and sufficient reason to disbelieve the views expressed by the trade union. An employer who is so biased against union inspection of his works or interrogation of his men is capable of compelling the men to sign for wages that they do not receive. Neither an examination of the books nor an inspection of the works is of any value, if the inspector does not understand what he is inspecting. The Minister&#39;s letter continues - </para>

          <para>The first government contract was given in 1034, the next in 1037, and the latest followed the calling of tenders in August of this year. Thus the Lyons Government, which seeks &#34; co-operation &#34; from the trade unions of this country, is openly assisting the anti-union shop by giving it hig military contracts. Union officials tell the <inline font-style="italic">Voice</inline> that conditions in tlie  Hatcraft  factory are bad. Employment of child labour is a feature. There are only five skilled men in the factory, they say, but to fulfil the latest military contract under union conditions it would take at least fifteen skilled men. This is not considering any additional outside work. Most of the employees are boys between sixteen and eighteen years of age. Very few lads are kept on over eighteen years. Other union-condition employers are kicking because they find it impossible to compete with Hatcraft Proprietary Limited under these conditions. One former young employee of the factory has told the union that whenever an inspector visited the factory he was whisked away into another room and handed a broom. The foreman continued with the boy&#39;s job until the inspector had gone - the lad was doing a skilled man&#39;s job. If the firm were to observe award conditions, union officials say that  Hatcraft&#39;s could  not Complete their present military contract if they worked their present skilled men 24 hours a day. Hours in the industry are fixed at 44 a week. Hours at this factory are hard to calculate, but the union believes them to bc more than 48 a week. </para>

        <para class="block">Under these conditions, is it reasonable that the Government should expect any co-operation from the trade Union movement in carrying out its defence programme so far as the supply of materials is concerned, when it has the power to see, by the simple inclusion in the contract of a clause - as the ex-Minister for Defence could have done, when a deputation from the union represented the dangers of giving the contract to this firm-which would give to some authority in a position to know the difference  between a civilian hat and a military hat during the process of manufacture, the opportunity to overlook these works and to see, not only that the workers in the industry were getting a fair deal, but also that other manufacturers of hats were not being prejudiced in the matter of securing government contracts. I invite the Minister, before he questions the truth of anything placed before him, to remember that I have heard both sides of the matter. If there are three sides, &#91; have heard the three; I have heard the views of the union officials in Sydney, of the managing director of the biggest hat factory in Sydney, and of the union officials in Melbourne, where this particular factory <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> located; and from the evidence placed before me, I know the conditions under which these men must be working. The only evidence the Minister can produce to challenge the veracity of those who raise this matter is that of an inspector, who is not in a position to judge as to whether or not the statements that have been made are correct. If he doubts our word, lot him accept the challenge issued by the union when the last contract was given to this firm, namely, to supply the department with an expert who would be able to watch the process of manufacture of these hats,, and to see not only that these men who work in the factory get a fair deal, but also that other manufacturers of hats throughout Australia, who pay decent wages and work their men reasonable hours under award conditions, shall have a chance to obtain a contract. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MAHONEY</inline>(Denison) &#91;3.551.- I have repeatedly expressed in this House the view that every effort should be made to impress upon the Department of Works the advisability of pushing on with the works it has in hand. During the last six months, the answer that I have received from the Minister is that the department has not a sufficient number of quantity surveyors to take out the necessary particulars for the preparation of plans and specifications for the different works. That leads me to only one conclusion, namely, that the Works Department is understaffed. I have frequently asked the Minister to do everything that lay in his power to secure the appointment of quantity surveyors throughout the Commonwealth. From time to time I am informed that it is not right to say that there is a shortage of staff in the department; yet that is the reason advanced by the Minister for the delay in proceeding with the work! How can the Department of Works function efficiently if it is not properly staffed? I know that there are many quantity surveyors in Australia who are out of work, and who would be only too ready to accept a position in the department, taking out the quantities required for the different works, lt is the duty of the Government to push on with its public works. Throughout Australia to-day there is a slump in the building trade, and it is the duty of every government, Commonwealth and State, to arrest it, by pushing on as quickly as possible with works which will again place in employment those whose services are no longer needed in the building trade. If the Commonwealth does not take action, hundreds of tradesmen will become unemployed, and that will have very serious consequences. It is bad enough for unskilled men to be unemployed, but infinitely worse for skilled men to be in that category. If the building industry does not revive, the apprenticeship system will break down. </para>
        <para>I have been informed on good authority that the banking institutions throughout Australia have informed builders that they have no more funds to advance at the present time. This will bring about a scarcity of money, and a consequent depression in the building trade, lt was predicted twelve months ago that, in  1939,  there would be one of the greatest slumps in the building trade that has ever been experienced in Australia. That is why I appeal to the Government to push on with all the works it can in order to take up the men who are being displaced from the building trade all over the Commonwealth. Certain public works, which were authorized eighteen months ago, have not yet been commenced. I received definite promises that certain works, which had been authorized in my State, would he proceeded with without delay, but nothing Ins been done. When I go to see a Minister about.it, he tells me that he is not now handling the matter, that it has been taken over by some one else. The Government is always juggling its Ministers and departments, so that it is almost impossible to find out at any particular time who is responsible. If there is not sufficient staff in the department to ensure that the work is carried out, let more be engaged. If there are not enough quantity surveyors, there is no reason why more should not be appointed. It is reported that expenditure on building in Melbourne this year has declined by &#163;600,000. There is a slump in Sydney, and very soon skilled tradesmen will be walking the streets of every city in the Commonwealth looking for employment. Tho loan conversion operations are absorbing all the, available money, and the building trade is suffering. That is all the more reason why the Government should press on energetically with its own works programme. While works which were authorized over twelve months ago have not yet begun, there is no need for the Government to bring down fresh works schedules in an attempt to make the people believe that it is doing something. If there is not sufficient staff to get out plans and specifications for the calling of tenders, let the -work be done by day labour, so that an immediate start may be made. Otherwise, the Government must accept responsibility for the unemployment that is occurring. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HOLLOWAY</inline>(Melbourne Ports) &#91;4.6 J. - I desire to draw the attention of the Government to a matter that has all the potentialities of a grave industrial dispute. I refer to the holding up of the British ship <inline font-style="italic">Dalfram</inline> which was loading pig iron at Port Kembla. The ship was supposed to be going to a port that would not raise the suspicions of the men employed, but they were informed after the loading was started that the ship was really going somewhere else. I know that this is a delicate subject, and I should not have raised it except that I want to nip the dispute in the bud. There is a large volume of public opinion behind tlie men who are refusing to load pig iron for despatch to certain ports, though those who support this action may not, perhaps, be taking a very long view. I appeal to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline></para>
        <para class="block">Menzies), who has had so much experience in the handling of difficult problems of this kind, to take action before the situation drifts from bad to worse. It would be so easy to make it appear that the men in this instance are overwhelmingly in the right. The Government has straightened out the difficulty associated with the export of iron ore from Yampi Sound. Exports were prohibited because it was necessary that the ore should be retained in Australia for our own purposes. It was difficult to make some people understand that the international situation was not responsible for the embargo, and that action was taken only because a survey had disclosed the fact that our iron ore resources were limited. The present dispute is a different matter altogether. It is not concerned with ore from Yampi Sound, nor with the contract of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which has been in operation for some months, for the export of certain quantities of ore to Japan. In this case, pig iron is involved. This is a product that has gone through the first process of manufacture, so that those who import it are not concerned with the disposal of the offal, and time will be saved in putting it to its ultimate uses. Most of us know that there is a shortage of this particular material in Australia for the manufacture of iron and steel girders for building purposes. The men concerned in the dispute know that their colleagues in the building trade are being stood off temporarily because the master builders say that they cannot obtain supplies of girders, and those who fabricate the girders make the excuse that they cannot obtain supplies of pig iron. The mon have been told that, yet the waterside workers at Port Kembla are being asked to load pig iron to go to a place where they do not want it to go. They resent the fact that the export of this pig iron will be responsible, in some measure, for throwing their colleagues in the building trade out of employment. I know that this matter is a very delicate one for the Government to handle, because of the possibility of an industrial dispute occurring on a wide scale. Yesterday, 60 men refused to put a vessel under the gear for loading. Workers in foundries supplying pig iron are on pins and needles, and the whole district is in a state of ferment over contracts made by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited to export ore, and with the trouble over tin clippings. Only a spark is needed to start <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> general industrial conflagration involving the employees of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and extending to land, and sea transport workers. I suggest that the Prime Minister or the Attorney-General should get in touch with the men concerned and give an assurance that a continuance of the export of pig iron will not be permitted. We have been told that contracts amounting to about 300,000 tons are awaiting fulfilment. I understand that four or five shipments, each of about 7,000 tons, will be required to complete the first contract. The workers should be given a definite assurance that the export of pig iron will not continue when the contracts are completed. A continuance of the export of pig iron would not only throw a large number of Australian workers out of employment, but would also tie up many industries. This question is not an international one - at present it is a purely internal trouble - but unless immediate steps are taken to prevent the export of this raw material, it will lead to a largescale industrial upheaval in Australia. Workers will be thrown out of employment in the building trades and in the iron and steel industries which manufacture material for building work. The Government should act as .quickly as possible. I have been in touch with certain people and have advised them to localize the dispute until some conciliatary steps are taken, ff the Prime Minister or the AttorneyGeneral could make a satisfactory statement of the Government&#39;s intentions the trouble, I believe, would be settled without further delay. </para>

          <para>.-I should like to refer to the dismissal of certain employees of the Postal Department in Tasmania. Upon reaching the age of 18, 19, or 21 years, boys who in many cases have been in the service of the department for many years, have been dismissed following re-classification of their positions. I have had brought to my notice the case of a young man who after seven years&#39; service, was put off when he reached the age of 21 years.  His  conduct had been satisfactory. That is a very undesirable state of affairs and should be investigated immediately. An even more distressing case to which my attention has been drawn is that of a young man, an orphan, who had been employed in the Postal Department for three or four years as a junior assistant. I understand that some effort was made to retain his services, because of his unfortunate circumstances, and his general good conduct ; but his position was reclassified, and after his dismissal, the work done by him was taken over by a girl. 1 appreciate &#39; the difficulties in postal administration, but I suggest to the PostmasterGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> that a thorough investigation be made so that such dismissals may be prevented in the future. </para>

Yesterday, -a report appeared in the press that, because the scope of the inquiry was now much wider that had been originally anticipated, one member of the board of inquiry, whose original position had been more or less that of a judge, was required to give evidence. One of the barristers appearing before the inquiry is reported to have made representations for the reconstitution of the board. The AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said yesterday that those representations had not reached him. I do not know whether they have reached him yet, but, at any rate, they have reached the board itself. Nothing should be allowed to hamper the successful conclusion of this inquiry, which is the first that has ever been publicly held into an air disaster in Australia. The public must be satisfied with its findings in respect of, not only the <inline font-style="italic">Kyeema</inline> disaster, hut also the control and operation of civil aviation generally. I appeal to the AttorneyGeneral -and to the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> to pay heed to the representations that have been made in respect of the personnel of the board. It should be reconstituted so that the fullest possible light may be thrown on the administration of civil aviation in this country and so that the people can be inspired with confidence that the control of aviation will be placed in the future on a satisfactory basis. </para>

          <para>.- It has come to my notice that several employees of the Postal Department in South Australia have been offered the honour of appointment as Commissioners of the Peace, but, because the Department will give only a qualified permission for them to accept the honour, they are prevented from accepting it. I have one case especially in mind, and I shall supply the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> with all the particulars. For the present the Postal Department is prepared to allow its employees to accept Commissions of the Peace, but only if they are not called upon to perform court duties. That qualification is fatal to approval being given to appointments by the Attorney-General of the State. I feel that those in charge of the administration of justice in South Australia would not require officers to* undertake services in any way that would inconvenience the department. I myself have held for almost twenty years a Commission of the Peace in South Australia, but, undoubtedly because of the public office that I hold, T have never been called upon to undertake court work. </para>

If private employers are ready to allow their employees to hold a Commission of the Peace, Government departments should be equally ready to do so. The department&#39;s attitude is indefensible, and I ask the Postmaster-General to take up the subject with his Deputy Director in Adelaide. </para>

          <para>.- I wish to direct the attention of the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> to a matter of national importance, namely, the need for more money to be made available to municipalities and other bodies, such as aero clubs, in country districts for the establishment and maintenance of aerodromes. In particular I have in mind the city of Mildura. The aerodrome in that centre is used by at least three air lines for services to Canberra, Sydney, Adelaide, Broken Hill and Melbourne. It is not within the financial ability of small municipalities to provide suitable allweather aerodromes. Some time ago I gained the information from an answer to a question that only meagre amounts have been allotted to assist in the development of these aerodromes. Particularly in these times every possible encouragement should be given to the development of country aerodromes. The Commonwealth has granted about &#163;19,731 to assist these aerodromes, and of that sum, New South Wales has received &#163;12,225; Victoria, &#163;500; Queensland, &#163;1,107; South Australia, &#163;300; Western Australia, &#163;1,350; and Tasmania, &#163;4,139. The &#163;500 received by Victoria has been paid wholly in respect of the aerodrome at Bendigo. The Government might well consider the advantage of having aerodromes in country areas and of assisting to make them efficient. The authorities in control of them are actually doing pioneering work, and should receive substantial financial aid. Everything possible should be done to develop air -mindedness by encouraging the formation of aero clubs which give instruction in flying. The aerodrome at Mildura, about which I am particularly concerned, is frequently used by the planes of the Royal Australian Air Force. The surface of the aerodrome has been disturbed a great deal by the propellors of the machines, and in wet weather I can well imagine that the landing ground would be a quagmire. I trust that the Government will review the whole question, and in view of its close connexion with defence, provide more liberal assistance for this national need. </para>

Then, instead of competition, we should have cooperation. 1 have visited the Mildura aerodrome, and I consider that its condition reflects no credit upon any authority. I do not say that the control of commercial aerodromes should be solely under the Government. I was surprised at the answers supplied to tho questions asked by the honorable member  for  Wimmera, particularly when I noticed that only &#163;500 had been provided  for  country aerodromes in Victoria, that sum having been allocated to the aerodrome at Bendigo. This matter should  be  considered from the defence aspect, and, although I have not consulted tho honorable member for Wimmera, it seems to be that the work of surfacing country aerodromes should be given to persons who are now unemployed. In wet weather, the landing grounds&#39; would be dangerous to both pilots and passengers. </para>

          <para>. -  Reference was made by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> to a contract given by the Defence Department to Hatcraft Proprietary Limited for the supply of military hats. Correspondence has already taken place on this matter, both with my predecessor <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> and myself, particularly in regard to the fact that the successful tenderers for the contract are not respondents to the award covering the trade in which they operate. The terms and conditions of tenders in all defence contracts provide that tho contractor shall observe the wages and conditions provided under the appropriate award. As the honorable member for Dalley has said, the departmental inspecting officers have examined the books and operations of this company, and, having cross-examined employees, some of whom are financial members of the union, they have found nothing to suggest that the terms of the contract are not being observed. The secretary of the journeymen&#39;s division of the union in New South Wales recently said that the complaint was that the firm employed boys and youths and adult labourers to do tradesmen&#39;s work at rates below the award rates. Special instructions were given by my predecessor for departmental inspecting officers to investigate this aspect of the complaint, but no breach of .the award has been discovered. The secretary of the union, as the honorable member for Dalley remarked, sought permission for a member of the union to enter the factory in order to watch the processing of the hats; hut under the contract no Minister or officer of the department can authorize anybody other than Commonwealth or State -officers to carry out such an inspection. The first contract was let to this firm in 1934, and since that date, the union could have cited this firm as a respondent to the award. I cannot understand why the union has not yet taken such action. I have discussed the matter with the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> with whom I propose to see the secretary of the Victorian branch of the union. A draft clause has been drawn up by the honorable member, with the assistance of the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn),</inline> which it is suggested might be included in future defence contracts to obviate such a state of affairs as is alleged to exist. This clause is now being examined by the industrial officer;&#39; of the department. I seriously suggest that the union should be able to give an explanation as to why it has not mi.de any attempt to cite the company as a respondent. If it did so, it would be entitled under the award to make any inspection considered by it to be required. In this respect, the union is no different from any other union having members employed by firms engaged in the work of supplying defence equipment. I shall interview the secretary with the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, and I hope .that we shall arrive at a satisfactory conclusion in regard to the matter. </para>

          <para>. -  I wish to make a statement concerning the remarks of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> respecting the export of pig iron; first, however, I shall deal with two points raised in relation to the <inline font-style="italic">Kyeema</inline> Air Disaster Inquiry, which the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> has asked me to mention. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> said, this morning&#39;s adjournment of the hearing appeared to be somewhat mysterious, since no reason was given for it. Apparently the reason was not announced in consequence of an oversight. I have now made inquiries and have ascertained that the inquiry was adjourned in order to permit the tribunal to visit the Essendon aerodrome to make an inspection, and to examine certain types of aircraft mentioned during the inquiry. The adjournment was apparently normal, though the normal course was not adopted of announcing the reason for it. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard)</inline> referred to a member of the tribunal whose position had been challenged. Until this afternoon our information on this subject was derived only from newspaper reports, but I have now been- notified that the legal adviser appearing on behalf of one of the parties has made certain representations on the subject. These are under consideration. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for Melbourne Ports has referred to a &#34; hold up &#34; that has occurred in the loading of certain supplies of pig iron at Port Kembla. The Government realizes that it is most desirable that problems of this kind shall not be allowed to spread, but shall be settled as promptly as possible. As Minister for Industry I have a very special interest in this matter. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports is well aware that for some time I have been engaged in a series of discussions with representatives of the waterside workers, and others, in relation to the whole problem of waterside employment, in respect of which certain anomalies exist which I am genuinely anxious to remove. I should regard it as a calamity for the waterside workers, and also for the Government and people of Australia, if any action were persisted in by the waterside workers of Port Kembla which would increase the complexity of the problems we are already confronting. The honorable member will fully appreciate that point. </para>
        <para>In order to avoid . any action which might add to the complexity of these problems I was requested by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> to take certain steps in relation to this matter. Yesterday I communicated with the &#34;Waterside Workers Federation in Sydney, and this morning I communicated with the federal council cil of the federation which is at present meeting in Melbourne. My experience of the federal council in these matters is that it is thoroughly prepared to be helpful and to take any action possible to preserve the peace. I have invited the council to co-operate with me in this matter, and I have no doubt that it will do so. </para>
        <para>As the real trouble in the minds of the waterside workers at Port Kembla appears to he due to a misapprehension, a public statement on the subject at this juncture may be helpful. I was informed by the representatives of the council in Melbourne that the waterside workers at Port Kembla consider that the shipments of pig iron now being made are merely the first of a series which will aggregate something like 300,000 tons. The information before the Government is that the total shipments will aggregate only between 20,000 and 30,000 tons. If this is so, the quantity of pig iron involved is almost microscopic compared with the quantity involved at the time the Government prohibited the export of iron ore from Australia. If it should turn out that the business is likely to assume proportions totalling anything like 300,000 tons, I assure the honorable member that the new position will he faced promptly by the Government, and action will be taken in connexion with it. As the Prime Minister has already pointed out the amount of business involved at present is of relatively small proportions. For this reason, the Government is not prepared to impose an embargo upon it. If, however, it threatened to assume large proportions, the Government would reconsider tho whole situation. Our information is definitely to the effect that only between 20,000 tons and 30,000 tons of pig iron is involved. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for Melbourne Ports suggested that there was a shortage of this commodity in Australia. Inquiry has been made into this aspect of the subject. The facts are, as the honorable member knows, that two kinds of pig iron are marketed. There is basic pig iron, which is used for the manufacture of steel ; and foundry pig iron. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited is practically the only user in Australia of basic pig iron. Foundry pig iron has many purchasers throughout the country. There is no shortage of fpundry pig iron. In fact, accumulated stocks of unsold foundry pig iron are on hand, and the difficulty is orders and not supplies. If the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited were selling to foreigners basic pig iron which in fact it required for its own purposes, a very remarkable situation would have to be faced. </para>

            <para>- I realize that fact, and it brings me to the last point I wish to make. I reiterate the statement already made by the Prime Minister that, while problems and differences of opinion undoubtedly exist in relation to the supply of raw materials to foreign countries, in certain circumstances, such problems must be faced by the Government and the Parliament of the Commonwealth. They cannot be determined by independent industrial action by any union or group of men. This is the place for discussion and decision in regard to the question of the supply of raw materials to foreign countries. With the assistance of the good offices of organized industrialists, I hope that we shall succeed in establishing that these problems must be determined by the Parliament. </para>

            <para>The personnel of the Standing Committee on Liquid Fuels has, apart from Government officers, been confined to those principally concerned as producers of liquid fuels. The object of this limitation is to facilitate investigations. An unwieldy committee from the point of view of numerical strength would not be able to deal expeditiously with the problems. Organizations and persons interested in the subjects with which the committee will be dealing will, however, be accorded full facilities for placing their views before it from time to time, and one of the courses which will be taken to achieve this will be to co-opt persons with special knowledge on to the subcommittees which have been appointed by the main committee to deal with such questions as power alcohol, &#39;benzol, oil from coal, oil from shale, Sc. As an example of this, the Australian Sugar Producers&#39; Association and The Queensland Canegrowers&#39; Council will be asked jointly to nominate one representative to assist the sub-committee on power alcohol. </para>
