            <para>- The whole of the buildings and structures at Rose Bay arc considered to be of a temporary nature. The galvanized iron buildings referred to by the honorable member are merely temporary ones to meet the requirements of the authorities for the storage of the materials being used in the construction of the slipway, the wharves and the other buildings, and particularly, for the housing of cement, a large quantity of which is being used in the construction of certain roadways and approaches. The materials used in erecting these buildings are the most suitable for temporary structures of this description. The whole proposal was submitted to the local council, and was discussed by me, personally, with the Mayor and the TownClerk in my office in Sydney. The plans and specifications were referred to the council to give it an indication of the nature of the Government&#39;s proposals at Rose Bay. </para>

          <para>, - I know that the Government, in proposing this amendment, is yielding to requests made on behalf of women&#39;s organizations, but unfortunately the granting of this request has created an anomaly to which attention: should be drawn. Thus, women who exercise the option to pay the additional 6d. will be placed in a position of equality with adult males in regard to contributions, but not  in  regard to benefits, until they attain the age at which they are eligible to draw the old-age pension. They will not be entitled to the same benefits in regard to sickness, disablement, &#38;c. </para>

Juveniles will now be entitled to receive sickness benefit until they reach the age of sixteen, at which age they will be qualified to obtain disablement benefit at the rate for juveniles. </para>

          <para>. -  In my second-reading speech I dealt at somelength with the many aspects of, and alternatives to, the benefits contained in this bill. I set out in general to describe the alternatives with which the Government was faced and informed honorable members that the Government believed that it had chosen the most worthwhile alternatives to make the money available from contributions and from the Government subsidy go as far as possible in the directions where it would do the most good. It is true, as was pointed out by the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Martens),</inline> that the British act contains a provision something similar to that contained in his amendment, but our bill and the British act are by no means the same. In some directions, relative to contributions, the British act is more liberal than it is proposed that this bill should be, but, in other directions, our bill is more liberal than the British act. Over the whole range, as I have already shown by figures, our bill is the more liberal of the two schemes. The principle behind the amendment moved by the honorable member was definitely considered by the Government, but it was thought best to frame our benefits in the way they have been framed in this bill. The amendment would seek to give to the wife of a man in receipt of a pension under this bill, or to the widow of such a man who had been in receipt of a pension under this bill, a pension under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act without a means test. In other words, a special concession is sought to be given to widows who are in receipt of a pension under this bill or wives of men who are in receipt of the old-age pension under this bill. That would in many cases lead to duplication of pension. Some widows would receive a double pension. </para>

          <para>.- I hope that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> will reconsider his decision not to accept the amendment moved by the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Martens),</inline> who is to be commended for bringing it down. If accepted, the amendment would enable the wives and widows of persons entitled  to pensions under this scheme to receive, when they were able to comply with all conditions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act other than the means test, a pension as a right. That is not an innovation in schemes of this kind. Provision of a nature similar to that sought in the amendment is contained in section 11 of the British act. I can understand that it would cost the national insurance scheme more money, but one of the chief objections to this measure from this side of the committee is that it does not go far enough in giving concessions to insured persons and their dependants and that, particularly, it discriminates in various ways against women. The Australian scheme in this respect should be at least as generous as the British scheme. Furthermore, we believe that in this scheme there should be no residential or n ation ality disqualification. </para>

The proposed new clause, which is in keeping with the special provision in the Invalid and Oldage Pensions Act, makes a further concession to blind people by excluding national insurance benefits in the calculation of income under the Invalidand Oldage Pensions Act. There are about 2,500 blind pensioners in Australia, and about 500 of these, being in work, are likely to come under the provisions of the national insurance scheme. The concession will, of course, involve additional cost, but it is a cost which the Government is willing, and indeed glad, to bear in order to alleviate still further the disabilities of blind people. </para>

I believe I am indebted to the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jolly)</inline> for the proposal, and the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> also discussed the question. The proposed new clause is designed to secure that an insured person shall not suffer loss of benefits by his employer&#39;s failure to pay contributions due under the act. It is supplementary to clauses 173 and 175, which provide for the prosecution of defaulting employers, and clause 177, which allows an insured person, backed if necessary by an approved society, to prosecute his employer if loss of health benefits follows the employer&#39;s failure to pay his part of the contributions. Clause 178 gives priority of claim to an insured person, in the event of the bankruptcy of the employer, for contributions that the employer has omitted to pay. The employee has to satisfy the commission that the deductions have been made from his wages, and in that event he will be protected by a certificate of the commission from loss of benefits. </para>

(2.) If the commission refuses to certify under this section the commission shall state its reasons and the society shall be at liberty to renew its application for exemption. (3.) If the commission is satisfied that, by reason of a change of the rules of the society or of the terms of employment of its members, the grounds upon which the certificate was given no longer exist, it shall cancel the certificate and this act shall thereupon apply to persons employed by the public authority notwithstanding that they are members of the society.

        <para class="block">This proposal deals with a situation for which the bill makes no provision. The second part of the first schedule enables the commission to exempt, in whole or in part, public employees if the commission is satisfied that the terms of the employment correspond to those provided for in the bill. The cases I want to bring under notice arethose in which the benefits are partly subscribed for by the employee and partly by the employer. The employees form a benefit society. The employer does not require them to belong to that society, but as a matter of fact all the employees do belong to it. The employer, acting under powers conferred by act of Parliament, makes provision for  a superannuation fund. Specifically, the case is that of the Mutual Benefit society of the employees of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board. It would be impossible for that society to be recognized as an approved society, because the employees are in Melbourne and not in the whole State. </para>

            <para>- That is a point we may consider later. An employee pays into the benefit society 9d. a week, and the board pays another 9d. There is also a benefit fund to which each member pays ls. a quarter, and the board another is. a quarter. Every member who is sick receives fi a week from the society and a similar amount from the board, making :i total of &#163;2 a week. Members receive health service not only for themselves as members of the society, but also for their wives and children if they are married, and for their widowed mothers if they are unmarried. Nasal, eye, and dental treatment is also provided. Acting under the powers conferred upon it by act of Parliament, the board has created a superannuation fund, out of which it makes liberal payments to employees. An employee who is retired at .60 years of age after ten years&#39; service is entitled to the equivalent of two years&#39; salary. If his service has been shorter he is entitled to proportionately less. There are probably a great number of similar societies in Australia, and their position ought to be considered loy the commission. I am making my present proposal because I am assured that, if the bill becomes law without provision being made for the benefit society I have referred to, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board will discontinue its contributions to the society. In that event the employees will he much worse off than they are at present. The organization they have built up provides them with, better benefits than those provided for in the bill. There is a danger that the society will collapse and that the hoard will content itself merely with making contributions under the act. The hoard is not bound as a matter of law to continue its contributions to the benefit society, or to continue its superannuation fund. I am assured by members of the board that it will not be able to continue its contributions either to the society or to the superannuation scheme if it is brought within the scope of the hill. I am proposing that if the society applies for an exemption the commission may examine the position and, if it certifies that the benefits provided by the society, plus the&#39; employer, are on the whole not less f  favorable  to the employee than the benefits&#39; provided for in the bill, the commission may exempt members of the society from participation in the national scheme. Further, the commission will be able to refuse to certify and may state its grounds for refusal, and the society may apply again later. If the board makes an alteration in the direction of giving additional protection I suggest that the society, in the altered circumstances, ought to be empowered to apply again. Also, I suggest that the commission should have power to withdraw a certificate if it finds that the conditions have been so changed as to be unfavorable to the employees. The commission will have power to investigate. I submit to the committee and to the Government that it does not appear from the bill that the commission can take this action. It could exempt them if it thought that the terms of their employment gave to them benefits equivalent to those given under this scheme, but it is not&#34; a matter of terms of employment because the men are not required to join the society, although, as a matter of fact, they do join the society. The board does not say to the employees &#34; You must join the mutual benefit society &#34; ; it has declined to give that direction. But if they do join, it assists them by contributing an amount equivalent to the contribution. In addition, it makes a superannuation allowance in respect of its employees, whether they are members of the society or not. I suggest that this measure does not contemplate such a position; yet it is a position which exists not merely in the tramway service hut also, to my knowledge, although I am not acquainted with the details, in the railways service and other public bodies. There is a railways  benefit  society. I think that the commission ought to have the power of exemption, so that it could say whether or not it thought that members o&#163; the society ought to be exempt. In addition, it should have the power to revoke any certificate of exemption it had given, if it were satisfied that the benefits were no longer as good as those here prescribed. All that I propose is that the commission shall have the power to investigate and if satisfied with the result of its investigation to act upon it. There is no doubt that this scheme will be very unpopular in many quarters if it deprives those concerned of any better benefits. In my opinion, the benefits given by the society, to which I have specifically referred, are in considerable degree better than those proposed under this scheme, and the scheme of the society will collapse if the measure is passed in its present form. </para>

          <para>. - The amendment of the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> revives a very considerable discussion which took place on clause 24, in the matter of what bodies or groups of employees should or might be exempt from the operation of the act. As honorable members know, the proposal in this bill, which has been accepted by the passage of clause 24, is to the effect that the commission shall have the right, upon application, to exempt from the operation of the act, in whole or in part, bodies of employees whose benefits are guaranteed by a government and which are, either wholly or partially, the equivalent of the benefits to he given under this act. That is the general principle. The Government, for what it believes to be good reasons, has set its face against the exemption of other than those types. T.his proposal again raises the whole question as to whether or not the power of exemption should be extended beyond those employments in which the benefits ure guaranteed by a government. &#34;We believe that the minimum number of persons in Australia should be exempt from the act; that in its operation the act should be as broad as possible. We are seeking to invest persons who come within the scope of the act - that is, all persons doing manual labour and all other persons up to a certain income limit - with the obligation to contribute and the right to receive benefits. They carry those personal rights with them even though they may move from employment to employment or from one place to another in Australia. We believe that that is the right thing to do. Were we to accept this particular amendment, it would be but a very short step indeed to the exemption of a very large number of persons in all sorts of provident schemes in private employment throughout the Commonwealth. As I have said earlier, some of these schemes are very good, some are indifferent, and some are quite bad. By giving exemption to such persons we should, in effect, guarantee the schemes as far as the employee was concerned. The honorable gentleman himself takes account of the fact that schemes such as the one he particularly has in mind may deteriorate, in which -event the commission would be called upon, by reason of the changed circumstances, to revoke the exemption it had given. In that case the employees concerned would be obliged to come into this scheme, and laboriously establish through the respective waiting periods the right to the respective benefits prescribed. Therefore, we believe that the best course is to maintain the present position of having a very limited exemption in respect of government employees, where governments make application and the terms of employment provide roughly the equivalent of the benefits of this scheme. Were we not to exempt those classes we should be gilding the lily, by duplicating the benefits. This scheme makes provision for certain benefits. If the same benefits, or roughly their equivalent, are already provided for by other governments, we see no call to duplicate them. For these reasons, while quite respecting the honorable gentleman&#39;s viewpoint, the Government regrets that it cannot accept the amendment. </para>

            <para>- The reason for my insertion of the provision in connexion with the certificate is that there is power to withdraw; the certificate even where the law provides for the benefits. The Treasurer claims that the committee has already discussed this matter. It has not done so, except incidentally. The provision to which he has referred has yet to be reached in the second part of the first schedule. When it is reached, honorable members will see that it is very similar to this proposal, the only difference being that under the Government&#39;s proposal all the benefits enjoyed by the employeesof a public authority must be a part of the terms of their employment. My proposal is that they shall be partly in connexion with the terms of their employment and partly as the result of their own provision. If the Treasurer is not prepared to accept my amendment, I should like him to consider the definition of &#34; approved societies &#34;, to see whether it cannot be extended to cover the employees of one public authority which has a benefit society: . On the present definition, it appears to me that this benefit society could not be held to be an approved society, because its employees are confined to Melbourne and suburbs, and an approved society must operate over the whole of Australia, or at least over the whole of a State. </para>

          <para>. -  I can satisfy the honorable member on the last point. An approved society may be registered in respect of the different areas to which he has referred, but it need not necessarily cover the whole of the minimum area. A society might be approved in respect of a State, but there would be no obligation on it to spread its tentacles all over the State; so long as its membership was sufficient, and it complied with the rules, it could be confined to an area of a few square miles. </para>

            <para>- That would be the case even if they did not ;but it would be easier if they did. To the extent that this national insurance scheme treads on the toes, as it were, of these other schemes, we believe it is possible to adjust the latter in respect of both contributions and benefits. It may be, as the honorable gentleman suggests, that some of these schemes may offer greater benefits in certain directions, but I find it difficult to believe that for the limited contribution of 9d. any scheme could provide on the whole benefits equal to those provided under this scheme, or would be nearly so broad or generous as this scheme. </para>

          <para>. - I urge the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> to give further consideration to the case of the society mentioned by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn).</inline> I feel sure that the Government, in implementing this scheme, has no desire to harm any existing organization. I point out that whenever an application as between the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board and its employees comes under review, the industrial tribunal takes into consideration the benefits enjoyed by the employees as members of this mutual benefit society when calculating the value of their services. Recognizing that many difficulties would be met with in the initial stage of this scheme, the Government, I arn sure, intends to implement it with as little disorganization as possibleof existing benefit societies. That being so, it should consider exempting, temporarily at least, such bodies as are so sound and permanent as the mutual benefit society of the employees of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board. The board is a semigovernmental body ; its employees enjoy retiring allowances and are awarded certain marks and badges in respect of their services. They are not temporary or casual employees. The average contribution to their benefit fund is approximately 10d. If the Government cannot exempt this society altogether for a while, it should at least ensure that these employees are not done any injury in respect of any benefit they now enjoy, at tbe same time giving them the opportunity to insure immediately under this scheme for such long-term benefits as the pension benefit. A sick pay of &#163;2 a week is very generous indeed, and nothing like it can be given under this scheme. One reason why this society can provide such a. generous benefit and at the same time be run so cheaply, is that doctors employed by the board are always on the spot to attend to injuries caused by accident, and their services generally are available to the society. The scheme is a two-party scheme, and the immediate benefits provided are much greater than its members could hope to receive under this national insurance scheme. I admit that no national scheme of insurance could pro-  vide benefits to the poorer sections of the community and hope to succeed unless it embraced all of the best risks. That is a fundamental feature of such a scheme, and no government could afford to exempt all of the best risks simply because they happen to he catered for in a better way under some individual scheme. I again suggest that in the initial stages of this scheme, the Government should recognize this society in respect of the benefits it now provides in sick pay and unemployment allowance, and at the same time give its members the opportunity to insure immediately for those benefits which are provided under the national scheme but not under their own scheme. Let these particular employees continue their society until such time as it is decided that they should como completely under the national scheme, otherwise considerable injury will bc done to a large number of people. I repeat that whenever industrial applications as between the board and its employees come under review, the advantages received by the employees as members of this society are used as an argument against the granting of improved working conditions, and if their society is forced OUt of existence they will have no chance of receiving increases of pay in order to compensate for benefits lost. </para>

          <para>. - The Government believes that it would do a real injury to a large number of employees if it left them out of this scheme. Between the passage of this measure and its actual coming into effect, a period of at least six months will elapse, and if, within that, period, such schemes as that of the mutual benefit society of the employees of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board cannot be adjusted to this national scheme, then, to use an unparliamentary expression, &#34; I will eat my hat.&#34; No difficulty will be involved in adjusting a company scheme or any other scheme to this scheme. A number of these schemes, as the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> is aware, are the subject of legal contract between the employer and his employees. In the case of the Metropolitan Gas Company, which he mentioned, the company claimed certain deductions from income tax, but under the Income Tax Assessment Act and its regulations no company is entitled to deductions in respect of contributions to an employees&#39; provident scheme unless such a scheme is watertight and irrevocable. In order to &#34;comply with the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act, a very large number of these schemes have been placed on a proper basis as between employer and employee. In the case&#39; of these funds, I have approached the State governments to pass legislation to facilitate the adjustment of these schemes to the Commonwealth&#39;s scheme, because it is not within the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to make any such provision in this bill as is provided inthe British act. We believe that it will ultimately be to the advantage of all these persons to be brought within a Commonwealth scheme, because no private scheme can be so satisfactory to the workers as a national scheme. I do not know of any private provident scheme in respect of which the contribution is on other than a 50-50 basis. We have that principle embodied in this bill, but in. addition we have very considerable and increasing governmental subventions to this scheme. There can be no doubt, therefore, that with very few exceptions this national scheme must operate much more in the interests of employees than any existing private scheme, notwithstanding the fact that in one or two directions non-governmental schemes may provide greater benefits. Broadly considered, they cannot possibly be as beneficial as a national scheme. </para>

          <para>.- In reply to the honorable members for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn),</inline> and Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> said that in the interregnum between the passage of this measure and its coming into effect,  an  opportunity would be given to adjust schemes of the kind mentioned to this national scheme. I wish to draw attention to the Victorian Railways employees mutual benefitsociety&#39;s scheme. This  is  backed by a government department, but whether or not it has sufficient members to qualify as an approved society under this measure,  I  do not know. In one respect it has an advantage over the scheme of the mutual benefit society of the employees  of  the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board in that its members are scattered throughout the State. Furthermore, various societies are run by employees themselves. These provide  for  payment to members only in respect of time off for sickness or injury. They are operated cheaply because they do not provide medical treatment for members, which is paid partly by lodges of which the particular employees are members. These societies do not pay for such services in the same way as benefit societies, and, therefore, they do not compete with the latter societies in that respect. Since the introduction of this measure, I have been informed that these particular employees&#39; organizations, such as the rolling-stock branch of the Victorian Railways Department at North Melbourne and similar bodies at. Jolimont and Newport, have large memberships. I take it that they will be able to amalgamate inorder to qualify from the point of view of strength of membership as an approved society under this measure. </para>

            <para>- Yes, but the benefit schemes I am  now  referring to are not backed by the Government. However, they have been in existence for over 20 years. Will it be possible for them to amalgamate in order to comply with the membership qualification of an approved society under this scheme, or must they go out of existence altogether? These men are very concerned on this point. There are well-conducted railway benefit societies; but I do not suggest that they can be regarded as competitors with established friendly societies because they do not cover the same field. They do provide benefits for railway men in regular employment which the employees desire to retain. The Treasurer contends that in many instances it would be better for such employees to come under the national insurance scheme, and that it may be possible before the act becomes operative for some of these societies to amalgamate and to some extent retain their identity. The tramways benefit society, to which the honorable member for Bourke referred, is a very worthy organization. Many tramway employees who live in my electorate are known to me personally, and I know that they are anxious that their present organization shall not be disturbed. In view of all the circumstances I trust that the railways&#39;  benefit  society, which has been in. existence for 50 years, and the tramway benefit society should be allowed to retain their identity. </para>

          <para>. - An application for exemption of the society mentioned by the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)</inline> would have to be made by the State government, as it is a society operating within a State government service. Speaking offhand, I should say that so long as the conditions of employment of the men whom the honorable member mentioned do not guarantee them benefits wholly or partially equivalent to those provided in the bill, the State government would be guided as to whether or not they applied for whole or partial exemption, or in fact for any exemption at all. Assuming that the State government did not apply for exemption in respect of the employees referred to by the honorable member, there would be no disability placed upon them in that they could amalgamate their various societies into one approved society. I have received letters from members of such societies, some of which are very illuminating, particularly as to the amounts they have to contribute on a rate-for-age basis in order to qualify for certain benefits. One correspondent said that he was paying 8s. 6d. a week in order to qualify for a pension of 20s. a week. </para>

        <para class="block">The object of the proposed new clause is to provide that the employers&#39; contributions in respect of persons employed by a public hospital or other charitable institution shall be paid by the Commonwealth and not by the institution. In New South Wales, and also in other States, hospitals are maintained by contributions usually of 6d. or ls. a week. Various hospital schemes are in force, hut when the Government&#39;s proposals become operative most of these schemes will have to be abandoned. Employees will not continue to contribute to hospitals because some of the medical benefits for which they are at present contributing will be provided under this scheme. The hospitals will be substantial losers as they will not receive a subsidy under this scheme for the services rendered. This scheme will involve many hospitals in substantial losses by reason of the fact that they will also have to pay the employers&#39; contributions in respect of their employees. This will make it even more difficult for many hospitals to carry on the good work they are now performing. </para>

            <para>- Provision should be made in this bill. In the Family Endowment Act of New South Wales, passed in 1927, it was provided that in the case of public hospitals and. public benevolent or charitable institutions- employers&#39; contributions should be exempted. There is no reason why a similar provision should not be inserted in this bill. If these institutions are not assisted in the direction suggested, it will- make it very difficult for local committees to raise sufficient funds for the maintenance of hospitals. No obstacles should be placed in the way of hospitals and ^benevolent or charitable institutions, which, under this bill, will be responsible- for the payment of employers&#39; contributions. I have received a number of letters from various hospital authorities in my electorate complaining of the imposition of an employer&#39;s contribution, and asking for exemption. Many hospitals which are now finding finance a difficult problem do not know to what extent they will be affected. They feel sure that they will lose a considerable amount particularly in respect of voluntary contributions of 6d. or ls. a week. They will not receive any subsidy under this scheme, and will have difficulty in meeting their liability as employers. The Broken Hill hospitalis financed largely by contributions from the miners and by the mine owners; it is a form of compulsory contribution. The employees receive medical benefits through that hospital, but when this scheme is brought into operation the employees will be compelled to further contribute for medical benefits which they now receive through the hospital. Hospitals will be involved in a considerable increase of expenditure and a large proportion of their contributions will be discontinued. The position is quite clear and I think that this is an appropriate occasion to provide that in the case of public hospitals and other charitable institutions the employer&#39;s contribution be paid by the Commonwealth. I trust that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> will accept the proposed new clause. </para>

            <para>- The proposed new clause is not clear. We must admit that some hospitals will find it more difficult to raise the necessary funds to enable them to carry on. If the financial responsibility wore placed upon the Commonwealth it would create a precedent and requests for similar exemptions would be made by other authorities. Australia should fall into line with Queensland, where deficiencies in hospital finance are met by the State government paying 60 per cent, and the municipal authorities 40 per cent. I am opposed to the proposed new clause, because I feel that it would create a bad precedent and would result in other bodies and institutions seeking similarconsideration. </para>

          <para>. - The first schedule is divided into two parts. Part I. contains a list of employments which, subject to the exclusion of classes or groups specified in Part II., are insurable employments. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of Part I. covers the main groupsfor which provision is to be made, that is, those employed within the Commonwealth under contract of service or apprenticeship. Paragraph b deals with the first special group to be insured, that is, those employed on board ship. Persons in this group are essentially part of Australia&#39;s industrial activity although they are, necessarily, for a great part of their time technically outside the Commonwealth. Paragraph c contains the second special group, namely, out-workers, as defined in the schedule. These people are actually employed under contract of service, and the commission is empowered, at its discretion, to include them. The intention of the Government, and, of course, of the commission which is to administer this legislation, is to endeavour to include as many classes of persons as possible under the national insurance scheme. Naturally, with the very great diversity of employments throughout Australia it is impossible to cover specifically all contingencies that may arise in the administration of the provisions of this bill. Consequently it is necessary to give certain discretionary power to the commission to deal with border-line cases. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> covers the third special group to be insured, namely, employees such as shearers, canecutters, share-farmers, and others engaged in manual labour and working under substantially the  3ame  conditions as persons under contract of service, but not covered by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline></para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The fourth special group to be insured is stated in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> and covers, where practicable and with reservations, certain classes of workers employed by or under &#34; any authority under the Commonwealth or a- State, constituted by or under any act or State act&#34; whose circumstances correspond, broadly, to those of insured people generally, but who are not technically under contract of service. The fifth group specified in paragraph / includes employees whose work entails plying for hire in taxis or other vehicles belonging to other persons. These people are technically not under contract of service. Taxi-drivers are typical of this class. </para>

          <para>.-I hope that in excluding certain categories or types of employment from the operations of this bill the commission will be careful to see that it does not give an advantage to one branch of an industry which may be in competition with another branch or with other industries producing much the same commodity. If outworkers, as specified in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> are to he excluded, I fear that some employers will be encouraged to use them extensively in production to the detriment of factory workers who will be forced to contribute under this scheme. The commision should bear in mind the fact that to the extent that it exempts an industry from the application of this act, it will reduce the tax on employees in that industry by approximately ls. 6d. a week for each male employee, and, in respect of female operatives, by a lesser amount. This is a real danger. Exemption from the provisions of this legislation should be granted only as the result of the most careful inquiries to ascertain whether or not the interests of employers of insured persons will be prejudiced. An administrative difficulty should not be sufficient justification for exclusion, and exemptions in themselves should not be allowed to become an element of competitive unfairness in industry. I confess that, with regard to out-workers, considerable administrative problems are likely to occur, but, from the stand-point of national policy, exemptions should not be made except for the strongest reasons. Obviously, resort will be had to out-work if it can be done more profitably than factory work. I regret that  Ave  were precluded last night from discussing clause  1S8,  which deals with regulations. Under this schedule, the commission may, by special orders, specify conditions under which workers may be included or excluded from the scope of the bill. To the extent, therefore, that there is an absence of parliamentary authority, the commission will become a quasi-legislative body. I suggest that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> should if possible, even at this stage, give us some indication of what form he thinks the regulations will take. If he cannot do so, an early opportunity should be provided for Parliament to consider the regulations,  foi-,  in this matter, they will be of almost as much importance as the will of Parliament expressed in the bill itself. </para>

          <para>.- I also hope that some indication of the nature of these regulations will be given, because it is in these regulations that the power of the commission to exempt outworkers will be specified. The astounding amount of sweating connected with outwork in Melbourne was exposed some years ago in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> More recently a similar state of affairs was shown to exist in Sydney. Employers of the worst type let out work to women who have power machines in their homes. By this means awards of the court are avoided. It seems to me that these employers may obtain exemption from the provisions of this bill, and that the exploiting of labour by means of out-work will thus be continued. I strongly suggest that the Treasurer should endeavour to ensure that no such exemptions shall be made. I do not wish permaturely to criticize the commission&#39;s administration, but it is obvious that the policing of the scheme will be very difficult. In the capital cities the out-work system is one of the worst features of industrial competition. Large departmental stores are having products made in sweating hells under the most revolting conditions, and I hope that some action will be taken to ensure an effective check on such activities. No exemptions should be granted by the commission until the most exhaustive inquiries have been made. I move - </para>

        <para class="block">I feel that this paragraph to the schedule presents a very serious danger. Despite the policing activities of trade unions and industrial and arbitration inspectors, employers are &#34; getting away &#34; wholesale with sweating, and only in isolated cases are convictions secured. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> that if this paragraph is allowed to go through as it stands, the system of out-work will be given a great impetus, and one of the most objectionable features of our industrial system will be perpetuated. By the deletion of the proposed words the commission will not have power to exclude any of these people. That is the sole purpose of my amendment. I am not concerned with its effect on one or two people here and there; while it may impose a little hardship on a few individuals, it will prevent wholesale hardship from being inflicted on a great number of persons associated with the industrial system in the cities. If the schedule be passed in its present form, many sweating employers will be given open encouragement to carry on activities which constitute such an undesirable feature of the factory system in Australia. </para>

          <para>. -  Speaking only a few clays ago the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> made a prophecy. He suggested that whereas at that stage, apparently, many people in Australia, including their representatives in this chamber, were contributionconscious, they -would shortly become benefitconscious. Few of us then, thought that that prophecy would be completely fulfilled within the short space of a few hours; the proposals now being made, however, suggest that that prophecy has already been completely fulfilled.&#39; I am glad to know that there is a desire to bring more people into the scheme, so that they may participate in its benefits. </para>

          <para>. -  The object of the amendment is to try to prevent some 8,000 or 10,000 people, mostly women, employed in the great clothing industry of this country, from being excluded from the scheme because of the nature of their employment. For the last four or five years Judge Drake-Broekman, of the Arbitration Court, the officers of the Clothing Trades Federation - which by the way is anxious to become an approved society - and the best employers in the clothing industry have pooled their efforts to stamp out the sweating evil. Their sole aim is to place all manufacturers on a fair footing of competition. It is not the best, but the worst, employer who makes the pace, with the result that, very often, the best employer is put out of business. The best employers have pooled their interests and have appealed to the court; Judge Drake-Brockman has promised his assistance in dealing with this problem. Evidence given before the court discloses that most of the 8,000 or 10,000 persons employed in &#34;the clothing industry are classified as out-workers. The difficulty in dealing with employers of labour of this sort is that they sell the material to out-workers to be made up into garments. They will continue to do so, and will use every device not only to beat the court, but also to be able to avoid responsibility for contributions to the National Insurance Fund in respect of outworkers in their employ. I am anxious to help the commission to safeguard the interests of the best employers and the. employees. The employer in this industry who will not stand up to the resolutions of his chamber of manufactures, and who seeks to undermine the decent employer by this means, will do anything to defeat the commission or the court, or anybody else, if it is to his advantage. </para>

I suggest to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> that his officers should co-opt the services of representatives of the employees and the best employers to assist them in safeguarding the interests of employees of this description and to classify them as insurable persons, thus making all employers of out-workers liable for contributions to the fund in respect of those employees. </para>

            <para>- I am endeavouring to point out that safeguards can be evolved in order to overcome the diffi culty in connexion with contracts sublet to out-workers. I know that that practice is in operation at the present time, and that contracts or sub-contracts are let to out-workers for the completion of a garment. Only that portion of the garment is covered by such contracts. I suggest that the widest possible power should be given to the commission, even to the extent of power to. investigate all contracts of this nature, sub-let by employers in order to see that they are classified as employers of labour and brought within the scope of this bill. In the main, out-workers do not earn more, and, inmany cases, earn considerably less, than the average employee who works in a factory, even though, in an endeavour to make the average living wage, they work extraordinarily long hours day and night. </para>

            <para>- The commission must have some little discretion in this matter because an infinite variety of work, not only in the garment industry,  but  also in the engineering industry, for instance, is done outside. In some instances, persons are employers on their own account; they have their own businesses as self-employed persons, but to supplement their incomes, they take in outwork which may not yield to them more than 5s. or 10s. a week. It would be unwise to deny the commission discretion in these matters. The commission can be relied on not to exclude from the scheme persons who properly should come under it. If, however, we deny to the commission discretionary powers, we shall create hardship by bringing under the scheme people who should not be called upon to make contributions. It would be unwise to make these provisions rigid; a measure of elasticity should be allowed. </para>

          <para>.- 1 am concerned on behalf of low-paid and special workers, especially women who are classed as outdoor workers because they make pyjamas, shirts and other articles of clothing in their own homes. These women work long hours for very low pay, and they earn so little that they cannot afford to make any contribution to this scheme. Nevertheless, they are entitled to protection. When I reflect on the conditions under which these women are forced to work, I am reminded of the lines in Thomas Hood&#39;s immortal poem : <inline font-style="italic">The Song of the Shirt -</inline></para>

        <para class="block">It is strange that, whenever an honorable member rises to advocate the claims of oppressed workers, he is subjected  to  jibes from honorable members opposite. Those who sweat these unfortunate workers are supporters of the Government. Those who need a scheme of national health insurance most are denied it by this measure. Honorable members may ask why these women endure such conditions. The answer is that economic necessity forces them to do so. Unscrupulous employers take advantage of their need, and this bill will not protect them. Unfortunately, the Treasurer is obsessed by the desire to bludgeon this legislation through the Parliament, regardless of its effect on the workers. He is concerned only with relieving the wealthy section of the community from the necessity to contribute towards pensions for deserving needy people. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> knows of the sweating that exists in the clothing trade ; his contribution to the debate was most, valuable. I hope that the claims of these workers will be- recognized, and that they will not be left at the mercy of unscrupulous employers. The conditions under which many of them work are so deplorable that it is no wonder that their health breaks down. The bill should be sufficiently comprehensive to include all classes of workers who need the benefit of a national health insurance scheme. </para>

            <para>- I think so, because it is wide enough to include every worker.&#34; Indeed, the definition is so wide that it includes certain persons whom it was not intended should be covered by this legislation. The effect of the amendment would be to throw on the draftsman the responsibility of defining precisely those persons who should be regarded as out-workers, and, by inference, the classes of workers that should be excluded. The amendment would introduce into the schedule a rigidity that would make proper administration impossible. The granting of a discretionary power to the commission will avoid much trouble in the future. In my opinion, the commission must have that discretionary power because it is not possible in an act of Parliament to define every class of person who should be included or excluded. The definition should be made as wide as possible, with power for the commission to exclude those sections which cannot reasonably be included. Parliament would have the right to discuss the regulations providing for such exclusions. </para>

          <para>.- The honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. John Lawson)</inline> is right in saying that the definition of &#34; out-worker &#34; covers all classes of persons, but there is one thing that binds them together - they are persons to whom work is given for the purposes of the business of the givers. In the clothing trade, for instance, work is performed by persons who obviously are direct employees, and are, therefore, covered by this scheme. But an employer may also let some of his work to contractors or sub-contractors. Should such persons do the work individually, they will be covered by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d.</inline></para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">An employer may also give work to outworkers - persons who work in their own homes, or elsewhere, outside the factory of the person who supplies them with the work. There are, therefore, three classes of workers. The amendment of the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> has been misrepresented as an attempt to bring certain persons und.er this legislation. That is not the desire of the honorable member or, indeed, of the Opposition. My opinion of the bill has been expressed earlier; the more I see of ir, the more I dislike it, because it will not confer any substantial benefits on those who are supposed to be beneficiaries under the scheme which it sets up. The purpose of the Opposition is io protect employees who may -be brought under the scope of this measure from the unfair competition of other employees who will not come under it. A manufacturer should not be able to say, &#34; If I have this work done in my own factory, I shall have to pay ls. <inline font-style="italic">6d. a</inline> week in respect of every employee. I shall, therefore, give the work to out-workers, and thereby evade making any contribution &#34;. The Opposition is afraid that orders made by the commission may enable employers to give preference in employment to out-workers as against ordinary workers. As the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> knows, the position in the clothing trade became so acute that representatives of the employees and of the employers conferred with a view to the practical abolition of out-work. It is almost impossible to control out-work in the clothing trade. The Opposition does not want to encourage manufacturers to give preference to out-workers over general employees. Any order that; exempts out-workers from making contributions, or that exempts employers from making contributions in respect of their employees, would encourage employers to have as much of their work as possible done by out-workers, rather than in their own factories. A special order is not a regulation. If . a&#34; special order by the commission is made the House should have an opportunity to review it. I understand that the Treasurer says that, if necessary, he will include provisions by which special orders may be treated as regulations and made subject to review or disallowance by either House of the Parliament. But the honorable gentleman will -find it difficult to do that. A special order might be made in respect of one out-worker or one industry. </para>

It must be obvious to the committee that the amendment is too rigid in that it takes from the commission the right -of determination in specific instances. The commission should have authority to determine whether certain classes of employers should or should not be defined as outworkers. I have in mind such firms as David Jones, Anthony Hordern and Sons, and other large firms in Sydney and other capital cities in the Commonwealth, which manufacture in their own factories and also let out from those factories orders to a large number of small manufacturers. If those persons whodo this class of work were defined as out-workers many hundreds of employees would automatically become the responsibility of the larger firms which gave the contracts to smaller manufacturers. I do not think that that is the intention of the honorable member for Werriwa, and I approve the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>

          <para>.- I should like the Treasurer to tell me whether an out-worker will have the right of appeal against inclusion in this scheme. I ask this question because I realize that very few persons who to-day are classed as out-workers will continue as out-workers until they reach the maximum age. This is true particularly of &#171;women. The average woman who to-day is an outworker is so because she is contributing to the income of the home for the purpose of rearing a family. In most instances when the children have &#39;grown up, the mother ceases out-work and the members of the family keep the home going. I do not wish this class of out-worker to be brought under the scheme at all, and I should like to see included in the bill some provision to give out-workers the right of appeal, otherwise a great injustice will be done to a large number of people. Official figures show that only  .0S7  per cent, of -women in Australia over the age of  60  years will derive any benefit from the scheme. As to the proposal that effective measures should be taken to prevent employers from evading responsibility for contributions imposed on them by this scheme, we know quite well that any charges on employers a*e always added to the cost of production. The Treasurer will admit that the sales tax, of which he can speak with some authority, is paid by the general public - mainly by the workers. In the same way this con tribution of ls. Cd. from employers will be passed on to the consuming public. I should like the Treasurer to say definitely if out-workers will have a right of appeal against inclusion in this scheme. </para>

            <para>- The exemption would apply only to the portion of the contribution providing for health insurance. Nurses, wardsmen and assistants in hospitals are already assured of medical attention, under the terms of their engagements. If the institutions were required to contribute to the national insurance fund in respect of these employees, it would be an extra and unnecessary payment which would cause a serious inroad upon their revenues. The need for this amendment has been brought under my notice by the authorities of the Adelaide Children&#39;s Hospital. Under this legislation, hospital services will be availed of by a larger number of persons than in the past, and in addition these institutions will lose a substantial part of their revenue which has been derived heretofore from voluntary subscriptions. The exemption for which I am asking would not impair the efficiency of the insurance scheme. It would simply mean that, if a hospital did. not cover its employees for medical benefit at least equal to that provided under this measure, its employees would come under the present scheme; but, if it gave medical aid equivalent, or superior to, that contemplated under the bill, it would be exempt from the provisions of the measure in&#39; respect of medical benefit. I hope that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> will see the wisdom of accepting my amendment. </para>

          <para>. - I hope that, in pursuance of the policy of widening rather than restricting the ambit of this scheme, the Government will adhere to tho schedule as it stands. The honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> has suggested that medical attention and hospital attention are pa.t of the emolument of hospital employees. In most cases this service is given as an act of grace, and is not recognized as a right. There is no certainty that this privilege will always be extended to the employees, and, if the amendment were accepted, it might well be that some hospital employees would fall within the ambit of this legislation,  as  regards medical benefits, and others would not. Much has been said concerning the disability which the measure will impose on hospitals because of the extra contributions they will have to make in respect of their employees, but not a great deal has been heard regarding the offsetting advantage in that hospitals are among the institutions which do not suspend payment of the wages of their employees on account of illness, when they are unable to carry out their duties. The sickness and disablement benefits to bc provided under this measure will save the hospitals a considerable expenditure in sick pay, and this will enable them to recoup themselves to a substantial degree for the outlay represented by their contributions as employers. I was hoping that the trend of the discussion since lunch time towards a recognition of the desirability of having an all-embracing national health insurance scheme would have been maintained. I trust that, instead of restricting the scope of the measure, the committee will rather widen it. </para>

          <para>. - This amendment might easily prove to bc the thin end of a wedge for relieving the employers - in this case the hospital authorities - of the payment required for medical benefit.  As I have previously explained, not all nurses are permanently employed. Generally speaking, they move about a great deal. Their occupation is by no means static. A nurse may be in a hospital one day, and attending a case in a private home on the following day. We want &#39;to bring about a situation in which all working persons will carry about with them from employment &#34;to employment, and from place to place, their full obligation to pay under the scheme, and also their full rights to all benefits. The amendment, if agreed to, would disturb that situation, and, therefore, the Government cannot accept it. The hospitals will be no worse off under the scheme, because doctors, who now give free medical attention to hospital employees, will be able to set up a small panel on to which those employees can come. If any question of emolument arises, it can be adjusted between the nurses and the hospitals. </para>

            <para>-That may help to some extent, hut so much treatment is given in hospitals without payment that but little relief will be afforded. In New South Wales, there are 174 public hospitals; in Victoria, 63; in Queensland, 113; in South Australia, 47; in Western Australia, 93; and in Tasmania, 19. All of these are managed by boards, either appointed by the Crown or elected by subscribers, and all, I understand, are in financial difficulties. Within the. last two years there have been citations before State industrial tribunals by unions representing hospital nursing staffs, in which claims have been made for increased pay and fewer working hours, particularly a  better rotation of hours, and those claims have been resisted on the ground that the granting of them would impose an undue burden upon the finances of the hospitals. I remind the Treasurer that the budgets of the States, which improved steadily during the last four years, are now showing signs of going the other way. Having regard to the general prospect before Australia, there appears to be no ground for optimism regarding the financial outlook, so that the Treasurer cannot be indifferent to the effect of this scheme upon Sta.te finances. The honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> said that hospital nurses in South Australia are at present receiving health services, the equivalent of those provided in this scheme, without any cost to the hospital in which they are employed. It is regarded as part of the remuneration due to nurses, and as compensating them, to some extent, for the inequality between their conditions and those in other industries. If the Government insists that the State governments shall contribute ls. 6d. in respect of each hospital employee, and that the employees themselves shall also contribute ls. 6d., in order to provide a medical benefit which they now obtain free, the proposal will not be popular. </para>

            <para>- And another 4d. from the employer, making a total of Sd. Even 8d. represents more than the value of the medical benefit that will be provided. It should be possible to make an adjustment to assure these employees of their pension rights without imposing conditions that will threaten the stability of hospital finance. If the Treasurer will not be moved by the effect which the scheme may have on State budgets, let him at least be influenced by the fact that so many of the hospitals, although subsidized by Sta.te governments, are administered by philanthropically-minded citizens, who devote a great deal of their time and energy to this work. If the Government imposes an intolerable burden on hospital administration, it will be impossible for these public-minded citizens to carry on. Private citizens cannot be expected to continue interminably the almost hopeless task of trying to administer a hospital when there is no prospect even of paying wages and giving services. I ask the Treasurer to reconsider his attitude to the amendment moved by the honorable member for Hindmarsh. </para>

          <para>. - I was interested to hear the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> present the case on behalf of the hospitals, but at  the same time I appreciate the position of the Treasury. I accept the principle that national insurance should cover as many employees as possible, and it is upon that principle that I agree with the Treasurer&#39;s decision to reject the amendment moved by the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin).</inline> If, however, the Treasurer had been prepared to accept the honorable member&#39;s amendment, I should have pressed for consideration to be given to the ambulance services. In New South Wales, the ambulance service is carried on by a group of individuals on a grant of &#163;22,000 from the State government, supplemented by tens of thousands of pounds made up of weekly payments by persons who feel that they should insure against the possibility of having at some stage of their lives to avail themselves of the service. The ambulance service not only conveys persons to hospitals, but it also renders first-aid in street accidents and the like. I imagine that its financial stability will suffer as the result of the introduction of this scheme. Emphasis has been laid on the fact that experience in Great Britain has shown that panel doctors send to hospital patients whom they cannot or have not time to treat. If a similar condition obtains in Australia - and obviously it will - the ambulances will be called upon to convey to hospital a greater number of persons than hitherto. The insured employees will feel, too, that their contribution to the insurance fund should entitle them to free conveyance to hospital, and will accordingly cease their contributions to the ambulance service, whose revenue will consequently be seriously reduced. </para>

        </list>
        <para class="block">The anomaly is contained in the words &#34; otherwise than by manual labour &#34;. The Treasurer cannot be aware of the large numbers of manual labourers who earn considerably more than &#163;365 a year and who can afford to avail themselves of medical attention at the prevailing rates. The provision thatI have cited differentiates between them and other workers to the detriment of the medical profession, on whose behalf I appeal to the Treasurer to give further consideration to the matter. It is well known that, particularly in mining districts, men are engaged throughout the year at rates exceeding &#163;365 a year, but in substantiation I submit to the Treasurer the following table prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. F.</inline> W.

        </para>
        <para class="block">Those figures relate to the State of Western Australia, but I should say that similar conditions obtain throughout the Commonwealth. In many instances these men are not in employment of a temporary nature or of a nature which is likely to be varied. It is constant throughout the year and years. The anomaly of  which complaint is made could he overcome if the Treasurer could see his way clear to amend paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> by omitting all the words after &#34; employment &#34; in the first line and words &#34; a rate of &#34; in the second line. The- exclusion of the word &#34; rate &#34; would obviously bring within the scheme those manual labourers whose sporadic work earns for them less than  &#163;365  per annum. I readily acknowledge that some men may receive remuneration at a weekly rate exceeding.  &#163;365  a year, but, owing to the intermittency of the work would not earn more than that amount in a year. If the paragraph were amended as suggested there would be excluded from benefit that huge number of manual labourers who work constantly for more than  &#163;365  a year. A great deal of the objection of medical practitioners that they will lose money as the result of the introduction of this scheme, would be removed if a large number of persons who can afford to pay the ruling rates for medical attention were excluded from benefiting from the cut rates which will be imposed on the profession when this scheme operates. </para>

          <para>.- I support the amendment of the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin).</inline> The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> is reluctant to accept the amendment, but it seems to me that his view, although it may be correct of hospitals in Victoria, is not correct of hospitals in some of the other States. Hospitals in Tasmania will suffer very severe hardship if the schedule be carried in its present form. Launceston hospital, which is subsidized- by the State,, is on all fours with other subsidized hospitals. The board controlling it is a nominee body of public-spirited citizens, who receive no remuneration in return for their services. They have very great difficulty in financing the hospital, and it frequently happens that they have to appeal to the Government to make good a financial deficiency at the end of the year. It is not a very large hospital&#34;, it has about  400  beds. The national insurance scheme will impose on it an additional expenditure of something like  &#163;600  a year. The increased burden will have to be borne by the State, as the hospital deficit will be increased by that amount. There may be a small offset in the amount of money received from employees covered by the scheme, but it will be negligible.. Extra payments from those who attend the hospital will also be very small. Launceston hospital is typical of many other subsidized hospitals throughout Australia. It is true, as the Treasurer has said, that many nurses after receiving their training in hospitals, pass on to other work. I remind him that the nursing staff represents only a percentage of the employees of a hospital, and that ought not to be regarded as a determining factor. Some_ of the nurses remain for years, hut I agree that in the main they leave after receiving their training. There are many other permanent employees, however, who remain on hospital staffs for years, and, in the ordinary course of events will be there until they reach the retiring age. Launceston hospital employees receive free medical attention and free hospital treatment when they are sick, just as if they were covered by the provisions of the bill. For the first week or two of sickness they still receive their wages or salaries. The Treasurer has suggested that they could obtain medical attention from a panel of doctors at the hospital. That idea would not work in practice. There is a permanent staff of doctors, and they are assisted by honorary doctors. Therefore the Treasurer&#39;s reply to the arguments of the honorable member for Hindmarsh and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> breaks down. I speak from knowledge of the conditions that obtain in the Launceston hospital, and I know how the national insurance scheme will affect it. I ask the Treasurer to accept the amendment. </para>

          <para>.- I notify the Government that I shall support the amendment of the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin).</inline> I do so on the broad ground that the Federal Government should make a gesture to the State governments regarding the class of employees referred to. It is true that the State governments provide large sums of money for the upkeep of hospitals. If we were dealing only with governments, perhaps it would be a matter for negotiation between the Commonwealth and  the States, but associated with, the administration of every hospital is a band of individuals who year in and year out devote much of their time, in a voluntary capacity, to its management. In order to raise funds, entertainments of all sorts are organized by citizens who value the work of the hospitals in their districts. Frequently, the field in which they are able to raise funds is very limited. This is one direction in which the Government should give assistance. I nstitutions such as St. Vincent&#39;s Hospice for the Dying, the Home of Peace for the Dying in Marrickville, and the Home for Incurables .in Ryde, are entirely dependent on voluntary subscriptions for their upkeep. I am concerned, not so much about their employees as about the voluntary boards which manage their affairs on behalf of the general community and the Government of the State. The commission ought to bt empowered to waive the contribution in respect of these institutions. A large percentage of those who enter them are unable to make any payment for the treatment they receive, and those responsible for the upkeep of the institutions have to rely  wholely  upon the voluntary subscriptions of the residents of the district, often comparatively few in number. I should like ambulances also to be brought within, .the scope of the amendment. They, too, render valuable service to people who are unable to make any payment for it. Humanity demands that this Government and Parliament shall make a generous gesture to the sick and the afflicted of the community. Therefore, the committee ought to vote for the amendment. </para>

The Government is acting severely even in demanding that the members of the medical profession shall render a cheap service to every employee, other than manual workers, receiving up to &#163;365 a year; yet thousands of manual workers in the mining industry, who are earning more than &#163;365, will be brought into the scheme.

          <para>.- The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> said that the Government has repeatedly indicated its mind on the suggestion that hospitals should be exempt, but honorable members are equally entitled to indicate their mind on the subject, particularly in view of the experience which many of them have had in hospital work. I should not press for the exemption of any class if I thought that such employees might be deprived of advantages offered under the scheme, and, therefore, I am not suggesting that hospitals should he exempt in respect of any benefit other than medical benefit. Hospitals already extend medical benefits to their employees, and I suggest that we should avoid overlapping in thisrespect when dealing with this clause. I have been a member of a hospital board for a long time, and I know that theseboards generally experience great difficulty in carrying on. Hospital finance isobtained from three sources - subsidies from the State Government, fees paid by patients and voluntary donations. </para>

            <para>- My observation applies to hospitals in practically all of the States, with the possible exception of Queensland. I point out that voluntary contributions are decreasing, and that income from this source threatens to disappear entirely. That tendency is evident throughout Australia. The hospital with which I was connected did not derive 5- per cent, of its revenue from voluntary contributions. Under this scheme, hospitals will be faced with a two-fold -burden ; their costs of administration will be increased, and they will be compelled toprovide for greater numbers of patients in view of the attitude of the medical profession to the health side of this scheme. Under the scheme, more patients will be sent into public and non-paying wards than has even been thecase before, and hospitals will be obliged to find increased funds in order to provide extra nursing staff, medicine, bedding and other requirements. As the service rendered by hospitals is unique and cannot be compared with any other health service, the Government would no*- establish a precedent if it agreed to this amendment. Public- hospitals are the foundation of a national health service, and, I- suggest, one of the worst mistakes made by the Government in connexion with this scheme is its failure to recognize this fact. Hospitals have a very strong case for exemption, under clause 47, in respect of medical benefit, because they should not be asked to contribute in respect of a service which they already provide for their employees. The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> suggested that doctors provide this treatment in an honorary capacity; I have no doubt that they will be just as much prepared to continue to give that service without fee as they will be to continue their honorary work in public wards. There is no substance, therefore, in the statement by the Treasurer that hospitals boards can put their nurses, who are insured persons, on panels. If they did so, they would be obliged to go through a ritual which, I feel sure, no hospital would bother about. If the Government cannot see its way clear to accept this amendment, it should at least include this matter among the subjects to be referred to the royal commission for investigation. </para>

        <para class="block">That the House do now adjourn. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> BARNARD  (Bass) &#91;4.9&#93;.- On the 14th instant, I directed a question, <inline font-style="italic">upon notice,</inline> to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> concerning the landing of the Douglas air liner <inline font-style="italic">Kurana</inline> at the emergency landing ground at Umbrella Flat, Georgetown, Tasmania, where it became bogged, owing to wet weather. The Minister in his reply stated that that landing ground was provided to enable  a  machine to land in cases of emergency only, and under normal weather conditions had proved very suitable. He further stated - </para>
        <para>Financial considerations make it difficult to ensure that all emergency landing grounds throughout the Commonwealth shall &#39;be of the same standard as capital city and other aerodromes in regular use as stopping places. </para>
      </quote>
      <para class="block">While I agree that emergency landing grounds cannot be placed in as good condition as the regular landing grounds adjacent to the capital cities, I ask the Minister to inquire further into the circumstances of the bogging of this plane, and to see whether this ground cannot be made fit for planes to arrive and depart in all weathers. Western Junction aerodrome is, of course, the recognized landing ground for Launceston, but in a country of wide open spaces, it is highly desirable that &#39; landing grounds capable of accommodating modern machines in all weathers should be provided at appropriate places between terminal points. It was only after I had made repeated representations to the Government concerning the necessity for an emergency landing ground at some point close to the Tasmanian coast that something was done. Under existing con ditions a certain amount of trepidation must be in the mind of passengers by air who, in uncertain weather, have to leave either the mainland for Tasmania or Tasmania for the mainland, and they should be assured that a suitable emergency landing ground is available if difficulties should occur during the flight. Although the landing ground at Umbrella Flats was made available by the Government after frequent requests by myself, it is not yet in a satisfactory condition, otherwise the Douglas liner <inline font-style="italic">Kurana,</inline> with 24 passengers on board, would not have bogged there. It is necessary that travellers between Tasmania and the mainland should be made confident of the fitness not only of the permanent landing grounds but also of the emergency landing grounds that planes on which they are travelling may have to use. I ask the Minister to ascertain what cost would be involved in improving the Umbrella Flats landing ground. </para>
      <para>The necessity to take prompt action in this connexion is emphasized by reason of the fact that on Wednesday last the <inline font-style="italic">Kurana,</inline> which left the Western Junction aerodrome for Melbourne, could not land at Essendon owing to unfavorable weather conditions and had to be flown back to Flinders Island in the Furneaux Group. It landed at Pat&#39;s River aerodrome after having been five hours in the air. </para>

          <para>- It is because I regard the Minister&#39;s reply as unsatisfactory that I am now making these representations. The honorable gentleman said that the Umbrella Flats landing ground was satisfactory under normal weather conditions. Of what earthly use is a landing ground which cannot be used under abnormal conditions? </para>

            <para>-  Planes have landed there in wet weather.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BARNARD.-</inline> That is so. Planes frequently land there in wet and bad weather; but on the occasion to which I have referred the <inline font-style="italic">Kurana</inline> was bogged. I have seen the newspaper photograph of the plane after it landed, and it seems  to me that it was only because of the skill of the pilot that it did not capsize. It takes little imagination to realize what might happen when an aeroplane carrying 24 persons bogs on landing. It could very easily turn over on its nose with probably fatal results. I ask the Minister to investigate the cost of providing satisfactory runways at Umbrella Flat to enable aeroplanes to land there whenever inclement weather prevents them from landing at either Western Junction or Essendon. The people of Tasmania are entitled to a satisfactory aerodrome at this point. </para>

That was the only point on which I was consulted. , It has been suggested that the pair was intended to cover other divisions during the afternoon, but I could not have given a pair under those conditions for there were certain matters before the committee on which I distinctly wished to vote. It &#39; was only after careful consideration, and on the understanding that the pair related only to contributions which I did not wish to be altered, that I gave a pair at all. </para>

          <para>.- I ask the Minister in charge of the House to convey to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> a request, which I- know is supported by honorable gentlemen on both sides of the chamber, that an opportunity be afforded before this period of the session ends, for a discussion on foreign affairs. The right honorable gentleman said this morning that the Government wished the consideration of certain items of business to be completed before the House rose, but he ma.de no reference to external affairs. Later when I addressed a question to him on this subject, he said that he was afraid that my desire could not be complied with, but that it would depend upon the progress made with the business to which he had referred. T wish to make the request more definite than is possible by way of a question, &#34;that the House be given an opportunity to discuss this subject before this period &#171;f the session closes. </para>

          <para>.- Prior to the passing of the Financial Emergency Act, persons receiving pension on account of miners&#39; phthisis from the Victorian Government, and from the governments of the other States, were subjected to no deduction in respect of that pension when income for invalid and old-age pensions purposes was being calculated. Following the passing of the financial emergency legislation, the position was changed, and the receipt of such a pension is now taken into consideration in assessing permissible income, with the result that sufferers from .miners&#39; phthisis are subjected to an unfair penalty. In view of the fact that restorations have been effected of the salaries of members of Parliament, and, in fact, almost complete restoration of the financial emergency cuts has now been made, I suggest, that the provision, under which a pension for miners&#39; phthisis is included in the earnings of an applicant for an invalid or old-age pension, should be repealed. The pension was granted to these unfortunate people primarily to enable them to secure the medical attention and nursing which their complaint made necessary; it was not given to them as a payment on which they were expected to live. Therefore, I ask the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> to give very earnest consideration to the representations I have made on behalf of these unfortunate people. </para>

            <para>- That is what sticks in the Minister&#39;s gizzard. I hope the honorable gentleman will live to see a lot more like me. The matter which I proposed to discuss with the Minister was in connexion with the charges which the Air Board proposed to impose on the Ballarat Aero Club for aeroplanes that will visit Ballarat in connexion with its centenary air pageant. As the proposed air pageant is to be a special feature of the Ballarat centenary celebrations, I ask the Minister if the charges to be imposed for the use of defence aeroplanes, can be reconsidered. I have no hope, however, that my request will be acceded to. </para>

          <para>.- Some time ago I addressed a question to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> regarding the membership of rifle clubs. 1 may have misconstrued his reply, but I gathered from it that it was not the Government&#39;s intention to reduce the personnel of rifle clubs in Australia. On the 14th May last, however, I received from the Secretary of the National Rifle Association of Western Australia, a letter which states - </para>

        <quote>
          <para>The Defence Department has issued instructions that the number of active members oi rifle clubs in Western Australia must &#39; be reduced from the present strength of 6,500 to 5,805, which was the number at the end of June, 1937. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I respectfully suggest to the Minister that the value of rifle clubs in the defence organization of Australia is very great. I know that in the minds of certain military officers expenditure on rifle clubs is not considered to be as important as expenditure in other directions. Although I do not agree with that view, I have no desire to be drawn into a discussion of the relative values of the various arms of the services. It is undeniable that in the event of an invasion of this country men trained in the use of small arms &#39; will form a very effective nucleus of the defence scheme. The amount provided by the Defence Department for the encouragement of rifle clubs is altogether too meagre. I plead with the Minister on behalf of these rifle clubs, particularly the Rifle Club Association in Western Australia of which I am patron. A recent rough census of rifle club members shows that 75 per cent, of thom are of military age; the remaining 25 per cent.  are excellent rifle shots. Many of them fill executive positions in the movement, but only four are paid for their services, namely, the secretary of the Commonwealth Council, and one man in each of the States of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. That shows their enthusiasm. </para>

            <para>- That is so. It is true that the clubs receive from the Defence Department 200 rounds of ammunition free for each efficient member, but, as the Minister knows, that consists of ammunition two or three years old. In addition to that quantity of free ammunition, the clubs receive 5s. for each efficient member, except that where military ranges are used, the grant is 2s. 6d. a. member, and that in respect of militia rifle clubs, the members of which are also members of the military forces, the grant is ls. 6d. for each efficient member. In addition to spending their own money, riflemen devote a considerable portion of their own time to training. Generally, their Saturday afternoons are spent at the butts.  When  I was younger, I travelled every Saturday from Ringwood, Victoria, to the North Williamstown butts  in  order to make myself proficient as a rifleman. I am glad to say that I passed the prescribed test. A rifleman&#39;s initial expenditure can be set down at approximately &#163;7 for the purchase of a rifle, aperture sight, etc. ; in Western Australia his minimum expenditure would be about &#163;10 per annum. Lost time and travelling expenses would add considerably to that expenditure. I trust that when the Estimates for the ensuing financial year are under consideration the modest request which I slia.ll submit to the Minister by letter will be acceded to. </para>

This matter has been mentioned on a number of occasions by honorable members on both sides of the House.

        <para>Later, a change was made, and the commission was instructed to take such receipts into consideration only when some additional income was received by the applicant. Generally, some small deduction from the pension followed. The time has arrived for the full pension to be paid to these men, regardless of these small receipts. At present most of them receive only 14s. or 15s. a week because of these reductions. I ask that the claims of these men be given earnest consideration. </para>

When the honorable gentleman first made representations to me, I had a careful inquiry made in order to ascertain the facts. The aerodrome at Umbrella Plats is not a regular landing ground, but one for use only in an emergency. The ground is situated in an area where suitable landing places are not plentiful; I understand that the surrounding district is uneven and that difficulty would be experienced in obtaining a more suitable area for a landing ground. </para>

            <para>- Moreover, the area is subjected to flooding and a considerable amount of seepage in very wet weather. The difficulty confronting the department is that only on rare occasions does the ground become as wet as it was when the emergency landing had to be made recently. The fact remains, however, that the aeroplane landed successfully, and only subsequently became bogged. The purpose of an emergency landing ground &#39;is to avoid disaster, and whilst it is regretted that the machine subsequently became bogged, the ground served its purpose and enabled the machine to land safely. If the Commonwealth Government were to accept the responsibility of putting every emergency landing ground in first-class order, so that, irrespective of weather conditions, aeroplanes could land without difficulty and take off again, the cost would be beyond the funds at its disposal. The department is endeavouring to establish as many  emergency landing grounds as possible along the main air routes within the Commonwealth, but, obviously, emergency grounds cannot be put into the same condition as is necessary at standard aerodromes which are used regularly by all classes of machines in all weather conditions. The honorable member will admit that the machine that landed successfully, was one of the heaviest aeroplanes in use in the Commonwealth - a large <inline font-style="italic">Douglas</inline> machine. </para>

            <para>- I do not think that the honorable gentleman was fair when he accused me of being discourteous to him and to his constituents. He first brought the matter under my notice in my office in Melbourne. On that occasion I granted him an interview, lasting probably half an hour, during which we discussed a number of other subjects. Then he put his request in writing and received the official reply. Subsequently in the House he asked a question, and I gave him a very full reply stating the reasons for the attitude taken up by the department in connexion with these requests for visits by air force machines to take part in air pageants in different parts of the Commonwealth. Following on that question he asked me, whilst I was crossing the floor before or after a division, if I would grant him an interview. I said that I could not do so immediately, because I had other appointments to keep, but that if he would- see me in my office at halfpast eight I would again discuss the matter with him. I have no record of his keeping that appointment or making a further request for an interview. I therefore think that the honorable gentleman was not fair in accusing me of discourtesy. I did all that was humanly possible to meet his wishes in the time available after dealing with official business. I cannot promise to vary the decision that has been arrived at, because it is in conformity with the policy of the Defence Department in connexion with requests of this nature. If, however, the honorable member has additional facts to show that the request made by the Ballarat Aero Club is of a special nature which would justify reconsideration of the matter, he can rest assured that his request will receive the same consideration as that of any other honorable member. </para>

        <para>The honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Green)</inline> referred to the reduction of membership of various rifle clubs. That reduction is the result of a decision by Parliament, in connexion with last year&#39;s Estimates, to make provision for 50,000 riflemen. It is difficult, because of resignations and enrolments, to keep the membership of rifle clubs to a particular figure. As the total number had been exceeded, the department sent a circular to all rifle clubs informing them that their membership would have to bc reduced, in conformity with the decision of Parliament. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie, as an ex-Minister for Defence, will know that if the Estimates had provided for a specific number, there would not be sufficient money for the subsidising of any excess riflemen. The subject of rifle clubs finance is under consideration in connexion with the preparation of the budget for the next financial year. </para>

I said, &#34;Certainly I will&#34;. He then said, &#34;1 will send a messenger to you and let you know&#34;. That he did not do.
