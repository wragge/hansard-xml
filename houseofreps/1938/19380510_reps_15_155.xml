            <para>- &#34;Will the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs say whether the statement purporting to have been issued by him to the press, which appeared in last &#34;Wednesday&#39;s newspapers, with reference to the steps he was taking to prevent the importation of objectionable magazines, is, in the main, accurate, particularly that portion in which he explained that two problems were involved, one being the objectionable character of the magazines, and the second that the imports were on a dumping basis? Will he also make it quite plain that when he said it would be a matter for the Government to determine whether any special protection could be granted to Australian producers, he did not intend to convey the impression that the Government was contemplating any action for the purpose of protecting local producers of indecent literature? </para>

            <para>- The interpretation placed on my statement by the honorable member is the opposite of what I wished to convey. It has been found that the sale of indecent literature is having a detrimental effect upon certain decent Australian publications, and at the same time is encouraging other publishers in Australia to run a little loose in order to hold some of the trade they already have. T believe that the steps which the Government proposes to take should ment the situation. </para>

            <para>- There have been two processes - one, an inquiry into the cost of milk, and the other, litigation in connexion with certain matters between Canberra dairymen and other persons. The Department of Health, naturally, has the matter of milk supplies under consideration. In regard to the recent litigation, if that is what the honorable gentleman is driving at, all that I have to say is that certain officers of my department, were subpoenaed to give evidence, by both the plaintiff and the defendant, but having been previously examined by the lawyers representing both sides, none was called. </para>

Will the right honorable gentleman put an end. to those suggestions by making it quite plain that the chair will not he put up for auction, &#39;but that the university at which it will be located will be the one at which it can best function, find from which it will be able to render the most widespread service to the people of Australia? </para>

            <para>- It must not necessarily be assumed that the Government, in any event, is prepared to accept the whole cost of the creation and endowment of a chair of aeronautical research. The Government is delaying action in this matter not for the reason suggested by the honorable member but because other important matters are more urgent.  At  an early date consideration will be given to this matter and a decision reached. </para>

          <para class="block">I do so in order to direct attention once again to the belated nature of this report which brings before the Parliament facts in connexion with the operations of the Munitions Supply Board only up to the 30th June, 1937. This is too late a date, I submit, for this Parliament to have before it information which it ought to have had in order to consider fully legislation just passed relating to munitions supply. I have not had an opportunity to review the report, but I submit to the Parliament that an advance precis of it ought to have been circulated a fortnight ago, having regard to the fact that the Parliament was then being invited to vote very large sums of money for munitions supply. The fact that the report is submitted to us after we had made our decision in the matter, and not before it, is indicative of how unsatisfactory generally is the practice of these bodies which, either under statute  or  as a matter of courtesy, furnish reports which are subsequently tabled for the consideration of honorable members of the Parliament. I acknowledge that there has been a great acceleration of expedition in relation to the tabling of this report compared with previous reports - no doubt, representations made on previous occasions have had some effect - but I cannot but feel that the report, tabled at this juncture, will be of service to honorable members of the Parliament only insofar as we are asked to give further effect to a policy the principles of which have been accepted without the guidance which this report no doubt would have given. </para>

              <para>- Most certainly we were voting money for activity in the future; but, in order to know the extent of the organization we would need for the future, it was, I think, desirable at least, if not necessary, that we ought to have been informed as to how the present organization was functioning, what it was doing, and what were the recommendations which the board saw fit to make to the Parliament. I know the Minister is very annoyed at me for taking this course. </para>

His  final request has already been met. Ample opportunities will be given to discuss this matter, not upon the printing of the report just tabled, but, first of all, upon the statements which I have made of a general character in regard to defence, which have still to be debated. As a matter of fact, the honorable gentleman himself secured the adjournment of that debate. </para>

              <para>- That is so, and before the Government&#39;s defence policy is completed, this House will have to vote very many more million pounds for that purpose. The report which is now before us will assist honorable members in coming to wise decisions when further appropriations for defence are sought. The Leader of the Opposition said that this report should have been in the hands of honorable members earlier, but I remind him that they will have ample opportunity to acquaint themselves with its contents before the further discussions which will take place on the subject. There has been no avoidable delay in the presentation of the report, nor has the department wasted time in preparing it. Honorable members will recognise the great amount of work that the Minister has had to deal with, particularly of late. The report was received by the Minister only to-day, and it was tabled by him without delay. </para>

              <para>- No good purpose can be served by the motion, as sufficient copies of the report havebeen circulated among honorable members to acquaint them with its contents.Whether or not it shall be formally printed is a matter for the Printing Committee to decide. Pending a decision of the subject by that committee, copies have been distributed among honorable members for their information. I hope that, on reflection, the Leader of the Opposition will agree that there has been no avoidable delay, and that the discussions that have taken place in regard to the defence programme could not have waited until the report was received. </para>

            <para>. - The tariff schedule before the committee, which was laid upon the table on the 8th December, 1937, includes the schedules introduced on the 24th June and the 7th September, 1937. A comprehensive memorandum has been prepared and distributed among honorable mem  bers,  which will enable comparisons to be made between the proposed rates of duty under each item and those operative under the 1933-36 tariff. In order to avoid unnecessary debate through a misunderstanding by honorable members, I should like to make it clear at the start that only the proposals of the 8th December last are now under discussion. An opportunity to debate the proposals introduced on Wednesday last will be given to honorable members at some later date. </para>

In 1931, the Prime Minis(Mr. Lyons) stated the tariff policy of the Government. Epitomized, this policy  is - </para>

          <para>Honorable members will, I am confident, agree with the wisdom of granting tariff protection only to those industries which have been established on efficient and economic lines or which have reasonable prospect of developing along such lines. They will, too, agree that to be effective a tariff need not represent virtual prohibition. A tariff which gives more protection that is reasonably adequate for an efficient industry confers no benefit on such industry. On the contrary, the probabilities are that excessive protection may react to the detriment of the industry. Efficiency in industry is stimulated by healthy competition.  whereas the inducement to efficiency is lacking when an industry is sheltered by duties which shut out competition. Unduly high protection brings the twofold danger of lack of efficiency and the consequent detriment to the consumer. </para>
          <para>The Tariff Board Act provides that the Minister shall refer to the board for inquiry and report certain matters connected with the tariff, including the necessity for new, increased or reduced duties, and that inquiries relating to any revision of the tariff shall be held in public, the evidence being taken on oath. All interested parties are invited to give evidence, and the board has the power to summon any person to attend the inquiry and to give evidence and produce documents. The ability and impartiality of the board are unquestioned, and experience has proved that, in sifting the uneconomic from the economic industries, and in assessing adequate as distinct from excessive duties for the latter, the board has been remarkably sound. In its tariff -making, the Government and the legislature have been greatly assisted by the expert guidance given by the Tariff Board. </para>
          <para>Charges are made from time to time about what is sometimes described as the instability of the tariff, and protests are made against alleged continual tinkering with the duties. It must be recognized that, in industrial progress, change and development are always taking place. Due to this, tariff revision is necessarily a continuous process following upon inquiries by the Tariff Board into the items calling for review from time to time. It can be safely said that, as a general rule, no tariff item is investigated by the board with consequent alteration of the rates unless the circumstances of the industry concerned justify it. Since the Prime Minister&#39;s declaration in 1931 of the Government&#39;s tariff policy, certain developments have occurred which have had their effect upon tariff-making. They are - </para>

          <para>The Ottawa Agreement, which secured preferential treatment for all of our major exports, except wool, in the largest overseas market in the world, contributed largely to the revival of prosperity in Australia. In exchange for the preference accorded in the United Kingdom to Australian primary products, the Commonwealth agreed to the adoption of certain principles in Australian tariffmaking, and these have since been adhered to. The agreement has been in operation since the latter part of 1932, and while, generally speaking, it has operated to advantage, experience has proved the need for some revision of its terms. A review of the agreement is about to take place and, as honorable members are aware, a ministerial delegation recently left to represent the Commonwealth in connexion with such revision. </para>
          <para>Before November, 1933, the Tariff Board made its recommendations regarding rates of duty necessary to protect Australian industries on the basis of Australian currency being at parity with sterling. Exchange, however, has quite as definite a protective effect as has a customs duty, and it is obvious that a rate of duty which would represent adequate protection with Australian currency at parity with sterling would constitute excess protection while Australian currency is depreciated as compared with sterling. In order, therefore, that the protection should not, owing to the incidence of exchange, be excessive with possible attendant evils of monopoly, uneconomic production, and unduly high prices to consumers, the Government, after obtaining an exhaustive report from the Tariff Board, decided to make, as regards the rates of duty provided on protective items under the British preferential tariff, a deduction equal to onefourth of the duty payable or one-eighth of the value for duty, whichever was the lesser. Later, a more exact way of making allowance for the protective value of exchange was evolved, and,since November, 1933, the Tariff Board, in its findings, has recommended two sets of duties, namely :  - </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(a)">
              <para>those for present exchange con ditions, and </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(b)">
              <para>those which the board considers should operate if Australian currency were at parity with  sterling. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The margin between the two sets of rates varies in the different tariff items according to the proportion of imported materials or Australian materials with a world parity value used in manufacture of the goods. With this system, the application of which is not confined to the British preferential tariff, there is an automatic adjustment by an increase of the rates of duty as Australian currency appreciates towards sterling. This adjustment preserves the protection to Australian industry irrespective of the relationship between Australian currency and sterling. </para>
          <para>As the result of the adoption of a policy of trade treaties, an intermediate tariff column was reintroduced into the tariff schedule which, for some years, had two columns of rates, namely, British preferential tariff and general tariff. The object of the intermediate column is to provide a convenient avenue for expressing the level of duties which form the basis for trade treaties. The rates proposed under the protective items of the intermediate tariff express, in every case, a protective level for Australian industry as well as preserving the margins of preference to the United Kingdom required under the Ottawa Agreement. The rates under the intermediate tariff are brought into operation by proclamations from time to time, as occasion requires. Many of them have not yet been brought into force. </para>
          <para>The rates of duty appearing in the general tariff column of the proposals represent in many cases a level midway between the Tariff Board&#39;s (a) findings for present conditions and (b) findings for normal exchange conditions, and enable the Government to offer countries with which a trade treaty is contemplated a more favorable rate under the intermediate tariff. </para>
          <para>The Government&#39;s tariff policy needs no vindication from me. A preliminary estimate by the Commonwealth Statistician indicates an average employment in factories for the present financial year of 554,000. This figure exceeds by 104,000 the average number employed in factories in any year before the depression. Factory production in 1936-1937 reached &#163;178,000,000, a record in the history of the Commonwealth, notwithstanding that pre-depression prices were on a much higher level than they are now ; and preliminary figures suggest that for 1937-1938 the figure will reach &#163;188,000,000. Returns from trade unions indicate that unemployment is at a lower level at present than at any other period since the records were instituted. The improvement during 1937 amounted to no less than 2&#189; per cent., the figure now standing at 8 per cent. </para>
          <para>That industrialists have confidence in the Government&#39;s tariff policy is evident from the information given in the Prime Minister&#39;s policy speech last September that a recent limited survey of 350 representative firms showed that more than &#163;11,000,000 of capita&#93; has been applied to extensions of established industries, that more than &#163;3,000,000 has gone into entirely new industries, and that industries absorbing a further &#163;10,000,000 of capital are in course of organization and will come into production at an early date. </para>
          <para>It is possible that the marked increase which has taken place in respect of the value of imports may be attributed by some to inadequacy of tariff protection. To illustrate the fallacy of any such deduction, I would point out that the extraordinary development that is proceeding in secondary industry has one effect upon our external trade which is not fully appreciated. The mounting demand for essential raw materials and capital equipment has helped to push up our import values to a marked degree. </para>
          <para>It is a commonplace that prosperity derived from good seasons and improved export prices - as witness our excellent trading position of last year - will inevitably react so as to stimulate imports. Such a reaction is now operating, but it is  completely dwarfed by the import- stimulating effects of industrial expansion. </para>
          <para>The most recent statistics issued by the CommonwealthBank show that the monthly average values of imports of machinery and raw materials have moved as follows :  - </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="155331193805104_10_0.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para>The combined average mouthy increase over 1936-37 in these sections alone is &#163;A.1,1 30,000, or 50 per cent. of the total. </para>
          <para>Of the remaining sections imports of piece goods and vehicles account in equal measure for an increased monthly average of &#163;529,000 or 23 per cent. The remaining sections - manufactures, unclassified goods, oils and foods - combine in the order given to produce the remaining 27 per cent. </para>
          <para>When it is remembered that the classification adopted by the Commonwealth Bank only partially segregates raw materials and capital goods, it is not too much to say that these account for about 80 per cent. of the increase of imports which has taken place during the present financial year. </para>
          <para>We have to recognize the fact that the character of our imports has undergone, and is continuing to undergo, a profound change. Consumers&#39; goods are giving place to producers&#39; goods, and they will continue to do so in step with the further progress of secondary industry. </para>
          <para>All this explains, but does not condone, the marked expansion of imports, which this year will be the chief factor responsible for a renewed, though certainly not extravagant, drain on our accumulated London funds. The signs so far give no real cause for anxiety. Demand for imports, and especially capital imports, will slacken as industries become established. The reaction from last year&#39;s good export season is already almost spent. </para>
          <para>The duties in the proposals have now been in operation long enough for their effect to be judged. Possibly some manufacturers will consider that, in the care of their goods, higher rates should have been imposed; but I know of no single instance where an Australian industry, operating economically and selling at fair prices to the public, has been detrimentally affected to any extent by the rates of duty in the proposals. If it can be definitely established in any case that the rates provided are inadequate for economic industry, I am prepared to refer the matter back to the Tariff Board for further inquiry. </para>
          <para>I commend the schedule to the committee as representing a level of protection, which is fair to the interests of the manufacturer, the employee, and the consuming public. </para>

            <para>.- The Labour party approaches this tariff debate with the knowledge that it has not wavered one iota from the protectionist policy for which it has consistently stood for a great many years.

          <para class="block">We believe that protection should be conditional upon those two qualifications being enforced. Owing to the limitations of the Commonwealth Constitution, the Commonwealth Parliament is denied power to fix prices. At any rate, that was the decision of the High Court some years ago, but whether it would to-day give a similar decisionis a matter for conjecture. </para>
          <para>Another plank of the Labour party&#39;s platform even goes so far as to provide for the imposition, if necessary, of embargoes against exports to assure the home market to Australian industries capable of fully supplying the demand, subject to control of prices and of industrial condition? according to Australian standards. </para>
          <para>The Labour party&#39;s tariff policy has in the past been subjected to a great deal of misrepresentation. This applies particularly to the drastic measures that had to be adopted by the Scullin Government when it was faced with the two grave responsibilities of protecting Australian industries, and of rectifying our adverse </para>
          <para class="block">Trade balance overseas. The Scullin Government had received a definite mandate from the people to deal with those problems, and it tackled them courageously, with such good effect that much of the improvement in regard to trade, employment and improved financial position which we note to-day may be traced largely to the policy it inaugurated. Although difficulties, due to the depression, became accentuated in the first year the Scullin Government was in office, difficulties that were in no way the result of the administration or legislation of that Government, but were due to world conditions generally, a substantial improvement in regard to employment in secondary industries was nevertheless effected. In order to illustrate this, I propose to give some examples of the substantial increase of employment which took place in a number of major secondary industries even during the depths of the depression as the result of Labour&#39;s protectionist policy. In the woollen and worsted industry employment was provided in 192S-29 for J 1,400 persons, but in .1931-32, when the depression w&#39;as at its worst, employment, in this industryhad increased by 2,260 to 13,600. In the hosiery industry employment was provided in 1928-29 for 11,519 persons, and in 1931-32 for 12,500, an increase of approximately 1,000. In the same period employees in the cotton spinning industry increased from 950 to 1,650. Many other industries also recorded increases. For example, Australian knitting mills in 1928-29 gave employment to 11,500 persons, and in .1931-32 to 12,500. Before the introduction of the Scullin Government&#39;s tariff manufacturers of wireless equipment were employing only a fewhundred persons; in 1931-32 there were no fewer than 2,000 employees in this important Australian industry. In the galvanized iron industry there was an increase of persons employed from 800 to 1,200, and manufacturers of dry batteries increased the personnel of their establishments from 85 to 600. I mention these facts to show that even in those years, when the depression was becoming more acute, the protectionist policy of the Scullin Government did more than arrest the tendency to greater unemployment in </para>
          <para class="block">Australian industries; it substantially increased employment in secondary industries which benefited from the protectionist policy. Moreover, but for the strong action taken by that Administration in increasing the duties on many items and imposing prohibitions and restrictive tariffs on others in order to lessen imports, our trade balance would have drifted to such an extent that Australia would have been compelled to default, because during the period when the Bruce-Page Government was in office our trade balance drifted by &#163;70,000,000. As the result of the tariff policy of the Scullin Government, which involved the imposition of prohibitions, the rationing of imports, and substantial increases of duties on what may be called luxuries and goods that could be economically and efficiently manufactured in Australia, an adverse trade balance of &#163;34,000,000 in one year was converted into a favorable trade balance of &#163;30,000,000 two years later. Naturally the taking of such drastic action interfered with the business of certain importing interests. But strong measures had to be adopted in order to grapple with the difficulties which had been gradually becoming more serious owing to the complacency and inaction of the Bruce-Page Government, and to that Government&#39;s collusion in active borrowing overseas to the extent of approximately &#163;40,000,000 per annum during its last three years of office. The money came to Australia in the form not of gold, but. of imported goods which displaced the products of Australian factories and rendered it impossible for our secondary industries to expand and give increased employment to Australian workmen. </para>
          <para>I warn the present Government against a renewal of overseas borrowing, with its resultant disadvantages to Australia. In consequence of the growth of economic nationalism in other countries, I would say to those who believe that our primary producers have everything to gain from a lower tariff, that 011 r primary producers will have to look more and more to the local market for the disposal of their products. They must realize their dependence to an increasing extent upon the people of Australia for the  marketing of their goods. When we remember that nearly 560,000 people are directly employed in Australian secondary industries and are paid wages aggregating approximately &#163;90,000,000 per annum, we must realize the tremendous importance of the local market. Excluding gold, approximately 60 per cent, of the products of the land, are consumed in Australia. The value of the local market is indicated in the latest figures compiled by the Commonwealth Statistician. Those show that in 1936-37 the total value of primary production, excluding gold, in Australia, was about &#163;230,000,000, and the value of the market provided by Australian secondary industries was &#163;149,000,000. Australia, being a debtor country, must export  sufficient  goods not only to pay for its imports but also to cover interest and other charges overseas which amount to approximately &#163;28,00.0,000 per annum. The most recent figures relating to Australia&#39;s trade balance show that for the ten months of the present financial year the favorable balance is &#163;11,600,000. In order to meet our overseas commitments we require a favorable trade balance of &#163;28,000,000, and, as only two months of the financial year remain, it is evident that the total will fall far short of the figure mentioned. </para>
          <para>We know from bitter experience what happens when governments encourage the importation of goods that can be manufactured in this country. Before the economic depression Australia was importing &#163;141,000,000 worth of goods per annum. More than half of these could have been economically and efficiently manufactured in Australia, and given employment to our own people. Since the present Government assumed office the trade balance has again been allowed to drift. It is frequently stated by those who wish to tear down the tariff wall that Australia is a primary producing country and must depend more upon the export of its primary products than upon its manufacturing industries. The Labour party is of the opinion that what is needed is well-balanced economic development, providing for scientific advancement, side by side, of all primary and secondary industries. The value of the output of Australian manufactures for the last five years was &#163;1,S65,000,000, whereas the value of all classes of primary production was &#163;1,020,000,000, or &#163;845,000,000 less than the value of our secondary products. These figures demonstrate that Australia does not live upon its exports and that some practical consideration must be given to the further development of secondary industries. During the five-year period mentioned,, the value of Australia&#39;s experts was &#163;655,000,000, but the value of the raw materials used in Australian factories was &#163;1,059,000,000, or &#163;404,000,000 greater than the total value of exports. The aims of the tariff protection for which the Labour party stands may be divided into two classes, economic and non-economic. These may be summarized as follows : First, a country is inferior in status if it does not possess and develop industries such as are established in other advanced countries. For Australia to be mainly dependent on primary industries would be to place its people in the position of hewers of wood and drawers of water foi- the people of more favored countries. Secondly, diversity of industry and employment is indeed a social advantage, making for greater versatility and the  development  of various aptitudes in the population, and generally speaking, promoting a fuller and richer natural life for the people of this country. We maintain that a country should be as independent and as self-contained as possible, in order that it may be less vulnerable to the effects of any war which may disturb markets abroad. Thirdly, certain industries are specially desirable directly for armaments, or in case essential supplies should be cut off, or to promote the population of vulnerable areas, such as are to be found in the north-eastern portion of tropical Queensland. </para>
          <para>The economic advantages of tariff protection are, briefly, these: First, protection promotes new industries and employment, and therefore additional industries and employment. Secondly, it follows that, because of the added demand for new industries, protection enlarges the home market for all industries, including the primary industries and all others that are unprotected. Thirdly, local competition and the increasing scale of production reduce prices, in many instances even below the prices of free imports. Fourthly, the tariff reduces imports, and therefore lessens the burden&#39; of payments overseas. I think that it must be admitted by all that the tariff also protects wages and labour conditions against the competition of low-wage countries; that it ensures greater stability in protection by promot ing industries that are not at the mercy of the seasons; and that it reduces dependence on the vagaries of foreign markets in normal times, especially in relation to staple products such as wool, butter and meat. I believe that the impact of the economic depression would have been felt to a much greater extent in Australia had it not been for the existence of secondary industries in this country. The further we develop those secondary industries, the less we shall feel the impact of any future economic depression. Professor Copland, of the Melbourne University, in his book <inline font-style="italic">Australia To-day,</inline> expressed himself in the following  terms  - </para>
          <para>There is a belief that primary production is more important to a country than manufacturing. This is a mistaken view, and it has led to much misunderstanding concerning the contribution made by manufacturing industries to the national income and the economic prosperity of the country. </para>
          <para>Another distinguished economist, in the person of Professor Giblin, wrote as follows in his book <inline font-style="italic">Australia 1930 -</inline></para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is to be expected that our future development in Australia must be chiefly by secondary industries. If we cannot succeed in efficient secondary industry, then our growth will be very small and fitful. If an attempt is made at present to extend in primary industries at the expense of secondary industries, it will bc to knock our heads against a brick wall. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Professor Giblin has never been noted in this country for being a high protectionist. </para>
          <para>Let us consider the growth of employment in the primary and secondary industries. It will be found that in 1919 there were 440,000 persons engaged in the farming, dairying and pastoral industries, and 323,000 in the manufacturing industries. Ten years later, in 1929, the numbers were 419,000 in the primary industries, and 450,000 in the secondary industries, a decrease of 25,000 in the primary industries and an increase of 127,000 in the secondary industries. Take the figures for 1937, the latest for which statistics are available. They show that 449,000 persons were then engaged in the farming, dairying and pastoral industries, and 493,000 in the manufacturing industries - 44,000 more in the secondary industries than in the farming, dairying and pastoral industries. The falling off of employment in primary production from 1919 to 1929 was due in large measure to laboursaving machinery in the wheat industry and other primary industries. No doubt labour-saving machinery has been installed also from time to time in our factories, but for which the increased volume of employment which the secondary industries provide would have been very much greater than it has been. </para>
          <para>I believe that we have reached the stage in connexion with our tariff policy where, to a great extent, the economic future of Australia lies in the balance. Australia to-day is at the cross roads. Many manufacturers say they would embark on further development hut for the uncertainty of the future. The  Hon.  F. P. Kneeshaw, M.L.C., ex-President of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, speaking in Sydney on the 17th August, 1937, at the annual conference of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures, had this to say - </para>

So much for the contention of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White),</inline> and other representatives of the Government, that the increase of employment in the factories of Australia has been due to the present Government&#39;s policy of reducing duties. In the aggregate, this Government has reduced duties on approximately 2,000 items and subitems of the tariff. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Another aspect of this Government&#39;s tariff policy is revealed in the obnoxious clauses of the Ottawa Agreement, the subjugation of the parliamentary control of our fiscal policy to the Tariff Board, trade diversion, and the like, which have left manufacturers in a state of uncertainty as to the future, and have inflicted tremendous losses on a large number of our primary producers, notably the woolgrowers of Australia. In the opposite direction lies Australia&#39;s safety. First,  the  deletion of clauses 9 to 13 of the Ottawa Agreement; secondly, Parliament to have complete, power in dealing with tariff matters, and not to hand over its powers to a Tariff Board created by Parliament. In the opinion of honorable members who sit on this side of the House, the Tariff Board should revert to the position of- an advisory committee. Thirdly, there should be recognition of Australia&#39;s right to develop fully its secondary industries by means of effective tariff protection, so as to enable those manufacturers who are prepared to invest their capital in Australia to produce goods that were formerly imported, observing Australian standards of wages and conditions of employment without fear of losing the whole of their investment due to a withdrawal of the tariff protection, and without a feeling of insecurity as to the future. That feeling of insecurity in regard to the continuity of a tariff policy renders it impracticable for many of the major secondary industries of Australia to develop to-day. The claim of the Government that the secondary industries have flourished and not suffered, and that employment in factories has increased as the result of reductions of duties, is so much political balderdash that would not convince even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie.</inline> Industries have progressed in this country, not on acount of any of the reductions of duty made by  the Government but despite them and mostly on account of the improvement of world conditions generally. How can the Government say that reductions of the tariff will not adversely affect secondary industries, when the whole purpose of such reductions is to allow goods produced outside of Australia to enter this country and thereby diminish the sales of Australian goods ? </para>
          <para>Articles 9 to 13 of the Ottawa Agreement were specifically designed to allow British manufacturers to capture portion of the Australian trade, and. that they have done so is shown by the huge increase of Australian imports from Great Britain during the last six years. I do not blame the Tariff Board for the inquisitorial nature of the inquiries it has conducted into a number of Australian industries, for, undoubtedly, the Ottawa Agreement cut right across the protectionist policy of this country. We were, in fact, asked to review the degree of protection that  was  being accorded to a number of our industries. Certain articles of the Ottawa Agreement definitely stated that overseas manufacturers must be given equal opportunity with Australian manufacturers to compete for the Australian trade, and the Tariff Board had no option but to recommend reductions of duties to make this possible. </para>
          <para>Australian imports from Great Britain in 1931-32 were valued at &#163;17,400,000. By 3936-37, the value of them had increased by about &#163;21,000,000 to &#163;38,500,000. That shows a &#39; marked increase. The Government has announced that, since the ratification of the Ottawa Agreement, duties have been reduced on 1,200 items under the British preferential tariff and on 687 items under the general tariff, making a total of 1,8S7 reductions. Nothing in the Government&#39;s fiscal polley gives ns any guarantee that effective protection will be accorded to our industries in the future. .Just nt present, British manufacturers fire not fighting for our trade as hard as they were doing some little time ago. This is undoubtedly because they arc more busily engaged than formerly in fulfilling orders placed with them by the British Government for defence equipment. The great rush to construct armaments has kept the factories of Great Britain fully engaged, and they have not been able to sharpen their pencils, as it were, and get busy in an endeavour to secure a greater proportion of Australian trade. This, however, is probably a temporary circumstance. When the already-placed orders for defence equipment have been fulfilled, no doubt the British manufacturers will again turn to Australia and seek to gain a stronger footing on our market. This will, obviously, be to the detriment of our industries. It will then be realized how subversive to our own interests the Government&#39;s fiscal policy really is. It will be found then, that many Australian industries, which so far have been able to retain the major portion of our home market, are actually vulnerable to attack by overseas manufacturers. The Queensland Chamber of Manufacturers voiced this fear last year when, according to a report published in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> of the 25th April, it eta tedWhen there is a cessation of the intense concentration of  Armament  production which has prevented the export of many types of manufacture!) to Australia, many of our industries will, owing to the reduced tariff, be placed in a parlous position. </para>
          <para>The undesirable effect of the huge increase of imports that has occurred in the last six years cannot be viewed with equanimity. Even under existing conditions, the expansion of a number of major industries in Australia has been seriously limited because of uncertainty of the future. On the one hand, the Government asks the people of Australia, and also people abroad, to invest their money in local industries, but, on the other hand, it declines to assure such industries of adequate protection on the Australian market. If investors were assured that no drastic change would be made in our fiscal policy, and if manufacturers were confident that no dislocating variations of our protective duties would be made, progress in both the primary and secondary industries of Australia would hp greatly accelerated. </para>
          <para>Early this year a Sydney manufacturer stated that if our protective du tic*&#34; were stabilized for five years, many new industries would be established in Australia. It is common knowledge that many manufacturers are unwilling to extend their operations because the Government&#39;s policy obliges thom to observe a policy of caution. Tariff stability is, therefore, an urgent necessity. The national interests demand nothing less than this, but tariff stability can never be accomplished as long as Parliament is denied complete control of the tariff, and the iniquitous Articles 9 to 13 of the Ottawa Agreement remain in force to make it impossible for Parliament to increase duties until recommended to do so by the Tariff Board, which is. itself, a creation of the Parliament. </para>

          <para>The Prime Minister, who had formerly heaped sarcasm and ridicule on the Country party and its tariff policy, afterwards took some of the members of that party into the composite ministry, and is it any wonder that to-day there is a feeling of anxiety and apprehension among the manufacturers of Australia as to how far they will be able to trust a Government made up of low tariffists, and even avowed freetraders, like the Assistant Minister for Commerce, who because of his low tariff tendencies was taken to the bosom of the right honorable member for Cowper? I appeal to those representatives of the Country party who decry the protection of secondary industries, to realize that Australia does a great deal to protect the primary industries also. For the five years 1931-1932 to 1936-1937, Commonwealth provision from revenue and loan for relief and other forms of assistance to primary producers amounted to &#163;19,000,000, to which must be added &#163;12,000,000 which will be allocated, we are told, for the adjustment of rural debts; these two amounts total &#163;31,000,000. Then there is the community&#39;s contribution in added domestic prices through the operation of price stabilization schemes, such as those applying to butter, dried fruits and sugar; this contribution, according to the Prime Minister, when speaking at the Sydney Show of 1936, amounted to approximately &#163;5,500,000 a year or &#163;33,000,000 for the six years. I do not criticize assistance to Australian primary producers to secure home-consumption prices for their products, based on cost of production, and intended to assure a reasonable return on capital invested and the labour employed. The Labour party stands for that, but I do deprecate the one-eyed outlook of the freetrader who claims a home consumption price for what he sells on the Australian market, and, at the same time, wants to buy his goods iii the cheapest markets of the world, as was demanded by the Assistant Minister for Commerce in 1931. </para>
          <para>We find that exchange benefits to the exporters of primary produce for the five years, 1932-33 to 1936-37, amounted to, for butter, &#163;8,700,000; for wool, &#163;39,900,000; and for wheat, &#163;.14,300,000. In five years, therefore, currency depreciation gave butter, wool and wheat nearly &#163;63,000,000 greater value in Australian currency than would have been its value expressed in sterling. This applies to all exports to-day. Against this, we find that the extra cost to Australian governments as the result of adverse exchange rates for the seven  years  1930-31 to 1936-37, amounted to no less than &#163;42,500,000. These figures speak volumes; they show clearly that tlie Australian public has contributed generously to the assistance of our primary industries. This record should be borne in mind by those who are continually protesting against what they term excess costs owing to adequate protection being afforded to secondary industries. </para>
          <para>I wish now to say a few words in regard to the Ottawa Agreement. In a speech last year, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> referred to the increased sales of our primary products since the signing of that, agreement. To a very great extent, these increased sales to the United Kingdom have ref tilted, not from the Ottawa Agreement, but from improved economic conditions throughout the world, and from the great revival of industry in Great Britain, which has enabled it to increase  its imports of primary products from all countries. Speaking in the Senate on the 29th April, 3936, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> very clearly set out his views in regard to this when he said - </para>

              <para>- Definitely no; all I know is that he is a nationalist senator and the father-in-law of the AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> In 1932, Australia exported 24,100,000 bushels of wheat to the United Kingdom, representing 22.8 per cent, of Great Britain&#39;s total, imports of wheat; in 1937, it exported. 22,400,000 bushels, representing 23.1 per cent, of Great Britain&#39;s imports. In 1935, Australia&#39;s exports of wheat to. Great Britain dropped to 17,600,000&#39; bushels, or 17.5 per cent, of Great Britain&#39;s total imports, whereas Great Britain increased its imports from foreign countries from 34,600,000 bushels, in 1932, or 32.S per cent, of its total imports, to 45,900,000 bushels in 1935, representing 45.9 per cent, of its total imports. Yet wheat was one of the items included in the Ottawa Agreement. In 1932, Great Britain&#39;s purchases of butter from Australia amounted to 1,790,000&#39; cwt, or 21.5 per cent, of a total of 8,300,000 cwt. In 1937, its imports from Australia amounted to 1,490,000 cwt., or 15.8 per cent, of a total of 9,400,000 cwt. Thus, imports from Australia decreased by 300,000 cwt., or 5.7 per cent, of Great Britain&#39;s total imports. These figures show that, although Great Britain&#39;s purchases of butter have increased, both the quantity of imports from Australia and their percentage to total imports have decreased considerably. The same may be said in regard to barley. Let it be clearly understood that I fully realize the importance of the British market to Australia, just as I realize the advantage of reciprocal trade within the British Commonwealth of Nations, with due regard to the necessity for developing our own secondary industries. The Ottawa Agreement has not been wholly responsible for the increase of exports from Australia, and is no excuse for retaining those obnoxious clauses 9 to 13, which jeopardize our secondary industries, or for preventing Parliament from adopting its proper role of sole arbiter of tariff matters. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Leave to continue given.&#93;</inline> The <inline font-style="italic">Oversea Trade Bulletin</inline> for 1937 shows that last year Great Britain took 4S.79 per cent, of Australia&#39;s exports, as compared with 56.26 per cent, two years earlier, while exports to the remainder of the Empire were 10.61 per cent. of the total, as compared with 9.78 per cent. two years ago. Thus, the Empire market in the last two years has declined from 66.04 per cent. to 59.4 per cent. of Australia&#39;s total overseas markets. The figures in regard to wine show that in 1937 Great Britain obtained 19.7 per cent. of its imports from Australia, whereas for 1932 24.4 per cent. of its total imports were from Australia. </para>

          <para>When the Government introduced its trade diversion policy in 1936 Ministers claimed to be acting courageously. They regarded it as a first step of a considered policy to place our overseas finances on a sound and enduring basis. We were told that it would completely restore confidence in Australia in theminds of investors overseas, with the result that this country would experience no difficulty in obtaining all its loan requirements. We are accustomed to such well-rounded phrases from the Government,but in due course most of them prove to have been meaningless. So sound is our position overseas to-day that 66 per cent of the &#163;7,000,000 loan floated in Loudon recently bus been left with the underwriters. Moreover, a large amount of the funds held in London will have to be made available to meet our commitments there, since the trade balance for the last ten months is only &#163;11,600,000 in our favour, whereas &#163;28,000,000 is needed to meet interest and other loan charges. Now, after much damage has been done to Australian primary industries, the Government has been forced to accept the view expressed by members onthis side of the House when the trade diversion policy was inaugurated. I direct the attention of honorable members to the following statement in the &#34;Brown Book&#34; entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Record of the Lyons Government,</inline> which was issued by the Government during the last election campaign </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline>in his book gives further currency to the untruth that because of the absence of the Japanese wool buyers from the sales in the latter half of last year the Australian grower lost millions. </para>
          <para>The statement continued - </para>
          <para>The charge that the Australian wool industry suffered great losses because of the dispute has no support from any informed quarter. </para>
          <para>That is a sample of the propaganda issued by the Government. In reply to it, I shall quote, first, some remarks by the  President  of the Graziers Association of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> P. Abbott, who, in an address which was broadcast in June, 1936, said - </para>
          <para>If Japan, because of Australia&#39;s new tariff, reduced her purchase of Australian wool by 50 per cent. it would mean a loss of &#163;6,000,000 a year to Australia. </para>
          <para class="block">There was widespread indignation among the graziers of Australia at the blundering associated with the trade diversion policy and the methods and procedure adopted in bringing it into operation. Australia lost Japan s wool trade and has not completely recaptured it. In order to show how adversely the Government&#39;s proposals affected Australia&#39;s trade with Japan. 1 point out that whereas exports from Australia to Japan for the year ended June, 1936, were valued at &#163;17,600,000 in Australian currency, their value fell to &#163;539,000 in the six months June to December, 1936. For the corresponding six months of the previous year they were valued at &#163;8,000,000. The significance of those figures was explained in theRockhampton <inline font-style="italic">Morning Bulletin</inline> of the 28th September, 1936 - </para>
          <para>To anyone not interested in the pastoral industry these figures may not convey very much, but to each grower they are often the difference between progress and retrogression, and to Australia with its wool clip of about 3,000,000bales it signifies a loss of &#163;7,500.000. </para>
          <para>Honorable members who have studied this subject know that when the dispute with Japan was eventually settled, that country was able to restrict its imports of wool from Australia to such an extent that reliable wool brokers estimate that Australian wool-growers lost &#163;5,000,000 per an num. </para>
          <para>I shall not trespass further on the generosity of the committee, but in conclusion I express the hope that the Government will endeavour to pursue a consistent protectionist policy for Australia, and will not allow itself to be influenced by importing and free-trade interests. I realize that a Cabinet which includes hardened freetraders like the Assistant Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> must often find itself on the horns of a dilemma. How can we expect adequate protection to be given to Australian industries by a government comprising freetraders and low tariffists as well as men who would in one fell swoop reduce the Australian tariff to the level at which it stood between 3921 and 1928. Other Government supporters claim to be reasonable protectionists. They profess to stand for scientific protection, but the policy which they really advocate is one which will permit goods to be imported from other countries in competition with well-managed and scientifically conducted Australian factories to the detriment of the 50,000 boys and girls who leave Australian schools every year and seek employment, some of them unsuccessfully. If those young people are to be absorbed in. industry, as they have a right to expect, their opportunity will be provided principally by secondary industries. Eventually, the Government had to abandon its trade diversion policy, which resulted in the loss of millions of pounds to the primary producers of Australia, because of the chaos that it created. I now ask the Government to exclude from any future agreement which it may make the iniquitous sections 9 to 13 of the Ottawa Agreement, so that the Tariff Board may be placed in its rightful position as an advisor to this Parliament, instead of being, as it now is, superior to this Parliament in the fixing of tariff duties. The future development of Australia, and the growth of its population depend on the scientific development of our primary and secondary industries side by side. </para>

            <para>.- I was glad to hear the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> stress the need for a reasonable and scientific tariff. Such a pronouncement from him is, in the light of his record as Minister for Trade and Customs, highly amusing. The Tariff Board Act provides that the Minister may not impose duties until after the receipt of a report by the Tariff Board, but various governments have acted in defiance of that legislation. The most flagrant disregard of the enactment was the action of the Scullin Government in increasing the duties on- numbers of articles by 100 per cent., and, in some instances, by even 300 per cent. </para>

              <para>- I am merely relating facts, but if our finances were in danger through excess of imports, that problem should have been dealt with by raising the exchange. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline> It would appear that the one aim of the Scullin Government was to honour a pledge given to manufacturers prior to the elections, that the Labour party would impose prohibitive duties if it were placed in power. Unfortunately, that Government was not alone in disregarding the provisions of the Tariff Board Act. I agree with the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition that the trade diversion policy of the present Government was unwise. It is remarkable that the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett.)</inline> who so vigorously denounced such a policy when in opposition should have been its protagonist when a change of-government took place. In adition to causing losses to Australian producers, that policy caused strained relations with other countries. </para>

          <para>I do not desire to discuss at length the relative merits of freetrade and protection, but honorable members who would understand them would do well to study Coghlan&#39;s statistics for the years prior to federation. It will be remembered that whereas Victoria had a heavy protective tariff, New South Wales followed a freetrade policy. I well remember reading in 1890, reports of public meetings convened to discuss the prevalence of sweating in Victorian factories and of most degrading destitution among the workers of that State under the policy of protection in operation there. Between 1886 and 1900, under a policy of freetrade. manufacturing industries in New South Wales made greater progress and employed more persons than did similar industries in protectionist Victoria in 1900. Moreover, the conditions of employment in Now South Wales were superior. </para>
          <para>In view of the conditions existing throughout, the world to-day it would be most impolitic to adopt a policy of freetrade, even if it were possible to do so. We must have regard to the injury which such a policy would do to existing industries, some of which should not have been established in this country. I well  remember that the general manager of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited said publicly in 1913, that his company desired no protective duties, bounties, or other form of assistance from governments. He said that if the company could not compete with the rest of the world without a duty it would not commence the production of steel. Possessing as it does a huge coal deposit adjacent to its smelting plant, and perhaps the largest deposit of iron ore in the world, it should, even allowing for different industrial conditions, be able to compete successfully with overseas manufacturers without the assistance of high duties. From 1920 onwards there has been an almost continuous demand by manufacturers for increased duties on certain products which form the raw material of other manufacturers, and this has resulted in the cost of commodities being increased to an alarming extent. I hardly like to imagine that conditions in Australia are as bad as they are in the United States of America; but it is interesting to note that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Page, who for many years was the  Chairman  of the Tariff Board in that country, stated - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Lying campaign contributions, expensive and misleading propaganda, costly and expert lobbying, astute distortion of evidence and consideration enjoyed by men in control of government affairs are among the means at the disposal of &#34; big business &#34; for securing duties needlessly high. And the power to divert the effects of the law is as important as the power to make it. The more monopolistic a business may be, the more completely is it able to dictate the prices the consumer must pay and producers must receive for the raw material. This obvious advantage explains why the United States tariff has been called tho mother of trusts. </para>
            <para class="block">We know that such things are done. I recall receiving a letter from a Melbourne manufacturer of nails and barbed wire who was compelled to purchase his raw materials from Lysaght Limited or Bylands Limited, who complained that the suppliers were dumping these goods at a price below cost; hp. added that they insisted upon doing that unless he would undertake to refrain from selling his goods in New South Wales and Queensland and raise his prices by &#163;6 a ton. When I brought the complaint to the notice of the Minister for Trade and </para>
            <para class="block">Customs, who referred the matter to the Tariff Board, I was informed that he had withdrawn this charge of restraint of trade from the Tariff Board as the complainant had withdrawn his charges from the manufacturers of the rods. I have in my possession a printed price list supplied by those two firms, showing that they fix not only the wholesale prices but also the retail prices of fencing wire and wire netting. Some time ago I showed that the prices of wire netting, barbed wire and fencing wire in South Africa were. 33 per cent, lower than in Australia because of the duties imposed here. Undoubtedly a cartel in Australia is operating to the detriment of the users of these and other commodities. I also received a letter from a Belgian manufacturer to the effect that he could not quote for wire netting and other similar goods because the Australian trade had already been apportioned. It is worthy of note that Lord Dudley is now in the United States of America urging the iron and steel industries of that country to join in the British and continental cartel. There may be monopolies that by efficient organization can keep down prices and so benefit the community, but that is not the policy of those concerned in the manufacture of the goods I have mentioned. We know perfectly well that the international situation is unsettled and that trade barriers lead to unfriendly relations and eventually may cause major disputes. In these circumstances we naturally ask why unnecessary restrictions should be placed upon trade. Although the trade diversion policy introduced some time ago must have cost this country millions of pounds, which was borne wholly by our export pro&#39;ducers, the manufacturers did not lose. Under our present policy we are asking the primary producers of Australia to provide sufficient funds in London to enable manufacturers to purchase their raw materials on favorable terms. Fully 33 per cent, of our imports are admitted duty free under licence. We are so surrounded with tariffs, cartels and secret agreements that production costs are enormously increased and the primary producers who have to take the risk and responsibility of producing tlie nation&#39;s wealth are the greatest sufferers. Even before the adoption of the Ottawa Agreement preference was given to Great Britain. I believe in giving preference to British goods, but not to the extent of practically imposing an embargo against foreign goods. In pre-war days, because of the immense area of the British Empire, or because of the fact that it contained one-fourth of the. people of the world, there were few complaints; also trade was reasonably free and there were few difficulties in obtaining the essential raw materials. &#34;With a moderate British preference of 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, and a duty of 25 per cent, to 30 per cent, on foreign goods, trade should, flow freely without detriment to Australian manufacturers or offence to foreign countries. Wire netting of British manufacture is admitted duty free, but a duty of &#163;10 a ton is imposed on imports from foreign countries. It appears that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company is now acting in conjunction with overseas steel interests because, whereas formerly New &#39;Zealand purchasers were getting supplies at the same rate of discount as users in South Africa, now, owing to some secret arrangement, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company is able to get the New Zealand trade against foreign competition. .Some years ago when prices of barbed wire in Australia were high, imports were being received from New York at a cost of &#163;12 a ton whereupon a duty of &#163;9 a ton was imposed to  enable  the Australasian makers to exploit the farmer. Is it fair to impose unnecessarily high duties on barbed wire, fencing wire and wire netting - commodities which are so essential to those who are developing our outback country. Moreover, the duty on rails imported from Great Britain is 45s. a ton, whereas on foreign importations it is 125s. a ton. The duty on fencing wire imported from Great Britain is 52s. a ton, and on foreign importations &#163;6 a ton. Unnecessarily high duties nor only interfere with trade, but also create resentment in other countries; such provocation should be avoided, particularly when efforts are being made to promote a better understanding between nations. Under the protectionist policy adopted shortly after the inception of federation, industries were established on a sound basis, and prior to 1920, complaints were not made by those engaged in agricultural pursuits or any other sections of the community. There were, of course, a few persons who were imbued with the idea that freetrade was essential for the development of the country, whilst another section was equally insistent on the merits of high protection. The reports of the Inter-State Commission show that that body favoured the imposition of moderate duties, under which, it was contended, it would be possible to build up industries on an economic basis. But after 1920 a section of the community became imbued with the idea that in consequence of the war and its effects upon the community heavier duties should be imposed in order to assist Australian industries. The Bruce-Page Government, with the assistance of some members of the Country party, continued to increase duties, but the <inline font-style="italic">debacle</inline> took place when the Labour party came into power and introduced those prohibitive duties which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition described to-day as &#34; reasonable and scientific protection.&#34; The Labour party&#39;s tariff schedules were prepared without reference to the Tariff Board or head officials of the Customs Department. </para>

              <para>- I cannot believe that the officials of that department recommended the imposition of duties ranging from 100 per cent, to 300 per cent, upon clothing. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will refer to the report of the commission appointed by the Bruce-Page Government, to inquire into the incidence of the Australian tariff, he will find that the duties imposed in respect of clothing, prior to the increases imposed by the Labour party, were &#163;600,000 higher than the salaries and wages paid in the clothing industry. In the rubber industry salaries and wages -amounted to &#163;1,300,000. whereas duties, had the goods beer imported, would have amounted to &#163;2,100,000. </para>

          <para>Little should be done in tariff making to give offence to other countries. A great deal of the trouble that threatens the world to-day is due to economic nationalism, which has resulted in countries not being able to find markets for their goods. Recently, the Executive made regulations to restrict migration to Australia from certain foreign countries. Italy and Germany have ever-increasing populations, and the result of our policyis that not only do we not allow the people of those countries entry into this country, which has an area equal to that of the United States of America and supports about 7,000,000 people instead of the 20,000,000 or 30,000,000 that it could support, but, also, by putting tremendous imposts on their goods, we refuse to trade with them. What must be the natural result of such a policy? The publication from which I have already quoted says - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Nations, like men. need a fair share of the earth&#39;s natural resources. It is the better part of wisdom if these resources are held readily available through the peaceful channels of trade. All nations find themselves in need of natural  elements  they do not themselves possess, and in need similarly of markets for their own industrial or agricultural output. If we could see <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> general adjustment of excessive barriers that shut off materials and markets from peaceful acquisition to-day, the imminent danger which confronts the world would be materially lessened, for the right to buy and Bell freely is a right that all nations would welcome, and there is not one among them that would not choose this peaceful method of raising their living standards to the suicidal method of attempted conquest. </para>
            <para>The nations of the world will not fight for the things they need if they can get these things through the peaceful pursuit of trade. If the legitimate channels of commerce remain reasonably open to them, we can hope that the world&#39;s merchants will remain merchants, and  not,  perforce, become privateers. But let  these  channels be closed, let man be denied the fruits of plenty by a policy of isolationism at home or abroad and he will turn to force in the last desperate attempt to achieve his end. </para>

          <para class="block">That principle applies to-day. We should be ever so much more careful in our relations with other countries than we have been. The tariff restrictions that were imposed in 1935 not only did grave injury to our own producers, but also imperilled our relations with other countries by creating irritation, jealousy and resentment. I have previously drawn the attention of the committee to the statement made by the  chairman  of the Tariff Commission in the United States of of America, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page,</inline> that raising the tariff wall leads to all sorts of corrupt practices. By restrictive quotas and ministerial patronage, we have opened the door wide for similar practices. In 1935, we imposed what was virtually an embargo against the importation of foreign motor chassis. I do not blame the Minister himself for what followed - after all, the Government must take responsibility for policy - but the result has been that officials of the Customs Department fix the quota for the different importers for each year on the basis of the importations of the previous year. The developments that are taking place in the motor car industry make this the wrong basts for assessing requirements. I have received letters from importers who desire to import larger consignments of motor chassis than they imported last year, when they did very little trade. In many instances, the smaller trade that they did last year was due to the fact that they were preparing for a campaign this year. The quota operates to prevent them from importing larger numbers., whereas other firms who were operating at full strength last year are not hampered in any way. That is not fair trading, and it is .bound to create an unfortunate impression overseas. I do not expect much from the Government at the present time, but I believe that, in the very near future, it will find how essential it is that all countries should come together and endeavour to promote peaceful trade. </para>
          <para>Another aspect of the existing tariff policy is the disadvantage that it imposes upon Western Australia. The home market in that State is very small, but the farmers have to accept world prices for their goods; on the other hand, for their purchases, they have to pay not only the prices fixed by the manufacturers in Victoria and New South Wales, but also freights,&#39; which are equal to the freight charges on goods carried to the State from Great Britain or the United States of America. That is a scandal. Some years ago, I had a return prepared which showed that the cost of developing a 1,000 acre farm in 1913 was &#163;2,600 as against &#163;4,400 in 1930-31. The tremendous increase is due to the continual growth of the cost of wages, materials, and the like, as the result of the protectionist policy which has built up in the eastern States wonderful cities - of which we are proud - at the expense of the agricultural communities in the other States. In order to give to Western Australia a chance to develop its huge area and to obviate the complaints that are continually voiced to-day, its people should be able to import their requirements on a low tariff basis. I want to see that great State developed and the people who go upon the land have some chance of making good. With the low returns and big costs, they have been in difficulties for a number of years, and every addition to their costs magnifies their troubles. The high tariff policy of the Australian Labour party contrasts with the policy of the Labour party in the United Kingdom, where Labour men are out and out free traders. </para>

            <para>.- Unlike the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> who is an out and out free trader, I believe in protecting local industry. During the last two years this Government has made a terrible hash of the tariff. There is no question that the trade diversion policy hampered industry in every city of the Commonwealth. As an example of that I cite a Sydney firm, of motor car importers. The quota was based on the firm&#39;s imports during a period of depression; and is so low to-day that the business can hardly be carried on. The firm handles particularly the Packard car; this is a highly priced product, and was not much in demand during the depression, but following the economic recovery, the demand for it to-day is much greater than can be supplied within the restricted quota. The Labour party is in favour of protecting Australian industries, particularly those that produce their goods under favorable conditions. I had an opportunity of inspecting the Ford factory in Geelong last year, and the organization for the manufacture and assembly of cars was a revelation to me. After witnessing the speeding-up method that that factory employs I hope that it will be the last factory of its kind to be established in Australia. I was struck by the fact that there were scarcely any men of more than 40 years of age at work. When speaking to the manager in his office later I mentioned this matter to him, and asked him the reason. He replied &#34;We do not keep them.&#34; They are put on the scrap heap and left to depend on the invalid and old-age pension. </para>

              <para>- I inspected the factory a week after the honorable member did, and the manager told me that members of the Country party who had inspected it had been quite satisfied. More than 4,000 men are employed in that factory, but one can scarcely find one who is more than 40 years of age. The speeding-up methods employed by some of the American firms engaged in the manufacture and assembly of motor car bodies should not be allowed in Australia. I mention this matter so that honorable members may take an opportunity to inspect the factory and ascertain for themselves the truth of what I have said. </para>

          <para>When the Government imposed a quota on American cars we were informed by the then Minister in charge of trade treaties <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett)</inline> that motor cars would be manufactured in Australia within six months. That was from twelve to eighteen months ago; so far not one car has been manufactured in Australia, and I do not think that the Government ever intended to give encouragement to that industry. When statements are made in this Parliament by responsible Ministers they should not be made with the object of misleading honorable members into casting a vote that may do great damage to Australia. When I first entered this Parliament, I believed a Minister&#39;s statement could be relied upon, but my faith has been shattered by the misleading statement that the manufacture of motor cars in this country would take place within six months, whereas there was really no expectation of any such development. </para>
          <para>I remind the honorable member for Swan that the Labour party in Great. Britain and the Labour party in Australia are faced with different circumstances. I do not know what the tariff policy of the Labour party in the British Parliament is, and I am not concerned with it, but I am concerned with the policy of the Australian Labour party, which, I am satisfied, is the only policy from which the manufacturers of this country and the people generally can expect any benefit. I have listened to the honorable member for Swan speaking in this House on numerous occasions, and it is evident that if only the farmers in Western Australia could obtain their supplies from overseas at a cheap rate, he would be content. The provision of employment for Australians does not concern him. He is quite prepared to accept goods from Japan or Czechoslovakia, so long as they are cheap. During the last four or five years every city in Australia has been swamped with cheap Japanese goods. Recently, there were displayed in the library of this &#34;building, samples of real and imitation jewellery produced by Australian manufacturers, but under a trade treaty with Czechoslovakia this market is being flooded with cheap jewellery from that country. I am convinced that the Government, by its tariff policy, has done irreparable damage to the secondary industries of Australia. When tariff schedules come before this committee for debate, I should like them to be discussed in a non-party spirit. Honorable members should be actuated by a desire to encourage Australian industries, particularly those that produce goods under reasonable conditions, and that do not take excessive profits from the public. </para>

            <para>.- When the trade diversion policy was instituted in 1935, various firms were allotted import quotas based upon the volume of their business during the preceding twelve months. It was, of course, necessary to fix quotas upon some basis, but there was no particular virtue in the dates chosen, and no reason why the quotas should be regarded as. fixed and unalterable, instead of being adjustable according to circumstances, and in accordance with reasonable business expansion. As it has turned out, some motor companies were given quotas in excess of what they have needed, while others were allotted quotas unreasonably low, due usually to the fact that they were only building up their businesses during the twelve months prior to the inauguration of the trade diversion policy. The firm which holds the agency for the Packard car is a notable example of this. I have on previous occasions brought this matter under the notice of the department, but I have always been informed that the department cannot depart from the original arrangement. I have never heard any reason why it should not adopt a more flexible arrangement that would be fairer to the various competitors in the trade. For that reason, I support representations of the honorable  member  for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mulcahy)</inline> on this subject. </para>

          <para>Every tariff schedule that has been introduced for general discussion has brought forth a complaint from the Opposition that the tariff policy of this </para>
          <para class="block">Government is resulting in the destruction of Australian industries. It is such ;in old complaint that we have now  become  quite accustomed to it. Thu  obvious  answer is that Australian industries were never more prosperous than they are to-day, so it is quite evident that the tariff is not doing them any harm. </para>
          <para>I wish to refer to one item in the schedule introduced on the 4th May, namely, that referring to minor explosives, particularly cartridges. Numerous complaints have reached me from various quarters that Imperial Chemical Industries Limited, which enjoys a monopoly of the manufacture of such goods in Australia, is using its monopoly unfairly, and in a manner that should be checked either by the Minister for Trade and Customs or the Tariff Board. In order to establish an Australian industry for the manufacture of cartridges for shot guns and rifles, a high duty was imposed on imported cartridges. I agree that it wu3 desirable that the industry should be established here, . but it is now almost exclusively in the hands of Imperial Chemical Industries Limited, which is not giving good service. At the commencement of ite manufacturing in Australia the company produced goods of very inferior quality, and it has not given proper service to retailers of ammunition. Moreover, it has used the big stick against any retailers who attempt to import ammunition from other countries. There have been complaints that retailers were unable to obtain supplies from Imperial Chemicals Limited, and that the prices were very high. However, I shall lon ve prices out of it. Retailers wore unable to import from the United States of America because of the embargo against such importations and this practically completed the monopoly of the company operating in Australia. Some retailers, however, placed orders elsewhere, and I am informed that an executive of the company, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poole,</inline> told them that they had no right to place orders overseas. He threatened them that if they placed any more orders abroad, he would cut them off the company&#39;s list, and they would not get any further supplies. One man stated that he would appeal to the Government, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poole</inline> is alleged to have replied : &#34; We are too powerful; your appeal would have no chance.&#34; That sort of thing should not be tolerated. If a company is given a virtual monopoly, as this one has been, it should not be allowed to take advantage of it in order to exploit the public. The Government should step in to see that justice is done. There is no complaint, I understand, about the quality of shot gun cartridges, but what are described as metallic cartridges, namely, those used for rifles, were simply rub: bish, and the public would not buy them. Lately, the company has been producing rifle cartridges of better quality, but it refuses to release them until the supplies of old cartridges have been used. </para>
          <para>The company also manufactures clay birds used by sporting men in shot gun competitions. I think we all agree that, if men must shoot for amusement, it i3 better that they should waste ammunition on clay birds than on live birds kept in captivity. The complaint is that the company is keeping the price of clay birds practically up to the level at which they could be imported. The protection against imported clay birds amounts altogether to 135 per cent., and the company charges for its locally manufactured birds a price which is only ten per cent. less. The result is that not many are being bought. This is another instance of what occurs when high duties result in the establishment of monopolies. The Government should, while giving effective protection to Australian industries, establish a body of some kind with power to police the operation of the tariff. I regard tariff duties as an award to an industry. It is the duty of the Government, which is responsible for the imposition of tariffs for the protection of Australian industries, to see that the people are treated fairly. In my opinion, this duty might very well be delegated to the Tariff Board. </para>

              <para>- The Tariff Board is in possession of all the information upon which the protection of particular item? is based. If its staff we re augmented by the appointment of investigation officers, any complaints of unfair treatment could be examined, the officials could inspect factories and ascertain the true position, and report to the Tariff Board, which in turn would submit its recommendations to the Minister, who could take the necessary parliamentary action. I see no obstacle to the Tariff Board carrying out this duty if the Government would invest that body with the requisite authority to police the tariff awards. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Swan has complained that our primary producers have suffered disabilities from the pro- tection given to secondary industries. I am afraid that he, and others who share his views, overlook the fact that but for the protection given to secondary production the Australian market for primary products would be invaded, if not in some instances captured, by manufacturers in cheap-labour countries, and the defeat of the Australian manufacturer would at once react to the detriment of Australian primary producers. I agree that the honorable member is, in tariff matters, consistent, although his arguments have become somewhat weather-worn. It is as well that we should emphasize the value to primary producers of the Australian market, which was created and is maintained by our system of protection. The dairying industry may be cited as a case in point. The measure of protection given to that industry has enabled those engaged in it, by organization, to obtain a remunerative price for the whole of the butter sold in Australia, and to dispose of the balance in London in competition with other countries whose costs of production are much lower than those in Australia. It should be obvious to all honorable members that the more we increase secondary production in Australia, and the greater opportunities we provide for the employment of Australian workmen at remunerative wages, the better it is for our primary producers. </para>

              <para>- It is true that General Motors-Holden&#39;s has made substantial profits during the last three years. If, in the opinion of Parliament, the profits of any industry are the result of exorbitant charges, it is competent for Parliament to ascertain if Australian users are obtaining value for their money, and, if necessary, review the protective duties. It may be found, after investigation of some industries, that it should be possible for a better product to be manufactured for the price charged. This might be said of the motor-body building industry, and particularly regarding one firm. It might be suggested that it should supply a commodity nearer in quality and price to the competitive products from overseas. </para>

          <para>The honorable member for Swan stated further that we were living in a fool&#39;s paradise because we were not encouraging foreign countries to trade with us. Is it necessary to remind him that any foreign country which desires to build up its manufacturing industries by the purchase of wool or any other commodity is free to trade with Australia? The Commonwealth Government has, from time to time, sent trade delegations to many countries in an endeavour to conclude mutually advantageous trade agreements. Some of these delegations have been successful. The Government is now endeavouring to conclude a trade agreement with the United States of America. </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Swan also complained about the system recently introduced of rationing the importation of motor cars. He must know that for many years, we have had an adverse trade balance with the United States of America and &#39;that the rationing system was introduced for the purpose of increasing our trade with the United Kingdom, the country to which, he pointed out, we owe so much. He will find in this tariff schedule proposals to give tariff preference to Great Britain which is Australia&#39;s best customer. Preference to Britain is the policy of the Government, and has the endorsement of the people of Australia. If we permitted foreigners to flood our market with their products, how could we give assistance to British exporters? &#34;We cannot have it both ways. The honorable member supports preference to Great Britain; therefore, he must support a higher tariff on goods from countries with which we are unable to conclude reasonable trade agreements. The policy of economic nationalism adopted by the governments of many foreign countries has caused that serious contraction of world trade which the honorable member for Swan deplores. Australia has always sought improved trade relations with other countries, provided the interests of Australia and Great Britain were not affected thereby. A continuance of the effort to build up manufacturing industries capable of supplying all Australia&#39;s needs is the only sound and sane policy for this young country. Our primary producers particularly are concerned to conserve and develop a home market that has sufficient purchasing power to give a reasonable return to the supplier. </para>

            <para>. -  I have an unbounded admiration for the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> because, - notwithstanding his background of colossal tariff failures, he cheerfully and regularly informs us of the advantages of Labour&#39;s tariff policy.  His  flogging of that dead horse always arouses my admiration, because I have a very lively recollection, as have other honorable members who were members of the House at the time, of the effects on industry of the tariff policy which was brought down by the Labour government, presumably to save Australia; and again this afternoon we have heard him tell the committee of the millennium, that would arrive if the country were only to adopt the tariff policy of the Labour party. In his inimitable manner, he tells us how industry would develop, unemployment decrease, and new factories open their doors. But what are the facts? We have had experience of a tariff policy introduced by a Labour government to guide us. Under the Labour party&#39;s tariff policy, brought down by no less a person than the present  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, when he was Minister for Trade and Customs, industry stagnated completely, factories closed their doors and unemployment reached a very high level - a level never experienced before in the history of Australia. </para>

              <para>- The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will try to explain away these facts. He has been trying to do so ever since the tariff policy of the Labour government crashed, and most honorable members could repeat by heart his speeches in explanation, if they so wished. Under the tariff policy of the Labour government factories were forced  to close their doors. Analysing such a situation, one must naturally ask why they did. The answer is plain. It was because the Labour government had imposed tariff duties and embargoes without making any scientific investigation of the possible effect of such a policy on industry. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition now applauds the Tariff Board and holds it up as a model of complete investigation of tariff problems - when it suits his argument to do so - but when Labour was in power it ignored the investigations and reports of that board and imposed in an arbitrary manner a system of duties and embargoes, the effect of which was to throw Australia back a half century in its industrial progress. Yet this afternoon the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition claimed that, under the tariff policy of the Labour party, industry would flourish and the millennium would be achieved. In common with other honorable members, I commend the present Government for the balanced tariff policy that it has brought down, and the manner in which it has made adjustments in the system which was imposed on Australian industry by the arbitrary manipulation of the tariff by a Minister for Trade and Customs at a time when, had he paid any heed to the reports of the Tariff Board, made only after thorough investigation, he would have developed breadth of vision and realized the repercussions of such a policy. I should like to direct the attention of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition to the conditions that obtain iu Australia at the present time under the balanced tariff policy of the present Government. Industry has never been in a more flourishing condition ; employment never reached greater proportions than it has at the present time; never in the greatest period of prosperity that Australia previously experienced was there so much employment as there is now. </para>

              <para>- Not entirely, but it is due to the balanced policy of the present Government. Never has Australia experienced such prosperity in its industrial life as it is now experiencing. Tb&#171; expenditure of capital on the establishment of new factories, the greater profits of industry, the improved standard of living, the great encouragement that has been given to those who desire to invest capital in industry, and the greater harmony which now exists in industry, ought to provide sufficient indication to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition that by its tariff policy the present Government has established a happy medium that must provide greater security and confidence for those who desire to invest capital in industry and greater security for those who earn their living in industry. </para>

          <para>Although the present Government has evolved such a well-balanced tariff policy, there have crept in several small anomalies to which I direct the attention of the Minister, in the hope that he will consider their rectification. I appreciate the principle of the trade diversion policy formulated by the present Government and the incentive given to development in the interests of both the British manufacturer and the Australian manufacturer. I applaud the Government for that policy, but in adopting a trade. diversion policy some allowance should be made for flexibility. When it is found that a system is so rigid that it imposes on Australian industry conditions which are not conducive to prosperity, the Minister should take steps to provide a more flexible system. The Government&#39;s policy of applying a quota to the importation of motor vehicles should be reconsidered in view of the altered set of conditions now obtaining. The Government decided to fix quotas for different makes of motor cars. In doing so, it must have realized that its quota system would react immediately in favour of the more popular makes of motor cars - those which provide the greatest value and thereby give an incentive to the public to purchase motor cars. But, instead of providing for a flexible system, the Government laid down a hard and fast system which has not been productive of the best results. Makes of motor cars which are popular are  underquota&#39;d  based on recent sale figures, and makes which are not popular are over.quota&#39;s or have gone off the market. In spite of these results, the quota that was established still stands. The demand  being made for the more popular makes of car cannot be satisfied. Surely, it was never intended by the Government that that state of affairs would be brought about when it established the quota system. Then one must ask, what has been the reaction on employment? I know of one firm which could not obtain sufficient chassis to satisfy the demand made for its make of car; the firm knew that it was reaching a peak period of demand for its make of car and that, in order to satisfy the demand, it would have to bring its full labour force into operation. I approached the Minister on behalf of the firm and suggested that he should give it the opportunity to take out its next month&#39;s quota a few days before the next quota was due. It was suggested that the quota should be taken out under bond <inline font-style="italic">so thai</inline> no opportunity would be given for exploitation. The Minister said, in reply, that if the suggestion were agreed to the quota system would be spoilt, because the same treatment would have to be given to all other manufacturers. To a certain extent, I am in agreement with the Minister; but, bearing in mind the fact that there is no flexibility in the quota system and that the manufacturers of some makes of cars will never bo in a position to demand their full quota, I suggest that he should make the system more flexible, and thereby prevent, as happened in the case of this particular firm, 200 men being thrown out of employment for some weeks. Although I should prefer the abolition of the quota system, if it is still the intention of the Government to obtain a status whereby it can negotiate trade treaties, I shall support it. Taking the commonsense view and for the reasons that I have given, my advice to the Government is to adopt a more flexible system which will assist industry instead of hindering it, as the present quota system does. </para>
          <para>The second point I desire to make relates to the levying of the duty of .7d. per lb. on motor chassis with the object of encouraging the manufacture of motor cars in Australia. When the proposal was first brought down, I could see no economic sense in it, and, obviously, that view was well-founded. The Government really gave an incentive to the Tariff Board to recommend this policy, because the Government, in its terms of reference, said, &#34; This is the considered policy of the Government.&#34; I suggest that the Tariff Board could not have interpreted that statement in any other way than as a direction to it to bring in a report in conformity with the view of the Government. The report made by the Tariff Board to the Government on this matter has not been released and, therefore, honorable members are not aware of its contents. Obviously, the board&#39;s report is not in accord with the policy of the Government. In other words, the board has reported adversely on the economic possibilities of establishing the motor car manufacturing industry in Australia. Otherwise, the Government would have gone ahead with its policy. The making of an adverse report by the Tariff Board is an acknowledgment of the fact that the imposition of the duty of .7d. per lb. has not produced any direct benefit. My advice to the Government is to do the big thing - lift the duty and provide another means for the desired result to be achieved. </para>

            <para>.- The honorable member who has just  resumed his seat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> was surprisingly assertive and full of knowledge. lt would have been very enlightening to me had he mentioned the factories which he said had been compelled to close their doors. Three or four times he stated definitely that that had happened as the result of the tariff policy of the Scullin Government. A man who, I should say, is at least as intelligent as the honorable member, the present High Commissioner for Australia in London, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> has admitted that the policy of the Scullin Government saved Australia. That cannot be denied. Some of the friends of this Government have taken advantage of certain things which were done by the Labour party. The protection which that party gave enabled them to establish and develop industries. They have exploited the people of this country, and the Government now in office has proved ineffective to deal with them. Wo have been told by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> and the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> that the Government intends to do certain things by means of different laws. It proposes to prevent people from shifting from one part of Australia to another. They will have to give an undertaking that they will not go to a certain place. If the Government has the power to take such steps, why does it not also seek to control those who charge exorbitant prices for different commodities? One portion of tho schedule that we now have before us deals with tobacco. I notice a certain reduction of the tariff on tobacco imported from England, provided that 13 per cent, of Australian tobacco is blended with it. I suggest that that will have no effect as far as the tobacco industry in Australia is concerned. The growing of tobacco leaf is not confined to Queensland; a very large quantity is produced in the southern States. The industry was being developed under the tariff policy of the Scullin Government, and eventually it would have proved of vital importance and of very great value to this country, but it was practically killed in a month or two by the reduction of the import duty and the raising of the excise duty by 100 per cent. A similar result is noticeable in the case of other in dustries. It would be interesting to know why Lysaght&#39;s are being allowed to bring, large quantities of iron into this country from overseas. Is the Government assisting to smash the labour conditions in the galvanized iron industry? Is it aiding and abetting the company to defeat the men <inline font-style="italic">-who</inline> are working for it under rotten conditions, which should not exist, considering the support given to it by this Parliament in the past? This Government is not prepared to see that the recommendation of Judge Cantor, a judge of the Arbitration Court in <inline font-style="italic">Now</inline> South Wales, is put into operation. I suggest that whatever means could be used by this Government to bring these bushrangers - they are nothing else - to heel would be justified, but it will do nothing in any shape or form to assist in that direction, because to do so would be to interfere with its friends. The position as I see it i3 that the object of this schedule and of the general tariff policy of this Government is not to assist in the slightest degree the industries of this country. Different State premiers have claimed that what their Governments have done has been responsible for tho so-called prosperity that exists to-day. There may be a certain degree of prosperity, but it is not as great as is claimed. A considerable degree of poverty is still to be found. There are conditions in protected industries which should not exist even without protection. I say quite definitely that either this Government is ineffective or it is too cowardly to use the power that it possesses. We have been told that Holden&#39;s make9 enormous profits. The tobacco monopoly is in a similar category, yet it is not treating its employees as well as they were treated a few years ago when its position was not as good as it is at the moment. Immediately it achieved the object it set out to attain - the wiping out of the import duty and the raising of the excise duty, which made it impossible to produce what should and would have been grown in Australia - this monopoly, instead of treating its employees as they should have been treated under the improved conditions, treated them worse than previously. Every other monopoly is in a similar position. It is unfortunate that we have to give protection  to these concerns for the sake of the workers of this country. They are not worthy of any consideration whatever. The tobacco monopoly sought and obtained from the Commonwealth Government protection which enabled it to become established on a footing which would not have been possible in any other circumstances, and immediately it felt that it was standing on firm ground it flogged the men and women whom it employed. I do not intend, on that account, to advocate a freetrade policy, as was suggested by one honorable member who spoke this afternoon. Free trade has been advocated by that honorable member ever since I entered this Parliament, and possibly throughout the whole of his lifetime. He at least is honest in that regard. Such a policy would <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> achieve the object that we desire. If this Parliament has the power to control these matters, it should be exercised. The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> has suggested that the Government could exercise control through the Tariff Board. It should let us know what power it possesses. While the honorable member was speaking, I asked him by way of interjection to state in what way the Tariff Board could act, and he replied that the Tariff Board had the power to act if the Government would give it the right to do so. Let the Government give the board the right to take whatever action it considers necessary, and thus place these people in the position that they should occupy. If there is any way in which they can he compelled to treat their workers fairly, they should be made to do so. There are industries which, under proper protection, would have been established, and doubtless would have proved successful and of value to Australia. I have referred to one in this chamber on a by-gone occasion. We have been informed by the  chairman  of a tobacco concern in Victoria of the enormous amount which was put into a new venture when it seemed that the tobacco growing industry would be developed in this country. Within a few months more than one half of the money thus invested was lost. It may be suggested that if they had hung on it would have been better for them. I can visualize that. But the difficulty was that all the money they had was put into the undertaking, and when the slump occurred, as the result of the lowering of the import duty and the raising of the excise duty, those who were supporting them with credit were not prepared to continue that support. Those who were incapable of doing so had to desist, but in a number of cases in which the credit could have been continued, those who were giving it were notprepared to continue it, because they believed that tobacco growing in Australia was doomed to extinction. Quite a large number of concerns were affected. I say quite definitely that this industry would have been established in the States in a very satisfactory condition under the tariff policy of the Scullin Government, but this Government denied that protection to it. The enormous amount which we are sending to another country for tobacco leaf would very largely have been saved to Australia had the opportunity been given to develop the local growing industry. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> has admitted that each year a better class of tobacco leaf is being produced locally. That improvement would have continued in greater measure if people had been allowed to remain in the industry. This Government has nothing at all to its credit so far as the protection of Australian industries are concerned. Rather should it hang its head and say, &#34; We have killed some industries very effectively.&#34; </para>

            <para>.- The most amusing feature of the speech of the honorable member who has just resumed his seat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Martens),</inline> waa that he forgot the existence of Queensland. In season and out of season, we have had representatives from Queensland who have told us of the disasters which have attended the growing of tobacco at Mareeba in that State. The honorable member for Herbert has said so many times that this country was rescued by the Scullin Government, that I think, he honestly believes such to be the case. During the six years of my membership of this Parliament, however, he has not produced any evidence to prove that the Scullin Government did what would give  to Australia an impetus to lift itself out of the slough of despond. The greatest blessing ever enjoyed by Australia was conferred by the advent to office of the United Australia party in 1931. During the last six years, I have listened to speeches on the tariff by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> He has repeated the same speech so often that we all know it off by heart before he begins to make it, his principal theme being that the tariff policy of the Scullin Government placed Australia in a position favorable to recovery. All that I know about the policy of the Scullin Government is that under it certain privileges were given to different concerns. It disregarded the reports of the Tariff Board, and of its own officers, and said to huge monopolies, &#34; Come in.&#34; I am not sure that it did not say to them, &#34; We shall let you know a week or two before the tariff is introduced what is going to happen.&#34; I have been assured that the works which one of the biggest monopolies in New South Wales established were begun because it knew beforehand what tariff was shortly to be imposed. What was done in the one case I suppose was done in other cases. What racked Australia at that time was the fact that in the Scullin Government there was no stamina, no commercial knowledge, no knowledge of what was necessary to bring prosperity back to Australia. Following upon complaints that honorable members of this House had made about the treatment meted out to the tobacco-growers of Queensland, 1 made a two months&#39; tour of that State some time ago. I was told before going there that a great, deal of tobacco had been produced which the tobacco companies would not buy. I went to Queensland seeking both information and advice. I went through the Mareeba tobacco-growing areas and visited many farms. I also visited many towns. I came to the conclusion that a great deal of inferior tobacco leaf was being produced. It seems to me that an effort has been made by some honorable members of this House to cover up the inefficient methods of certain tobaccogrowers. The year before I went to Queensland the tobacco companies had been very generous to the Queensland tobacco-growers, and had bought tobacco leaf to the value of &#163;12.000,000, but, unfortunately, they had to destroy by burning, leaf valued at &#163;3,000,000. I also made some inquiry into the tobacco growing industry in the electorate of New England. I ascertained that an expert from the New South Wales governmental staff, who had been sent there to make an investigation, came to the conclusion that the only use that much of the tobacco grown in New England could be put to was as a fertilizer. </para>

          <para>While I was travelling through the Mareeba district I was told by an expert that tobacco-blending was very much like tea-blending; it had to be done by experts, otherwise the product was of very little use. I well remember meeting one young; fellow in Queensland who told me that he had sold his tobacco for 3s. 6d. per lb., at auction. Another man told me that he had sent his product to the market but could not sell it. When he complained in a certain quarter, he was told that there must have been some mistake, and he was advised to have his product  regraded  and send it to the market again. He did so, at a cost of &#163;2 15s., and it was again rejected by buyers. Some honorable members would have us believe that tobacco may be grown as easily as cabbages, but the fact is that the tobacco plant is most delicate, and  requiries  scientific treatment. One man told me that in one season he had put 5 acres under crop and had got a first-class price for his product. The next year he thought he would extend his operation somewhat, and he put 7 acres under crop. But he got a smaller return from the 7 acres than from the 5 acres, the reason being that 7 acres proved too large an area to cultivate effectively by himself. He could produce from it o n 1 v an inferior leaf. </para>

I said to the tobacconist in Bundaberg, &#34; Do you sell Queensland tobacco ?&#34; He said, &#34;Oh, no; we give that to the hoboes. We have to give it away; we can&#39;t sell it.&#34; At Rockhampton I went into three tobacconists&#39; shops and asked for Queensland tobacco. One man replied, &#34; Sorry, sir, but it is not made.&#34; I believe a company did make some tobacco in Queensland from the Queensland leaf, but the business was not profitable. </para>

          <para>The trouble is that in consequence of the high protection provided for the tobacco industry by the Seullin Government a huge acreage was put under crop and this had the effect of seriously inflating land values. Properties that had been bought for a few pounds hu acre were sold for prices ranging from &#163;20 and &#163;30 an acre, and the business &#39;became heavily over-capitalized. Personally I have little doubt from the inquiries I made in Queensland that if a saleable article were produced by the growers it would be purchased by the tobacco companies. A saleable article is not being produced to any great extent at present. </para>

              <para>- I was very surprised to hear the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Martens)</inline> criticize the tobacco companies to-night. He must know very well that when the tobacco companies purchased the whole of the Queensland tobacco crop a year or two ago they said to the growers, &#34; Next year you will have to produce a  good light leaf of standard quality or else we will not buy it.&#34; The growers produced a dark leaf which was spotted and in many ways defective, and the tobacco companies declined to :buy it. One man said to me when I asked him if he expected to sell his leaf : &#34; The tobacco companies bought it last year, and they will buy it again this year, I suppose.&#34; The tobacco companies cannot be expected to buy inferior leaf for which they have no use. I wish to take the scales off the eyes of honorable members so that they may see the real facts in regard to the tobacco industry. I know very well that good tobacco can be grown in Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales. </para>

              <para>- I entirely disapprove of monopolies. Two classes in the community seem to me to demand attention from the Government. One section comprises the Lang planners, who are Communists. The other section is the monopolists, who endeavour to fleece the public by making huge profits and charging inordinately high prices. The complaint has been made to-night that the tobacco companies are monopolistic. If these companies are virtually a monopoly and are taking money out of the pockets of the working people, I. am prepared to join with any other section of honorable members to deal with them, but we must remember that honorable members opposite put the companies in the saddle. The honorable member for Herbert says, on the one hand, that the tobacco companies will not buy the inferior leaf produced by tobacco growers, and, on the other hand, that the companies constitute  a monopoly which underpays its employees and is in general, a menace to the State. If these things can be proved I shall be prepared to co-operate with other honorable members to deal with the matter. I am always willing to support any movement which has for its object the improvement of the lot of the common people, so that they may obtain a fairer share of the world&#39;s wealth. </para>

          <para>I wish now to deal briefly with the Tariff Board. It has frequently been said in this House that the United Australia party is a slavish servant of the Tariff Board. For my part I believe that all variations of the tariff should be consequent upon careful inquiry by men of experience into all the facts of the case. If either an increase or a decrease of duty is sought the applicants should be obliged tobring evidence to prove their claims. We should endeavour to bring about equal conditions in industry so that imports and exports may be maintained at a level which will give a real impetus to our trade and commerce. </para>

              <para>- Unlike the party to which the honorable member belongs, which is always so anxious to feed the rich monopolies, the United Australia party does not slavishly follow the recommendations of various boards. It has a definite policy and it stands behind it. The Labour Government made no attempt to undertake scientific examinations of commodities upon which it was asked to impose increased tariff duties; it merely took the advice of those whom it served it best to placate. I hope that no party to which I owe allegiance will ever slavishly follow every Tariff Board recommendation that is received in respect of an article required for general use by the common people. Duties appear in the schedule which I hope to see amended at a later stage. I have noticed, for instance, that higher duties are placed on materials imported by the yard from Japan, and even Great Britain, than on made-up goods from the same material. In this way Australian manufacturers are penalized. This is one of the anomalies which I hope will be rectified at an early date. </para>

I feel sure that the party opposite will not occupy the treasury bench for a long while, and I feel equally sure that the Barton seat is safe for the next six years. I urge upon the Government the desirability of giving very earnest consideration to the proposals submitted by the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison).</inline> Although I think there is room for the Government to mend its ways, I am fortified by the knowledge that when the party to which I belong has found itself travelling in the wrong direction it has always been quite willing to retrace its steps for the benefit of the people of Australia. I trust that in committee the Government will accede to some alterations of duties which will be suggested from this side of the chamber. </para>

            <para>.- I hope that I will never be so far gravelled for matter in speaking on the tariff or any other question, as to be driven to take notice of the irresponsible inanities of the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lane).</inline> The position of the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> however, is quite different; he is, to do him justice, in an entirely different category. He has made a speech in which he voiced nothing but high encomiums for the Government in regard to its tariff policy, and more than once he has asserted that the country is indebted to it for its well-balanced tariff policy. He dealt with it in a well-balanced speech. He gave to the Government at first a large measure of applause, but afterwards a moderate measure of blame and criticism. Indeed, he balanced himself so adroitly that one might say of him without injustice that he sat upon the fence in a manner of acrobatic excellence. He was not quite satisfied with the quota system of the trade diversion policy of the Government, because, although as a general principle he thought it was correct, it had too much rigidity, too little flexibility to let his own friends in as  he would like. I am not making accusations against the honorable gentleman when I say that. I have no intention of uttering any of those scandalous innuendoes of dishonesty such as have been uttered by the honorable member for Barton, who is now interjecting. I have never known a case in which that quotation, &#34; Save me from my friends &#34; more aptly applies than in the case of the honorable member for Wentworth, because I am quite sure that if the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> had been here, he would not have been flattered nor would the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> to find that he was being supported from the rear by such a delicately compromising half-protec- . tionist-cum-freetrader as the honorable member for Wentworth. Those honorable gentlemen profess to be true-blue supporters of Australian industry and genuine protectionists, but the honorable member for Wentworth prides himself upon being a past master in the art of upholding a shandy-gaff tariff. </para>

              <para>- They are too busy laughing at somebody else; it is because of that that some of my brightest utterances are missed by my friends who sit behind me. I do not know any debate that has taken place for some time past in which modern instances have &#39;been less well supported by wisesaws than in this debate. This subject of the tariff is not entirely modern; it is not, to say the least of it, fragrantly fresh; I seem to have heard most of the arguments and even most of the phrases, on occasion s too numerous to mention so oft repeated within the last 25 years. Honorable members heard the speech of my honorable friend the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> who was Minister for Trade and Customs in a government of which I had the honour to be a member. </para>

              <para>- He again, granted not for the first time, defended and expounded the policy of the Government of which he was a distinguished member in regard to the tariff. For a moment I felt listening to him that, insofar as he was dealing with the history of seven years ago, it was reasonable to hope that his arguments being sound, ought by this time to have penetrated the brain of everybody not entirely impervious to argument. It was only after he had spoken for a few minutes that I began to realize that there <inline font-style="italic">was</inline> in this chamber at least one, and probably more, with a brain entirely impervious to argument. It was quite evident when the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> commenced to speak on this subject. </para>

              <para>- I did not refer to him. The honorable member for Swan has at least been consistent and honest in this matter; he has not wobbled so much in tariff matters as many honorable members opposite. When I heard the honorable member for Swan expounding his views on the tariff I thought that, if any one wanted a reference as to when the honorable gentleman first delivered the speech which in substance, at all events, he repeated this evening, I would refer him to the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Handbook</inline> of 1913, under the letter &#34;G&#34;, where he would find that that gentleman had been elected in that year for Dampier. It was in that year that he first made that eloquent appeal, which he repeated to-night for the 57th time in support of the policy of freedom for Australia, particularly freedom of trade. The honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mulcahy),</inline> who has not been in this Parliament as long as I have - and I have been both in and out of it, although much longer in than out - discovered for the first time to-day that the honorable member for Swan is a rank freetrader. That realization came upon the honorable member for Lang as a bright discovery of modern times, although those of us who have had longerexperience in this House had suspected it for quite a time. But how can a champion of freedom be accused of rankness? I am reminded of the words of Byron - </para>

          <para class="block">Evidently the honorable member for Swan believes that the battle for freetrade, though baffled oft, must eventually be won - if not continuously won. The. description of the honorable member for Swan as a rank freetrader comes not only from the ranks of Labour, but also from the AssistantMinister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron).</inline> In his case, however, there is a certain amount of professional jealousy, for the Assistant-Minister regards himself as a proper, regulation, dyed-in-the-wool freetrader. However, there they are - the Assistant-Minister for Commerce, the honorable member for Swan, and also the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> who, I regret to notice, is not in his usual place in the chair. The ranks of Tuscany are, however, not coherent in regard to the tariff - the war policy - or indeed any other policy, except their determination to retain their seats in this chamber if the gods are favourable. </para>

I do not know who among us are low  tariffists  but I do know that my colleagues on this side are pledged supporters of the policy of adequate protection for the industries of Australia, which was declared here as recently as this afternoon by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. Having found them in all things sincere, I assume that they are sincere in their subscription to that policy. There still remains one qualification in regard to the honorable member for Swan. I remember it being said of one honorable member in this House that, whatever his views might . have been on certain other subjects, he was sound on predestination. It must be said of the honorable member for Swan that he is a protectionist insofar as he is sound on the gold bounty, if on nothing else. On one occasion an honorable member was accused in this chamber of having slipped on bananas, but I can assure the House that the honorable member for Swan has never slipped on the gold bounty. </para>

              <para>- It would he dangerous to do so. The galaxy of talent which generally supports the policy of the Government includes the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bernard Corser).</inline> In the honorable member&#39;s electorate there is a considerable radical element, and, accordingly, he not infrequently crosses the floor to vote with the Labour party. Especially does he seek the sunshine of Labour&#39;s smile in regard to tariff matters. And so, when I ventured to suggest this afternoon that he would manifest a perfectly friendly interest in sugar and bananas - and, I had intended to add, peanuts and cotton also - he declared with some acerbity, that I had a monopoly of disloyalty. That was a totally irrelevant observation. At all events, I am in doubt as to whether he meant disloyalty to my King and country - and in that respect I think that I am, like Caesar&#39;s wife, above suspicion - or disloyalty to the policy of high tariff duties, in respect of which I was, at times, a little suspect in my younger days. I do not know to what the honorable gentleman referred, but, to say the least, he was very nasty about it. He impugned my loyalty, whereas I was prepared to offer to him my thanks for the support which, on various occasions, he has given to this party when, after first making a careful count of heads to see that his vote would not affect the life of the Government, he has voted with the Opposition. </para>

              <para>- I was referring to the brave days of old. I was not in the House at that time, but George Reid was there, as were also Alfred Deakin, Charles Cameron Kingston, and others. Later, Samuel Mauger and many other great men were there. There were giants in those days. Long after their decease, but not till then, the nien of other days are always regarded as giants. Men of our own generation are not so regarded. </para>

              <para>- There are degrees of greatness. We must not, however, appear to be blasphemous in our comparisons. When the great tariff battle had been fought, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, as he afterwards became, was overborne. Thu tariff was too much for him, and so he started pursuing the anti-socialist tiger, lie fought an election with only moderate success upon that issue. It was publicly stated in the press, especially in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age.,</inline> which lias always been the great Victorian protagonist of protection, that protection was the settled policy of the Commonwealth of Australia, whereas, from that day to this, it has been the most unsettled policy of which I have any knowledge. Nevertheless, protection with variations has been the accepted policy of every administration that has succeeded the government which first espoused it. In those days, there was some difference of opinion on the subject in the Labour party. It was not until the inexorable weight of logic and reason had shown conclusively that protection was the natural and inevitable policy for Australian industries that a protectionist policy did, in fact, become the settled policy of the Labour party. </para>

              <para>- As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has rightly pointed out, it was the proud privilege of the Scullin Government so to use the tariff as to save the Commonwealth from that cataclysm which might have befallen had not embargoes, and in some instances, absolutely prohibitive duties, been imposed on the importation of goods from other countries. According to the High Commissioner in London, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> the action by the Scullin Government was responsible for placing the Australian ship of state on an even keel. The reduction of our interest bill was brought about by the statesmanship of the  Government of which I was a member which made the path for the Government which succeeded it an easy one. Taking advantage as it did of what we had done - the redressal of the trade balance, the saving of the country of so many millions iu interest, together with the undulatory return to prosperity under the capitalist system, its task became easy and made it the most natural thing in the world for the present Prime Minister, who had deserted us in our hour of struggle, to cross the floor and to take praise in the hour of prosperity for what others had done. But the battle, I think, has been fought, and it is a pity to find that the Ministerial party consists of a heterogeneous mass of contradictory opinion upon this fundamental subject. It was pitiful to hear the speech of the honorable member for Wentworth. Unlike a certain other honorable member, he has a reasoning faculty capable of assessing the value of facts, congratulating himself upon the way in which this Government has tampered with the tariff, and, in the matter of trade diversion from Japan and the United States of America, has tragically misused its power. It is pitiful, I repeat, to hear the honorable member, and others like him, out of tune with the policy of the Government, but nevertheless supporting it, and to find it composed of classes of opinion diametrically opposed one to the other. The Government is essentially heterogeneous in that it is made up of members such as the Acting Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> and the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> who have crashed their way into the Government by abusing it from outside, and, having gatecrashed, now sit down like lambs with lions expounding a common policy in which they do not believe. That being so, I can only express the hope that item No. 1 will be agreed to, and that not too much mischief will be effected by this mischievous tariff emanating from the congeries of different opinions which make up this so-called Government. </para>

            <para>. -  The general debate on the tariff naturally creates a good deal of interest, but in view of the comprehensive speech of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> it is not my intention to enlarge to any extent on the subjects he mentioned. I realize that honorable members opposite fully understand the fiscal policy of the Labour party. It is  a  consistent policy which has been responsible for the establishment of many important industries inAustralia, but I venture to suggest that many Australian people recognize that changes of tariff policy cause a feeling of insecurity which has prevented our manufacturing industries  from  developing in the way in which the Labour party expected them to develop. In the electorate which I represent, which is one of the largest manufacturing centres in Australia, there are employers who are prepared to expand their industries if they knew that there would be no tinkering with the tariff. Many of those to whom I have spoken have said that there has been some growth in recent years, but that their industries would have developed more rapidly had they known that the present Government was not likely to make tariff changes. The feeling which is prevalent throughout my electorate and in many othermanufacturning centres has prevented the normal development of industry. While the Government contends that it has been responsible for increased employment throughout Australia, I believe that there are many industries which would have absorbed more employees had those conducting them known that they would be secure for a long period. Although the Government claims that duties have not been reduced to any extent, the duties on approximately 1,200 items in the Scullin tariff have been reduced, and 700 other reductions havebeen made by composite governments from time to time. Many persons felt that they were justified in developing their industries to meet defence requirements. I can give definite instances where, owing to the publicity given to the Government&#39;s increased defence expenditure, those controlling these establishments thought that work would be awaiting them. Moreover, in conse quence of a statement which appeared in a Melbourne newspaper that largesums would be spent on defence, many men approached me and also other Victorian representatives asking if employment would be available in munition factories, but, at that time, men were being put off in what were thought to be expanding industries. In January and February, no fewer than 40 men in the rolling mill section of a. munitions establishment at Maribyrnong were dismissed. When the Labour party was in power, it found that most of the parts used in the manufacture of shells and other types of munitions were being brought from overseas, and that it was necessary to impose higher duties or embargoes so that these articles could be manufactured in Australia. The policy of the Labour Government enabled that to be done. The brass plate and strip metal necessary for the manufacture of shell cases and other parts of munitions were being imported, and the Government at that time realized that, if that policy were continued and war should occur, Australia would be unable to supply its needs. It therefore undertook the manufacture of these brass plate and strip metal parts so that Australia would not be dependent on supplies from other sources. That industry developed and the small number of men first employed increased to 150, many of them skilled, but most of them semi-skilled artisans. The Labour party was thus responsible for the establishment of an industry which private enterprise would not venture upon because of insecurity under the tariff. No attempt was made to establish a brass plate and strip metal works until the Labour Government came into power, but, now that the industry has been developed, this Government, which believes in private enterprise, has transferred some of the work to a &#34; pup &#34; company of one of the big combines in Australia and, as that company is operating in another State, many men in Victoria have been thrown out of employment. Recently, I asked the Government whether orders given to government factories had been transferred to private enterprise, and I was informed that the Government requires the rolling mills to  provide for its own defence requirements. As a matter of fact, the Government has not done anything of the kind, as 40 men who were engaged in the rolling mills were put out of work, and not all of them have yet been re-absorbed in other sections of the works. Apparently, it is the policy of this Government to hand over to private enterprise industries established by the Scullin Government which are now showing a profit. The Labour party is opposed to such a policy, particularly in matters of defence and in industries where a large number of men could be absorbed in producing, without profit, material needed in the event of war. </para>

          <para>Parliament should get back to the time when it had complete control of its tariff policy. We should remove the objectionable portions of the Ottawa Agreement, and, particularly, Articles 9 to 13, which deprive this Parliament of the power to frame its tariff policy. I trust that the Government will yield to the pressure from some of its own supporters, as well as to that from this side of the chamber, so that Parliament will be in a position to control tariff matters. The obnoxious articles in the Ottawa Agreement will have the effect of preventing the proper development of Australian industries, and of giving such preferences to Great Britain that it is able to compete unduly with established industries in this country which are so essential to its development. Whatever our expansion has been in recent years, it would have been greater had the position of manufacturers been more secure. I should like to see a considerable alteration in connexion with the Government&#39;s fiscal outlook and policy. If the objectionable portions of the Ottawa Agreement are removed, there would then be a greater feeling of security in the minds of manufacturers, some of whom have told me that they could absorb men now out of work and also provide for the training of skilled men, which is of primary importance to our future progress. We cannot view with complacency the number of items on which duties have been reduced as the result of this Government&#39;s policy. One matter which disturbs the minds of those who support a protective policy and increased development is the increase of imports concerning which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition spoke this afternoon. </para>
          <para>The value of imports in 1931-32 was &#163;17,400,000 compared with &#163;38,500,000 last financial year, an increase of &#163;21,000,000. From these figures one realizes what we could have done for ourselves had our protective policy not been tampered with. The big organizations that are operating in Australia were actually established under the protective policy of the Labour party. One cannot deny, I think, that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited owes a great measure of its success to the fact that it has had effective protection. Now, I think, that company could do very well with considerably less protection than is afforded it. It is probably getting more protection than it needs and, in consequence, is making very large profits. Every one would agree, however, that the establishment .of such an industry is necessary if Australia is to progress as a nation should. We can not be merely a primary pro- ducting nation, as many honorable members opposite would wish us to be. There seems to be a strong feeling among supporters of the Government that Australia should confine itself to primary production, but the Labour party - the honor able member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> made this clear - believes that secondary industries are of even greater value to this country than are primary industries. One newspaper in Australia which I think must be given credit for the development of the protective policy, and the resultant success of our industries, is the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> That  newspaper  and the Australian Natives Association have done a great deal - at all events in Victoria, and their influences have been felt in the rest of Australia - in setting up the conditions that now obtain. </para>

          <para class="block">The view of the Australian Natives Association cannot be ignored. Any reasonably minded person will admit that the setting up of industries on a firm foundation, and their development and expansion, is a primary function, if not the basic function, of any nation which considers itself progressive. Because I fear that the Government is not solid on  the  question of tariff regulation, I make these remarks, notwithstanding that similar views have been already stated effectively by the honorable member for Capricornia. Many things could be said in this debate, but I wish to avoid needless and tedious repetition. I, and my constituents in the Maribyrnong electorate, believe that it is essential to have clauses 9 to 13 of the Ottawa Agreement removed or amended - I should say removed altogether - so that complete control will be regained by this Parliament. The Government should pursue a policy under which those engaged in secondary industries would know, not for a brief time, but for a long time ahead, what the tariff policy would be. Having that knowledge, we could look forward to continued expansion of secondary industry and that greater stability which would make for the progress of the nation. We should develop our tariff policy on the lines laid down by Labour and get away from the emasculating policy that the Government has pursued in recent years. <inline font-style="italic">\Quormn formed.^</inline></para>

            <para>. - I rise to refute some of the statements made by the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lane),</inline> who displayed little knowledge of the tobacco industry, which he singled out for attack. I am qualified to speak on this matter, because I was reared in the centre of one of the main tobacco growing parts of Australia, the Tamworth and Inverell district. Before the Scullin Government introduced its tariff policy, tobacco was grown in only a very small way. The growers in northern New South Wales - and I can also speak for Queensland - were progressing slowly, being handicapped by an inadequate tariff. When the Scullin Government took office and increased the  tariff upon tobacco it gave an impetus te the industry throughout Australia. In the Tamworth district alone more than 2,000 men were engaged in tobacco production, and on the estate on which 1 was reared one man employed more than 100 men on a weekly wage in tobaccogrowing. With the increased acreage a decided improvement of quality was achieved. The honorable member for Barton decried the quality of Australiangrown tobacco, but it is a singular fact that when the tariff was imposed the whole of the leaf was sold. I admit that much of it was inferior leaf, because it had been cured under the old conditions, namely, sun dried and barn cured. We had hundreds of tons in barns throughout the north and north-west portions of the State, and when the duty on imported tobacco was increased, the big buyers purchased, at a profitable price, every pound of leaf that was in store. Some of the leaf had been stored for five or six years, and had been unsaleable previously. Strange to say, there was never any evidence when the leaf was manufactured into tobacco of ill effects on smokers. With the advent of the higher tariff, fluecuring was embarked upon, and many hundreds of thousands of pounds of money was invested in the industry. More than &#163;100,000 was expended in the erection of flues and in the acquisition of every up-to-date appliance. The industry was then flourishing, and one found inspiration in travelling through the district and seeing hundreds of men contentedly engaged in tobacco-growing, looking forward to the future with security. But disaster came upon the industry almost over-night, when the Scullin Government left office and the next government lowered the duties. To-day you see  disaster and ruin in tobacco-growing areas. Those prosperous plantations are now grazing areas, and plant and material worth hundreds of thousands of pounds are lying idle. Many people who had invested their life&#39;s savings in the industry were rendered penniless. On my visits to the districts I have met many men with their families tracking from town to town and subsisting on the dole. The Government&#39;s action was calamitous and aroused indignation in the vast army of people who had been employed in the industry. Advisably, I say that if the tobacco duties had not been interfered with, upwards of 50,000 people would have been interested to-day in the production of tobacco. No other form of primary production offers the same facilities for closer settlement, for a family can make a good living from 10 acres of land. But the only way in which impetus can be given to tobacco production is by adequate protection such as had been imposed by the Scullin Government. The statement that our tobacco is not equal to any produced in other parts of the world is not in accordance with the facts. Only recently a man with whom I was reared - one who is thoroughly versed in the growing of tobacco and who was  president  of the Tobacco-growers Association of Northern New South Wales, and a member of the Advisory Committee which meets periodically to advise the Government in regard to the cultivation of the leaf - established a tobacco factory at Newcastle. He obtained from overseas the services of a man who has expert knowledge of the manufacture of tobacco. He imported pome of the best-quality leaf from overseas and also some of the best leaf grown at Tamworth, and (he expert said that the locally-grown leaf, when manufactured, was superior to the American leaf. The reduction of the tobacco duties by the Government which succeeded the Scullin Government opened the way to the exploitation of the Australian people by the monopolies, which produce tobacco in other parts of the world with coolie labour. Naturally, the product, of cheap labour was more profitable, and the lowering of the duties enabled the manufacturers to draw to a greater extent upon their overseas plantations to the detriment of Australian growers. These big companies with interests in other parts of the world are stifling the local industry, and exploiting the Australian public. If the tobacco-growing industry were encouraged, it could provide a livelihood for 50,000 persons who would, in turn, consume the products of other primary producers. I represent a district which produces tobacco, wheat and wool, the lastnamed being unsurpassed anywhere in the world for quality. Wc in that district recognize that if adequate protection be given to the secondary industries it will tend to create a local market for our primary products. Owing to the trend of world affairs, we are gradually losing our overseas markets. Recently, the  chairman  of the British Trade Delegation, speaking in Sydney, warned us that the British market would in the future absorb a diminishing quantity of our primary products. The only remedy is adequate protection for our secondary industries, so that the people engaged in them may provide a market for the man on the land. </para>

          <para>Some time ago, the Government instituted a Tobacco Advisory Committee, with representatives from all the States. This committee met last year in Melbourne, and resolved to ask the Government to increase the duties on imported leaf, and to reduce the excise on Australian leaf. Although the Government tried to hoodwink the growers by appointing a committee and paying the expenses of delegates to the meeting in Melbourne, it refused to act on the committee&#39;s recommendations in regard to the tariff. During a recent tour of the northern part of my electorate, I was appalled to note the effects of the Government&#39;s tariff policy on the tobaccogrowing industry. In the vicinity of the town of Ashford, in the Inverell district, there are lands second to none for the purpose of growing tobacco. When the Scullin Government was in office, and the industry was properly protected, hundreds of men were, engaged in growing tobacco in that district. It was a thriving community with its own school, but when I passed through it a few months ago. the families had gone, and I saw a lorry taking away the furniture from the empty school. I urge the Government to give effect to the recommendations of the Tobacco Advisory Committee. If possible it should restore the Scullin duties so that within a few years we may again have thousands of contented growers engaged in the industry, thus helping to promote the economic and military security of the country. </para>

            <para>.- Like many other honorable members in this House, 1 have some interest in the tobaccogrowing industry, there being several growers in my electorate who are doing very well. They are receiving every assistance from the State Department of Agriculture, which tells them what kind of leaf to grow, how to erect the drying kilns, and how to cure the leaf. I agree with the opinions expressed by the honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> who made a very fine speech on this subject. I also listened to what the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lane)</inline> had to say. The honorable member took us for a trip through the tobacco-growing districts of Queensland, and I recall that last year he took us on an exactly similar trip. He made the same speech in the same flamboyant manner; he used the same phrases and said the same things about the growing of tobacco and the people who were growing it. However, there i.s one thing that he does not seem to. bc able to do; namely, to tell us from his own personal experience whether Australian leaf is good or bad. As a matter of fact, I do not think that he knows anything about, it. We have his assurance that he visited Queensland, that he disguised himself so that no one would know that he was a member of Parliament, and that he did everything necessary to obtain information so that he could explain to this chamber and to the people generally that we in Australia cannot grow tobacco, that the industry is too highly protected, and that the public is being exploited. </para>

          <para class="block">Australian tobacco-growing industry languished to such an extent that it could not produce enough leaf to supply the demand. I <inline font-style="italic">remember</inline> that, when the Scullin Government was in office, .1 smoked Australian leaf manufactured in Australia, and found it entirely satisfactory. Later, however, the Australian brands went off the market, until to-day it is difficult to buy tobacco grown and manufactured in Australia. Recently, .1 visited Western Australia, and there smoked cigarettes made entirely from tobacco grown and manufactured in that State, and very good cigarettes they were. I am convinced that there arc great possibilities before the Australian tobacco-growing industry, which should be able to provide a great deal of employment as well as a wider market for our other primary products. I therefore urge the Government to give it adequate protection. </para>
          <para>In addition to tobacco-growing, my electorate is interested in a number of secondary industries, including the manufacture of textiles, which, I am glad to say, are in a thriving condition. Some of the mills in Launceston employ over 1,000 operatives. To honorable members representing metropolitan constituencies on the mainland, this may not seem a large number, but- it indicates that reasonable protection to secondary industries also provides a market for primary production. The textile industry owes much to the Scullin Government, which increased the duties and gave Australian manufacturers an opportunity to expand. People who are in a position to judge tell me that the product of the Australian textile mills is equal to any in the world. </para>

              <para>- Some Government supporters make most astounding claims. Apparently they are satisfied with everything which this Government does.

          <para>I ask honorable members to cast their minds back a few years. I know that some of the things I am about to say may be unpalatable to Government supporters. I also know that they have been said before, but they will bear repeating. In 1929, ten months before the Scullin Government took office, Australian credit overseas was at an exceedingly low level. Attempts made by the BrucePage Government to float loans in London had been unsuccessful, and, if one may judge by the failure of the &#163;7,000,000 loan floated by this Government a few days ago, there is again a feeling of uneasiness in London about the financial strength of the Commonwealth. During the Bruce-Page Government&#39;s seven years&#39; term of office - years of unexampled prosperity - the Commonwealth debt overseas increased by &#163;53,000,000, and imports exceeded exports by &#163;70,000,000. Despite warnings by prominent members of the Labour party, the Bruce-Page Government allowed Australian finances to drift until 1929, when overseas credit was completely stopped. To-day we are experiencing some of the back-wash of the financial <inline font-style="italic">debacle.</inline> This Government is now arranging to fund treasury-bills that were issued in London at about that time. The action taken by the Scullin Government to increase protection to our secondary industries, and to impose embargoes in respect of a number of tariff items, was entirely successful ; an adverse trade balance of &#163;30,000,000 was converted into a favorable balance of &#163;32,000,000, and this country was saved from default in its overseas obligations. Earlier in the debate this evening the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> reminded the committee that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> was, for some time, associated with the Scullin Government, and endorsed its tariff policy, but later became the leader of the government that reversed it. </para>
          <para>I consider it necessary to direct attention to these facts in order to emphasize that, although this Government takes to itself credit for the improved position of the Commonwealth, the credit is really due to the Scullin Government, whose courageous action in tariff matters made recovery possible. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which does not support Labour&#39;s policy, in a recent article reviewing the depression period, declared - </para>

          <para class="block">Similar statements have been made by other newspapers which are not supporters of the Labour party, and they indicate that the claims being made by supporters of the present Government are not borne out in actual fact. I hope that the Government will quickly realize that a policy of scaling down the tariff schedule will reduce the possibility of increased productiveness in Australia. By adopting such a policy the Government is treading the same slippery road that led to the economic crash in the period 1931- 1935. We must export &#163;29,000,000 more of goods than we import if we are to pay the interest on our overseas debt and preserve our London funds. The writing was seen on the wall only this week when 66 per cent, of the amount of the Australian loan placed on the London market was left on the hands of the underwriters. Making all sorts of excuses, the Government claims that the loan was placed on the market at the wrong time, and that world affairs were responsible for its failure. To me the main cause is obvious: The Government&#39;s policy of scaling down the tariff has resulted in Australia not being able to export a sufficient quantity of goods to preserve the trade balance, conserve its London funds, and so maintain its credit abroad. I hope that the Government will take cognisance of these facts, and adopt the only course that will give stability to industry and increase our population, thereby giving the Australian people a better opportunity to protect their land in the event of grave necessity. </para>

            <para>. - Prior to the last general election the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun,</inline> which is not a supporter of the Labour party, declared that the present Government was the greatest tariffslashing government in the world, and that it had done nothing else than slash the tariff. Although I seldom agree with the views of that journal, I agree with that statement. The attitude of the Government towards the tariff is to reduce it to an instrument of taxation for revenue. The Australian tariff is no longer protectionist; all that the Government wants is a revenue tariff. As a result of that policy, it has been able to secure additional money in the Treasury, and it boasts that it has balanced the budget. There is no statesmanship or economic reconstruction of the nation in such a policy. A gramophone could he made to say, &#34;I move that this item and that item in the tariff be reduced,&#34; in order to permit a flood of imports to enter the country and compete unfairly with Australian industries. A revenue tariff is the most cowardly form of obtaining revenue known to governments., and every authority on taxation holds that view. The most conservative governments in the world have accepted the principle that the first canon of taxation is to tax those who can best afford to bear the burden. The chopping down of the tariff, which is the policy of the present Government., places the burden on those who can least afford to bear it. The Government is not operating a protectionist tariff, but a revenue tariff, mainly in the interests of importing firms. In the tariff schedule before the committee, there are unwarrantable discrepancies between the British preferential rate and the general rate. For instance, there are items in which the preferential rate is ltd. and the general rate 9d. ; in other cases the preferential rate is 15 per cent, and the general rate 50 per cent. I submit that discrepancies like these are so great that only goods from other parts of the British Empire can come into Australia, and goods from other countries are shut out. The Government has declared that Australia must trade with the countries of the world in order to promote friendly relations and a peace psychology. When the preferential rate is 1-Jd., and the rate against other countries is &#34;9d., can one claim that a proper balance is maintained? Differential treatment of this sort is the most prolific cause of mistrust and hatred of Australia, and, if persisted in, it will probably cause some nations to force trade on Australia by other than peaceful means. I have never opposed the principle of British preference. I have always taken the view that we should allow some measure of preference to the other nations constituting the British Commonwealth of Nations; but, when the preferential rate is fixed at ltd.. and the general rate at 9d., I think that Suck a policy is foolish. Examining the schedule one can find all sorts of similar discrepancies. On one page of the schedule, there are set out items on which the preferential rate is 18 per cent.., and the general rate 45 per cent. On another page there are items on which the preferential rate is 22 per cent., and the general rate 50 per cent. With such a wide margin of preference to the British Commonwealth of Nations, reasonable trading opportunities are not given to outside countries. The goods of those countries are practically shut out from Australia, and I submit that the Government is treading on dangerous ground when it proposes such wide gaps between the British preferential rate and the general rate. Can the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> by any stretch of the imagination, prove that that is preferential treatment? He claims to have some knowledge of the commercial world. If he has, he must know that a duty of 9d. in the general tariff, compared with a preferential duty of ltd. means the total exclusion of goods from foreign countries. That is the only feature of the schedule which I am attacking at the moment. </para>

          <para>During the last two or three years, a great deal has been said concerning the motor car industry in this country. The Government announced that through the medium of the Tariff Board it intended to try to do something for that industry. I submit that the overseas motor manufacturers are bleeding this country white. It&#39; i.- essential for the even and general economic development of Australia that its road transport system should be placed beyond the exploitation that is at present being practised by those manufacturers. British and American magazines in which motor cars are advertised for sale show that a Ford car, which is sold in Australia for &#163;350, costs only &#163;65 in i lie United States of America. Such a difference in price is ridiculous. The Cadillac car, which is a wealthy man&#39;s car, sells in the United States of America for just over &#163;800, yet the price in Australia is &#163;1,800 or &#163;1,900. Making every possible allowance for freight, profits for middlemen, and all other charges, that is exploitation of the worst possible kind. Australia cannot continue its transportoperations unless the motor industry is established here and given proper protection. Speeding up and other tactics of the worst possible nature are practised in industry in the United States of America. This Government, through the instrumentality of the tariff, should take definite action to see that Australia is protected against the exploitation from which it is now suffering. I have not seen all the establishments that make motor bodies in this country, but the one which provides ah illustration of the greatest tragedy in the economic life of our people is the Ford factory at Geelong. It is the greatest  speeder-up  and life-destroying agency one could imagine. Henry Ford is recognized in the United States of America, and I believe the world over, as the greatest speeder-up in industry. In his book he has told us that in walking through his factory he saw men taking nuts from one box and putting them in another. A noise in the factory caused a couple of the employees to look up. thus diverting their attention from their task. Ford has told us that he immediately came to the conclusion that if those men had not taken their eyes from their task the job would have been done more effectively; consequently he searched America for blind men, who would not be able to see what was hap- pen ing in the factory and therefore would concentrate on their task. Ford has been hailed as a philanthropist because he found employment in his factory for blind men, yet he admits having done so in order to speed up his operations. That is the sort of industry which is being developed in Australia to-day. Motor bodies are being manufactured under the same soulless conditions. I do not suppose that General Motors Holden&#39;s and the other motor body manufacturers are any better than the Ford Company. It is economically impossible for any country to develop without motor traction. If motor transport ceased in Australia, our economic life would almost como to a standstill, yet this Government sits supinely by and does not raise a finger to prevent the exploitation that is being practised. I repeat that a Ford car, selling for &#163;65 in America, is sold for &#163;355 in Australia. Motor trucks are on the same basis. This disparity applies also to the Chevrolet, the Cadillac, and all other makes of cars. British cars are in a similar category. I invite honorable members to peruse in tlie Parliamentary Library or elsewhere, British magazines which advertise the prices of cars for sale in Great Britain, and to compare those prices with the prices at which such cars arc being sold in Australia. We are not getting a fair deal. In the interest of the economic development and safety of Australia, this Government should come down with a. heavy hand and make it possible for cars of a uniform type to be manufactured in this country. Permission could be granted for . the importation of other cars, but such a duty should be placed on them that only the wealthy could afford to purchase them. A car of a lighter type could be manufactured in Australia. It could have a diesel engine, burning crude oil, which can be produced from our own oil-fields, thus making us independent of the foreign companies. If the Government would direct its energies to that end it would be worthy of governing Australia. It knows as well as anybody else that the abuses of which I have spoken arc going on. It knows why there are adverse trade balances. If there is anything which should engage the attention of governments, and particularly of this Government, to-day, it is the need for establishing the production of motor car engines in Australia. </para>
          <para>I have a final word to say as to how this Government gives protection to industry. It always talks with its tongue in its cheek when it claims to be anxious to increase the volume of employment.When the workers in protected industries are economically battered to such an extent that they are forced to use the only defensive weapon they possess - the strike - the tariff policy is thrown overboard. That is the case to-day in connexion with Lysaght&#39;s Limited, the biggest sweaters and speedersup one could find. At the best, their works are nerve-wracking, and destructive of soul and health. The men&#39;s teeth fall out, and the fumes arising out of the operations of the industry destroy their chests. In an endeavour to better their conditions, they are to-day on strike; and because they are on strike, tariff protection goes by the board and the goods manufactured by the company in the United Kingdom are allowed to enter Australia free of duty. That is not right. Although the Labour party believes inprotection, I have said in this Parliament a thousand times that I shall never consciously vote for a purely revenue tariff, and never support the imposition of a duty to protect an Australian industry which cannot supply the home market. Those are sound principles upon which to operate a tariff policy. When an industry, established on a reasonable basis, can supply Australia&#39;s requirements, I am prepared to vote for the maximum amount of duty to ensure that the local market shall be preserved for local producers. Such a policy, of course, cuts both ways.I think this Parliament could do a great deal more than it has hitherto done to keep a tighter hold on industry. I realize the constitutional limitations under which we labour, and I know that this Government cannot be expected to do all that a Labour government would do to meet the position; but it is a tragedy that our fiscal policy should be employed as an instrument with which to flog our people into working under unhealthy conditions. The Government, in my opinion, is using the tariff for this purpose. The workers in our iron and steel industry are not getting a fair deal. </para>

              <para>- I am not talking of embargoes. I have said a thousand times that I would protect up to the hilt any industry which could supply the Australian market with its requirements. The honorable member may put what interpretation he likes on that statement. I favour a protectionist tariff policy but not a revenue tariff policy. The honorable member obviously wishes to protect his wealthy friends from contributing byway of taxation their proper share to the costs of government. He and his colleagues are prepared to take the money needed for governmental expenditure out of the pockets of the consumers and the poorer classes of people by means of a revenue tariff instead of by direct taxation. Every world-wide authority on taxation has agreed that the first principle of honest taxation is that taxes shall fall . on the shoulders of those best able to bear them. Any other system of taxation is cowardly. In supporting the policy which this Government is operating honorable members opposite are violating this principle, for in many respects the Government&#39;s tariff is a revenueproducing instrument. This, I assert, is a cowardly system of taxation, and is being operated by a cowardly government. </para>

            <para>.- The controversy as to the respective merits of protection and freetrade has been waged more or less incessantly since the inception of federation, but of late years the freetrade policy has had very few stalwarts in this chamber. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> I would describe as one of them. Although I come from the same State as you and live under very similar conditions I cannot agree entirely with the views that I know you and the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> honestly hold on this subject. I believe that it is necessary for Australia to manufacture, as far as possible, all its own requirements, and that this should be done, provided that the cost of the goods so manufactured is not unduly increased to our consumers. I consider, however, that some authority should be constituted to protect the consumers against the charging of unreasonable prices by manufacturers. Undoubtedly, those whose industry is protected, owe something to this country, and they should not be allowed to charge exorbitant prices for their goods. It cannot be gainsaid that for a considerable number of years the price of manufactured articles in Australia, has been higher than would have been the price of similar imported goods. If it were not so, protective duties would have been unnecessary to encourage . Australian secondary industries. Most people expect that until industries are firmly established, production costs will be somewhat high, but they also expect that when industries become firmly established they will be able to market their products at prices comparable with those of similar goods from other countries plus freight charges. Australia has not yet reached that happy state of affairs. Undoubtedly, primary producers who live in areas remote from manufacturing centres have to pay more for certain goods under a protectionist policy than would apply under a freetrade policy. </para>

          <para>It must also be agreed that more is involved in our protectionist policy than the mere manufacturing of goods. The adoption of such a policy, undoubtedly, provides diversity of employment; that in itself must result in the provision of work for a greater number of people than could be employed if our attention was devoted solely to primary production. So far as the export of wool, wheat and other commodities are concerned, the conditions that might have come from an entirely freetrade policy have vanished into thin air because of the attitude taken up by overseas countries with regard to imports of primary products. Australia, like many other primary producing countries, experiences difficulty in selling its produce because of what is loosely termed economic nationalism. Even if we were prepared to allow everything to come in from abroad we still would not get a market in Germany and Italy for our wheat and other primary products. However exorbitant the cost of production in those countries, they prefer to supply themselves with wheat rather than import at a much lower price from a country like Australia. Willy nilly, our friends opposite, whether they are freetraders or not, must view the policy of protection from different angles. Undoubtedly it provides, for the eastern States at any rate, a home market for primary products, and in New South Wales and Victoria, partly reconciles people who are fortunate enough to have land in close proximity to dense populations, to some of the disadvantages of high duties. Primary producers in the other States do not have those compensations. The unemployment of youths is a tremendous problem in Australia and in every country of the world to-day, and protection, because it provides employment in secondary production commends itself to us. That aspect is accentuated by the distressing circumstances of some of the primary industries. Many of the youths who secure employment on the land to-day find that farmers are able to pay only a miserable pittance. Secondary industry also produce skilled workmen, so that if we are attacked - although I consider that there is little danger of that - we shall be able not only to manufacture small arms as we have been doing for a number of years, but also to produce ordnance, upon which, our friends tell us, our very existence depends. It has been said <inline font-style="italic">ad infinitum</inline> by freetraders that because of our policy of protection we are compelled to pay higher prices than would be the case if duty free importations were permitted, but that is not always so. At the present time, with every country engaged in a huge expenditure on armaments, the price of steel is high. If galvanized iron were not manufactured in Australia to-day we would have to import all our requirements at from &#163;5 to &#163;6 a ton above the Australian price. The statement that Australian galvanized iron is not so good as the imported article has, I think, been exploded. It may have been true with respect to the very heavy gauge iron used 40 or 50 years ago which can still be seen on the roofs of farmhouses in different parts of Australia, but the &#34; Orb &#34; iron manufactured in England by Lysaght&#39;s Limited is no better than the &#34; Orb &#34; iron manufactured by that firm in New South Wales, though the price of the imported article, duty free, is &#163;6 a ton higher. The price of Australian corrugated iron, 26-gauge, is &#163;27 a ton, from which a maximum discount of 7 per cent, is allowed in some cases, making the net price &#163;25 2s. 3d. a ton. Imported iron of the same quality costs from &#163;31 to &#163;33 a ton. </para>

              <para>- No. I am sure that the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> believes, as I do, that if it is impossible to secure our requirements from Great Britain we should not import iron from a foreign country which may take up arms against us. Lysaght&#39;s Limited have endeavoured to speed up production in various ways until to-day they have an output of 100,000 tons per annum, which is just within measurable distance of Australian requirements. Because some retailers and farmers have experienced difficulty in securing their requirements of iron, the Customs Department permitted duty-free entry from Great Britain of 12,000 tons of iron; but because of the high price only 50 tons has been imported; many people have decided to let their work stand over with the hope that they will be able to get the local product at the lower price. There is no immediate possibility of the price being lowered. </para>

          <para>Having said so much for protection in Australia I propose now to deal with some very serious problems that are confronting us in respect of highly-protected industries in this country. Some years ago the Labour party advocated a policy known as the New Protection. It provided not only that manufacturers should receive fair treatment so that their industries would be placed on a payable basis, but also that the Australian workmen employed by them should be paid fair wages and given reasonable conditions. That policy has not been given effect, although it was reasonable to expect that a concern like the Broken Hill </para>
          <para class="block">Proprietary Company Limited, which has the monopoly of the steel industry of Australia, would, if only as a matter of policy, treat its employees fairly.I have been informed by a man who was closely connected with Lysaght&#39;s corrugated iron works that only about 50 per cent. of the men employed by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited are unionists. Nohonorable member will deny the right of men to band together in order to secure a fair returnfor their labour. The reason for the small proportion of unionists is that about 10 per cent. of the men employed by the company occupy key positions. Being skilled workers, they are placed on the staff, and, because of that, are not allowed to join any union. The result is that, in the event of a strike, the skilled men would not be affected, and as the company could obtain other men to replace the unskilled strikers it would be able to cany on. In the circumstances there is no incentive to the workers to become unionists. </para>
          <para>Grave danger exists when men improperly trained and insufficiently fed take the place of men on strike. Within the last year or two the Broken Hill Proprietary Company has taken a financial interest in the manufacture of corrugated iron by Lysaght. The man to whom 1 have referred as having been employed by Lysaght, told me that in the past, whenever a dispute seemed imminent in Lysaght&#39;s works, employers and employees met around a table, with the result that the trouble was always settled on a fair basis. To those honorable members who are more closely acquainted with the iron and steel industry than I am, I tender my apology for raising it, but I have done so because it was not mentioned earlier. Seventeen years ago, when the Commonwealth Government decided that the galvanized iron industry should be established in Australia, it provided for a bounty of &#163;4 10s. on every ton of corrugated iron produced. Later, the bounty was discontinued in favour of a duty. The existing duty on galvanized iron is &#163;4 10s. a ton, British preferential tariff, and &#163;6 10s. a ton foreign.  At  the inception of the works 200 men were brought from Lysaght&#39;s factory in Great Britain, but a large num ber of them found the work intolerable in Australia&#39;s greater heat, notwithstanding that they were paid 89 per cent. more than they would have received had they remained in the Old Country. They therefore sought easier jobs. The duty of the man whom I have mentioned was to dip the black sheet iron into a sulphuric acid bath. The dipping was necessary to prepare the sheets for the process by which they were galvanized ; a highly trying, exhausting and unhealthy job. He was expected to handle 27 tons a day. When the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited obtained a financial interest in the works, a case was cited before the court. A round-table conference was refused and the men were advised that, in future, all matters in dispute would be thrashed out in the Arbitration Court. The result is well known to honorable members. A log of claims  was  submitted, but the result was a big reduction of wages. The new award provided a rate of 14s.8d. a ton for the first fourteen tons of iron produced, and 6s. a ton for the next fourteen tons. Men, instead of being paid89 per cent. more than the English rate, worked, in many instances, for only &#163;3 18s. a week. It has been said that the mechanization of the industry resulted in men who previously earned &#163;12 a week having to accept &#163;6 a week. It is greatly to be regretted that methods employed by Henry Ford and other manufacturers in the United States of America have found their way into Australia. Especially is that to be deplored when it is remembered that the representatives of the workers in this House assisted to establish this industry. One cannot help asking when a halt is to be called. Although I am prepared to stick to my party in a general way in assisting Australian manufacturers. 1 hope that the time will soon arrive when prices will be such that no company, especially one established with the assistanceof this Parliament, will be able to show a profit of &#163;1,250,000 in a year and at the same time make drastic reductions of the wages paid to its employees. </para>
          <para>Mr.RIORDAN (Kennedy) &#91;11.0&#93;. - I rise to support the remarks of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> on the measure before the House. I desire to refer at the outset to remarks made by certain Government members concerning the tobacco industry. Government supporters on the hustings have tried to make the people believe that they are the protectors of both secondary and primary industries. Tonight, however, we heard the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lane)</inline> make a spirited attack on one of our important primary industries in Queensland, the tobacco industry. This industry was established in Queensland during the regime of the Scull in Government. Up to that time &#163;3,000,000 was paid away every year to foreign countries for tobacco of all kinds. In December, 1930, the Scullin Government increased the rate of duty on foreign black-grown tobacco from 3s. to 5s. 2d. per lb. When the Lyons Government came into office it reduced the duty in February, 1932, from  5s.  2d. to 3s. per lb. In December, 1933, it increased the duty to 3s. 6d. per lb., but at the same time increased the excise duty on Australian leaf from 2s 4d. per lb. to 4s. 6d. per lb. The result was that the industry, which had been established during the depression to provide employment and a profitable undertaking for the small investor, received a blow from which it has never recovered. During the period of adequate protection, vast tracts of land in the hinterland of Cairns were thrown open for settlement. It has been claimed that the Scullin protective duties led to the creation of fictitious land values, but that is not so. I have here a telegram received on the 7th March, 1932, by the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Martens)</inline> from the Queensland Land Administration Board. It is as follows :  - </para>

          <para>.-I desire to bring under the notice of honorable members certain matters in connexion with the alkali industry in Australia. The industry is of tremendous importance to the Commonwealth. The defence requirements of the country make it indispensable to us, apart from its ordinary commercial uses. Without alkali the manufacture of explosives would bo impossible, and the same applies to important industrial products such as soap, glass and paper. Until quite recently, imperial Chemical Industries supplied most of Australia&#39;s requirements by importations from overseas. All efforts to establish the industry in Australia were unsuccessful until a South Australian engineer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> K. McPhail, a returned soldier, reported that he had a suitable combination for alkali manufacture. I propose not to go into all the details in connexion with this matter, but to give a few facts showing how Imperial Chemicals Industries have gained control of the industry in South Australia, and how the man who was first responsible for discovering a combination for alkali manufacture in. Australia has &#39;been pushed aside. The Government has been approached on several occasions by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhail,</inline> who strongly contends that he has been unjustly treated, but so far the Government has done nothing in the matter. On the 28th August, 1937, a letter was sent to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> from which the following is extracted :  - </para>

The facts of the case, as I understand it, are that in 1922 Brunner Mond Limited, now merged in Imperial Chemical Industries Limited, reported adversely on the whole of Australia being likely to be suitable for the production of alkali. They reported their inability to find any combination for the production of alkali, and abandoned their efforts. In 1930, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhail</inline> asserted that certain portions of South Australia were suitable for the production of alkali. He approached the Scullin Government, which encouraged him to investigate further the possibilities. On the 5th January, 1931, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough,</inline> Commonwealth Geological Adviser, advised the Government as follows: - </para>
          <para>The results of investigations have proved conclusively that in no part of Australia is there to be found that combination of conditions essential for the successful and economically sound manufacture of soda and soda ash. </para>
          <para class="block">This statement by Dr.Woolnough refers to the investigation by Brunner Mond Limited, which failed. When this information was conveyed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhail,</inline> he insisted most definitely that he had completed a scheme regardless of the failure of Imperial Chemical Industries Limited. Giving evidence on oath on the 15th May, 1931, before the Tariff Board, the managing-director of Brunner Mond Limited admitted that his company had spent &#163;40,000, and its conclusion was that alkali manufacture was impracticable in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhail</inline> was advised to confer with Imperial Chemical Industries Limited with a view to comparing schemes, so that the cost of production might not be increased as against other industries. This he did, and his proposals were subjected to close scrutiny. After the defeat of the Scullin Government, Imperial Chemical Industries Limitedwas invited to assist the Commonwealth advisers in the preparation of a report on the possibilities of the industry. I am informed that the Commonwealth advisers, after consultation with Imperial Chemical Industries Limited, presented a report advising against the establishment of such an industry, and the then Minister in charge of Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> publicly condemned the possibilities of establishing any such industry. Despite the adverse reports of both the government experts and Brunner Mond Limited, we find that, by 1935, Imperial Chemical Industries had control of the whole scheme. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan approved what Brunner Mond Limited was doing, although he denounced the same in 1933 when it was in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhail.</inline> The question might well be asked, why the Commonwealth Government should hand this monopoly of vital raw materials to an international combine of this kind and what were the circumstances which resulted in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhail&#39;s</inline> claim that what he did was a fundamental point in enabling Imperial Chemical Industries Limited to set going a combination for the production of alkali in Australia. Imperial Chemical Industries Limited is one of the greatest international combines in the world, and last year it made a profit of more than &#163;9,000,000. Several of the Ministers, including the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby),</inline> have visited these works in South Australia, and I am confident that the Government must have in its possession the fullest information relating to this matter. I do not know the law on the matter, but here is a citizen of Australia, a returned soldier, an engineer and a business man of Adelaide, who claims that he has been deprived of his reward for service which he rendered to Australia in getting this industry established. He asserts that his moral claim, at least, should be investigated.  His  suggestion is reasonable, namely, that he should be given a nominee, the Government should be given one and these two nominees should agree on an independent  chairman.  If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhail</inline> had not been brought into contact with Imperial Chemical Industries Limited, that firm would not have been able to establish an industry which Brunner Mond Limited could not establish and the Comomnwealth geological advisers stated was impossible of establishment. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to bring under the notice of the Government a matter of great importance to Australia, and I want it to make representations to the Imperial authorities with regard to the treatment of ex-Imperial soldiers now resident in Australia. In the last two years there have been brought under my notice three or four cases of exImperial soldiers who were receiving pensions, and who had commuted their pensions in Great Britain for a lump sum and had come to Australia. All these men were incapacitated, otherwise they would not have received pensions. Since coming to Australia some of them have been able to receive medical treatment at military hospitals but others have been denied similar treatment. There is one case of a man who was removed from the Prince of Wales Hospital; he was permanently incapacitated, but the Imperial authorities stated that his injuries were not due to war service. One day in our party room, in the presence of a number of honorable members and the  Deputy  Commissioner of Repatriation, the man stripped and we saw that he had been literally shot to pieces. Another case is that of a man who received a life pension in Great Britain for war service. He enlisted in 1914, was attached to the 12th Battalion of the Munster Regiment and had one year and 137 days&#39; service. He was wounded and gassed and received from the Imperial authorities a life pension of 60 per cent. This man was receiving medical treatment at a military hospital at Liverpool, England. He was advised by the doctors there to go to Australia on account of the condition of his health. He took their advice, and brought his wife and three children to this country. For nine years he received medical attention at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick. During the same period he received a 60 per cent. pension, and, eventually, he died.  His  widow applied for an Imperial widow&#39;s pension, because she and her children were destitute. She was granted by the State a widow&#39;s pension, in addition to child endowment for her children until they had attained the age at which they were no longer entitled to it. To-day, she and her children, two of whom are out of employment, are destitute. She has endeavoured to obtain an Imperial widow&#39;s pension. The matter has come before the responsible authorities, but her claim has been rejected, although the medical officer - I believe it was <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. King,</inline> of Randwick - definitely stated that her husband had died from the effects of the war. It is a serious matter for the family of a man who served in the Imperial Army, was incapacitated, came to Australia, and was not in a position to make any provision for his dependants, to be thrown on the resources of the State or the Commonwealth. I consider that representations should be made to the Imperial authorities on behalf of the widow of this deceased soldier. </para>

It is the duty of the Government to see that such persons are not dumped in this country when incapacitated to become a charge on the Commonwealth or the State. I hope that representations will be made by the Government to the Imperial authorities, with a view to seeing that these people receive at least sufficient sustenance to keep body and soul together. </para>

          <para>.- I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister representing the PostmasterGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Perkins)</inline> a matter which is causing a great deal of concern to the members of the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union of Australia. I regret that it is necessary to ventilate it on the floor of this House because, understanding the case of the men, I believe that  if  the  department had given it the  sym.pathy  and consideration it merits, it would have been adjusted long ago. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>For a number of years - in the vicinity of 25 years, I understand - it has been the practice in the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department to allow jointers, when working in manholes, to be accompanied by a mate or an assistant. This not only makes it possible for the work to be carried out more expeditiously and efficiently, but also gives protection to the men who are working on the jointing. There have been many cases of recent date in which men have collapsed when  working alone in manholes, and, but for the fact that passers-by noticed their predicament, the result would probably have been worse than it actually was. In several instances the men have had to seek hospital attention. The question of  providing  jointers with an assistant has been taken by the department before various tribunals for consideration on a number of occasions. On one occasion, the department wanted youths to work with the jointers, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, who beard its plea, decided that it was in the best interests of both the men and the department that the men should have adults as assistants when engaged on this particular work. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers, at a subsequent hearing, confirmed the decision already given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. It appears that in the. particular district affected - I understand that it is the Kogarah-Bexley district which comes under notice in this case - an engineer named Jones some little time ago attempted, unsuccessfully, to introduce this particular method, and that he is now endeavouring to avail himself of the earliest opportunity to ventilate his spleen upon these men. At the moment it seems to be his idea that the accepted practice should be departed from. He has said that where the manholes in which the men are employed are in close proximity to one another it is necessary to have only one assistant working between two jointers. In one case, two manholes which were considered by engineer Jones to he in close proximity to each other, were found to be a mile apart when measurements were taken. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> maintains that that constitutes two manholes in close proximity to each other. Any person who has the least knowledge of the risk which these jointers have to take in carrying on their work must recognize the necessity for having some one close at hand in case of emergency, such as a leakage of gas into the manhole or through the ducts from other manholes. On many occasions this has brought about the collapse of men who have been engaged on this work. It is absolutely necessary to have an assistant close * by in case of ail emergency, as well as to help in carrying out the work In view pf the enormous profits that are being made in the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, there can be no grounds for the usual argument in support of such an economy as it now proposes to introduce. The union has taken the matter up with the  Deputy  Director of Posts and Telegraphs in Sydney, but has not succeeded in obtaining any alteration of the practice in this district. As a matter of fact, it has been treated discourteously in connexion with this particular complaint in that it has not even received a reply to communications which it has addressed to the department. Therefore. I believe that the Government should indicate very plainly to the department that this practice should not be persisted with, and that the men should be given the absolute maximum of protection. Reading some of the instructions issued to the engineers by the department, it might appear to those who are unaccustomed to working in industry that every protection is being given to these men in their employment. In my opinion, those instructions are issued by the department only with a view to protecting itself in the event of any fatalities occurring in the ranks of these men in the course of their employment, because, should there be a claim for compensation or a civil action for damages against the department, it could quote the instructions issued to its engineers to indicate that it had taken the maximum precaution to protect the men against injury or death. I worked in government employment before I entered this Parliament, and know that these instructions are issued time after time, and are entirely ignored by the engineers and other officers of the different departments. They know that the instructions are issued for the purpose which I have indicated, and that it is never expected that they should be acted upon. I hope the Government will avail itself of the earliest opportunity to have this matter adjusted, because I believe that the request of the union is a reasonable one, as all it asks is that the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department should take steps to secure the maintenance of conditions which it has already obtained in this particular service. </para>
        <para>I wish to refer briefly to the eviction from a house in Canberra a few days ago of a young married man and his wife. I have made inquiries into this subject and am informed that the man was evicted because he happened to be in occupancy of certain premises without having gone through the ordinary departmental channels to obtain the tenancy. Instead of putting bis name on a list and awaiting his turn to get a house, he rented rooms from a person who held a tenancy and when that person left the house he continued&#39; in occupancy of it. The Department of the Interior collected rent from him for about two months but eventually decided that it needed the house for some man whose name was higher up on the list. It is not to criticize the practice of giving premises to persons whose names appear in order on a waiting list that I direct attention to this matter, but it is to  express  a strong protest against the failure of the Government to provide housing for people who have to work in the Federal Capital Territory, and to protest also against the giving of preferential treatment in this matter to public servants. We recognize that public servants who have to come here to work should be provided with houses, but so also should other people who have to work in the Federal Capital Territory. l t is the duty of the Government to provide houses for all and to give preferential treatment to none. In a statement which the Minister for the Interior furnished me on this subject, he stated that up to the present 1157 houses have been erected in Canberra. He also added that - </para>
        <para>Tn connexion with tlie transfer to Canberra of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department and the Defence Department, the Government must build houses for the accommodation of the transferred officers. In this connexion the </para>
        <para>Government is pursuing a building plan which will, over a period of five years, provide the necessary accommodation for the officers  of  those departments to be transferred. </para>
        <para class="block">The whole situation is unsatisfactory, for I have been informed that the order iu which houses are made available is as follows : first preference is given to permanent officers of the Commonwealth Public Service, second preference is given to other Government employees, and third preference is given to other persons in the Federal Capital Territory. The unfairness of this procedure is shown by the fact that the young man who was evicted Was born in the Federal Capital Territory and has worked here all his life. He is a married man and his wife is an expectant mother. I am informed by the department that the only concession made to this man -was that the Government undertook to store his furniture. In an apology in the local press for the Government&#39;s action in this connexion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Percival,</inline> an officer of the Department of the Interior, said - </para>
        <para>This man had been allowed live or six weeks in which to find other accommodation. </para>
        <para class="block">In view of what the Minister had to say about the inadequacy of the Government&#39;s housing policy, I should like to know what possible hope there was of this man obtaining a house here, when it is admitted that the Government has failed to erect sufficient homes to meet the requirements of its own employees? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Percival</inline> said that the department appreciated the urgent need for more houses. He is also reported to have said - </para>
        <para>Approximately 55 permanent officers wert transferred to Canberra annually. During the past year 52 houses had been* built by the Government. However 50 more permanent officers would arrive in Canberra within tinnext few days. Many houses were also required for skilled tradesmen who had been brought to the city for special jobs. </para>
        <para class="block">If 50 more Commonwealth officers arrived in Canberra in the next few days it is difficult to imagine what the situation will be. There is certainly every reason to agree with the Government that the housing shortage is acute, but it is the Government&#39;s duty to correct this position, and further, it is within its power to do so. I want the Government to indicate to  the people already residing in the Territory when they can expect, an improvement in respect of housing conditions. The Government should at once embark upon a comprehensive housing scheme, and I hope that it will take immediate steps in this direction. </para>

The general opinion in Adelaide is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhail</inline> has been treated harshly and unjustly.

I can assure the honorable member, and all other honorable members, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhail</inline> is a reputable and well-respected business man of Adelaide. He is a very competent engineer, whose activities warrant the granting to him of every assistance in his endeavours to protect our alkali industry from a great international monopoly.

          <para>. I know it is not popular to speak at any length at a late hour of the night on a motion for the adjournment of the House, but private members have very few opportunities to ventilate matters affecting their districts and their constituents. Foi this reason,  I  feel justified in bringing under notice a matter which concerns the members of the Operative Stonemasons&#39; Society of Australia in the hope that the request I now wish to make on their behalf will be granted. In June last, the members of this organization applied to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for an award for a 40-hour working week. The application was based on the unhealthy nature of the <inline font-style="italic">industry</inline> anc strong evidence was tendered on this point. It was shown by reports of the Silicosis Committee that out of approximately 400 masons examined in New South Wales, over 50 were affected by the trade disease to a compensatable degree, with a further 35 potential cases. It was also&#39; shown by the results of a medical examination that the number of masons in Victoria and South Australia affected by the disease was in similar ratio to those of New South Wales. The court, however, held that it would be necessary to have a much greater number of men medically examined, and stated that it would ascertain if the Commonwealth health authorities would undertake the examination. When the matter again came before the court recently, the court stated that the stonemasons themselves should apply for the setting up of a medical commission to inquire into the complaints. The Operative Stonemasons Society of Australia wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston,</inline> Director-General of Health, and also to the Minister  for  Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page),</inline> asking that early action be taken in regard to this matter. I may add that the industry has had a 40-hour week in New South Wales since 1920. The materials used in New South Wales are precisely the same as those used in the other two States and the methods are similar. The organization is satisfied, therefore, that a competent examination would show results that would satisfy the court of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> justice of the claim. I ask the Minister to ascertain if there is in the department a file  on this subject, and -whether any representations, either to the Government or to the Minister for Health, have been made by the court. The Government should consult with the Commonwealth DirectorGeneral of Health to ascertain how far it is possible to meet the wishes of the court for a wider medical examination. </para>

        <para>On many occasions during the last few years I have expressed my regret that the portfolio of the Postmaster-General is not held by a Minister in this chamber. We have, of course, in this chamber a Minister who represents the Postmaster-General, but the lack of direct access to the PostmasterGeneral hinders honorable members a good deal, as important matters cannot be dealt with at first-hand. In respect of the conditions of cable- jointers in the employment of the Postal Department raised by the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> I might add that 1 brought this matter under the notice of the Government in 1936 when the dangerous nature of their work due to the escape of gases in the manholes arose in the first instance. At that time three men were affected by gas fumes in the Bexley district and had to be taken to a hospital. One was detained over the weekend. One of them would have passed away, due to suffocation, if a passerby had not noticed his condition in time to have resuscitation methods applied. The whole trouble in this instance has been caused by an engineer named Jones, who has endeavoured to &#34;buck &#34; what might be called established practice in regard to the employment of a jointer and a mate to work together in this class of employment. In every other section in the metropolitan area of Sydney no trouble exists because departmental instructions have been generally adhered to. When the engineer Jones caused the trouble in 1936, the organization drew the attention of the department to the matter with the result that the following instruction was issued: - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Where cable-jointing is being executed in manholes or tunnels, a jointer should not be employed single-handed if an adequate supply of fresh air is not available to him or work is being performed under conditions which impose or are likely to impose any risk on the employee concerned. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Subsequent to that, things went along quite satisfactorily, Jones had to accept the position. But again he has endeavoured to circumvent the instruction. I might add that, many years ago, the department submitted an application to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, seeking to replace adult mates to cable jointers by the appointment of youths. First <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins and later <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers flatly refused the application and said that the services of youths would be valueless. The organization takes the view, and rightly, that, as the department had already attempted through the court to break down a principle in connexion with the employment of these men and has failed to do so, it has no right to endeavour to overcome its failure by direct methods which are now causing disaffection among the employees involved. This matter, in my opinion, requires only firm handling by the Minister to clear up the trouble. I ask him to take the necessary steps to deal with it. </para>

          <para>. - The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> referred to the recent eviction of a tenant of a home owned by the Government in the Federal Capital Territory, and the acute shortage of houses which undoubtedly exists in Canberra at present, and offered some observations on that subject. The Government, of course, concedes, as I said in reply to a question this afternoon, that there is an acute shortage of housing accommodation. But this is not a condition peculiar to Canberra ; it is one that exists in almost all of the capital cities and provincial cities in Australia to-day. The peculiar circumstances of the development of Canberra, the recent resumption since the passing of the depression of public works in the Federal Capital Territory, with the consequent influx of a number of tradesmen and others, and the extension of government departments, particularly the Department of the Interior, have resulted in an acute shortage of houses in Canberra at the present time. It is from that fact alone that the necessity for the recent eviction arose. I take this opportunity to say that the fact that this person was evicted is no reflection on him personally. It was an unfortunate necessity which arose solely because of the determination of the Department of tho Interior to act fairly in regard to .the housing accommodation at its disposal. Applications for housing accommodation are recorded in the order in which they are received, and accommodation is made available on that basis. The only qualification to that statement is that the department observes a certain order of priority as to the classes of persons who are eligible to be granted houses. First preference is given to permanent public servants of the Commonwealth; temporary public servants receive second preference; and thereafter other persons in the Federal Capital Territory are provided with accommodation as it becomes available. In their desire to secure housing accommodation in Canberra, some people have attempted to evade the departmental system of making houses available according to strict order of priority. A man may rent rooms in a home of a tenant of the department, and in the event of such tenant vacating the property he has entered into full occupation of the whole dwelling, thereby defeating the purpose of the Government. The circumstances leading up to the eviction to which reference has been made are that the person who was evicted from the home occupied and rented rooms in it. The tenant left the house, and the sub-tenant entered into full occupancy.  His  rent payments were accepted by the department for several weeks, but subsequently he was given notice to vacate the premises so that it could be allotted to another person whose name came next on the register of persons awaiting bornes. He declined to vacate the premises, with the result that the department was forced to approach the court for an eviction order. He was given at least five weeks&#39; definite notice to vacate the premises, and even longer notice that he would ultimately have to get out. As he declined to leave the house, the processes of the law had to take their course. When he complained that he had nowhere to take his furniture, the department offered to store it for him, without cost, until such time as he found a home or rooms into which it could be placed. I wish to repeat that no slur is attachable to the person who was evicted. </para>

        <para>On the general question of housing in Canberra, I may say that the Government is well aware of the necessity for providing sufficient homes to accommodate legitimate applicants for them.

          <para>.- The Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> McEwen) has offered an excuse rather than give solid reasons for the eviction of the persons referred to by honorable members. Some time ago, in the city of Melbourne, Victoria., when an acute shortage of houses existed, steps were taken by the Government to ensure that, in circumstances in which an owner asserted his right to take possession of his own property, thereby driving out its tenant, a home was provided for the evicted tenant, so that the discredit of forcibly removing a tenant and his family, including, as in this case perhaps a wife in a delicate state of health should not attach to the community generally. That sort of thing should not be permitted in this capital city, which is far removed from other cities and places where evicted tenants might possibly obtain other accommodation. The Minister attempted to justify the action of the Government by saying that the person evicted had been a tenant of a part of the building only, and that when the real tenant left it, he took possession of the whole house. I endeavoured to point out by interjection that the person who was subsequently evicted was legally in possession of that part of the dwelling of which he was apparently the accredited tenant, and in respect of which he had paid the rent. Not only that, but for a time his rent was accepted by the department. Clearly he was regarded as a desirable tenant, until pressure was brought by the Government to forcibly remove him in order to make way for another. Apparently, the other person was not in the street and homeless, but had accommodation elsewhere. Had the Minister risen to a proper appreciation of the decencies of the situation, he would undoubtedlyhave accepted the responsibility of seeing that other accommodation was provided for the woman and her family before such drastic action was taken. Such action brings discredit on this capital city in which the Government is supposed to have unlimited areas at its disposal. The Government as landlord has no excuse for such an. action of oppression against a woman in that state of health. 1 join with those who protest against the Government&#39;s action. The excuse offered by the Minister  is  quite unworthy of him and of an Australian government. </para>

A large amount of preparatory work was necessary in order that the Government might be in a position to place before Parliament, on the resumption of its sittings, a programme of work. In particular, the Government&#39;s proposals connected with defence, and the national health and pensions insurance scheme required a great deal of attention. In addition to the pressure of business associated with the parliamentary programme, the Government was closely occupied, up to the time of the departure of the ministerial delegation from Melbourne on the 22nd March, with the consideration of various matters affecting Australian trade likely to be discussed at conferences overseas. </para>
